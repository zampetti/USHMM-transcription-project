something about your religious upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">AK: There was no special religious upbringing, because in that time of the Soviet Union there was as you know from history, after the October Revolution there was a strong propaganda of atheism.</span> <span id="s34">And that’s why we Jews and non-Jews, you know, the Christians, you know, were brought up in a non-religious spirit, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">AK: Especially the younger generation which was born already in the Soviet Union in 1934 like I was born.</span> <span id="s37">You know, I was not brought up in a religious spirit at all.</span> <span id="s38">When I was going to the Kindergarten there the little children were never taught any religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">EM: Was your father, your mother Jewish by...</span></p> <p><span id="s40">AK: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">EM: They both were?</span></p> <p><span

before the war in 1939, about life in Kiev in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">AK: Thanks to my excellent memory which it is a very part of my childhood, I can tell you a little bit, even more than a little bit I would say.</span> <span id="s51">Because my memory is very excellent, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">EM: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">AK: My childhood was like the childhood of all children who were born, you know, in the time of the Soviet Socialist system, you know.</span> <span id="s54">I went, as I told you, I did report to the kindergarten, you know.</span> <span id="s55">I played with the children, you know, about the whole politics, you know, about this what was going on with the domestic policy of the Soviet government or foreign policy I didn’t have any slightest idea because I just began to live in this world.</span> <span id="s56">And so I can not give you any details.</span> <span id="s57">But anything else you may ask me about my childhood I can even in single details all the satisfactory answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EM: Well, could you tell me a little bit about the economic conditions?</span> <span id="s59">I mean, were you well-to-do or how large was your apartment and so on, since your father was a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s60">Did you have any special privileges?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">AK: O.K., our apartment was a communal apartment, a collective apartment.</span> <span id="s62">You know, in other words it was a big apartment where all together five families lived in all, married families with a husband, wife and their children, you know.</span> <span id="s63">Each family was entitled to have only one room as under the Soviet system.</span> <span id="s64">This was the majority of average Soviet citizens who lived, you know, but my father, thanks to his Ph.D. degree, in order that he should be able to keep his scientific books, he was given a privilege, he was allowed to have two rooms instead of one, yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s66">So you all lived together in one apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">AK: One apartment, a collective apartment, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">EM: A collective apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">AK: They had to share their collective kitchen, the collective bathroom, the collective toilet.</span> <span id="s70">So with all five families all together, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EM: And you say there was no religious upbringing for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">AK: No religious upbringing in the 1930’s, not at all.</span> <span id="s73">Yeah, for the little, newborn, younger generation, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EM: How did you know that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s75">Or when did you learn that you were Jewish, or Jewish background?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">AK: Always.</span> <span id="s77">This to me, your question seems to be a little bit funny.</span> <span id="s78">Because all people of Polish [unclear] they are born, they are being taught by their parents who they are.</span> <span id="s79">You know, what their first and last name is, you know, what kind of nationality they are.</span> <span id="s80">And so I was taught the same way, you know, since I started to walk from the carriage, you know, and to walk on my feet, you know, I was taught who I am.</span> <span id="s81">Yah?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">EM: You were taught you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">AK: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">EM: But you didn’t have any religious education.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AK: Not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s86">Not in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s87">As I said, in the Soviet Union in the 1930’s you know, all Jews and non-Jews were all brought up young Soviet citizens under the Soviet system in non-religious spirit all the time.</span> <span id="s88">Yeah, yeah, in those years.</span> <span id="s89">It was a decree of how a person then Joseph Stalin was ruling the country, you know, and especially it was also very popular the propaganda of atheism, of scientific atheism so-called, you know, in those years, you know, where people they wanted the people to believe there is no God, no miracles, no anything which is beyond the human mind, the understanding, the comprehension of the human mind.</span> <span id="s90">Especially this propaganda was taught to the collective farm workers, to the peasants.</span> <span id="s91">You know, they wanted to bring especially the peasants in a non-religious spirit, in a spirit of scientific atheism.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">AK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">EM: Could you tell me what you remember of 1940, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">AK: I just remember 1940 when I was six years old, I was still continuing to go to the Kindergarten, you know, in Kiev, you know?</span> <span id="s96">And my childhood passed like I told you like all children’s childhood, happy, you know, without any worries, without any special problems, you know?</span> <span id="s97">And then when the year 1941 came, the June 22nd, this historical date, when Nazi German invasion took place on the Soviet Union, you know?</span> <span id="s98">This date I remember very well which is left in my memory forever.</span> <span id="s99">This was early in the morning, 7:00 when I woke up, you know, and I saw, you know, that my mother was sad, you know?</span> <span id="s100">Trying a little to be crying, you know, and something I understood even though I was not even seven years old.</span> <span id="s101">My seventh birthday was on August the 30th, 1941.</span> <span id="s102">So on June 22nd I was still six years old.</span> <span id="s103">And I understood something has happened that tragic.</span> <span id="s104">Even with my childish mind I understood.</span> <span id="s105">And my father came to me, he said, “Listen, now the war begins, began, you know, seems to be.”</span> <span id="s106">You know, even it was not officially announced.</span> <span id="s107">But then at 12:00 noon, you know, the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Viasheslav Molotov, who was there at that time the Foreign Minister, he has announced, “In all Soviet broadcasting stations that now that the war began Germany has broken a peace pact with us and has invaded us in a very betraying manner,” you know?</span> <span id="s108">And since at that time he also has announced a mobilization, the recruitment of young fellows who are in the recruiting age who have to go to the military service and to fight the war, to fight the Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">This was 12:00 noon on June 22, 1941 they announced.</span> <span id="s110">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s111">EM: How old was your father at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">AK: He was 35 years old at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EM: Was there any danger that he might have to go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">AK: It was a danger, yes.</span> <span id="s115">They wanted to recruit him but fortunately he made, you know, went, had an acquaintance, a medical doctor, you know, who gave him a false certificate that he should be released because his heart condition is not so good, you know.</span> <span id="s116">Because he, actually he didn’t wanted to go to fight, you know.</span> <span id="s117">But you had to have a good reason for that, you know?</span> <span id="s118">So, he had an acquainted woman doctor in one of the Kiev hospitals.</span> <span id="s119">He, she gave him a certificate that his heart condition is not in such good way that he can go to fight, to become a soldier.</span> <span id="s120">And so he was immediately discharged.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EM: He was rejected.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">AK: Yeah, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">EM: Now, when did the Germans march into Kiev?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">AK: The Germans marched into Kiev, this was exactly either September 18 or September 19, 1941, either one of these two days.</span> <span id="s125">I don’t remember exactly, but either one of these two days: September 18 or 19, 1941, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">EM: Could you tell me what happened at that point?</span> <span id="s127">Was the civilian population evacuated or did you just wait in Kiev till the Germans marched in?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">AK: The civilian population was a lot of them were evacuated, you know, from June 22nd until September 18, until the German Army marched into the city, you know.</span> <span id="s129">Especially many Jewish people like us were evacuated, you know, who didn’t wanted to remain under Nazi German occupation because they deeply believed, you know, that like the Soviet press on the radio said, that in case some Jews will stay in the city in case of temporary occupation of the city, all Jews will be annihilated physically.</span> <span id="s130">So all Jews had to leave the city.</span> <span id="s131">My father and my mother didn’t want to believe that.</span> <span id="s132">They believed it was just an official anti-fascist propaganda, you know?</span> <span id="s133">And that’s why they decided to stay, you know, like many of our other compatriots decided to stay, which as you know, later on in September 29th, you know, went to Babi Yar and were killed there.</span> <span id="s134">33,000 about was over there, because that number is not exact, 30,000, because so far as they know from the Soviet press before, under Khrushchev, you know, rule, and also under Brezhnev rule, when I received free literature from my native city of Kiev, in the Ukrainian language even, I received, you know, about the Holocaust, Jewish Holocaust.</span> <span id="s135">It said...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">EM: When did you receive that information?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">AK: From Kiev, as I say, you know here in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s138">I, we were living since 1950, you know.</span> <span id="s139">And I got induction with the Committee for Cultural Relations, with the compatriots abroad in Kiev, and in Moscow also.</span> <span id="s140">And they have sent me literature for free there.</span> <span id="s141">Newspapers, a regular weekly newspaper and also other little brochures, pamphlets, you know where it was mentioned also about the Jewish Holocaust, you know.</span> <span id="s142">So it was mentioned over there, you know, that in Kiev Babi Yar were liquidated 70,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s143">But this was under Brezhnev and Khrushchev, you know, that it was mentioned 70,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s144">Now, when Gorbachev came to government, I believe this number, they started to publish about the Holocaust at Babi Yar more exact.</span> <span id="s145">They said it was all together 100,000 liquidated, not even 70,000 but 100,000.</span> <span id="s146">But from the Jews were liquidated only those who decided to stay in the city and not to evacuate themself with the Soviet authorities.</span> <span id="s147">Was, were only 33,000 so about.</span> <span id="s148">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">EM: So the Soviet authorities warned the Jews that the ones that will stay will be annihilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">AK: That’s right, correct, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">EM: Now, your parents stayed.</span> <span id="s152">Did anything change in your way of life under the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">AK: Yes, it...</span></p> <p><span id="s154">EM: Did you stay in the same apartment?</span> <span id="s155">Did your father work or did things change, and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">AK: The things changed tremendously, yeah.</span> <span id="s157">Fortunately, you know, when the German’s Army entered the city of Kiev, my father and my mother had good friends in a little town which was on the other side of Dnieper River, which is called Darnitsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">EM: Darnitsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">AK: Darni-...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">EM: Darnitsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">AK: Darnitsa, yes.</span> <span id="s162">They had good friends and who decided to hide us in their home, you know, that we, in order to prevent us to being liquidated from the Germans in Babi Yar, like all our compatriots in June, I mean in September 29th, went to Babi Yar, as you know, who were not hidden, you know.</span> <span id="s163">But we were hidden by some of our good friends in Darnitsa, you know?</span> <span id="s164">And we were hidden until almost we were ready to meet the Soviet Army back, you know, to Kiev on November the 6th, 1943.</span> <span id="s165">But unfortunately, you know what happened?</span> <span id="s166">The Germans found our hideout shelter, you know, and they immediately put us under arrest.</span> <span id="s167">And me, when I was nine years old, shipped us in the freight, cattle train to Germany, and straight to Brätz concentration camp, which was on the previous border of Poland and Germany, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">EM: Now just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">AK: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">EM: Now you were hidden from, by non-Jewish friends of your parents, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">AK: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">EM: In Darnitsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">AK: In Darnitsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">EM: Before September of 1941.</span> <span id="s175">When did they hide you?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">AK: Just in the few days when the German Army entered Kiev, after September 18th, 1941.</span> <span id="s177">Just before September 29 when the Holocaust in Babi Yar took place.</span> <span id="s178">Yeah, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">EM: Just before that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">AK: Yeah, in order to prevent us to be killed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">EM: Where were you hidden?</span> <span id="s182">In a home, in a hut, underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">AK: In a little, a two-floor house with a roof, you know, on the roof we were hidden.</span> <span id="s184">Me, my mother and my father were hidden on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">EM: On the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">AK: Yeah, by these good people which was very so artificially isolated from their human eyes, you know to prevent to find somebody over there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EM: And these people lived in the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">AK: Yeah, these people lived there in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">EM: In the same house, and they hid you in the attic, under the roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">AK: In the attic, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">EM: In the attic, under the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">AK: Yes, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">EM: How long were you hidden there?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">AK: About two years, as I told you, almost until November 6th, 1943, you know.</span> <span id="s195">But unfortunately, as I told you, something happened that you know, we were discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">EM: Yeah, yeah, well we’re going to get to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">AK: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">EM: Was your mother or your father or you able to leave that attic?</span> <span id="s199">Or were you the whole time in, hidden in the attic?</span> <span id="s200">Were you able to get out at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">AK: No, we were not able to get out at all.</span> <span id="s202">We had to sit day and night like in a prison over there.</span> <span id="s203">We were not able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">EM: And was there enough food that these people could supply you with?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">AK: These people, you know, didn’t have enough food because as you, to be honest with you, during the Nazi German occupation everybody had a scarcity of food, you know.</span> <span id="s206">But they would share whatever they could, you know, especially for me, when I was a little kid, that I should survive, you know, so much as they could share with me and with my parents, with this little quantity of food they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">EM: Did your parents have to pay them for hiding you?</span> <span id="s208">Or did they do it for, out of the goodness of their heart?</span> <span id="s209">Or do you know if your parents paid them?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">AK: My parents paid them a little bit, you know, our valuable belongings, which we had, a valuable engagement rings, you know, earrings of my mother, you know, with a, made of pure gold.</span> <span id="s211">And that’s all we paid them, you know.</span> <span id="s212">Not too much.</span> <span id="s213">Not too many, but those even little quantities we paid them, these were things of high value, you know, so they accepted that with great gratitude, you know and were very glad, you know, and continued us to hide over there in the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EM: What was the punishment for non-Jews for hiding you?</span> <span id="s215">Was there an announced death sentence for people who were hiding Jews?</span> <span id="s216">Do you know?</span> <span id="s217">What was the punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">AK: The punishment was exactly like you said, death sentence, for anybody, gentiles, Christians, who are hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s219">You know, it was immediately a death sentence, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">EM: Do you know if there were many non-Jewish Ukrainians who would point out Jews that were in hiding, collaborators with the Germans?</span> <span id="s221">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">AK: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s223">There were a lot of young fellows, you know, who went voluntarily to serve to the police force from the Ukrainians, you know, as soon as the Nazi German occupation of the city of Kiev, and of this little town of Darnitsa that took place a lot of young fellows volunteered to go to the police force, you know?</span> <span id="s224">And among them almost everybody of them was very enthusiastic about pointing on the Jews, who is a Jew, you know, and where he is hiding, you know, for the German S.S. henchmen that they should find them, discover them immediately and you know, and liquidate them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">EM: Liquidate them.</span> <span id="s226">Do you know of any gentiles that were punished for hiding Jews?</span> <span id="s227">Did you hear of any gentiles that were punished?</span> <span id="s228">I know what the punishment was, officially, but have you heard of anybody being really punished for it or being caught for hiding Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">AK: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">Our saviors were all punished by death sentence after they were discovered that they were hiding us, you know.</span> <span id="s231">We are not punished as Jews by the death sentence because they wanted us to use--in the first place for hard physical labor, whatever punishment, you know?</span> <span id="s232">But those all belongings probably my mother and my father gave to them valuable belongings went to the Ukrainian police, you know, into their pockets, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">EM: Now tell me when you were, something about the time when you were discovered.</span> <span id="s234">How come the Germans discovered you?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">AK: There must have been some informers living in this little town of Darnitsa, you know, who were neighbors of that family who has hidden us, you know.</span> <span id="s236">And they must finally have pointed you know because they believe that the Germans are leaving pretty soon, you know, because that was before November 6, 1943 when the Soviet Army was almost, almost about to liberate you know that four of the left territory of the Dnieper River was on the right territory, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">EM: Which river?</span> <span id="s238">Is it the Dnieper

nothing.</span> <span id="s335">Just they gave once in a 24 hours a little bit, a glass of water, a little bit of bread, you know, to survive.</span> <span id="s336">That is all, a captured people, you know, in the freight train.</span> <span id="s337">There was about maybe left for three or four days, if I remember, three or four days that they let, you know, without normal food, without normal eating, without normal drinking, you know?</span> <span id="s338">And finally we are all, arrived to Brätz, you know?</span> <span id="s339">And we met over there, you know, of course, when the gate

physical labor, you know?</span> <span id="s348">They were in the same train, you know.</span> <span id="s349">But we when we were delivered you know to Brätz concentration camp, there were only these Jewish families remained in the train who were in imprisonment, you know, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s350">So we came to the concentration camp and we were met by the Wachtband, you know, by these German big, strong guys, you know, in a uniform, you know?</span> <span id="s351">And first they greeted us, you know they, with beatings, with the clubs, sticks, you know, like always they did, you know, that we should once and forever remember that this is a concentration camp and nobody should dare or think about any resistance, about any rights or anything you know to kill the whole courage and the spirit in the people, you know.</span> <span id="s352">From the first meeting the beatings hard you know with the club sticks.</span> <span id="s353">Everybody like cattle,

id="s359">AK: Most of them as I said they were unloaded before, you know probably were appointed to work with the German farmers some places usually they did...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">EM: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s361">AK: Or in the German industry, military industry, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EM: I know, but, so they were taken off the train?</span></p> <p><span

barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">AK: In barracks, yes, in barracks, very cold barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s375">In the summer time was hot.</span> <span id="s376">In the wintertime was cold, you know, and the hard physical work exhausted many of the prisoners, you know, because again the nourishment was very bad, you know.</span> <span id="s377">And the constant beatings, beatings, beatings and beatings, was especially provided regime, be a sport, they called this.</span> <span id="s378">Every day gymnastics, you know, when, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">EM: Tell me, was your mother separated from you or, I mean, or were you, did you go with your mother?</span> <span id="s380">Did women and men stay together or how...</span></p> <p><span id="s381">AK: Well women and men were separated, were another section of the women’s concentration camp, where all women were.</span> <span id="s382">They were separated from their husbands and their husbands were separated from their wives.</span> <span id="s383">And the boys, the little boys, stayed with their fathers, and little girls with their mothers, like usually in this case, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">EM: And so you stayed with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">AK: Yeah, mmm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">EM: You stayed.</span> <span id="s387">And what kind of work did your father and you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">AK: Oh, a lot of work had to be done.</span> <span id="s389">To build some cement roads there, you know, which were appointed you know for the automobile machines, you know, and to carry heavy stones you know for the building material, you know?</span> <span id="s390">And for me they gave me a little bit because I was a little kid a little bit easier work, you know.</span> <span id="s391">But that was also a hard physical work for my age, for my little kid, you know, to carry stones, you know, or something like that.</span> <span id="s392">You know, it was not easy, you know.</span> <span id="s393">But the main important thing as I told you, you know, there was provided a special regime every day in the camp, you know, which they called it gymnastics, you know, sport, you know.</span> <span id="s394">Were all prisoners, you know, including such little kid like I was.</span> <span id="s395">You know, we had to run.</span> <span id="s396">They would say made us run and fall down.</span> <span id="s397">Run and fall down.</span> <span id="s398">And so for one hour, for two hours, for three hours.</span> <span id="s399">As soon as somebody didn’t fall down and after the command sounded over there, so-called cops of the concentration camp ordered him get up, you know, he was beaten like worse than a cattle, you know?</span> <span id="s400">You had to fulfill their the commands in one second immediately when the command sounded, you know.</span> <span id="s401">It was very exhausting physically of course.</span> <span id="s402">It was one, two or three hours to run, like that being very bad nourishment after a hard physical work.</span> <span id="s403">It was a very big tough experience a tough experiment which they made on the people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EM: I understand.</span> <span id="s405">Now the work that you had to do, was it in the camp itself or did they take you out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">AK: That was in the camp itself, you know.</span> <span id="s407">They were all isolated by the barbed wires and by their towers, watchtowers which were there where the Germans had a light, electric light lanterns which lighted the darkness after the sunset so nobody could escape.</span> <span id="s408">Immediately they had machine guns there where they could shoot and everybody wouldn’t dare to escape from the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">EM: Could you tell me, were there only Jews in this camp or were there non-Jews also?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">AK: They were all mix of people, all big international over there.</span> <span id="s411">There were Jews, Poles, there were Russians also and the Russians also were Russian workers with us, who were captured from the Russian Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s412">There were plenty, plenty over there, you know, so there was a big, in other words international place, this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s413">And Ukrainians were...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">EM: Were...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">AK: Present there too, plenty Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">EM: Were the Jews separated from the non-Jews or did you all live together in the same barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">AK: Well we lived all together in the same barracks.</span> <span id="s418">There was not separation any more.</span> <span id="s419">Just men and women were separated like I mentioned before, but the nationality didn’t matter for the Germans.</span> <span id="s420">They were all together were forced the same way to do slavery work.</span> <span id="s421">You know, as hard as possible, and to be nourished so bad as possible and to be exhausted so much as possible of the physical energy, this what the purpose of the administration of the concentration camp, to exhaust the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EM: Do you remember how large that camp was, approximately how many people there were in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">AK: Well, I have to look in my book again, which I bought after the war which I have it describes the quantity of the inmates.</span> <span id="s424">You know is now for me hard to tell.</span> <span id="s425">No, I believe maybe approximately I don’t want to lie to tell you a wrong number, but about maybe five thousand maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">EM: Maybe five thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">AK: Five thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">EM: Were you able to see your mother while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">AK: No, in that period of time- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s430">EM: ...interviewing Mr. Alex Krasheninnikow.</span> <span id="s431">This is tape one, side two, continuing.</span> <span id="s432">Did you know if your mother was in the same camp?</span> <span id="s433">You said you couldn’t see her, but did you know that she was still in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">AK: Yes we knew that she is there, you know, but we didn’t know whether she survived or whether she is dead already nobody would give us a message about it.</span> <span id="s435">Because we could see in the men’s section of the concentration camp we could see the men dying every day, every day, and not only dying, you know.</span> <span id="s436">Well they were shot.</span> <span id="s437">If somebody could not do a hard physical work, pick up a heavy stones, you know, because his energy was expired we know that the S.S., these henchmen cops of the concentration camp took him behind the bungalow and we could just hear loud shooting, puff, and this was the sign that the man was shot.</span> <span id="s438">Yeah.</span> <span id="s439">Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">EM: Do you know how the corpses were disposed of?</span> <span id="s441">Was there a crematorium or were the people buried?</span> <span id="s442">Do you have any recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">AK: There was a crematorium, yes where the people were burned but they were also buried both they did.</span> <span id="s444">One part they burned in the crematorium and the other part they just burned like dogs, you know, like animals outside of the concentration camp because we could see the corpses loaded on the wagons in the trucks.</span> <span id="s445">I mean were loaded on trucks and they were just taken outside of the camps and there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s446">EM: Were any people taken out of the camps into different camps?</span> <span id="s447">Like were there any transports from this camp into another camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">AK: This I cannot tell you only I know they had new types trucks of prisoners were coming almost everyday, more and more to the camp from different regions of the occupied territories, from all Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s449">There were all Czechs coming there, from Czechoslovakia and also Bulgarians from Bulgaria even there are not so many in quantity like Russians or Ukrainians you would say.</span> <span id="s450">Also not so many in number like Jews, you know, but there were plenty, plenty of different nationalities because the newcomers were delivered by, with the truck guarded by the S.S. henchmen every, almost every day, every day from the all Europe which was occupied by the Nazi German empire, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">EM: O.K.</span> <span id="s452">So you worked there from November, 1943 to when?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">AK: From November, 1943 until January, 1945, when finally Schwiebus was, this was the end of January, 1945, but finally Schwiebus was liberated by the Soviet Red Army, you know.</span> <span id="s454">Then we were free again.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">EM: How, could you describe the liberation?</span> <span id="s456">I mean did the Germans escape?</span> <span id="s457">Did they open the gates?</span> <span id="s458">How was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">AK: The liberation as far as I remember took the following way, you know.</span> <span id="s460">In the same day before already when the Red Army was coming almost near to the Brätz concentration camp and to Schwiebus what they did there were many weaklings taken out from the camp and behind the bungalows and were all shot, which never happened there before.</span> <span id="s461">Now, people were shot, as I told you before who were exhausted of energy, but not in the same quantity as in the last day, you know they did, you know.</span> <span id="s462">And finally after that, you know, they all became mild to everybody because they felt that their power, they won’t last too long, because the Soviet Red Army is coming closer, nearer and nearer to this camp, and they may be responsible.</span> <span id="s463">And they started to be kind all of a sudden to the people who remained alive to treat like equal to an equal, you know?</span> <span id="s464">And finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">EM: For how long?</span> <span id="s466">How long did this last?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">AK: For about a couple, maybe a couple hours, four to six hours, you know?</span> <span id="s468">And finally what they did, they all escaped from the camp.</span> <span id="s469">And then we finally understood that we are free.</span> <span id="s470">And after that well the prisoners themselves opened the gate of the concentration camp so, outside so the new army is coming.</span> <span id="s471">The Red Army is coming closer and then finally they ran inside to the camp and greeted each other, embraced each other and said, “You are free!”</span> <span id="s472">Now to each other with the food products especially little children like myself that they should survive with the bread and butter, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s473">They didn’t have too much either, you know, so much as in a time of peace, you know, when the whole food industry is functioning normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">AK: But the soldiers would share with us everything they had, the last piece of bread, rye bread, white bread, maybe the butter, maybe the pork meat, something like that, you know.</span> <span id="s476">And that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s477">EM: So your father and mother, did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">AK: They survived, yeah.</span> <span id="s479">And my mother--the women were allowed to come to the men’s section and men to the women’s section.</span> <span id="s480">And she came and we were very glad to see that she survived, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">EM: Do you have any idea of how many Jews there were in the, in for instance in your barracks?</span> <span id="s482">Did you know who was Jewish and who was non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">AK: Well, so far we knew each other, you know, because once in a while we were allowed to talk, you know.</span> <span id="s484">And we realized each other, you know, by the manners of talking, you know, who was Jew and non-Jew.</span> <span id="s485">But the quantity, again, I have to look in a book because this book is in my home library for a long time but I didn’t look for a while in that, you know.</span> <span id="s486">If you are interested to give you this answer I will tell you exact number how many Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s487">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s488">No, I just wondered if you had any idea of what the...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">AK: No, probably maybe two thousand, I would say, approximately, not exactly, but approximately.</span> <span id="s490">Two thousand Jews were there with us together, you know.</span> <span id="s491">But Polish Jews, mostly Polish Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">EM: Mostly Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">AK: Who were, they were there from Poland, you know, because that was close to the Polish border, you know, the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s494">And they spoke also Russian, like us because they were formerly from that territory which was under Czarist Russia before the First World War.</span> <span id="s495">You know, so there were two languages popular in that time, the Polish and Russian...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">EM: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">AK: You know, so that’s why even the little children like myself, you know, at the age of eight, nine years old, there were boys and girls who speak three languages already--Yiddish, Russian, and Polish.</span> <span id="s498">Yeah, we were free to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">EM: But you didn’t know any Yiddish, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">AK: I knew, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">EM: You didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">AK: I knew already, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">EM: What--but where did you learn that Yiddish?</span> <span id="s504">From your...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">AK: I forgot a little bit now, you know, but from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">EM: No, no, but where did you learn...</span></p> <p><span id="s507">AK: From my parents a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EM: When?</span> <span id="s509">As a child or...</span></p> <p><span id="s510">AK: As a child, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">EM: As a child...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">AK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">EM: Then you were learning it.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">AK: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">EM: So because you said that, you know, you didn’t have any Jewish upbringing.</span> <span id="s516">So I just wondered how come you knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">AK: Yeah, but with the language I had the Jewish upbringing, in the language.</span> <span id="s518">Just in the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">EM: In the lang-...</span></p> <p><span id="s520">AK: Not in religion.</span> <span id="s521">Not in religion, but in the language, yes, I had, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">EM: Now, you mentioned something about hearing that the people who hid you were, were they put to death or how were they punished?</span> <span id="s523">That you heard that they were punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">AK: Yeah, hard to tell again because as I said, they all escaped, you know, a couple hours before the Red Army came they all, the cops of the concentration camp, this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EM: No, I mean the people that were hiding you, the Baranowskis.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">AK: Oh, oh, the Baranowski family, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">EM: And you know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">AK: Somebody, they gave us a message that they were shot by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EM: That they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">AK: Yeah, they were immediately shot, taken outside from their homes and shot.</span> <span id="s531">Yeah that’s, that was non-official message given to us, you know, but somebody who came from the Jewish families with us from Darnitsa they gave us such an unofficial message.</span> <span id="s532">So we don’t know for sure whether this was true or not, you know, but an unofficial message was given to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">EM: So what did you do after the Soviet Army liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">AK: We went back to Kiev, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">EM: You went back to Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">AK: Yeah, and then the regime was...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">EM: But that was in, what, in January of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">AK: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s539">We went back to Kiev even before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s540">You know, we could go back to Kiev, you know.</span> <span id="s541">But I must tell you the truth that the economical conditions was very hard over there and also the political regime under Joseph Stalin was horrible, as you know.</span> <span id="s542">From the history you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s543">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">AK: Of the period of the [unclear], you know.</span> <span id="s545">And that’s when my parents decided to make a plan how to escape to the West after that, yes.</span> <span id="s546">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">EM: So how long did you stay in Kiev?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">AK: We stayed in Kiev until 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">EM: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">AK: I think ‘50, yes, five years after the war.</span> <span id="s551">And then finally we took, my parents with me together took a risk.</span> <span id="s552">I was a big boy already.</span> <span id="s553">I was 16 almost, 15, not exactly 16 years of age.</span> <span id="s554">Yeah, so [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s555">EM: So, in Kiev did you go to school then for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">AK: I went to school for a while because my, actually my education in my childhood was missing a lot because I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s557">So I had to start actually my education in the age of, for instance I was 11 years old when the war was over in 1945.</span> <span id="s558">From the very beginning, from the same grade where the children start from the 7 year of age, you know, because I missed a lot by being, you know, under the German imprisonment of the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">EM: And your father, did he go back to his old job?</span> <span id="s560">Or what kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">AK: Yes, so they gave him again back to his own job, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">EM: And you could go back to your old apartment?</span> <span id="s563">Or did you get a new place to...</span></p> <p><span id="s564">AK: We got a new place, but also in a communal, collective apartment, you know.</span> <span id="s565">We didn’t have our own, private apartment, you know.</span> <span id="s566">We had to go live in another one which was a couple families.</span> <span id="s567">We shared the same, a common kitchen, the common toilet, the common bathroom, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EM: Could you tell me, what was the attitude of the people in Kiev once you came back?</span> <span id="s569">Did they say, were they antisemitic?</span> <span id="s570">Or didn’t you feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">AK: First, yes, we didn’t feel any antisemitism, because everybody knew what happened in Babi Yar, what happened to the six millions of Jews, you know, in the whole occupied Europe in that time.</span> <span id="s572">.</span> <span id="s573">So in the beginning they were so, I would not say sympathetic, you know, they didn’t show demonstrate any compassion, you know.</span> <span id="s574">But they were just like I would say indifferent, you know.</span> <span id="s575">They didn’t demonstrate any antisemitism in the beginning at all, you know, only in the year of 1948.</span> <span id="s576">Then it has been started.</span> <span id="s577">And I just received, you know, to be honest with you, they have now a Soviet magazine from Moscow, the Sovetish Heimland where is being published the biggest crimes which were committed, you know, to the Jewish intelligentsia beginning of 1948 by Joseph Stalin and Laurentii Beria, his right hand Chairman of the KGB, yeah.</span> <span id="s578">And since that time, you know, the antisemitism started to grow stronger, yeah.</span> <span id="s579">And then, it added, again when we were already here in the United States, what I read in the same magazine in 19- [noise]</span></p> <p><span id="s580">EM: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s581">[tape off then on] Did life in Kiev in 1945, from 1945 to 1950 differ a lot from life before?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">AK: It differed only in one way, that it was very much more scarcity of the food products, of other consumer goods and people have to stay in long lines whenever something was delivered, even a little quantity of food products or consumer goods so it was crisis, economical crisis worse than before the war, of course, because the whole industry was destroyed by Nazi Germans, you know?</span> <span id="s583">Industry in food industry and technological industry so there was a terrible scarcity.</span> <span id="s584">And that’s why many people decided to leave for any place the Soviet Union because the life was horrible, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s586">Did your parents have any other family that survived there, do you know?</span> <span id="s587">Did you have any aunts or uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">AK: Yes, my father’s mother, my grandmother, was living in Moscow, and his two sisters, my aunts.</span> <span id="s589">They were in Moscow.</span> <span id="s590">You know, that’s why they were safe completely from the Holocaust because Moscow as you know was never occupied by the Nazi German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">AK: You know, and in the time when Joseph Stalin died and we were here already in America my father has established relations with them, found them, through the American Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">EM: So when did you leave Kiev?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">AK: We left in 19-, I’ll say in July, 1950, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">EM: 1950.</span> <span id="s596">Where did you go from Kiev?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">AK: We went to the border of eastern Germany and western Germany and we escaped through the border illegally.</span> <span id="s598">Somebody helped us to escape through the border illegally to the Federal Republic of Germany, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">EM: So you went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">AK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">EM: Where did you live in Germany and how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">AK: In Munich.</span> <span id="s603">We lived in the southern part of Germany, in Munich.</span> <span id="s604">And we lived about let’s say we came there in July, 1950, the end of July.</span> <span id="s605">We lived there until, so about December, 1950, you know.</span> <span id="s606">And we immediately applied for a visa to go to United States.</span> <span id="s607">That’s why only a couple of months, yeah, a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">EM: How, did your father know anybody in the United States to help him with the visa?</span> <span id="s609">Or was it difficult for him to get the visa to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">AK: It was not difficult, because there were a lot of Jewish organizations here, you know, who were sen-, Jewish, and also these Jewish organizations were united with the so-called United National Refugees Organization, which was functioning at that time in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany.</span> <span id="s611">And they helped us to come to get a visa and to come to United States, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">EM: When you were in Munich, did you stay in a DP camp or wh-...</span></p> <p><span id="s613">AK: No, no, we didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s614">In 1950, you know, almost, these camps started to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s615">EM: Dissolved.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">AK: Laid off already, you know.</span> <span id="s617">But the UNRRA, which was called then, a little...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">EM: IR-...</span></p> <p><span id="s619">AK: Maybe IRO, you know, change it, by the name of IRO, you know, they helped us to get a visa to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">EM: The UNRRA, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">AK: UNRRA, yeah, United National Refugees Relief Association [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration], yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s623">So where did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">AK: In December of 1950 we arrived here to...</span></p> <p><span id="s625">EM: In 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">AK: Straight to the city of Philadelphia we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">EM: Oh, and so you parents and you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">AK: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">EM: And then did your father get a job here and you went to school or...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">AK: My father just got a job, not any more as a teacher, as a, like he was before.</span> <span id="s631">He got a job in the University of Pennsylvania in the scientific laboratory to do research work.</span> <span id="s632">That’s what kind of job he got when he arrived here, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">EM: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">AK: And I went to school, yeah, to American High School yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s636">Well, is there anything else that you would like to add or something that you think would help us to understand the situation a little better?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">AK: Yes, as I mentioned before, the only thing I can add again, that I decided to, as soon as Joseph Stalin died, you know, I decided to establish there cultural relations within my native country the Soviet Union, between the city of Kiev.</span> <span id="s638">Because these Committees for Cultural Relations With the Compatriots Abroad only started to be functioning after Joseph Stalin’s death.</span> <span id="s639">Before that such committees never existed, neither in Kiev nor in Moscow, nor anywhere.</span> <span id="s640">But then, they started immediately, you know, under the rule of Khrushchev, you know, for the, first Malenkov was ruling the country, then Khrushchev, you know, they started to establish these committees in order to keep relations with their compatriots abroad.</span> <span id="s641">I wrote to them, you know, I found out from a newspaper an address and they start to send me regular literature straight to the city of Philadelphia, you know, so because I always believed no matter what, you know, you have to be a patriot of your native country where you are born, you know.</span> <span id="s642">You didn’t have to be an enemy.</span> <span id="s643">You may be disagreeing with the Communist regime especially with when Stalin was ruling the country, you know, it was horrible of course.</span> <span id="s644">You know, this terror, the liquidation of many innocent people--Jews and non-Jews--also altogether.</span> <span id="s645">You know, declaring them as enemies of the people for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s646">But nevertheless I believe it, you know, the regime doesn’t matter, and the political or social system doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s647">This is your native country.</span> <span id="s648">You have to be a good friend of it and establish cultural relations.</span> <span id="s649">I read literature, especially when they would send this literature free of charge, you know?</span> <span id="s650">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s651">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">AK: And so I got back in touch with them.</span> <span id="s653">That’s the only thing I may add, you know, and I am doing this until today, the same thing.</span> <span id="s654">I have cultural relations with Kiev.</span> <span id="s655">Not any more with Moscow, because a problem is, you know, when Gorbachev came to the government, as the head of the government...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">AK: They’re asking me to pay for the newspaper already because it started already to be like in, a little bit Capitalism really.</span> <span id="s658">Yeah, so I decided, you know, my goodness, I said, “For twenty years they have sent me for free and I don’t want me to pay.”</span> <span id="s659">I resisted to pay so they discontinued to send.</span> <span id="s660">But from Kiev, they send me still the Ukrainian newspaper.</span> <span id="s661">There’s a whole news from Ukrainia.</span> <span id="s662">It’s published bilingual, in the Ukrainian language and in English, you know.</span> <span id="s663">And from Minsk, you know, the Belorussian newspaper I also have cultural relations with the capital of Belorussia in Minsk, the Rezhima.</span> <span id="s664">Golos Rezhima means Voice of the Native Country [Voice of the Regime] also.</span> <span id="s665">They call the newspaper in Belorussian language.</span> <span id="s666">And Belorussian language is very close to Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s667">In Russia you don’t have to study it to be able to understand, so I am reading with great pleasure, yeah, and it’s all I may add, you know, yeah, to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">EM: Could you tell me, did you ever think of going to Israel for a, when you were in Germany for instance?</span> <span id="s669">What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">AK: Well I was thinking...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">EM: What was your attitude towards Zionist or Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">AK: Well my attitude, as I told you, I was not brought [up] in a Zionist spirit, you know, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s673">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">AK: But I still believe it, you know, that Israel is also a Jewish native country, a native country of all Jews, and I have, was very enthusiastic of visiting very often Israel, you know, as a native country of all Jews who received this native country after two thousand years of being spread all over the world, being pogromed, you know, suffering from pogroms, from other persecutions and discrimination.</span> <span id="s675">You know, so I was very enthusiastic to go, but unfortunately until this time, well like I never went to my native country Soviet Union, to the Kiev, only I have cultural relations.</span> <span id="s676">The same thing, I never went to Israel now.</span> <span id="s677">But I still believe, I’m not too old and I will always have a chance to do that, sooner or later, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">EM: Could you tell me, what kind of work are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">AK: I am an interpreter, a linguist.</span> <span id="s680">Russian-English, English-Russian interpreter in City Hall and in other lawyer offices where depositions are being held.</span> <span id="s681">I am working for Berlitz School.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">AK: Berlitz School is my, where my employer is.</span> <span id="s684">The Berlitz School...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">EM: So

the camp helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">AK: Well, there was no such way, no such chance to help each other because everybody was imprisoned, you know, equally.</span> <span id="s717">You know, so nobody had right to help, you know, there.</span> <span id="s718">You know, if somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s719">EM: I mean some, like for instance was...</span></p> <p><span

the...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">EM: Just from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s773">AK: Ukrainians and the Russians who were politically arrested...</span></p> <p><span id="s774">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">AK: You know?</span> <span id="s776">Before they shot them they delivered them with the trucks to Babi Yar and then they shot them, you know.</span> <span id="s777">And so, so far as I know from the press, from the Soviet press today they said they were shooting of machine guns was not stopping, you know, the whole [coughing] excuse me, two years of occupation, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">EM: Of the whole...</span></p> <p><span id="s779">AK: Somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s780">EM: Not just in nine-...</span></p> <p><span id="s781">AK: All over again, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">EM: Not just in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">AK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">EM: There were shootings...</span></p> <p><span id="s785">AK: In 1941 first the Jews fell, were the victims and then everybody else became a victim too and they were shooting machine guns continued over and over again, you know, over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">EM: Tell me something.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">AK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">EM: When the Germans came to Kiev, did they look especially for Jews?</span> <span id="s789">Did they give any special arm bands to the Jews?</span> <span id="s790">Did they look for Jews especially?</span> <span id="s791">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">AK: Yes.</span> <span id="s793">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s794">Yes, that is a good question, you know.</span> <span id="s795">Before this announcement was given in September 28, 1941, that all Jews have to leave their apartments at 7:00 in the morning, next day it means on September 29 with all their important belongings, and go to Babi Yar, you know, before that announcement, you know, the first days the German Army entered to Kiev, some Jews who were walking with other people, you know, on the street to meet the German Army, you know, they were just looking sometimes asking people for ID card any man or woman whose face looked a little bit Semitic.</span> <span id="s796">You know, and sometimes they and look, asking for ID cards.</span> <span id="s797">They, you know, was looking on the people’s eyes and noses and said, “Ah!</span> <span id="s798">Jew, or Jews with the face to the wall,” you know.</span> <span id="s799">And they collected them, you know, and probably also they put them on the truck and delivered them to Babi Yar and killed them.</span> <span id="s800">You know, but they could not kill everybody like that, you know.</span> <span id="s801">And so finally they found this place Babi Yar which was very convenient, a big ravine, a gigantic ravine, you know, with the cliffs...</span></p> <p><span id="s802">EM: A big ravine by...</span></p> <p><span id="s803">AK: Around the, a ravine, yeah.</span> <span id="s804">And they had to give this announcement that everybody has to go there with their belongings, you know which were very important.</span> <span id="s805">But they didn’t say any food, you know, just belongings, important valuable things, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">AK: So everybody believed already ahead of time, could assume what will happen, that they didn’t tell you to take food with you, food products, that probably they will liquidate you physically, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">EM: Do you know if the Jews knew what was happening in Poland at that time, just before the Germans marched in?</span> <span id="s809">Did the Jews know what was happening in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">AK: Well, I will tell you something, since the Molotov and Ribbenthrop Pact was signed on August 25th, 1939, you know, between the Soviet Union and Germany for ten years, as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">EM: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">AK: That was assigned for ten years.</span> <span id="s813">You know, whenever somebody in the Soviet press wanted to write about this big Holocaust which took already the whole occupied Europe, what the Nazi Germans provided it was prohibited to write in that time because we are allies of Germans.</span> <span id="s814">Let them do whatever they want in their occupied territory.</span> <span id="s815">So long as they didn’t touch us, we don’t care and we have to be quiet, because we don’t want to annoy them.</span> <span id="s816">They are our allies now.</span> <span id="s817">We signed a peace pact for ten years.</span> <span id="s818">And this peace pact didn’t last even for two years, you know, and they invaded, you know.</span> <span id="s819">But in that time the Soviet press had to be silent because even anybody wanted, a journalist, to bring any article about it, the horrible things in Czechoslovakia in other places, you know, even in France in 1940 when they occupied France, you know, to write about this horrible Holocaust.</span> <span id="s820">They said, “Don’t you dare touch the Germans, we, let her fight, you know, they are our allies.</span> <span id="s821">Let them do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s822">So long as they don’t cling to us we have to be quiet...” But they were clinging to us too, finally.</span> <span id="s823">Ha ha, yeah, they were bitterly mistaken, yes.</span> <span id="s824">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">EM: All right, well thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">AK: You’re welcome, Mrs. Millman.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">EM: Thank you, Millman, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">AK: Yeah, Millman, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">EM: I do have, O.K., I would like you to fill something what, this card out, O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">AK: Yeah, O.K.</span> <span
