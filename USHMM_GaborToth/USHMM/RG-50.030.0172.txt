A: Well, (pause - crying) when I left, he was saying he wants to see me...we're going to see each other. I said it is impossible, you know...it's so strict. It's everything against the law. We even can't speak to each other. And then later on he said, listen. The second Sunday I got to come too I know I have to go to Eferding to work by a farm. I found out somehow. He said he's going to be in Eferding at one o'clock by the church. Got to be at church there. I don't know Eferding . I know there got to be a church there. That's what we meet. He came on a bicycle. I got there on a bicycle and we saw each other and then we met secretly and we...I think we fell in love. And some people saw us, somehow, and we were arrested and uh...
Q: What happened when you were arrested? 01:11:18
A: Well, they put us in a jail, the Gestapo. The Polizeipresidium in Linz and the...they took us to the Gestapo. We were questioned if you have a a love affair with each other. I said no. We just nothing between us. You know, we couldn't could not say anything, you know, I know it was against the law, and we was saying just in case something come up that somebody...that they find out that we see each other, I take the blame on me because I know it's going to be bad for you. They're not going to hang me, but they're going to hang you, I said to him, you know. So I did take the blame on me. I said but its' nothing between us, so they let us go...the Gestapo. And so they they took me...they said I got to go back to that farm, but I got to go someplace else that where he no find me. OK. They let him out Friday, and they kept me till Monday that we no meet each other on a depot or go somewhere that we no get in touch with each other. And then Monday...on Monday I was on a on a on a train depot. Was waiting for the train to go to Eferding to pick up my things, because the the employment office that put me to another farm to Gunskirchen, but in we in a country that no nobody finds me there, see, and they were saying if you get in touch with each other, you're going to be black and blue and you're going to be a head shorter, they were saying to me, you know, so I thought gosh, I'll never see him again so whatever happen, it happen. And I was standing in a train depot. All of a sudden...there were a lot of people...all of a sudden he walked in from the train to go to another train. Was on Monday morning. Oh my God...when I saw him and he saw me...well, we couldn't...we couldn't go to each other because if somebody's here maybe the police is around here someplace or there may be some people
01:14:00 squeal again looking at us, so we we we were so scared but we somehow pulled on a side and there was old curtain over there for the...in a train depot...somehow an old thing...and oh in the corner we're were...we meeting, you know. Where you going? And he had the address from the from the employment office where he got to go to a farm, to a different farm and I had to go to a different farm in Gunskirchen. I already knew it, you know. He said where are we going to meet? I said I don't know. It's going to be real hard, you know. He said, listen, next Sunday, in Wels at the Landstrasse you're going to be there about one o'clock, and that's where we meet. He came on a bicycle to Wels from Biesling to Wels, and I came on a bicycle to Biesling and we were riding up and down. We just saw each other, but we couldn't...we couldn't go there to shake hands or to say hello because we were afraid somebody see us. And finally we went on a side place somewhere, you know. We got off and we talked to each other and we meet over there, OK, and that's how I told him how to get there to Gunskirchen but he find me where I am and so he came a couple of times to Gunskirchen on a Saturday, late in the evening to meet and uh, you know, it was very strict that we're said, you know, if somebody see us...my God, you know, we're we're...it's the end of us. And then he said yes, I know that, you know, but can't help it. So I said it's so terrible on this farm here (sniffle). I would like to get an easier job somewhere and he said well, don't do it, you know. I said well, I try, you know, to get maybe in Wels maybe an easier...they need...they needed somebody to the factories, you know, and I tried to go to the unemployment, to the employment office. I tried. And they did have a job over there and when I start quitting that farm, the farm...the the guy was so miserable...he saw...he said he saw Julian there in the evening that we're meet
01:17:00 on his farm. So he put me into the Gestapo that they're going to arrest me, and I never could get this job in in Wels because I I left the farm so the farmer he was so mad, you know, and he make me, you know, to to to told the Gestapo, you know, that I meet the Pole at this and that and Julian and that they're arrest me, and so they did. They arrest him and also me.
Q: Did he...did did the farmer specifically betray you to the Gestapo?

I know it cost him a lot of money and a lot of whatever to get me out because it was a miracle. My hair grew back. I was ashamed to go some place, naturally, you know that some outside people don't see me and then one day my mom said well, your hair getting a little longer now. You should have a permanent now, you know...the permanent came out but I couldn't go to the town where I come from. I was so embarrassed, so my mom sent me to Wels so
01:44:00 Mom said take some... at that time, you know, there was food shortage and things like that...take some butter and some meat with you and give it to the some kind of strange, you know, whatever lady to tell her to do your hair. (Crying) That's what I did. And I looked a little better already. (Crying) And then I put myself together at home...kept busy working. My sisters were nice. They accept me again, but the outside people...some outside people were bad.
Q: What did they do? What did they do?
A: Well, they just do angry...actually they do nothing to me. They just...when they saw me, oh...there she is, there she is. She was...she was in a concentration camp because of a Pole, you know. You know, it was like a big, awful big thing, you know, and it was just...I put just my life in from one day to the next, you know, because it seemed so empty, so worthless. I didn't know what happened to Julian. I don't know, so...I didn't know what's going to happen so I just leave it up to God. Then one day that other Pole, Franz, he told me he got a card from Julian. I said oh my God, where is he? He says here, here's the card and it was written in German. I said Flossenberg?
01:46:40 Flossenberg? I don't even know such a concentration camp is Flossenberg. And then I thought my God, I wonder, you know, how he is there. My God, you know, to help him or something. So in time being, I I put myself together and I thought I'm going to send him a package, but I had to talk to Franz first. Franz, you help me? He said yes. But uh you no can...I I going to make a package but I have to take everything on my own. That time we we had...on the farm we had over six hundred trees...apple trees in that time was...pick pears and apples, you know...everything fresh picked. I though my God a package like that would get there that they no rot, you know, whatever...how long they get it...everything fresh picked. And uh I smuggled in my room a huge box and I.. . the the apples were there and the huge pears, the sugar pears. I wrapped every apple and every pear in a in a piece of newspaper and put it in a box, one after the other, and there was a big pail of onions in the room also to dry out and garlic. I put everything...filled every little hole, til it was full. (Crying) I put it together, carried it downstairs at night for Franz to take it in his room and the next day I.. . there was a a a non-working day. I told him that he got to take this package to Wiesenkirchen...that's very far away. It's about ten
01:49:00 miles from there, maybe even more, on the post office because the other post office might know what something fishy going on, you know, some somebody send a package to to to Flossenberg, but I put on uh front this friend Franz name to go for the address, for the...you know, for who sent the package. And uh Franz said I not going to do that for nothing. What you give me for that? What do you want? He liked to drink schnapps, so had to give him...Franz...a pitcher and fill it up with schnapps and give it to him. He was a good guy, but he used to like to drink and he did. Took that schnapps that he carried this package to the post office and sent it to Julian. After the war, after when Julian got out, he told me he received this package. You know, I was wondering if he received it or not. If
01:50:00 they found out that I did it, because they were saying when I left the concentration camp, if you stay in contact with Julian that you...any...make any move...you going to be black and blue and a head shorter, and I always remembered that, you know, but I did put this package together for Julian, you know, so it was a a big chance to take. My sisters didn't know. Nobody knew. Just Franz and me knew it, that I sent this package. And uh when it come to the time when the war got worse and worse during the end, a lot of time I was...I I almost didn't hope that he...Julian is still alive. But I keep praying and hoping that he is alive. (Crying) And all of a sudden the war was over. God...how we start...how I find out, how can I find out if he make it. I know his mother was from Tarnow somewhere. I got...I got to find out if he is alive, whether or not even if he not come, not to come here. And spring came. It was nice spring weather. I was...it was on Saturday morning. It was May 18th. I was sitting on back porch. Not sitting...was outside in the back yard of the house. All of a sudden the the the bell ring. We got a bell that rings through the whole house. We had a bell. I thought my God, who that...who is this? I hadn't even thought about it, you know. Let it be whatever it is. My sister Theresa, she went outside and she said "mein Gott' Julian, she said, and I heard that name...I just couldn't believe it. I jumped and you know, went see who it is. Oh my God...there he is, but he didn't came alone. He came with another another friend. He...I think he was afraid to come alone. (Laughter) So...God, I'm glad you're alive. And then just happen you know, we were in love and that's it. (Crying) But we still still was uh meeting secretly. My father was still a little, you know...but uh was no other way. He could see it's just no other way, so they try to help us but he said what you going to do? Nothing_ what you can I, you know, to help or something. What you do? Then he said, well, if we get married I going to get a job just temporarily get a job and an apartment to live there and uh later on I would like to plan to go to America because my father is there. And I thought my God...so far away...America. And that's what we did, you know. My father then...my sisters, my mom...agreed that we get married and we got married in a year later. It was April 24th. And uh we had a little apartment in 01:54:00 Biesling. He was photographer. He was...he work in a machine, you know, and things to make a little living, you know, things. It's nothing to brag about but it was a job and then he arranged the papers to go to America. And my father said that's the best thing, you know, to go to America because this is a land of the opportunity, the future for all people, but still they would like to have us there, not to leave. Meantime our little girl was born. Then we left for this country.
Q: When did you arrive? 01:55:00
A: We arrived in March...March...I don't know exactly the date...I think also around the 20th. Around the 20th March we arrived in this country and uh we lived three months with my husband's father and then we got our own apartment. We worked in a textile mill and I was weaving. Textile mill...and he worked also in a different mill. Between time, you know, I left six o'clock in the morning for work until two and he started three o'clock from eleven o'clock, so we had always somebody for our little girl and then later on the mills, the textile mill closed up. We're...we wanted so...we had a little bit money already saved. We we said if it's an old house, I don't care so long we got our own little roof over our head. That would be nice for our children. That's what we did. We found an old, old house, farmhouse, very good land. I said you'll see...we going to make it on this. Fixed up the old house...it's beautiful. Fixed it up, renewed it and uh first we didn't had any money to buy cows or anything. We bought little chickens, raised the chickens, three hundred fifty leghorns. And then we had the profit from leghorns, sold the eggs and later on we bought cows on the...bought young stock...bought fifteen young stock to raise to make some money to sell it, so we already on on our own and he...besides he worked on the construction and I on the farm and then later on we said, well...he said I would like to go in some business. I think that be a good idea, what else. You know, we not going to stay on the farm. I said it's OK. We got a place, some cottage place with a yard. He had some stones for display and uh start his monument business and later on we found out another...what we are now...it's a beautiful place...was for sale and we bought that place. I.. . besides I worked in a factory, helped him and he worked at the...with the stones. I worked with Dunlop sixteen years and uh that's all I know. (Laughter)
