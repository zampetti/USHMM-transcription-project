remember any different kind of treatment from the teachers or the students?)</span> <span id="s271">You know, I can tell you a story about when I was in the first grade.</span> <span id="s272">The beginning it was the first day in my school.</span> <span id="s273">I remember it like this day.</span> <span id="s274">It's a big room, desks, little tables.</span> <span id="s275">Our school was only for girls.</span> <span id="s276">At this time schools were separated for girls and boys.</span> <span id="s277">Stalin wanted it to be like in ancient times before the revolution.</span> <span id="s278">Girls study with girls, and boys study with boys.</span> <span id="s279">On the first day the teacher asked everybody, "What is your nationality?"</span> <span id="s280">And my name was the last on the list, because my last name was Shternberg.</span> <span id="s281">The first letter is "sh", after it only four letters in the alphabet.</span> <span id="s282">They are very rare letters, so as usual I was on the last place on the list.</span> <span id="s283">And the teacher asked each girl to stand up and answer.</span> <span id="s284">And all the girls stand up, and each girl says: Russian.</span> <span id="s285">(Russian is a noun and an adjective, too.)</span> <span id="s286">But I sit in my place and think what will I say when it is my turn?</span> <span id="s287">Everybody was Russian.</span> <span id="s288">It was my turn, I stand, and she looks at me.</span> <span id="s289">I can't force myself to say Jew.</span> <span id="s290">I look at her, and she looks at me.</span> <span id="s291">And I say, "What do I have to say?</span> <span id="s292">Russian?"</span> <span id="s293">I cannot pronounce "Jew".</span></p> <p><span id="s294">I can't explain you can't understand being Jewish in Russia.</span> <span id="s295">On the one hand I was proud, but on the other hand I was afraid to say it.</span> <span id="s296">I was ashamed to be Jewish, you know for others.</span> <span id="s297">I was proud for me because I knew I am Jew and it is good, because Jews are very good people.</span> <span id="s298">But I knew that other people don't like Jews.</span> <span id="s299">They treat them like they're bad.</span> <span id="s300">"What do I have to say?</span> <span id="s301">Russian?"</span> <span id="s302">And she said, "No, you are a Jew."</span> <span id="s303">The whole class everybody turned.</span> <span id="s304">I remember it!</span> <span id="s305">I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s306">I cannot forget, if I recall it, I cannot suppress tears.</span> <span id="s307">I was so small.</span> <span id="s308">I couldn't pronounce that I'm Jew.</span> <span id="s309">I ask, "What do I have to say?"</span> <span id="s310">because everybody said "Russian," so I said "What do I have to say?"</span> <span id="s311">And she said "No."</span> <span id="s312">I don't remember that she was antiSemitic.</span> <span id="s313">I was a very good pupil.</span> <span id="s314">I had only fives all years.</span> <span id="s315">And I was a very loud girl, very brave.</span> <span id="s316">I was never quiet.</span> <span id="s317">And I was an excellent pupil.</span> <span id="s318">And I was very good friends with the girls.</span> <span id="s319">I never fought.</span> <span id="s320">And in the school my teacher treated me good.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">But when I was in high school in ninth and tenth grades, the last grades, my teacher was antiSemitic.</span> <span id="s322">We had many teachers, and some of them were antiSemitic, and some of them were not.</span> <span id="s323">Because, I don't remember, but sometimes I heard it, and sometimes no.</span> <span id="s324">But my main teacher, she was exactly.</span> <span id="s325">She arranged it, and I didn't receive a medal.</span> <span id="s326">My husband did he tell his story?</span> <span id="s327">He received a medal but his main teacher was antiSemitic so he received the documents too late and couldn't enter Moscow University because it had a deadline.</span> <span id="s328">She did it specially because she knew that he wanted to go to University.</span> <span id="s329">And she delayed, delayed, delayed.</span> <span id="s330">And so she gave him the diploma after the deadline.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">In my case, they did it differently and didn't give me a medal.</span> <span id="s332">If it were to happen with my children, I would go to school or I would go to the Board of Education, I would fight, but it was 1954, and my parents were afraid to do anything.</span> <span id="s333">And they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s334">They knew it's not fair, it's antiSemitic.</span> <span id="s335">But they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s336">They said they knew I was a good girl, that even without the medal I can enter institute.</span> <span id="s337">And so I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">(So did you ever think about joining Komsomol when you were in school?)</span> <span id="s339">I was in the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s340">Everybody was in it!</span> <span id="s341">In our class there were maybe forty pupils, and everybody was in it.</span> <span id="s342">It was strange not to be.</span> <span id="s343">When my children were at school I said, "No!</span> <span id="s344">You cannot!"</span> <span id="s345">But it was strange, too, even when my children were schoolboys, even for them.</span> <span id="s346">But I said, "No."</span> <span id="s347">"Why are your boys not in

Yes.</span> <span id="s683">The work was very important, the secrecy, but you know, in Russia, everything is secret, everything.</span> <span id="s684">And we think that maybe we can receive this refusal, but we applied nevertheless.</span> <span id="s685">Because we thought that we need to say that we want to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">(You needed to speak out.</span> <span id="s687">You didn't want to be afraid.)</span> <span id="s688">If we do not apply, that's our own refusal.</span> <span id="s689">We are waiting.</span> <span id="s690">Time will pass, will go, and his secrecy will be over, and after this we will apply.</span> <span id="s691">No it's not good, because in this case we are in our own refusal.</span> <span id="s692">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">(Yes, so you're saying you couldn't wait until his work was no longer secret work because maybe they would say he knew all these secrets then.)</span> <span id="s694">No, not because of that.</span> <span id="s695">Anyway.</span> <span id="s696">We want to apply.</span> <span id="s697">We want to say, "We want to emigrate.</span> <span id="s698">We don't want to live here."</span> <span id="s699">(Who did you talk to about this?</span> <span id="s700">Did you talk to other Jews like yourselves?)</span> <span id="s701">Yes.</span> <span id="s702">We're talking between ... with our friends and some of them applied, and some of them emigrated.</span> <span id="s703">Some of them were thinking about it, or discussing.</span> <span id="s704">Some of them wanted, but they did not have the possibility to do anything because of many, many reasons.</span> <span id="s705">There are many reasons.</span> <span id="s706">First of all, you have to decide for yourself.</span> <span id="s707">It's more important to decide, "I want it!</span> <span id="s708">I want it!"</span> <span id="s709">It's very important to have it inside, first.</span> <span id="s710">And when we decided, among my husband and me, we decided that we would apply immediately.</span> <span id="s711">And we applied.</span> <span id="s712">But before, my husband quit his job.</span> <span id="s713">He stopped working at this institute.</span> <span id="s714">It was very amazing for his colleagues, because he had a very high position in this institute.</span> <span id="s715">He was chief of laboratory.</span> <span id="s716">I think he told [you] about it.</span> <span id="s717">(Well, we didn't get very far in his interview.</span> <span id="s718">We had a short interview.</span> <span id="s719">We have not finished.)</span> <span id="s720">You'll have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">(Tell me a little bit.</span> <span id="s722">He did have trouble rising to that position, but he did become chief.</span> <span id="s723">That was good.)</span> <span id="s724">And then his supervisor, his director, they ask him, "What happened?</span> <span id="s725">Why are you leaving?"</span> <span id="s726">He said, "I will stop working.</span> <span id="s727">I've found another job."</span> <span id="s728">Without any secrecy, and we applied.</span> <span id="s729">We applied, and we received refusal.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">(How long did it take for the refusal?)</span> <span id="s731">It took more than one year.</span> <span id="s732">We were waiting... It was the beginning of 1981.</span> <span id="s733">We were waiting and no answer.</span> <span id="s734">For that time it was a normal thing.</span> <span id="s735">They didn't give us an answer for a long, long time many months.</span> <span id="s736">At last it was a party meeting of the Communist party, and I wrote to this meeting to complain.</span> <span id="s737">I wrote that I don't receive answer.</span> <span id="s738">They immediately gave me an answer refusal!</span> <span id="s739">[laughs] (At this point, Misha was born?)</span> <span id="s740">Yes.</span> <span id="s741">He was born in 1979.</span> <span id="s742">At this time we had an invitation from Israel, and he wasn't on this invitation, and we wrote him onto this invitation after he was born.</span> <span id="s743">When we was born, we applied, together with my Michael.</span> <span id="s744">(Let me say for the record, Michael and Misha are the same person.)</span> <span id="s745">Yes.</span> <span id="s746">When we thought what name to give him, that this name will be okay, because Misha, it's a simple Russian name, very common.</span> <span id="s747">And Michael, it's an American name.</span> <span id="s748">And Mashe, it's a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s749">They're close.</span> <span id="s750">At this time, when we applied, we were going to go to America my husband and me, and Michael was born, and our sons were small (Sergey and Vladimir).</span> <span id="s751">They didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s752">But during the years of refusal they grew, they began to study Hebrew, they began to study Jewish traditions, Jewish history, and they decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s753">And my husband and my two elder sons, they decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s754">And one of our friends, she said, "I'm very glad that you received refusal.</span> <span id="s755">If you did not receive ... you would go to America.</span> <span id="s756">But now you would go to Israel."</span> <span id="s757">But we "overwaited" (waited too long) in refusal.</span> <span id="s758">And my sons decided to go to America.</span> <span id="s759">It happened in the beginning of 1988.</span> <span id="s760">They changed their mind.</span> <span id="s761">There were many reasons.</span> <span id="s762">But they decided to go.</span> <span id="s763">But I was strong.</span> <span id="s764">I wanted to go to America from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">(Why was that?</span> <span id="s766">Why did you choose America over Israel?)</span> <span id="s767">You know, there were many reasons for me.</span> <span id="s768">I can say the main reasons.</span> <span id="s769">First of all, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s770">I was afraid for Arabs, because there are many Arab countries, but Israel is a small country, and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s771">That was only one reason.</span> <span id="s772">The other reason was that I had very strong feeling to Israel, a very strong feeling.</span> <span id="s773">I knew, if I go to Israel, I would fight.</span> <span id="s774">I cannot be still.</span> <span id="s775">(What would you be fighting?)</span> <span id="s776">I'd be fighting with Arabs, you know.</span> <span id="s777">Political.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">(You would have gotten involved in the politics.)</span> <span id="s779">Yes, because I had and I have now a very strong feeling to Israel.</span> <span id="s780">(Nationalist leanings...) Ahh... (What is your feeling Israel should be just for Jews?)</span> <span id="s781">Yes, just for Jews, because I understand that the situation that is now, Jews and Arabs, there can't be peace on this land.</span> <span id="s782">There can't be.</span> <span id="s783">Because Arabs want to fight.</span> <span id="s784">It cannot be peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">The next reason was I don't like the weather there.</span> <span id="s786">It was important for me.</span> <span id="s787">Even in Chicago in the summer, I don't like the hot weather.</span> <span id="s788">A very important reason for me was my vision.</span> <span id="s789">I have very original vision.</span> <span id="s790">I can see only horizontal lines and I cannot see good vertical lines, so Hebrew letters for me are all the same.</span> <span id="s791">I couldn't read Hebrew letters, you know, Hebrew alphabet, because thick horizontal lines and thick vertical lines I don't see them.</span> <span id="s792">I see only horizontal lines.</span> <span id="s793">So when I open Hebrew book all letters are the same for me.</span> <span id="s794">I said I can't learn Hebrew ever!</span> <span id="s795">So there were many reasons more, many not very important.</span> <span id="s796">And I wanted to go, and I said, no, we will go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">(In 1981 they refused you.</span> <span id="s798">And I know that some people who received refusals were not considered refuseniks.</span> <span id="s799">But you were considered refuseniks.</span> <span id="s800">Why is that, because you were outspoken?)</span> <span id="s801">Because many people received refusal, were waiting until maybe last year, when the door was opened and many people could emigrate.</span> <span id="s802">But we did not wait.</span> <span id="s803">How to say we fighted.</span> <span id="s804">(You struggled against the system.)</span> <span id="s805">Yes.</span> <span id="s806">(By struggling against the system when refused you get the name refusenik, is that it?)</span> <span id="s807">Yes.</span> <span id="s808">Every halfyear, we applied again.</span> <span id="s809">We wrote letters.</span> <span id="s810">(Who did you write to?)</span> <span id="s811">To OVIR.</span> <span id="s812">It's a rule.</span> <span id="s813">Every halfyear I could apply.</span> <span id="s814">I could apply only twice a year.</span> <span id="s815">(Every six months.)</span> <span id="s816">We applied and nothing changed... We wanted to emigrate, and nothing changed.</span> <span id="s817">We asked them to give us permission, and they said no.</span> <span id="s818">They said no, you had security, secrecy....</span></p> <p><span id="s819">(You were not working at this time?)</span> <span id="s820">No, I did not work.</span> <span id="s821">When you apply to OVIR, it was a rule, you had to bring paper from your work.</span> <span id="s822">It's written, "You work at this place, (at this firm), and you don't have debts, and we know that you want to emigrate to Israel."</span> <span id="s823">It's necessary.</span> <span id="s824">It was necessary to be written.</span> <span id="s825">So, if you ask for this paper, everybody in your work knew that you wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s826">Sometimes they did not want to give people this paper.</span> <span id="s827">And they did not want to give this paper to me.</span> <span id="s828">It was a big scandal at work.</span> <span id="s829">They did not want to give this paper, and I struggled with the director, supervisor.</span> <span id="s830">Of course they gave me this paper because it's against the rules not to.</span> <span id="s831">If I work, they must give me this paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">(What was the name of the place you were working at?)</span> <span id="s833">It was Mechanical Design Bureau for Medical Industry... I don't know how to translate it.</span> <span id="s834">(What was your work there?)</span> <span id="s835">I was, in Russian, it's engineer designer draftsman.</span> <span id="s836">I drafted big drafts.</span> <span id="s837">(Of equipment?)</span> <span id="s838">Equipment for medical industry.</span> <span id="s839">(Can you give us an example of what kind of equipment?)</span> <span id="s840">Different machines, automatic equipment that make different things for medical industry.</span> <span id="s841">(Machines that stamped out or in some way helped...) For example, last work was a machine that made a frame for glasses.</span> <span id="s842">They cut the frame for glasses.</span> <span id="s843">They cut this (stem...) That's the work I did.</span> <span id="s844">(So it's highly technical, very specific industrial design work in the medical field.)</span> <span id="s845">You know, it doesn't depend on your work, it depends on the people who give this paper.</span> <span id="s846">If people are friendly, if people are good, then sure, they give you this paper.</span> <span id="s847">If people are afraid that something will happen and somebody asked why you have in your work people who want to emigrate, they say usually, "Go away.</span> <span id="s848">Fill out this paper: quit your job.</span> <span id="s849">After that, you can apply.</span> <span id="s850">If you quit your job, we'll give you this paper for OVIR."</span> <span id="s851">(So in your case they absolutely refused to give you that paper.)</span> <span id="s852">But after a couple days they gave me this paper.</span> <span id="s853">They could only force me to apply to quit working.</span> <span id="s854">They wanted to force me to quit working.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">(So what did you do after that?)</span> <span id="s856">This paper was given to OVIR.</span> <span id="s857">(But you continued working there then?)</span> <span id="s858">If I go to another work, if I found another job, they would ask me, "Why did you stop working at your last place?"</span> <span id="s859">Because everybody in Russia has a special "Labor book."</span> <span id="s860">In this book it's written all your jobs when you begin, when you stop, next job... every person, every man, every woman who works they have this special "Labor book."</span> <span id="s861">(Do you still have that book?)</span> <span id="s862">No, I left it in Russia.</span> <span id="s863">It's not necessary in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">(You didn't consider it a souvenir to bring with you.)</span> <span id="s865">You know, we cannot bring here original documents.</span> <span id="s866">We can bring only copies.</span> <span id="s867">We did copies in Moscow and brought here, but my "Labor book" was given to OVIR when we left.</span> <span id="s868">(You had to turn it in...) Yes.</span> <span id="s869">Our passport and our "Labor book" we must give to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">(So how long did you continue working after you got this letter for OVIR?)</span> <span id="s871">After this time I did not work because my Michael was born.</span> <span id="s872">I could not work.</span> <span id="s873">(They would not let you go back.)</span> <span id="s874">No, they could not fire me, I could come back when Michael was one year old, but it was undesirable and I quit.</span> <span id="s875">And I had my "Labor book."</span> <span id="s876">If, for example, I found another job, I come there, they open my book.</span> <span id="s877">They ask, "Why did you stop working in this medical bureau?"</span> <span id="s878">I could say, "because my kid was born."</span> <span id="s879">But they call by phone what happened, how did she work... "Aha, she wants to go to Israel!"</span> <span id="s880">; "We don't need you."</span> <span id="s881">So it was absolutely impossible to find another job.</span> <span id="s882">Moreover, at a new job every half year we applied to OVIR I would have to take new paper from new job.</span> <span id="s883">My husband he worked in the same place, at the same work, so it was not a surprise for them when he asked for a new paper!</span></p> <p><span id="s884">(He gave up his job as chief of the laboratory in, what was it, 1979?)</span> <span id="s885">No, he stopped working in 1978, and he found a new job, and he applied when he had found a new job.</span> <span id="s886">(His new job did not pay as well, I imagine, as the old one.)</span> <span id="s887">Yes.</span> <span id="s888">And his salary was reduced when he took paper for OVIR.</span> <span id="s889">But he was not laid off.</span> <span id="s890">Because it was luck, it was a good situation.</span> <span id="s891">He's chief of his institute.</span> <span id="s892">He was how to say retired and new people came, and many people left his institute, many people who worked there, they left.</span> <span id="s893">So they think that they need new people.</span> <span id="s894">(Why were people leaving?)</span> <span id="s895">Because all directors left, and many, how to say, supervisors, president and vicepresident they left.</span> <span id="s896">And many people left.</span> <span id="s897">New people came.</span> <span id="s898">(Was it retirement, or were they reassigned to other places?</span> <span id="s899">Why were they leaving?)</span> <span id="s900">The president left, he retired.</span> <span id="s901">Supervisors in the Ministry didn't approve (didn't confirm) him, because he was 65 years old.</span> <span id="s902">So he left.</span> <span id="s903">The vicepresident left.</span> <span id="s904">Many people left.</span> <span id="s905">And a new director and a new president came.</span> <span id="s906">And many people did not want to work.</span> <span id="s907">Many people left.</span> <span id="s908">They could find better jobs easily.</span> <span id="s909">So they needed people.</span> <span id="s910">They needed him, they didn't fire him, didn't force him to quit his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">(This is on the new job.)</span> <span id="s912">Yes.</span> <span id="s913">(What was he doing on the new job?)</span> <span id="s914">He had to change his profession.</span> <span id="s915">He became a computer programmer.</span> <span id="s916">He learned it.</span> <span id="s917">He studied himself and learned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">(Did he make enough money to have the family live where they could have enough of what they needed?)</span> <span id="s919">[laughs] You know, it's an interesting question, because, you know, in Russia, one man cannot support a family, especially, I did not work.</span> <span id="s920">He was the only one in the family working, we had three children instead of two, and his salary was reduced.</span> <span id="s921">And he had extra jobs.</span> <span id="s922">Yes, he, how to say, first of all, he was a tutor.</span> <span id="s923">He had children, and he taught physics.</span> <span id="s924">They came to our house several times a week.</span> <span id="s925">He received money from that.</span> <span id="s926">What else... He received scientists' articles.</span> <span id="s927">He edited articles, scientific articles.</span> <span id="s928">(Where were they published?)</span> <span id="s929">In special magazines.</span> <span id="s930">"Technical Information."</span> <span id="s931">Mostly it was translations from English.</span> <span id="s932">He translated and edited them, these articles.</span> <span id="s933">(From English to Russian?)</span> <span id="s934">Yes.</span> <span id="s935">Moreover, we sold many things.</span> <span id="s936">(What were you selling?)</span> <span id="s937">For example, we had a piano.</span> <span id="s938">My sons learned to play the piano.</span> <span id="s939">I bought it on credit.</span> <span id="s940">I paid the credit off.</span> <span id="s941">So we had a piano.</span> <span id="s942">It's big money in Russia.</span> <span id="s943">We sold it.</span> <span id="s944">I sold my fur coat.</span> <span id="s945">( Who bought your piano?)</span> <span id="s946">It's not hard to sell something in Russia.</span> <span id="s947">It's hard to sell something in America, but in Russia it's not hard to sell something good.</span> <span id="s948">Because everything is difficult there to buy something is difficult, but to sell it is not.</span> <span id="s949">(What kind of piano was it?)</span> <span id="s950">It was a simple piano.</span> <span id="s951">We bought it in a regular store.</span> <span id="s952">(A Russianmade piano?)</span> <span id="s953">Yes.</span> <span id="s954">(What kind of coat was it you sold?)</span> <span id="s955">It was sheep.</span> <span id="s956">It was funny my friend, she left for America, and she sold it to me.</span> <span id="s957">And when we got refusal and needed money, again I had to sell everything that I could!</span> <span id="s958">And we had a good library.</span> <span id="s959">We had many books.</span> <span id="s960">We sometimes sold our books because it was very hard to buy good books in Russia.</span> <span id="s961">My father loved books and bought many books, and my husband, too.</span> <span id="s962">When we needed money, we sold books.</span> <span id="s963">[laughs] (Were you able to obtain samizdat books?)</span> <span id="s964">Yes.</span> <span id="s965">(Was it important to you to have those books or not?)</span> <span id="s966">What do you mean, "to have?"</span> <span id="s967">(To read them.)</span> <span id="s968">To read?</span> <span id="s969">We read at home.</span> <span id="s970">We gave them to other people.</span> <span id="s971">They give to us.</span> <span id="s972">We listened to Voice of America.</span> <span id="s973">When we were in refusal for several years, Americans and people from England they began to visit us.</span> <span id="s974">Not from the beginning of refusal maybe in 1984 they began to visit us.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">(You began to get letters?</span> <span id="s976">How did these people find you?)</span> <span id="s977">You know, usually they just visited us.</span> <span id="s978">We give them other names of refuseniks, phone numbers and addresses.</span> <span id="s979">And they give our names to other people who visit us, who visit Moscow.</span> <span id="s980">And other people can visit other refuseniks.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">(Who were some of these people you said Congressmen and Senators?)</span> <span id="s982">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s983">Usually they were tourists.</span> <span id="s984">(Do you remember any of their names?)</span> <span id="s985">My husband remembers.</span> <span id="s986">You know, he has a big copy book where he wrote names.</span> <span id="s987">Names are difficult to remember.</span> <span id="s988">(Were there any people from the Council on Soviet Jewry?)</span> <span id="s989">Yes.</span> <span id="s990">They visited us.</span> <span id="s991">It was the last year, in 1988 they visited not our family, but they visited the refusenik community.</span> <span id="s992">(So you were part of the refusenik community you were able to give each other support in some way?)</span> <span id="s993">Yes.</span> <span id="s994">I think that we did a big job.</span> <span id="s995">We made the list of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s996">It was not my idea it was the women's idea to make this list.</span> <span id="s997">But it was a women's group and women would meet and said it's necessary to make a list of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s998">It was only talking.</span> <span id="s999">But I said, if we need to make a list, I can find the names of refuseniks in my telephone book, I can call them, and I will ask them if they know other refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1000">And I started to do it, because everybody knew that it's good to do.</span> <span id="s1001">But nobody did it, but I began, and I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">So I had many people, many addresses, many telephone numbers, and I called people and I asked, "Can you take your telephone book and say names of other refuseniks?"</span> <span id="s1003">And they told me other names and telephones, and I'd call them and ask the same question.</span> <span id="s1004">So I made a list.</span> <span id="s1005">I typed it with my fingers because even though I had a typewriter, I'm not a typist.</span> <span id="s1006">So I made this list and called other cities and they sent out a list from Leningrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">How to say, first of all, I asked people, "Do you want to be on this list?"</span> <span id="s1008">Because some of them said, "No, we don't want to be.</span> <span id="s1009">We want to be silent, to sit and to wait."</span> <span id="s1010">But some of them said, "yes."</span> <span id="s1011">They wanted to, because we would struggle.</span> <span id="s1012">We will try to push authority to let us go.</span> <span id="s1013">So some of them said no.</span> <span id="s1014">Some of them said, "Yes, we are refuseniks, but just now we cannot go, because of circumstances."</span> <span id="s1015">For example, one woman said, "I will wait until my daughter graduates institute."</span> <span id="s1016">Some of them said, "No, we are afraid."</span> <span id="s1017">Some of them could say, "My son is in Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s1018">I can be still and quiet or he will have troubles in the army.</span> <span id="s1019">I don't want to be on the list."</span> <span id="s1020">And after the son came back home, she will sign the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">(You had a list of people who were willing and ready.)</span> <span id="s1022">To struggle, to try.</span> <span id="s1023">(To take the risk of whatever...) Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1024">(How big was that list?)</span> <span id="s1025">[laughs] That's a question.</span> <span id="s1026">All the people I could reach.</span> <span id="s1027">There are many people I could not reach.</span> <span id="s1028">So we had a list of refuseniks whom we know, and who want to be on the list.</span> <span id="s1029">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1030">Some of them said, "Oh, I'm so glad you called me because all our friends left.</span> <span id="s1031">We think that we are alone in refusal, because all our friends left.</span> <span id="s1032">So we are so glad to be together!"</span> <span id="s1033">(Which of your lists was bigger the list of people who wanted to be known, or the people who wanted to be not known?)</span> <span id="s1034">Known, known.</span> <span id="s1035">Maybe ten people said no.</span> <span id="s1036">(How big was your actual list?)</span> <span id="s1037">Actually, in Moscow it was 200 families.</span> <span id="s1038">It was different, because some people received permission and left, and some received refusal.</span> <span id="s1039">In time, we found out when someone was an old refusenik or a new refusenik and I wrote them on this list.</span> <span id="s1040">But approximately it was 400 in Moscow, Leningrad and several [other] cities.</span> <span id="s1041">I could not say it's a whole list, because nobody gave us the information.</span> <span id="s1042">Not OVIR!</span> <span id="s1043">Only people whom we could reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">(So you called longdistance to Leningrad...) To Leningrad, to Odessa, Kiev, Minsk, Khar'kov, Penza.</span> <span id="s1045">Gorky, Talinn, Riga, Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1046">Not much.</span> <span id="s1047">I knew people in Irkutsk.</span> <span id="s1048">They called me because they have troubles they want to apply.</span> <span id="s1049">You know, we had some kind of magazine about Jewish life it was samizdat magazine.</span> <span id="s1050">It was written there, "Now there is a list of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1051">If you want to be on this list, call Sulamith Reznikov, phone number, and Tat'iana Rosenlit, phone number."</span> <span id="s1052">(Do you still have a copy of this list?)</span> <span id="s1053">No.</span> <span id="s1054">It's a pity.</span> <span id="s1055">I thought we can not take it through Customs.</span> <span id="s1056">So I left all my papers.</span> <span id="s1057">But I left all my papers to another woman who took this list of refuseniks and maintained it.</span> <span id="s1058">So if I knew I could, I could take it here.</span> <span id="s1059">Maybe I will try to ask somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">(So you were really working fulltime at home then?)</span> <span id="s1061">[laughs] Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1062">It was so funny, because our phone was busy all day long, because some people called me, and some people I called.</span> <span id="s1063">(How did you pay the longdistance bills?)</span> <span id="s1064">I paid.</span> <span id="s1065">It's not very much in Russia.</span> <span id="s1066">Somebody had to do it.</span> <span id="s1067">I didn't talk much time.</span> <span id="s1068">(What percentage of the people you talked to would you say got to leave the country?</span> <span id="s1069">Would you say half of them have left already?</span> <span id="s1070">More?)</span> <span id="s1071">More.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">In my list?</span> <span id="s1073">now?</span> <span id="s1074">I talked to Jen Freid [?]</span> <span id="s1075">maybe a month ago.</span> <span id="s1076">She invited us to a concert, but it was a week day, at 7:00.</span> <span id="s1077">If it were a Saturday, we could, but it was a Tuesday and my husband could not he works late.</span> <span id="s1078">But I have talked to Jen and have asked her if there are other refuseniks now.</span> <span id="s1079">She said there are 400 new refuseniks there in Moscow, or in the Soviet Union, I don't know on the list.</span> <span id="s1080">But refuseniks that I made on my list most of them have emigrated, have received permission.</span> <span id="s1081">Because they struggled, I think.</span> <span id="s1082">They struggled.</span> <span id="s1083">They bothered the authorities.</span> <span id="s1084">Most of them left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">You know, there is part of refuseniks named poor relatives.</span> <span id="s1086">It's people who cannot receive permission from their relatives.</span> <span id="s1087">If I want to emigrate, I have to receive permission from my parents or a paper where it is written that they are not alive, certificate of death.</span> <span id="s1088">If they are alive, I have to receive permission from them to emigrate.</span> <span id="s1089">If I divorce, and I have a kid, I must receive permission from my [ex]husband.</span> <span id="s1090">So if you have children... So many people cannot receive permission from parents, from spouses.</span> <span id="s1091">They're named "poor relatives."</span> <span id="s1092">There are many refuseniks who cannot receive permission.</span> <span id="s1093">They are in refusal because of this.</span> <span id="s1094">OVIR doesn't let them leave without that permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">(Speaking of families, it is unusual for someone your generation, which is also my generation, in Russia, to have more than two children.</span> <span id="s1096">Sometimes you see people with one child, or two.</span> <span id="s1097">So you really did something...) You're right.</span> <span id="s1098">Among our friends, we were only one family with three children.</span> <span id="s1099">(Why was that?)</span> <span id="s1100">I love children!</span> <span id="s1101">[laughs] (Would you have had more than three if you could have?)</span> <span id="s1102">Yes.</span> <span id="s1103">When my first son was born I said to my husband, "Let's have more."</span> <span id="s1104">He said, "No, I cannot support more!"</span> <span id="s1105">When was my second son born?</span> <span id="s1106">You know, my father died, and I suffered much.</span> <span id="s1107">I loved my father, and he died so suddenly.</span> <span id="s1108">It was so big sorrow, and I cried very often, and my husband decided that I had to have a new baby.</span> <span id="s1109">And it happened and I had a son.</span> <span id="s1110">He was named in honor of my father Vladimir.</span> <span id="s1111">And then we had two kids for Russia, it's enough.</span> <span id="s1112">Two children "Oh, they have two children!"</span> <span id="s1113">Because in Moscow, most people have only one child.</span> <span id="s1114">Maybe now they have two children, maybe it's more common.</span> <span id="s1115">But in my time, common was to have only one child.</span> <span id="s1116">And we had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">If somebody asked me how many children I have and I answer that I have two children, they say, Oh!</span> <span id="s1118">And I say that if I were able, I would have more.</span> <span id="s1119">And it happened.</span> <span id="s1120">I can explain.</span> <span id="s1121">My husband did not want to have more.</span> <span id="s1122">And when I knew I am pregnant I said, "I will."</span> <span id="s1123">So I had a third baby.</span> <span id="s1124">People look and say, "You don't work, you have three children!"</span> <span id="s1125">(This was after the reunion of your department at the institute?)</span> <span id="s1126">This is twentyfive years after we have graduated institute.</span> <span id="s1127">We had a meeting in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1128">There were approximately 70 people.</span> <span id="s1129">Everybody wrote his name, address, phone number, place of job, and how many children he or she has.</span> <span id="s1130">And when I looked at this list I saw that only I had three children.</span> <span id="s1131">The other people have one kid, or two children.</span> <span id="s1132">Nobody but me had three children, because it's a very rare thing in Russia.</span> <span id="s1133">And I was the only one woman who didn't work!</span> <span id="s1134">In the USSR both must work the husband and wife to support the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">(So you had three pregnancies and three children?)</span> <span id="s1136">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1137">(Because some people have many pregnancies...) No, I was healthy so I had three children.</span> <span id="s1138">(But for some people it's not a question of health, it's a question of having an abortion.</span> <span id="s1139">That seems to be from what I can tell, the most common form of birth control in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1140">Did you have access to birth control?)</span> <span id="s1141">We did not want kids... (So you were able to get birth control.)</span> <span id="s1142">Yes.</span> <span id="s1143">Not like here.</span> <span id="s1144">(Some sort of contraceptive was available to you.)</span> <span id="s1145">Time.</span> <span id="s1146">(You planned it.)</span> <span id="s1147">Yes, we planned it.</span> <span id="s1148">I knew, I tried to know the time.</span> <span id="s1149">(So a natural form of prevention where you figured out when you were fertile and when you weren't.)</span> <span id="s1150">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">But when I knew I was pregnant with Michael I said no abortion!</span> <span id="s1152">I will have the kid.</span> <span id="s1153">I was forty years old when I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1154">When I had Michael I was fortyone.</span> <span id="s1155">And when I came to the doctor and she asked me, she said, "No, you're pregnant.</span> <span id="s1156">I think you'll have an abortion."</span> <span id="s1157">I said "No," and she looked at me.</span> <span id="s1158">She was so surprised, because I am forty years old, and says, "At fortyone you want to have a baby!"</span> <span id="s1159">And I just said yes.</span> <span id="s1160">She looked at me like I am crazy!</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">(So when you had the baby, and I ask this question because I know it depends on where you are and who you're with, were you treated well?</span> <span id="s1162">They knew that you were not a young mother...) I felt myself young!</span> <span id="s1163">(Did they treat you well?</span> <span id="s1164">Did you have good care?)</span> <span id="s1165">Yes.</span> <span id="s1166">They worried a little bit, but I had a good delivery.</span> <span id="s1167">Everything was good.</span> <span id="s1168">I remember how the doctor was surprised, because at forty years, they (women) prefer abortions.</span> <span id="s1169">But I said no, even at fifty years I will have a baby!</span> <span id="s1170">I love children!</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">(So you got your baby Michael, you're busy keeping up the list of refuseniks, and you're having visitors now from America and England, and what do these visitors do do they promise you anything, or do they just come to...) They just come and talk.</span> <span id="s1172">You know, it was very big support for us, moral support.</span> <span id="s1173">You cannot imagine it was so big a support.</span> <span id="s1174">Sometimes they could bring a gift.</span> <span id="s1175">Sometimes it was not moral support, it was material support.</span> <span id="s1176">I could sell this thing, for example, a tape recorder.</span> <span id="s1177">But the most support was moral.</span> <span id="s1178">We knew that we were not alone.</span> <span id="s1179">In our struggle, we have support from the outside.</span> <span id="s1180">If, for example, my husband and me, somebody, was arrested, I will call to America, and everybody will know about it.</span> <span id="s1181">When we went to demonstrations, it was not a very pleasant deal.</span> <span id="s1182">But we invited foreign correspondents so their countries can know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">(What happened at a demonstration?)</span> <span id="s1184">I explained to you about support.</span> <span id="s1185">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s1186">Sometimes these people called us from other countries and they could ask us how it's going, how's your refusal.</span> <span id="s1187">(Someone like Marilyn T., made those calls.</span> <span id="s1188">Was she the person who called you?)</span> <span id="s1189">No, she could call to Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1190">It is usual people who visited us and went back to their country they could call us and they wrote us letters.</span> <span id="s1191">It was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s1192">We felt this support.</span> <span id="s1193">We felt that we have many friends out of this country, many friends in America, many friends in England.</span> <span id="s1194">It was very important for us.</span> <span id="s1195">It was not only words.</span> <span id="s1196">Some people could say only polite words.</span> <span id="s1197">"It's very nice to meet you.</span> <span id="s1198">Very nice to talk to you."</span> <span id="s1199">It was real support for us.</span> <span id="s1200">They support our spirit to struggle, to wish, to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">(From 1984 to 1988, you felt that your struggle was not alone, that you were active in the refusenik network creating the list.</span> <span id="s1202">When did you find out you were going to have permission?)</span> <span id="s1203">It was a miracle, because in the Spring we received refusal.</span> <span id="s1204">It was in April we received refusal.</span> <span id="s1205">And my son, Sergey, he applied alone because he decided he can emigrate alone.</span> <span id="s1206">He did not have security job.</span> <span id="s1207">He did not have any secrecy.</span> <span id="s1208">He did not have reason to be refused.</span> <span id="s1209">And he applied alone.</span> <span id="s1210">And at the end of July, he received refusal again on the grounds of secrecy.</span> <span id="s1211">His father's secrecy!</span> <span id="s1212">It was the end of July.</span> <span id="s1213">After that, he went on vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">After vacation, in the beginning of September, he decided to struggle for permission.</span> <span id="s1215">It was September.</span> <span id="s1216">In the beginning he wrote letters, he wrote complaints to Communist Party, to the Supreme Soviet.</span> <span id="s1217">In the beginning of October I was at home.</span> <span id="s1218">I received a call from OVIR and the woman said, "Did you receive refusal?"</span> <span id="s1219">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1220">"Now I think you will receive permission."</span> <span id="s1221">She did not say, "You have permission."</span> <span id="s1222">But, "Now I think soon, maybe, perhaps."</span> <span id="s1223">But I knew it meant permission.</span> <span id="s1224">I immediately said, "Can my husband stop working?"</span> <span id="s1225">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1226">And I understood that it's permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">I called my husband, and I told him we received permission.</span> <span id="s1228">And he said, "You know, I'm talking to my supervisor."</span> <span id="s1229">He had a very good supervisor.</span> <span id="s1230">And maybe it was break for lunch.</span> <span id="s1231">They were talking, and my husband just said to him, "I want to stop working because I don't have time to do my refusenik work."</span> <span id="s1232">He many times said to me, "I must stop working because I have too many jobs in refusenik community that I don't have time to do it.</span> <span id="s1233">I must stop working."</span> <span id="s1234">I said he could not stop working because we needed his salary.</span> <span id="s1235">We had such talks many times.</span> <span id="s1236">When I called him he said, "Just now I said to my supervisor that I want to stop working.</span> <span id="s1237">My wife doesn't let me."</span> <span id="s1238">And I call and say we have permission!</span> <span id="s1239">He stopped working immediately!</span> <span id="s1240">[laughs] And I called my eldest son and I told him we have permission.</span> <span id="s1241">He began to cry!</span> <span id="s1242">He was so glad, because we waited so long to emigrate and it was so sudden.</span> <span id="s1243">(Was he married yet?)</span> <span id="s1244">No, he was not married, but he had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1245">He did not have time to marry.</span> <span id="s1246">(So did they marry here?)</span> <span id="s1247">Yes.</span> <span id="s1248">(But she was able to come?)</span> <span id="s1249">It's a long story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">(So how much time between your learning about this and your departure?)</span> <span id="s1251">It took much time because first of all, it took much time to receive papers, visas from OVIR.</span> <span id="s1252">Then it took much time to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s1253">Now it's a big deal to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s1254">Everything is a problem in Russia.</span> <span id="s1255">So I could buy a ticket only on the end of January.</span> <span id="s1256">So we left January 22, 1989.</span> <span id="s1257">And we arrived here May 11, 1989.</span> <span id="s1258">It

At a Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s1297">I want to be a social worker, for HIAS.</span> <span id="s1298">I applied.</span> <span id="s1299">Just on Monday I had an interview.</span> <span id="s1300">She said she cannot say yes or no because she has many people to interview.</span> <span id="s1301">She doesn't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1302">But maybe I will find a job at a Jewish family service somewhere.</span> <span id="s1303">Because it's the job for me to help people, to arrange for them what they need.</span> <span id="s1304">It was the job I did in Moscow when I was in refusal.</span> <span id="s1305">We had a women's group and other people came and they needed advice and support.</span> <span id="s1306">We did it.</span> <span id="s1307">I did not think much about my activities when I was in the group, but I wanted to give you to read about activities when I was in refusal.</span> <span id="s1308">It's written about... (This is part of your resume, then.)</span> <span id="s1309">Yes.</span> <span id="s1310">It's about my Jewish activities.</span> <span id="s1311">(They list you as being part of the Jewish refusenik

<p><span id="s1314">(This was the center of the refusenik community in Moscow.)</span> <span id="s1315">Yes.</span> <span id="s1316">There were several centers in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1317">One of them was our women's group, because we organized different events for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1318">I'll explain it to you.</span> <span id="s1319">(It says you compiled and maintained a list of known Jewish refuseniks in the USSR.</span> <span id="s1320">You organized the center for refusenik information and mutual support.)</span> <span id="s1321">I can explain this point.</span> <span id="s1322">Before our women's group, there were many refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1323">They were visited by people from other countries because they were refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1324">And some of them tried to struggle, tried to do something, and they tried to go between people who knew each other five, two, seven people who knew each other they could go to demonstrations, to ask authorities something.</span> <span id="s1325">When we organized our women's group and organized a list of refuseniks, it was some kind of Jewish community, because every event, we called everybody.</span> <span id="s1326">I had in my women's group some kind of information center because there were several women.</span> <span id="s1327">I could say, "You will call these people, and you will call these people, and you will call these people."</span> <span id="s1328">And all the people were informed about events.</span> <span id="s1329">We go to demonstration, or we go to Communist party about requirements.</span> <span id="s1330">There were many events, some meetings, and we informed everybody in Moscow, because we had the list, we had the phone numbers of everybody.</span> <span id="s1331">We could inform everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">We had people in other cities who did not have phones.</span> <span id="s1333">I wrote them letters.</span> <span id="s1334">I wrote them letters about how it's going how are you, how is your refusal, did you receive permission.</span> <span id="s1335">They wrote me letters.</span> <span id="s1336">(Were you typing these letters?)</span> <span id="s1337">No, I can't type.</span> <span id="s1338">After I typed "the list" many times, they found computers, and other persons did these lists on computers.</span> <span id="s1339">I did not need to type it with my fingers, because it was necessary to do several copies to give this list to everybody.</span> <span id="s1340">When [J..</span>

don't know how to say, (in the State Department) Yes.</span> <span id="s1348">We had meeting with [Shifter].</span> <span id="s1349">We gave him our list of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1350">We gave this list to every available representative.</span> <span id="s1351">I think Reagan had this list of refuseniks who wanted to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">(Was this at the first meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev?)</span> <span id="s1353">Yes, it was the first meeting in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1354">I want to say about [...].</span> <span id="s1355">We could inform everybody in Moscow about events, and sometimes we informed other people in other cities, and they could come.</span> <span id="s1356">Sometimes they come to Moscow to the demonstrations.</span> <span id="s1357">(So weren't these demonstrations risky?)</span> <span id="s1358">Yes, it was risky.</span> <span id="s1359">Years ago it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1360">You could be sent to prison.</span> <span id="s1361">But times changed.</span> <span id="s1362">From the meeting of Gorbachev and Reagan in America, it was December, 1987.</span> <span id="s1363">There was a big demonstration in Washington, maybe 200,000 do you remember this demonstration?</span> <span id="s1364">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s1365">There was a demonstration in Moscow too, the same day, December 6th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">(This was rallying for the refuseniks, for people who wished to leave the USSR.)</span> <span id="s1367">Yes, it was a big demonstration of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1368">You know, from this time there were many demonstrations.</span> <span id="s1369">Sometimes, it depended on the situation.</span> <span id="s1370">The militia was always around.</span> <span id="s1371">Sometimes they did nothing, just watched.</span> <span id="s1372">Sometimes they took you to the militia.</span> <span id="s1373">(They arrested people?)</span> <span id="s1374">Yes, they arrested people and took them on a bus and drove you to the militia and forced you to write why you were at the demonstration, where is your slogan.</span> <span id="s1375">It depended on the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">For example, on December 6, they did not take people to the militia, because there were many, many foreign correspondents.</span> <span id="s1377">That was why.</span> <span id="s1378">When it was big demonstration in January 1988, they did not take people to the militia either.</span> <span id="s1379">Why?</span> <span id="s1380">Because there in Moscow was a big delegation of human rights Helsinki, you know.</span> <span id="s1381">(Helsinki Watch?)</span> <span id="s1382">I forgot this name.</span> <span id="s1383">They were representatives of this Helsinki committee.</span> <span id="s1384">They watched this demonstration, so the militia did not arrest us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">(So in the winter you bundle up...) I said it depends.</span> <span id="s1386">We had several demonstrations when were arrested and taken to the militia.</span> <span id="s1387">(You were arrested?)</span> <span id="s1388">Yes, several times.</span> <span id="s1389">But I said, either they arrest or they don't arrest it depends on the situation.</span> <span id="s1390">When Reagan came and we had demonstrations, we were not arrested, and we had demonstrations of only women and children.</span> <span id="s1391">Michael participated, too, because on June 1, in Russia, it's Children's Defense Day.</span> <span id="s1392">On this day our group organized a demonstration of only women and children near OVIR.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">The militia brought buses we knew these special buses in which we are placed when arrested, and then driven to the militia.</span> <span id="s1394">I saw these buses, but they did not use them, because only children and women, and many correspondents because it was June 1, and Reagan was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1395">So it depends on the situation.</span> <span id="s1396">But they would arrest us, put us in a bus, bring us to the militia, keep us in the militia several hours.</span> <span id="s1397">Of course they force us to write this.</span> <span id="s1398">We never wrote anything.</span> <span id="s1399">Once I was brought to court.</span> <span id="s1400">They charged me ten rubles for illegal demonstration.</span> <span id="s1401">I said it's not fair.</span> <span id="s1402">In the militia they searched for my slogan.</span> <span id="s1403">I brought my slogans here.</span> <span id="s1404">I can show you my slogans.</span> <span id="s1405">(This was Michael's.)</span> <span id="s1406">"I am the same age as my refusal."</span> <span id="s1407">(He was nine years old then.)</span> <span id="s1408">He was nine years old.</span> <span id="s1409">When he was born he became a refusenik.</span> <span id="s1410">I had several slogans.</span> <span id="s1411">(It's a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s1412">And ink.</span> <span id="s1413">And Michael's is a pale pink on white, and yours is a brown, and in Russian it says.</span> <span id="s1414">.)</span> <span id="s1415">It's written, "Ten years without secrecy.</span> <span id="s1416">How long will we have to wait?"</span> <span id="s1417">What secrecy?</span> <span id="s1418">Ten years passed.</span> <span id="s1419">Secrecy finished ten years ago, how much longer to wait!!</span> <span id="s1420">It was one slogan.</span> <span id="s1421">I have another one.</span> <span id="s1422">I put my slogan on my neck.</span> <span id="s1423">(It's on old linen.)</span> <span id="s1424">I was taken to the militia.</span> <span id="s1425">Nobody could find it.</span> <span id="s1426">I'd put it under my coat.</span> <span id="s1427">They did not know where my slogan was.</span> <span id="s1428">They tried to find my slogan.</span> <span id="s1429">Because usually they took everybody's slogan and tore them, but they saw them.</span> <span id="s1430">But they searched me they searched my purse.</span> <span id="s1431">"Where is your slogan?"</span> <span id="s1432">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1433">I lost it because..."

So it was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">We found friends, they were religious friends, refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1576">They took us to people who knew a doctor that did it.</span> <span id="s1577">One doctor did this operation, he was a surgeon.</span> <span id="s1578">He worked in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1579">(He was a refusenik?)</span> <span id="s1580">He was a refusenik, but now I don't know his last name.</span> <span id="s1581">Everybody called him only his first name because it was underground.</span> <span id="s1582">We met in our apartment.</span> <span id="s1583">Several people from the synagogue were present.</span> <span id="s1584">When it was my children, my husband present in that room.</span> <span id="s1585">We had a very big table.</span> <span id="s1586">(A surgical table?)</span> <span id="s1587">No, it was our dining table.</span> <span id="s1588">(They used it as a surgical table?)</span> <span id="s1589">Yes.</span> <span id="s1590">It was wide and long.</span> <span id="s1591">We put a big tablecloth on it.</span> <span id="s1592">The doctor brought his instruments, everything.</span> <span id="s1593">We closed the door.</span> <span id="s1594">We did not open the door because it was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">And after that, I don't know, because I was in another room, they said several "Bracha" after that.</span> <span id="s1596">And we had "L'chaim."</span> <span id="s1597">How to say, it was made with tradition and religion.</span> <span id="s1598">It was not a simple operation like in hospital.</span> <span id="s1599">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s1600">It was not one day.</span> <span id="s1601">My husband had it and my children too, later.</span> <span id="s1602">It was twice in our house.</span> <span id="s1603">(What year was it?)</span> <span id="s1604">My husband, it was 1984.</span> <span id="s1605">And my children, in one year.</span> <span id="s1606">When my husband wanted to do it he asked my children if they wanted to.</span> <span id="s1607">They said no.</span> <span id="s1608">In one year they said it to my husband themselves, "I want to do it."</span> <span id="s1609">Both of them said it.</span> <span id="s1610">In one year!</span> <span id="s1611">My husband did not ask them.</span> <span id="s1612">So, it took place in our apartment twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">It was not only my husband or my kids.</span> <span id="s1614">As usual when this doctor did it in somebody's apartment, there are many people who are there.</span> <span id="s1615">The first time when my husband did it, in our apartment there were people from Leningrad, Batumi, from Moscow, from Yerevan.</span> <span id="s1616">(Where?)</span> <span id="s1617">Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.</span> <span id="s1618">And they came to Moscow especially to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">And when my sons had it done, there were several people from other cities and from Moscow, too.</span> <span id="s1620">Because it was necessary to have good operating room.</span> <span id="s1621">(Did they have any kind of anesthesia?)</span> <span id="s1622">Yes, sure!</span> <span id="s1623">(What was it, a local injection?)</span> <span id="s1624">Yes!</span> <span id="s1625">He's a surgeon.</span> <span id="s1626">He said he cannot do it any other way.</span> <span id="s1627">He was an excellent surgeon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">(So that was really a major transition for the family.</span> <span id="s1629">That was an enormous commitment.</span> <span id="s1630">They weren't just rendering lipservice to this.</span> <span id="s1631">They really completed the covenant, so to speak.)</span> <span id="s1632">When my husband had the circumcision it was very funny?</span> <span id="s1633">Not funny, scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">To show how it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1635">It had to be in another apartment.</span> <span id="s1636">In the apartment of our friend, his son had to have it.</span> <span id="s1637">He had some medical problems and he wanted....</span> <span id="s1638">He was eight, maybe.</span> <span id="s1639">But it was necessary to do.</span> <span id="s1640">If people knew that it will be in his apartment... It was far away from our house.</span> <span id="s1641">You had to take public transportation to get there.</span> <span id="s1642">And everybody, several persons who are going to have this circumcision, they knew this address.</span> <span id="s1643">They came there, the doctor came.</span> <span id="s1644">And these old men from synagogue came.</span> <span id="s1645">Suddenly some foreign people came to visit this refusenik family.</span> <span id="s1646">It became very dangerous to do it in this house, and they changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">My husband called me and said, "We're coming to our apartment.</span> <span id="s1648">Prepare something quickly!"</span> <span id="s1649">So the husband stayed at home to talk with the visiting people and the mother took her kid, and everybody took taxi and came to our apartment.</span> <span id="s1650">Many people came because they were afraid to do it in that apartment, because if foreign people came, the militia or KGB could come anything could happen.</span> <span id="s1651">They changed the apartment immediately.</span> <span id="s1652">They started the operation later in our apartment.</span> <span id="s1653">(The father was sort of like a decoy.</span> <span id="s1654">So he was not present at the circumcision?)</span> <span id="s1655">He was visited by people.</span> <span id="s1656">Mother took care of the kid.</span> <span id="s1657">(Those are powerful experiences.)</span> <span id="s1658">(When we ended our discussion last time there were some interesting stories you said you wanted to tell me.</span> <span id="s1659">You said you knew people, Russians, who looked Jewish, and because they looked Jewish, they were treated like Jews.</span> <span id="s1660">And then you said there were Jews who looked Russian, and therefore passed as Russian, and didn't have many of the problems that...) They did have problems... (But in a different way...) For example, many people couldn't recognize that I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s1661">They thought I was Russian because I am light.</span> <span id="s1662">And Jews in Moscow, they look different.</span> <span id="s1663">Most of them have black hair.</span> <span id="s1664">People didn't think I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1665">It was very funny when I tried to find a job because many Americans say, "It's hard to find a job in America too."</span> <span id="s1666">American people say it's hard to find a job because there are many people who want to find a job and there aren't many positions.</span> <span id="s1667">But in Russia it's quite the opposite.</span> <span id="s1668">There are many positions.</span> <span id="s1669">If somebody applies for this position, usually he is admitted.</span> <span id="s1670">When I tried to find a job, first of all, while we are talking he's very glad.</span> <span id="s1671">He explains to me what I will do, what my job will be.</span> <span id="s1672">After that he tells me to write the application.</span> <span id="s1673">I write it, and his face just [changed].</span> <span id="s1674">He says to call in two weeks.</span> <span id="s1675">In two weeks I call.</span> <span id="s1676">"No, we found another person.</span> <span id="s1677">We don't need more."</span> <span id="s1678">It was many, many times with me and with my friends who looked not like Jew, but like Russian.</span> <span id="s1679">Sometimes something could help.</span> <span id="s1680">For example, my husband's brother had a friend.</span> <span id="s1681">He had absolutely Russian appearance, but he had a Jewish last name.</span> <span id="s1682">Maybe Katz or something.</span> <span id="s1683">He married a Russian woman and took her last name.</span> <span id="s1684">With a Russian face and a Russian last name, he did very good, I think.</span> <span id="s1685">(He had a good career?)</span> <span id="s1686">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1687">(What did he do?)</span> <span id="s1688">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1689">I knew this story because my husband's brother told it many times, like a very bright example!</span> <span id="s1690">It was his friend.</span> <span id="s1691">(Did he totally assimilate?</span> <span id="s1692">He denied his Jewishness?)</span> <span id="s1693">Maybe he was Jew in passport.</span> <span id="s1694">But as usual in documents and at work it is usual to pay attention to the name.</span> <span id="s1695">Only when you change your work you fill out application.</span> <span id="s1696">If you work at the same place, it's important name.</span> <span id="s1697">(It seems like their children's passports would still say "evrei" because their father was Jewish.)</span> <span id="s1698">No, no.</span> <span id="s1699">They can take the mother's nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">When you go to receive passport, when you are sixteen.</span> <span id="s1701">You take a special application to the housing office where you live.</span> <span id="s1702">They send this application to the militia.</span> <span id="s1703">You fill out this application and you write which nationality you want.</span> <span id="s1704">You take your mother's or your father's passport.</span> <span id="s1705">Moreover, if your mother and father have different nationality, they want you to write Russian, not Jew.</span> <span id="s1706">I remember I had a friend.</span> <span id="s1707">He was Jewish and his wife was Russian.</span> <span id="s1708">For his first son was written "Russian", but for the second son, he wanted to write "Jewish".</span> <span id="s1709">When he went to the housing office [housing authority], and he writes Jew, they began to persuade him, and they put him to sign this paper several times.</span> <span id="s1710">They didn't want to write in Jewish.</span> <span id="s1711">Maybe they want to turn Jews into Russians?</span> <span id="s1712">I don't know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">But my friend, quite the opposite, she was absolutely Russian, but she had Jewish appearance, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1714">And once I said to her, "Anna, you look like Jew."</span> <span id="s1715">And she said, "I know it!</span> <span id="s1716">I've had many troubles at my work."</span> <span id="s1717">(Did she give you any examples?)</span> <span id="s1718">She did not want to discuss it.</span> <span id="s1719">You know, for Russians it's offensive to feel themselves Jewish, to have troubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">(What happened when you finally got your invitation?</span> <span id="s1721">Did you get one from Israel or the U.S. to get your visa?)</span> <span id="s1722">From Israel.</span> <span id="s1723">Now you can receive one from America if you apply to OVIR.</span> <span id="s1724">But a couple of years ago, you could apply only for an Israel visa.</span> <span id="s1725">They forced many people, not just Jewish, but Russian, Lithuanian, to receive invitation from Israel.</span> <span id="s1726">Maybe the authority wanted to consider them like Jews, to count like Jewish.</span> <span id="s1727">I don't know why, but there was only one way to receive invitation from Israel.</span> <span id="s1728">I knew many people, not Jewish, they received the invitation from Israel.</span> <span id="s1729">They left for America, for Australia, where they wanted, for Europe.</span> <span id="s1730">But they must have an invitation from Israel only Israel.</span> <span id="s1731">And one point more, for example: we had a friend, a refusenik, his daughter lived in Australia.</span> <span id="s1732">He received an invitation from his daughter, but they said no.</span> <span id="s1733">You can apply only for an Israel visa.</span> <span id="s1734">Why?</span> <span id="s1735">I can't explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Second point.</span> <span id="s1737">If you're going to go to Australia, America, Europe, if you receive an invitation from any country, not from Israel, and you receive permission from authorities, OVIR gives you a foreign passport.</span> <span id="s1738">You are Soviet citizen with foreign passport.</span> <span id="s1739">You can live abroad.</span> <span id="s1740">If you receive invitation from Israel and you apply and you want to go to Israel, and you're a Soviet citizen, they don't give you a passport, they give you only paper, a visa.</span> <span id="s1741">You are deprived of Soviet citizenship.</span> <span id="s1742">Moreover, you must pay for it.</span> <span id="s1743">When they give you permission, you must pay 500 rubles for being deprived of citizenship!</span> <span id="s1744">So we could receive an invitation only from Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">(So you received your invitation?)</span> <span id="s1746">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1747">(Who sent it to you?)</span> <span id="s1748">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1749">It's written name.</span> <span id="s1750">After that, we received many invitations from another person.</span> <span id="s1751">We didn't know, because we didn't have relatives.</span> <span id="s1752">(Was this done through the Council on Soviet Jewry, do you think?)</span> <span id="s1753">No, it's from Israel.</span> <span id="s1754">Somebody arranges it, to send it to people who don't have relatives in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">(You got your invitation, then what happened...) Then we applied to OVIR.</span> <span id="s1756">(This is after being refused several times.</span> <span id="s1757">How many times were you refused?)</span> <span id="s1758">You know, the first time we applied, we got refusal.</span> <span id="s1759">After that, every six months you have the right to apply again to OVIR.</span> <span id="s1760">"I want to emigrate, my desire did not change, and I ask you to discuss my papers and give me permission."</span> <span id="s1761">If there is any change, you send a paper... For example, when my mother died, we sent a copy of her death certificate.</span> <span id="s1762">Every change, we sent them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">When my son graduated from school, we must change everything.</span> <span id="s1764">It was funny when he graduated from school.</span> <span id="s1765">When he turned sixteen and received a passport, he had to bring a new application, because the application is only for person who has passport.</span> <span id="s1766">And my elder son did not have passport.</span> <span id="s1767">We had application only for my husband, my mother and me.</span> <span id="s1768">When my son turned sixteen, he must do his own application.</span> <span id="s1769">But he was in school.</span> <span id="s1770">When I brought it in, OVIR said they couldn't take this application.</span> <span id="s1771">They said, "He must go to school and receive papers from school."</span> <span id="s1772">I explained to you how everybody had to receive papers from work.</span> <span id="s1773">It's written: "this guy works here.</span> <span id="s1774">He doesn't have debts.</span> <span id="s1775">We know he's going to emigrate to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1776">The same paper will be given to your son in the school.</span> <span id="s1777">If he's a member of Komsomol, they have to eliminate him."</span> <span id="s1778">I said, "He's not a Komsomolets!"</span> <span id="s1779">She said, "If he's a komsomolets, he has to be eliminated!"</span> <span id="s1780">I said it again!</span> <span id="s1781">Three times she said it.</span> <span id="s1782">"We need this special paper from the school that he doesn't have debts."</span> <span id="s1783">"Why this paper?"</span> <span id="s1784">"Because everybody in this school has to know that he wants to emigrate to Israel."</span> <span id="s1785">Especially, she said just to me in OVIR, this woman.</span> <span id="s1786">So he did not fill this application when he studied in school.</span> <span id="s1787">And he didn't fill it in.</span> <span id="s1788">After this time!</span> <span id="s1789">In a short period between school and institute!</span> <span id="s1790">(Because he went to institute.)</span> <span id="s1791">When he graduated school, for a short time he did not study at school, he didn't study at the institute.</span> <span id="s1792">So he filled this paper, this application.</span> <span id="s1793">He brought it to OVIR.</span> <span id="s1794">After that he went to institute, so he didn't have to bring papers from institute.</span> <span id="s1795">Only after he graduated institute and began to work only at this time.</span> <span id="s1796">He could apply again.</span> <span id="s1797">Because if he went to institute to ask for this paper....</span> <span id="s1798">it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1799">We had to find different ways!</span> <span id="s1800">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">(What was the date when you got that invitation?)</span> <span id="s1802">Invitation?</span> <span id="s1803">We received several invitations from Israel.</span> <span id="s1804">(So the last invitation was where they finally responded?)</span> <span id="s1805">No, they actually did not need new invitation.</span> <span id="s1806">The invitation lasts only six months.</span> <span id="s1807">After that you need to receive a new invitation.</span> <span id="s1808">We have a new invitation.</span> <span id="s1809">Because if you receive one, you can receive several.</span> <span id="s1810">The last we received in 1988.</span> <span id="s1811">(Then how long did the processing take?</span> <span id="s1812">Did you know at this point that this invitation was the one that was going to...) No.</span> <span id="s1813">When we were refused, it was not so important, this day.</span> <span id="s1814">It was not very important.</span> <span id="s1815">Because we are refuseniks.</span> <span id="s1816">For example, the last refusal we received was on April 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">After that, my eldest son applied alone.</span> <span id="s1818">He received invitation and applied alone and received refusal at the end of July on the grounds of secrecy.</span> <span id="s1819">In October we received a call from OVIR and she said we had permission.</span> <span id="s1820">The date of invitation was not important for us because we were refuseniks and we fight it.</span> <span id="s1821">There was only one way to receive permission, and that was to fight, to be inconvenient for authorities.</span> <span id="s1822">It was the only way for a refusenik to receive permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">We have an example.</span> <span id="s1824">It was some refuseniks, they were very silent.</span> <span id="s1825">They did not fight, and they did not receive permission.</span> <span id="s1826">But everybody who fought on my list, most of them received permission.</span> <span id="s1827">There are new refuseniks now, but I don't know the reasons, because I'm here.</span> <span id="s1828">The people who were on that list, they fought it and they received permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">(So you're still in touch with friends in Moscow?)</span> <span id="s1830">[shakes head no.]</span> <span id="s1831">(No?</span> <span id="s1832">Everyone you're close to is out?)</span> <span id="s1833">Yeah, everybody emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">(Now you're here.</span> <span id="s1835">I know that you were helped by the rabbi of the Oak Park Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1836">That was a major thing.</span> <span id="s1837">Obviously, somehow you're connected to the JCC.</span> <span id="s1838">I know that Gennady goes there and Michael goes there.</span> <span id="s1839">That makes us feel good.)</span> <span id="s1840">Yes.</span> <span id="s1841">Shalom school.</span> <span id="s1842">He attends public school.</span> <span id="s1843">My son has some Jewish education, Jewish feeling, traditions, he has to know something, to feel himself Jew.</span> <span id="s1844">We explained much.</span> <span id="s1845">I think if we move somewhere, certainly he will attend Jewish school or day school.</span> <span id="s1846">It depends on the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1847">We're going to move to Oak Park very soon.</span> <span id="s1848">The school is in the synagogue it Jewish day school four times a week.</span> <span id="s1849">(It is a Jewish day school or after school?)</span> <span id="s1850">After school.</span> <span id="s1851">(The day school is a full program.)</span> <span id="s1852">No, not a full program like in the north suburbs, no.</span> <span id="s1853">After school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">(In different ways I've asked this question, but I want to hear how you would say this.</span> <span id="s1855">You've been through so much, and there many families who came out of Russia who say Russian, and it just says Jewish on the passport, but so what?</span> <span id="s1856">But you have a stronger identification with being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1857">Why do you have this identification?)</span> <span id="s1858">We want to know that we have roots.</span> <span id="s1859">We think that we have.</span> <span id="s1860">We are very proud to be Jewish, of international Jews, how they helped us.</span> <span id="s1861">They helped us very much.</span> <span id="s1862">I told how they helped us, our spirit.</span> <span id="s1863">Not only spirit.</span> <span id="s1864">They wrote us letters.</span> <span id="s1865">They tried to get us permission.</span> <span id="s1866">They fought for us.</span> <span id="s1867">(So you felt these people cared about you.</span> <span id="s1868">And you knew that it wasn't just a surface thing.</span> <span id="s1869">You knew it had to do with roots.)</span> <span id="s1870">And I feel that Jews, I was very proud, I felt that they feel like Jews, that they helped people.</span> <span id="s1871">They helped not only us.</span> <span id="s1872">They fought for refuseniks, for other Jews in Russia.</span> <span id="s1873">We felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">(So the identification is almost something mystical you can't really explain it.</span> <span id="s1875">You could just say you got help from these people, but there's something much deeper than that.</span> <span id="s1876">You could've had the help without the circumcisions, for example.</span> <span id="s1877">You didn't have to go that far.)</span> <span id="s1878">It was only the idea to prove to himself "I am Jew."</span> <span id="s1879">We knew several persons who came from other cities.</span> <span id="s1880">One came from Batumitz, Georgia.</span> <span id="s1881">South.</span> <span id="s1882">He did not need it.</span> <span id="s1883">He wanted it, because he is Jew.</span> <span id="s1884">He has Russian name.</span> <span id="s1885">But he wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">(What did you do to keep your family strong and together?)</span> <span id="s1887">I don't know!</span> <span id="s1888">I loved them!</span> <span id="s1889">We were together.</span> <span id="s1890">We were sticking together.</span> <span id="s1891">We explained everything.</span> <span id="s1892">We discussed everything.</span> <span id="s1893">Not only relatives, we were friends with our children and to each other.</span> <span id="s1894">My mother, when we applied in the beginning, she did not want.</span> <span id="s1895">She was so afraid.</span> <span id="s1896">"Don't say this on the phone!</span> <span id="s1897">You will be imprisoned!"</span> <span id="s1898">We explained to her, we got her to read Exodus, you know.</span> <span id="s1899">We tried to explain it to her, not to force her.</span> <span id="s1900">To make her feel the same, think the same.</span> <span id="s1901">She's Jewish.</span> <span id="s1902">I was so scared for her.</span> <span id="s1903">But she died in 1984.</span> <span id="s1904">I made the mistake about the circumcisions my husband was in 1983, and my children in 1984.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">(Were there surprises when you came here?)</span> <span id="s1906">Everything surprised me.</span> <span id="s1907">(What did you expect?)</span> <span id="s1908">About feelings, about how it looks, what?</span> <span id="s1909">People?</span> <span id="s1910">I like the people.</span> <span id="s1911">Chicago people are friendly.</span> <span id="s1912">Every day I'm surprised.</span> <span id="s1913">Bus drivers, train drivers.</span> <span id="s1914">They open doors.</span> <span id="s1915">People in Russia!</span> <span id="s1916">Never!</span> <span id="s1917">You run to the bus.</span> <span id="s1918">He sees you and shuts the door and goes!</span> <span id="s1919">You can't imagine.</span> <span id="s1920">I walk with baby and everybody says, "Hi!"</span> <span id="s1921">, and smiles.</span> <span id="s1922">People are friendly.</span> <span id="s1923">You cannot compare with Russians.</span> <span id="s1924">They are very angry, evil to each other.</span> <span id="s1925">Evil is the right word.</span> <span id="s1926">In transport they hurry, they push.</span> <span id="s1927">They're very unfriendly in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">People here are friendly they never scold each other.</span> <span id="s1929">Rarely?</span> <span id="s1930">But I didn't hear it, I go to the store, sometimes wait in a long line.</span> <span id="s1931">Nobody goes without line.</span> <span id="s1932">In Russia, everybody wants to be first.</span> <span id="s1933">Nobody just stays in line silent.</span> <span id="s1934">(So that was a surprise for you.)</span> <span id="s1935">Yeah, because we were told that in America people are mean to each other, that Chicago is a very bad city, many factories, no trees.</span> <span id="s1936">In Chicago, there are many plants, in general, in residential areas!</span> <span id="s1937">Many trees, parks.</span> <span id="s1938">We were so surprised!</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">(Were you disappointed about some things here?)</span> <span id="s1940">No.</span> <span id="s1941">No, no.</span> <span id="s1942">Honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">(What do you miss from Russia?)</span> <span id="s1944">Only language.</span> <span id="s1945">Only language, understanding language.</span> <span id="s1946">I would like to understand everything.</span> <span id="s1947">Like cinema, like books, to read.</span> <span id="s1948">I cannot do it here.</span> <span id="s1949">To feel language, not to understand only, but to feel idioms, everything you said, not just to understand.</span> <span id="s1950">I can say a word, but I can't feel its impression exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">(What are your hopes for the children here?)</span> <span id="s1952">They will have their own choice.</span> <span id="s1953">They will have what they want to do, to study, to live, because in Russia they could go only to this institute, not where they wanted.</span> <span id="s1954">Only the institute that admits Jews.</span> <span id="s1955">There were several institutes in Moscow only technicians.</span> <span id="s1956">I think my son will tell you the story about how he tried to enter Moscow University.</span> <span id="s1957">He studied physics and chemistry.</span> <span id="s1958">He was very bright.</span> <span id="s1959">He could not study in Moscow University.</span> <span id="s1960">He had to go to another institute and change his profession.</span> <span id="s1961">It was upsetting for me.</span> <span id="s1962">I started to cry when I told this story, because he was such a good boy.</span> <span id="s1963">For years he went to special classes.</span> <span id="s1964">He was a very successful student.</span> <span id="s1965">At school, but something he attends twice a week.</span> <span id="s1966">Many different classes for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">He was very bright and he couldn't go to the university.</span> <span id="s1968">So he turned to be a mathematician.</span> <span id="s1969">He's smart and bright.</span> <span id="s1970">Now he's a graduate student at the University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1971">He received his Master's degree, and now he's working on his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1972">Maybe he would have chosen something else?</span> <span id="s1973">I remember when he began to study mathematics in his institute, he would say, "If we go, nevertheless, I'll turn back to chemistry, biochemistry and physics."</span> <span id="s1974">It's sad because he became a mathematician and now it's hard to change it.</span> <span id="s1975">But he says maybe he'll study physics later.</span> <span id="s1976">Vladimir?</span> <span id="s1977">When he graduated school there was only one way, to go to the institute and study applied mathematics.</span> <span id="s1978">He was very successful.</span> <span id="s1979">Now he is at the University of Illinois studying liberal arts.</span> <span id="s1980">I can't explain.</span> <span id="s1981">He didn't have choice in Russia.</span> <span id="s1982">Here he has choice.</span> <span id="s1983">They will do what they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">I want to make some comments about some things I said last time.</span> <span id="s1985">Maybe it will be interesting for you, what I was afraid of.</span> <span id="s1986">I said when we went to demonstrations I was afraid they will beat.</span> <span id="s1987">But most of all, I was afraid that my son will be taken to army.</span> <span id="s1988">(I did not tell about it.)</span> <span id="s1989">Because it's not the American army.</span> <span id="s1990">(Sergey and Vladimir?)</span> <span id="s1991">Yes.</span> <span id="s1992">It's worse than prison.</span> <span id="s1993">Some people prefer to send sons to prison, because he refused to go to army, than to send him to army.</span> <span id="s1994">Because in the army they can be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">I knew two examples.</span> <span id="s1996">I worked in the same room with a woman whose son, who was Jewish, was killed in the army.</span> <span id="s1997">And when I asked her if she found out what happened, she said no.</span> <span id="s1998">She didn't want to find out.</span> <span id="s1999">He was standing and somebody shot him.</span> <span id="s2000">(Not during battle or anything....) No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">The second example, in 1990, this last summer, my friend, she's absolutely Russian.</span> <span id="s2002">She had two sons.</span> <span id="s2003">The elder one was in the army.</span> <span id="s2004">He was killed this past summer, in 1990.</span> <span id="s2005">(So this had nothing to do with being Jewish...) The army is dangerous... (For Jew or nonJew...) Yes.</span> <span id="s2006">Army is dangerous.</span> <span id="s2007">You may be killed because of relationships.</span> <span id="s2008">In the army it's very bad.</span> <span id="s2009">One story: There are two different Islamic lines.</span> <span id="s2010">So in Russia, Azerbaijan and Uzbeks.</span> <span id="s2011">It's like Iraq and Iran.</span> <span id="s2012">There was a big fight.</span> <span id="s2013">They killed each other.</span> <span id="s2014">They said to Russians, not Muslims, you will lie there.</span> <span id="s2015">We won't touch you.</span> <span id="s2016">And they killed each other.</span> <span id="s2017">Many people preferred prison.</span> <span id="s2018">And we were refuseniks.</span> <span id="s2019">It was more dangerous, because after army, we would receive new refusal on the grounds of secrecy.</span> <span id="s2020">So we were very afraid of the army.</span> <span id="s2021">(That was your biggest fear after all, that your sons would go to the army...) Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">(Other comments?)</span> <span id="s2023">About the women's group.</span> <span id="s2024">Our women's group was organized by Judith Ratner in 1987.</span> <span id="s2025">She lives in Israel now.</span> <span id="s2026">She's an activist.</span> <span id="s2027">She's a chemist, I guess.</span> <span id="s2028">There are several women who began this event.</span> <span id="s2029">But after demonstration in December, most women received permission.</span> <span id="s2030">Maybe one or two remained from this group.</span> <span id="s2031">(Of what year?)</span> <span id="s2032">1987.</span> <span id="s2033">December was demonstration.</span> <span id="s2034">So when I came there and began to make lists of refuseniks, there are many new women in this group.</span> <span id="s2035">Now this group exists, I guess.</span> <span id="s2036">What I wanted to say I was not the first organizer.</span> <span id="s2037">But what I made, I made lists, some kind of information center.</span> <span id="s2038">I was not one leader of women's group.</span> <span id="s2039">I'm shy to say so.</span> <span id="s2040">But it was some kind of committee.</span> <span id="s2041">We decided what do to, what we were talking about, what to write.</span> <span id="s2042">But why I said I was a leader of women's group.</span> <span id="s2043">First of all, it was in my apartment.</span> <span id="s2044">Second, everybody called me and I called everybody.</span> <span id="s2045">Everything went through me.</span> <span id="s2046">If they wanted to know something, they called me.</span> <span id="s2047">We prepared what to say, we had meetings twice every month.</span> <span id="s2048">I was like chairman.</span> <span id="s2049">But it's not like I was leader of Communist party!</span> <span id="s2050">We had a committee.</span> <span id="s2051">I wasn't the only leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">(What do you hope for yourself?)</span> <span id="s2053">Here?</span> <span id="s2054">I want to find a job, to work.</span> <span id="s2055">I can't even say to earn much money.</span> <span id="s2056">I want to do something useful.</span> <span id="s2057">(You knew you were part of the pulse of what was happening in the refusenik community and you'd like to be with the pulse here...) When was election, you vote for Democrat or Republican, for Hartigan or Edgar.</span> <span id="s2058">I know Jewish vote for Democrats, no?</span> <span id="s2059">(In this particular case I think they were both decent men.</span> <span id="s2060">And there were Jews working for both of them.</span> <span id="s2061">I know that Hartigan had been helpful and had been a guest at a JCC function.</span> <span id="s2062">But one of the leaders of the federation was very close to Edgar, so I think...) Because I wrote an article about Hartigan and when he was asked why he chose politics, he said only politics and the church helps people.</span> <span id="s2063">And I can't do medicine, but I want to help people too.</span> <span id="s2064">I can't be a politician, but I want to help people.</span> <span id="s2065">I said Michael can be a doctor to help people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">(So you're interested in doing some sort of social work?)</span> <span id="s2067">Yes.</span> <span id="s2068">It's my dream to drive.</span> <span id="s2069">I have bad vision, but I'll try.</span> <span id="s2070">I have to take the tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">(You are talking about moving to Oak Park.)</span> <span id="s2072">It's close to my husband's work.</span> <span id="s2073">It's a Jewish area.</span> <span id="s2074">There is a synagogue and Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">(Is there something I didn't ask or something you'd like to talk about at this point?</span> <span id="s2076">Do you feel we've covered the important things?)</span> <span id="s2077">Maybe something we did not say, but we will talk with my husband, and maybe he will say.</span> <span id="s2078">And my son.</span> <span id="s2079">He can tell many stories about Jewish things at his institute, but his own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">(Are any of the refusenik women you know here in Chicago?)</span> <span id="s2081">Yes, but they don't work like refuseniks.</span> <span id="s2082">Yes.</span> <span id="s2083">Not many, but yes.</span> <span id="s2084">Because when I was leaving, I gave all lists, many papers I gave to another woman.</span> <span id="s2085">In a few months she received permission and she gave them to another woman.</span> <span id="s2086">Now she lives in Chicago.</span> <span id="s2087">So I don't know where all documents and lists are.</span> <span id="s2088">I want to work, but I don't know quite how to do it here.</span> <span id="s2089">It can be done in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">We lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s2091">Once I was standing on the balcony and watching my sons walking to school.</span> <span id="s2092">After them there were walking two guys, two schoolboys, and one boy says to another boy, "Look: big Jew and small Jew" about my two sons!</span> <span id="s2093">I can't believe I'm hearing it.</span> <span id="s2094">They're small!</span> <span id="s2095">We say, "with mother's milk".</span> <span id="s2096">My sons began to play chess at maybe ten years old.</span> <span id="s2097">The other boy says, "I will have red and you will have blue, because Israel has blue color (on the flag).</span> <span id="s2098">And I am Russian, so I get the red figures."</span> <span id="s2099">I asked Sergey, "How did he know that you are Jew?"</span> <span id="s2100">He said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s2101">* * * * Evgeny and Lidia's story as told by Sulamith: In the Ukraine, in Dnepropetrovsk there are many Jews.</span> <span id="s2102">It's an antisemitic place.</span> <span id="s2103">There are no foreigners.</span> <span id="s2104">Closed cities.</span> <span id="s2105">So authority could do what they wanted.</span> <span id="s2106">In Moscow, in Leningrad, there are foreigners, journalists.</span> <span id="s2107">I told you about the demonstrations.</span> <span id="s2108">We always hoped that there would be journalists.</span> <span id="s2109">We invited them.</span> <span id="s2110">They were somehow our defense.</span> <span id="s2111">Eyewitnesses....</span> <span id="s2112">They saw, they took pictures.</span> <span id="s2113">So we knew we are not alone.</span> <span id="s2114">They had eyes.</span> <span id="s2115">But in the Ukraine the authorities could do what they wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">(What year is this we're talking about?)</span> <span id="s2117">S..</span> <span id="s2118">.</span> <span id="s2119">years.</span> <span id="s2120">He is Jewish, her husband, Evgenii.</span> <span id="s2121">He didn't finish any high education, college, but he's a pretty smart guy.</span> <span id="s2122">I don't know exactly his occupation, but in general he is a poet.</span> <span id="s2123">He visited Moscow, Leningrad.</span> <span id="s2124">He knew many poets, dissidents.</span> <span id="s2125">He was some kind of freethinker.</span> <span id="s2126">He wrote poems but did not publish.</span> <span id="s2127">And now he has many poems Jewish....</span> <span id="s2128">I don't know about what he wrote before.</span> <span id="s2129">He's a poet.</span> <span id="s2130">Erudite.</span> <span id="s2131">So he was some kind of dissident.</span> <span id="s2132">But then he turned from dissident to Jewish thinking, history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">I don't know exactly what years it was.</span> <span id="s2134">He's approximately the same age as us, maybe one year younger.</span> <span id="s2135">We are 1937, him 1938.</span> <span id="s2136">So maybe he was not so strong Jewish because everything was Russian.</span> <span id="s2137">My children, they're not different from their friends.</span> <span id="s2138">The same life, the same things, books.</span> <span id="s2139">But I am Jew!</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">You know how Russians don't say "we", they say "they", "Jews," "they".</span> <span id="s2141">The difference was really only in passports, because we couldn't study anything.</span> <span id="s2142">So when I explained when my father gave me this name he said I didn't have anything Jewish, no history, now tradition, no motherland, nothing.</span> <span id="s2143">At least Jewish name.</span> <span id="s2144">So when did he turn Jewish?</span> <span id="s2145">In 1957 he was brought to KGB, and they asked him about his poems, about his activity, about what he goes to Leningrad and Moscow for.</span> <span id="s2146">And they suggest that he work with them, but he refused.</span> <span id="s2147">It was 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">In 1964, he was again brought in because he read publicly Josef Brodsky's poems.</span> <span id="s2149">Brodsky was prohibited in Russia.</span> <span id="s2150">He was brought to KGB.</span> <span id="s2151">In 1971 he was arrested and brought to the KGB again and they asked him about different things.</span> <span id="s2152">They had many things about him, his dossier.</span> <span id="s2153">He was accused of many things, about his poems.</span> <span id="s2154">He reads poems about Soviet power, Stalin and so on.</span> <span id="s2155">But the story begins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">He married a woman, Lydia.</span> <span id="s2157">Just before this arrest, they got married.</span> <span id="s2158">About her I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s2159">It's another story.</span> <span id="s2160">After that he was arrested and his wife was arrested by the KGB.</span> <span id="s2161">The guy from the KGB tried to persuade her to leave her husband, saying he'd be in prison.</span> <span id="s2162">But she refused.</span> <span id="s2163">She cried, "Let my husband go."</span> <span id="s2164">In 1979, they applied to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s2165">I cannot tell you details.</span> <span id="s2166">I'll tell you in general, because it's written in Russian.</span> <span id="s2167">They had many troubles in their apartment.</span> <span id="s2168">The windows were broken.</span> <span id="s2169">They lived on the third floor.</span> <span id="s2170">People cried, "Zhidy, go away from this country or we will kill you without any punishment because you are Jews."</span> <span id="s2171">They complained to the militia, but the militia said that broken windows in your apartment is not prohibited.</span> <span id="s2172">They received refusal without any reason.</span> <span id="s2173">Refusal.</span> <span id="s2174">It was years that people received...</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">My husband's work was secrecy, but they received it without any reason.</span> <span id="s2176">They lost their jobs.</span> <span id="s2177">It was a hard life.</span> <span id="s2178">Many times they couldn't find jobs.</span> <span id="s2179">In 1983 the KGB came in search of their apartment and found narcotics.</span> <span id="s2180">They took baking soda or something, and would say, "it's narcotics.</span> <span id="s2181">You keep narcotics."</span> <span id="s2182">If they want to accuse someone of something.</span> <span id="s2183">(You remember the Ukrainian ...Albert, who was accused of having narcotics and his wife had her brother in this country and it was published in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s2184">It's a normal thing.</span> <span id="s2185">If the KGB wants, they can find a gun in your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">He told me this story of how they found these narcotics in his apartments.</span> <span id="s2187">They brought special dog, trained to find narcotics.)</span> <span id="s2188">The dog didn't find anything.</span> <span id="s2189">Then this guy began to look for himself.</span> <span id="s2190">They had a huge library, many books.</span> <span id="s2191">He took one book, did not find.</span> <span id="s2192">In the third book, he found narcotics.</span> <span id="s2193">So in 1983 they found narcotics, but really they were looking for Jewish literature and different books of Jewish history and his own poems.</span> <span id="s2194">And he was arrested and was put in prison for two weeks, how to say, interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">He was asked about his contacts, his people in Moscow.</span> <span id="s2196">He knew refuseniks in Moscow.</span> <span id="s2197">He did not say anything.</span> <span id="s2198">KGB Major said, "In our city there is no Jewish spirit.</span> <span id="s2199">We will try to do everything so it will never be here in our city."</span> <span id="s2200">They complained when he was freed.</span> <span id="s2201">He was returned the baking soda.</span> <span id="s2202">They look like narcotics henna and baking soda.</span> <span id="s2203">It was 1983.</span> <span id="s2204">And he could not find job and he found a job in a synagogue like person who cleans janitor.</span> <span id="s2205">He cleaned yard, street.</span> <span id="s2206">In Russia you have one for your building.</span> <span id="s2207">For example, in our apartment building we had a couple of dvorniks, people who clean the yard.</span> <span id="s2208">He began this work and he was a janitor and he maintained the boiler.</span> <span id="s2209">He had so small a salary, 30 rubles a month.</span> <span id="s2210">You can't imagine how small this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">When he began this work, this is when the sad story begins.</span> <span id="s2212">Once he began to work in synagogue and had Jewish feeling, he turned the synagogue not only order, he turned synagogue into important Jewish life in synagogue.</span> <span id="s2213">Because as usual, only old men attend synagogue.</span> <span id="s2214">And he tried to give new life to synagogue, and Jews began to gather in the synagogue, and the place became some kind of center for Jewish life in this city.</span> <span id="s2215">He brought matzos from Kiev on Pesach to people.</span> <span id="s2216">And the authorities did not want this Jewish spirit in the city.</span> <span id="s2217">They decided not to imprison him, to kill him, but to break his spirit, but to discredit him.</span> <span id="s2218">They wanted not only to break this spirit.</span> <span id="s2219">If he's discredited, the people won't trust him and it will be very bad.</span> <span id="s2220">In 1985 he was arrested again, about narcotics.</span> <span id="s2221">They searched and found narcotics and knives.</span> <span id="s2222">They could find a nuclear bomb if they wanted.</span> <span id="s2223">They took books about Jewish culture and history, his own poems, tape recorder, typewriter, famous Russian poet Tvardovsky, it was published in samizdat, but they decided that his poem... they said this antiSoviet literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">And his wife begins to complain to different places because he's arrested.</span> <span id="s2225">He's in KGB in prison.</span> <span id="s2226">She begins to go to the city authorities, to Kiev, different places where she could complain.</span> <span id="s2227">At last, she came to Moscow.</span> <span id="s2228">And in Moscow, on Gorky Street, the central street in Moscow, she was arrested.</span> <span id="s2229">She was brought to a psychiatric hospital and was told that she was an addict.</span> <span id="s2230">They said they will cure her of drug addiction, because she was very thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Now I will tell you about his wife.</span> <span id="s2232">This is a very sad story.</span> <span id="s2233">She's a Russian woman.</span> <span id="s2234">Her father is Russian, but nobody knows who her mother is.</span> <span id="s2235">Her father had a wife and when he was in the army, it was every person must serve in the army two years.</span> <span id="s2236">When he went to the army, he served in Siberia, in a prison camp.</span> <span id="s2237">He had an affair with some woman, and she had a child.</span> <span id="s2238">Probably she died, because when he returned home, he brought this girl, and no woman.</span> <span id="s2239">But his wife hated this girl.</span> <span id="s2240">This woman, (his wife), was written her mother.</span> <span id="s2241">But she hated Lydia all her life because she wasn't her daughter.</span> <span id="s2242">The only one who loved Lydia was her grandmother, and she told her this story (that they didn't know her real mother).</span> <span id="s2243">She was only one or two years old when he came back home with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">(Was this the father's mother who was the grandmother?)</span> <span id="s2245">Yes.</span> <span id="s2246">He loved Lydia.</span> <span id="s2247">She had a very hard time when she was a girl because her mother hated her.</span> <span id="s2248">Her grandmother was a simple Russian woman.</span> <span id="s2249">She knew herbs.</span> <span id="s2250">She knew some can cure things.</span> <span id="s2251">She taught Lydia to use herbs.</span> <span id="s2252">So she never took medicine, because she only took herbs.</span> <span id="s2253">She never took medicine.</span> <span id="s2254">The second point: they did not have kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">She was working as a nurse and was in the hospital and the doctor cured his patient with hunger.</span> <span id="s2256">I have her different copy books showing how she signed different things where they cured people with hunger.</span> <span id="s2257">They keep hunger for a long time.</span> <span id="s2258">That cures some diseases.</span> <span id="s2259">She studied it when she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s2260">Because they did not have children, she began to cure herself with hunger to get pregnant.</span> <span id="s2261">When she was arrested, for the first time she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s2262">What a coincidence!</span> <span id="s2263">At this time, when she was arrested, she was pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">But they said she was too thin.</span> <span id="s2265">"You are obviously a drug addict.</span> <span id="s2266">We will cure you from this."</span> <span id="s2267">She said, "Don't cure me.</span> <span id="s2268">First of all, I never take medicine.</span> <span id="s2269">Never.</span> <span id="s2270">And most of all, I'm pregnant."</span> <span id="s2271">But they gave her shots.</span> <span id="s2272">More.</span> <span id="s2273">She lost the baby.</span> <span id="s2274">They gave her different injections.</span> <span id="s2275">First it was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s2276">Later they brought her to Dnepropetrovsk.</span> <span id="s2277">Listen to what happens.</span> <span id="s2278">She is in the hospital, getting injections.</span> <span id="s2279">He is in prison.</span> <span id="s2280">KGB required that he refuse his Jewish spirit and thinking and ideas.</span> <span id="s2281">He said no.</span> <span id="s2282">The KGB gave her so many injections she said: her mother hated her all her life, but when she saw Lydia in this situation she began to cry.</span> <span id="s2283">She turned into this condition.</span> <span id="s2284">She did not understand anything.</span> <span id="s2285">After that, they showed her to her husband.</span> <span id="s2286">Her husband was told to change his views or your wife is like this.</span> <span id="s2287">He agreed to make a film on TV that will say "I refuse..." I asked Lydia if she remembered this date with her husband and she said no.</span> <span id="s2288">She was so... She said, "I can't explain what they did..." What they did, they gave her I think hormones.</span> <span id="s2289">She said she was covered with black hair all over her body.</span> <span id="s2290">In a couple of months it was gone.</span> <span id="s2291">But you understand what they did with her?</span> <span id="s2292">Three years after this hospital, in three years, she didn't menstruate.</span> <span id="s2293">I don't know how it is now, but three years after, she didn't.</span> <span id="s2294">Because they made something awful with her in this hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">He agreed, he made this show on TV.</span> <span id="s2296">They taped it and showed it in Dneiprpetrovsk TV.</span> <span id="s2297">After that it was trial.</span> <span id="s2298">There was a court trial and he said, "Yes, I had narcotics..." Whatever was required.</span> <span id="s2299">He was sentenced to two years in prison.</span> <span id="s2300">Was she released from the hospital?</span> <span id="s2301">Only after that, the trial, after everything was over.</span> <span id="s2302">They kept her like hostage, because they needed to force him.</span> <span id="s2303">She began to look for job.</span> <span id="s2304">I can't explain, it was so hard a life!!</span> <span id="s2305">In one year, he was released earlier because he worked hard.</span> <span id="s2306">He came back to Dneiprpetrovsk.</span> <span id="s2307">They tried to receive invitation from Israel.</span> <span id="s2308">They tried to emigrate.</span> <span id="s2309">In short, they received invitation, they emigrated and now they are in Israel.</span> <span id="s2310">What is very sad in this story?</span> <span id="s2311">First of all, it destroyed a good man, his good reputation.</span> <span id="s2312">Health.</span> <span id="s2313">He has heart problems.</span> <span id="s2314">I don't know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s2315">It was so awful!</span> <span id="s2316">She lost the baby.</span> <span id="s2317">She's a young woman.</span> <span id="s2318">They don't have babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">And when they came back, the other refuseniks didn't want to know him.</span> <span id="s2320">They did not like him....</span> <span id="s2321">But what I wanted to say, we were refuseniks.</span> <span id="s2322">We lived around other refuseniks.</span> <span id="s2323">I cannot tell this story about them without a cold feeling.</span> <span id="s2324">I want to help them.</span> <span id="s2325">I don't think badly of them.</span> <span id="s2326">Our refuseniks, they didn't like them.</span> <span id="s2327">They lived a normal life, their only fear was to be put in prison.</span> <span id="s2328">They had their children, wives, friends, everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s2329">Nobody was in KGB hands.</span> <span id="s2330">They (refuseniks) were not through it.</span> <span id="s2331">When I saw Lydia and Evgeny for the first time, I looked into her face.</span> <span id="s2332">They were telling this story to my husband.</span> <span id="s2333">Our friend who was a refusenik, he knew them.</span> <span id="s2334">They came to him.</span> <span id="s2335">But he didn't want to deal with them.</span> <span id="s2336">He brought them to us because, he said, "Gennady is very honest and fair.</span> <span id="s2337">He'll listen to you."</span> <span id="s2338">(Together we studied law.)</span> <span id="s2339">So they were in our home and were talking with my husband and telling him this story about their life.</span> <span id="s2340">And I came home and began to listen with one ear because they were telling this story to my husband, not to me.</span> <span id="s2341">I listened and realized: it's awful!</span> <span id="s2342">And I looked at her face and I saw her face!</span> <span id="s2343">There was pain, anguish, fear, that people do not believe them, do not understand!</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">[TAPE II] ...I saw this fear on her face, you know, because other people did not understand, they did not believe, they did not feel.</span> <span id="s2345">It was not fair.</span> <span id="s2346">I remember, this is what he said: "Gennady is friend, he will listen.</span> <span id="s2347">And I will go."</span> <span id="s2348">I wanted to help them.</span> <span id="s2349">Because I felt like they felt.</span> <span id="s2350">It is not all story.</span> <span id="s2351">It's not a common story.</span> <span id="s2352">They emigrated.</span> <span id="s2353">What I wanted to say, but first... When he did his show on TV why did refuseniks turn away from him?</span> <span id="s2354">Well, he said something about several refuseniks in Moscow, but these refuseniks had already left the country.</span> <span id="s2355">They were in Israel, he knew it.</span> <span id="s2356">Only one refusenik he said, she was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s2357">She was a very famous refusenik.</span> <span id="s2358">And soon after that she received permission and left.</span> <span id="s2359">Nobody suffered from them, from his words on TV, nobody!</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">And I wanted to ask why our refuseniks did not help them?</span> <span id="s2361">When the story with narcotics happened in Kiev, I told you: with Elbert, it was big noise.</span> <span id="s2362">Another refusenik came there and helped them, they made noise in America, they made big noise!</span> <span id="s2363">This was an awful story about Lydia and Evgeny.</span> <span id="s2364">She was in the hospital, she suffered.</span> <span id="s2365">He was in prison!</span> <span id="s2366">She was tortured.</span> <span id="s2367">Nobody helped!</span> <span id="s2368">Nobody said a word.</span> <span id="s2369">And now they turn away.</span> <span id="s2370">It made me so sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">(How do you interpret this?</span> <span id="s2372">What is your interpretation of this?</span> <span id="s2373">Of the refuseniks' attitude towards them.</span> <span id="s2374">How would you explain this?)</span> <span id="s2375">You know what?</span> <span id="s2376">I would like to talk to refuseniks about it because by this time, they left Russia and lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s2377">Only once I talked with Kosharovksy's wife.</span> <span id="s2378">Do you know Kasharovsky?</span> <span id="s2379">He was a famous refusenik.</span> <span id="s2380">They are in Israel too.</span> <span id="s2381">He is a good guy.</span> <span id="s2382">He knew this couple, Lydia and Evgeny.</span> <span id="s2383">And I talked to his wife, "Now she (Lydia) is in Moscow, they want to emigrate, too."</span> <span id="s2384">The wife said, "Oh no!</span> <span id="s2385">He said on TV about his refusal from his Jewish views.</span> <span id="s2386">He denied..." and so on.</span> <span id="s2387">They were in the KGB's hands.</span> <span id="s2388">They do not know what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">I knew before this story long ago I knew another story.</span> <span id="s2390">Our very good friend, she knew one person, and after he was broken by the KGB, she said, when she met him, it was absolutely another person.</span> <span id="s2391">I cannot tell you this story because it was long ago.</span> <span id="s2392">I did not know this guy about whom she said.</span> <span id="s2393">When I go to Israel I will visit her.</span> <span id="s2394">She is a very good woman, and I will write this story.</span> <span id="s2395">He was Jewish, this guy.</span> <span id="s2396">After the KGB, he began to work in a Christian church, at a small position.</span> <span id="s2397">The KGB made something with him, I don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s2398">But I remember when she told us this story she said, "This person, you cannot say any bad word because after the KGB..."

[tape ends]</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">ORAL HISTORY PROJECT Women's Auziliary of the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago SULAMITH REZNIKOV - ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (From handwritten copy explaining other taped comments.)</span> <span id="s2444">About the Jewish "Experience": Me.</span> <span id="s2445">I told you that at four years old I knew I was a Jew: when the war began in 1941 I was almost four, then we went into evacuation, children there teased me because of my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">I told you about my first day at school.</span> <span id="s2447">I told you I wanted to change my name because I felt myself uncomfortable, children teased me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">I told you the story about the medal.</span> <span id="s2449">Why was the medal important?</span> <span id="s2450">If you have a medal, it means only "fives" you can enter the institute, university without any exams.</span> <span id="s2451">Other girls who were good pupils but who never had only "fives," they had "fours" and "fives" they received medals because the teacher improved their grades during the last month.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">I had only "fives" all my school years, but did not receive it.</span> <span id="s2453">I had to take exams.</span> <span id="s2454">In the USSR all exams but one are oral and the teacher has the possibility to do what he or she wants: to mix you up, to ask things that are not required to be known to you, to exert pressure and so on.</span> <span id="s2455">When I had exams, one teacher tried to fail me this way.</span> <span id="s2456">When I studied in this institute I found out he was a furious antiSemite.</span> <span id="s2457">I told you when I graduated institute I was not taken to a job despite of their own requirements.</span> <span id="s2458">My parents' friend helped me to get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Several times in my life I tried to get a job.</span> <span id="s2460">Never could I do it myself without friends' help.</span> <span id="s2461">There were many vacations, and engineers were needed but not Jews.</span> <span id="s2462">I don't want to talk about everyday antiSemitism.</span> <span id="s2463">It's everywhere and always.</span> <span id="s2464">I've forgotten much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">My husband.</span> <span id="s2466">He will tell you himself I hope.</span> <span id="s2467">But I'll tell you something now.</span> <span id="s2468">When he graduated seven grades he decided to enter aviation school.</span> <span id="s2469">His family was very poor and in that school he would receive food and clothes.</span> <span id="s2470">Despite his excellent knowledge, he was not admitted.</span> <span id="s2471">When he withdrew his application he noticed on the corner of the piece of paper the erased word, "Jew".</span> <span id="s2472">He studied at school so excellently that teachers could not deprive him of the medal, but they could prevent him from entering Moscow University.</span> <span id="s2473">How?</span> <span id="s2474">They gave him his documents too late, after the deadline to the university.</span> <span id="s2475">In institutes the deadline is much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">He had to go to the institute.</span> <span id="s2477">He was the excellent student again, he received "red diploma" (only "fives"), but again he received the Jewish experience: when he graduated for the assignment he was first on the list because of the "red diploma", and he had the legal right to choose a job.</span> <span id="s2478">But he was refused, he received not a good job.</span> <span id="s2479">When he wanted to change it he became unemployed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">How did it happen?</span> <span id="s2481">He was admitted to a research institute and, naturally, quit his job, he came the research institute with his "labor book" but the chief of the personnel department (in the USSR it's a KGB man usually) said "No."</span> <span id="s2482">My husband looked for any job.</span> <span id="s2483">To search for a job it's a nightmare.</span> <span id="s2484">Maybe he will tell you himself.</span> <span id="s2485">At last he got a small position.</span> <span id="s2486">In nine months he received a call from the research institute, "Come here quickly."</span> <span id="s2487">"What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s2488">"Our chief of the personnel department is on vacation.</span> <span id="s2489">He is absent."</span> <span id="s2490">My husband was taken to work at this research institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Is it possible to remember everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Sergey.</span> <span id="s2493">He learned he is a Jew in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s2494">He was born in October, it was summer, so he was less than five years old.</span> <span id="s2495">In kindergarten children attend the same class, same teacher every day.</span> <span id="s2496">But in the summer because of vacations every week they have a different teacher from other classes.</span> <span id="s2497">Once my son had an excellent teacher.</span> <span id="s2498">My husband and I liked her very much and told my son, "What a perfectly good teacher you have now!"</span> <span id="s2499">The next day after kindergarten my son said, "You said the teacher is good, but haha, no, she is a Jew!"</span> <span id="s2500">This day his education began: we explained to him... He was a mentally developed boy, very bright.</span> <span id="s2501">At oneandahalf years old he began to ask about letters and at three he said his first word himself.</span> <span id="s2502">At five he read like an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">I often saw in kindergarten: teacher is absent, children are sitting around my son, he is reading them a book.</span> <span id="s2504">But physically he was not strong, was often beaten up.</span> <span id="s2505">Boys who beat him do not forget he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s2506">At school several teachers were clearly antiSemitic, they permitted themselves to say antiSemitic things.</span> <span id="s2507">The history teacher was furiously antiSemitic.</span> <span id="s2508">He gave my son lower grades.</span> <span id="s2509">Once I asked him why.</span> <span id="s2510">He said, "Look at Lena's copy book.</span> <span id="s2511">It's so nicely written, and look at your son's copy book."</span> <span id="s2512">I said, "But beauty of the copy book doesn't reflect knowledge in history."</span> <span id="s2513">He many times said antiSemitic things.</span> <span id="s2514">Once he beat my son since my son drew a mustache to somebody in the history book.</span> <span id="s2515">(All the children did it.)</span> <span id="s2516">His name was Sidorov.</span> <span id="s2517">Now he is in "Pamjat'".</span> <span id="s2518">(Somebody told me this.)</span> <span id="s2519">The most sad story is about my son's "entering" into university.</span> <span id="s2520">We knew that physics and math are absolutely closed for Jews in Moscow University.</span> <span id="s2521">But chemistry.</span> <span id="s2522">Four years he studied in chemistry group in "Pioneer Castle".</span> <span id="s2523">He took part in competitions for schoolchildren in chemistry, biochemistry, and physics.</span> <span id="s2524">He was a winner, has around sixteen certificates.</span> <span id="s2525">He was so bright and sophisticated, but could not enter the university.</span> <span id="s2526">I cannot remember this story, I begin to cry.</span> <span id="s2527">And the same reaction I have when I hear the same stories with other children of our Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s2528">He studied math in the institute.</span> <span id="s2529">He graduated with a "red diploma" (only "fives") but the same situation: like his father: he could not get the job that he wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Vladimir.</span> <span id="s2531">Children did not beat him because he was strong; he could beat back.</span> <span id="s2532">One year he even learned to wrestle in order to be strong.</span> <span id="s2533">When he had troubles he fought.</span> <span id="s2534">As usual, all children in the summer live in the summer camps.</span> <span id="s2535">Some of them one term, some two, some three.</span> <span id="s2536">These camps are overnight camps.</span> <span id="s2537">They are very cheap and available.</span> <span id="s2538">I never let my sons go there, I was afraid for them.</span> <span id="s2539">Once Vladimir wanted very much to go, he persuaded me long and I let him go because my friend was working in that camp.</span> <span id="s2540">She was a doctor and signed him: her son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">In that camp he had many troubles.</span> <span id="s2542">He went back home soon, but he did not tell me about the troubles because he did not want to upset me.</span> <span id="s2543">I know that children teased him and he fought.</span> <span id="s2544">He doesn't like and doesn't want to remember his troubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">When he was four or five he asked, "What does the word 'university' mean?"</span> <span id="s2546">Father explained.</span> <span id="s2547">Vladimir asked, "Will I study there?"</span> <span id="s2548">My husband said, sadly, "Never, never in the world will my sons study in the University."</span> <span id="s2549">We had not decided to emigrate by that time, so he meant Moscow University.</span> <span id="s2550">Technics is not his mission.</span> <span id="s2551">He is a humanist.</span> <span id="s2552">In his math school with very high demand to each subject he studied perfect, but the best was "composition."</span> <span id="s2553">A strict teacher said that he is the best in the class.</span> <span id="s2554">Even in America he had an "A" on English composition.</span> <span id="s2555">Nevertheless, after graduating school he entered the institute to study math.</span> <span id="s2556">He knew that Moscow University is not available for Jews, absolutely, especially if you want the liberal arts, something in the Humanities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">I am sure he told you the story about how he was nearly eliminated from school because of celebrating Purim.</span> <span id="s2558">I asked the teacher, "What is the crime?"</span> <span id="s2559">She exclaimed, "He ate ritual food."</span> <span id="s2560">She meant hamantashen cakes with poppy seeds.</span> <span id="s2561">You know, at Russian "Paskha" Russians bake "kulich" and "paskha."</span> <span id="s2562">They are real ritual food, people bring them to church and the priest consecrates them.</span> <span id="s2563">This "ritual food" at the Russian Paskha is sold in each store, and all stores are state stores.</span> <span id="s2564">But it is a difference: Russian "ritual foods" and Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">What I want to add is that applied math is the most difficult and most prestigious department in each institute, it takes a biggest competition to get there.</span> <span id="s2566">My sons got there in different institutes and studied successfully even though it was not their mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">We left the USSR and Vladimir can choose what he wants.</span> <span id="s2568">"They" didn't have time to put obstacles in his way.</span> <span id="s2569">But for Sergey they had time to do it.</span> <span id="s2570">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s2571">If he would be in America he would be a physicist, chemist, biochemist....</span> <span id="s2572">Sometimes he said, "When we leave I will study physics, chemistry..." But we did not leave.</span> <span id="s2573">He graduated from the institute, he became a mathematician.</span> <span id="s2574">He is working on his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s2575">I am sure he will be a very good mathematician.</span> <span id="s2576">But... This thought makes me sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">And what about my husband?</span> <span id="s2578">In Russia he had one way to be an engineer.</span> <span id="s2579">He is an excellent engineer, Ph.D., but in non-antisemitic country he could have another specialty.</span> <span id="s2580">He was a very big talent.</span> <span id="s2581">Our sons picked up from him.</span> <span id="s2582">He could be a physicist, journalist, actor, lawyer, doctor or something else.</span> <span id="s2583">Any way, he could be excellent.</span> <span id="s2584">I say it not because I am his wife, I know it.</span> <span id="s2585">But he had only one way engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">You know, my husband and sons are an example that in the USSR Jews cannot develop their possibilities, cannot get the best out of themselves.</span> <span id="s2587">It gives harm to Jews.</span> <span id="s2588">But to the country it gives much more harm.</span> <span id="s2589">Huge harm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Several Stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">My son invited his classmates to our home.</span> <span id="s2592">They played, talked.</span> <span id="s2593">They were around eight years old.</span> <span id="s2594">I was usually in the kitchen and I heard what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2595">Once I hear that two girls are arguing, then they are scolding each other, "You are a fool!"</span> <span id="s2596">"No, you are a fool."</span> <span id="s2597">"You are an idiot."</span> <span id="s2598">"No, you are an idiot."</span> <span id="s2599">"You are a Jew."</span> <span id="s2600">"No, you are a Jew."</span> <span id="s2601">I knew these girls, their families, I am sure they did not learn it from their parents.</span> <span id="s2602">Maybe from other children?</span> <span id="s2603">In general, antisemitism is part of the environment.</span> <span id="s2604">"Jew" in that country is a synonym for "bad."</span> <span id="s2605">My friends' daughter was in the third grade.</span> <span id="s2606">Once somebody in the class asked her, "Who is she?"</span> <span id="s2607">(her last name was not Russian).</span> <span id="s2608">The girl answered, "I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s2609">Children surrounded her and looked at her with amazement.</span> <span id="s2610">It seemed that they saw her for the first time and that she was a strange and unknown monster.</span> <span id="s2611">Do you know why?</span> <span id="s2612">First, because she said it herself "I am a Jew"!</span> <span id="s2613">And you know what they asked her?</span> <span id="s2614">"Are you from Israel?"</span> <span id="s2615">Every question was about Israel.</span> <span id="s2616">It shows that in their minds Israel and Jews come together, so intense antiIsrael propaganda in the Soviet Union is actually anti-semitic, antiJewish propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">My cousin was an officer in the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s2618">He wanted to study in the Military Academy.</span> <span id="s2619">He tried three times (three years in a row).</span> <span id="s2620">He passed exams most successfully but was not admitted.</span> <span id="s2621">After the third time he decided to complain.</span> <span id="s2622">He came to the General and told him his story.</span> <span id="s2623">The general said, "Well, right now I'll find out what is the matter."</span> <span id="s2624">He made a call, listened to the answer, and then turned his face to my cousin.</span> <span id="s2625">"Why do you take me in it?</span> <span id="s2626">Why do you take me for a ride?</span> <span id="s2627">Why are you bothering me?</span> <span id="s2628">You are a Jew!</span> <span id="s2629">Turn around and go!"</span> <span id="s2630">He was a General and did not need to be polite or to lie.</span> <span id="s2631">He told the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">"Education."</span> <span id="s2633">"Jewish Education."</span> <span id="s2634">I had splendid parents.</span> <span id="s2635">They loved me and I loved them too.</span> <span id="s2636">My father's father was a dentist, my mother's father was an accountant, both my parents were engineers, excellent engineers.</span> <span id="s2637">I was their third baby.</span> <span id="s2638">Two newborn babies before me died in hospitals because of the doctor's fault.</span> <span id="s2639">When I asked my mother, "My father gave me an unusual name, what name just you wanted?"</span> <span id="s2640">My mama answered, "I was so glad that at last I have a live healthy baby that I didn't care about name at all!</span> <span id="s2641">Your father went to the department of registration I did not say anything, when I came and said he named you Sulamith, I said only 'Okay.'"</span> <span id="s2642">My parents wanted more children but the war began, after the war they were about forty, life was hard, antisemitism grew, so I don't have brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">My parents didn't talk to me about politics, did not explain.</span> <span id="s2644">Why?</span> <span id="s2645">Now I try to realize it.</span> <span id="s2646">I think there were several reasons.</span> <span id="s2647">1) They thought: She'll live in this country all her life, she cannot change anything, let her think that everything is good, right and fair, that this country is beautiful.</span> <span id="s2648">In a popular Soviet song there are the words, "I don't know a country better than mine, more free..." and so on.</span> <span id="s2649">2) They wanted that I have at least a happy childhood.</span> <span id="s2650">3) they did not want me to have double thinking, I could say something at school and have much troubles.</span> <span id="s2651">There was one more reason, of no small importance: Even though they knew about the country, the system, nevertheless they thought that to live there is better than in another country, say, "America, country of imperialism, capitalism, all people are enemies to each other" and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">You know, Soviet propaganda is a very powerful thing!</span> <span id="s2653">And they were not able to receive information because of the "iron curtain."</span> <span id="s2654">But about antisemitism, about the "Jewish problem" they educated me.</span> <span id="s2655">First, like all children, I absorbed what I heard: talking, reactions to events, attitude toward them.</span> <span id="s2656">I took it in from my parents and from my "environment."</span> <span id="s2657">I try to remember if they talked to me about Jewishness, about problems.</span> <span id="s2658">It's hard to remember something specific.</span> <span id="s2659">I believe they did.</span> <span id="s2660">I told you that at four years old I knew I am not the same like other children, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2661">I am sure they explained something to me because when I met these cases I was prepared.</span> <span id="s2662">I knew I was a Jew, I knew how to treat words, relationships, and so on.</span> <span id="s2663">I told you a story about my father, how he explained to me why I must not change my name.</span> <span id="s2664">I told you how he explained to me why he gave me a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">When our first son was born, we discussed the name for the baby.</span> <span id="s2666">My father said, "Give him a Jewish name, Rafael or David."</span> <span id="s2667">I began to laugh.</span> <span id="s2668">I said, "Pa, he'll live in this antisemitic country, I don't want him to have troubles!</span> <span id="s2669">I'll give him a typical Russian name."</span> <span id="s2670">My father was strong.</span> <span id="s2671">I want to tell you one more story about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">When I was a first year student I fell in love with one Russian boy, my classmate.</span> <span id="s2673">He was a good boy, tall and very, very handsome.</span> <span id="s2674">We were just good friends.</span> <span id="s2675">He came to our home, we studied together, we went to movie theaters.</span> <span id="s2676">I was sure he fell in love too but he never said a word.</span> <span id="s2677">He was not an assiduous student so sometimes he had troubles and discussed them with my father.</span> <span id="s2678">You know, my parents liked him because he was nice and very polite.</span> <span id="s2679">After the second year he quit the institute and with a group of students went north to build "building of Communism."</span> <span id="s2680">After several years he lived in Moscow and rarely we met each other with our old friends.</span> <span id="s2681">Once we remembered student years and he said he loved me.</span> <span id="s2682">Then I asked, "Why didn't you marry me?"</span> <span id="s2683">He said, "I had a talk with your father and said I wanted to marry you, but he told me, she must marry only a Jew."</span> <span id="s2684">I said, "My father never told me about it, now he is dead and you can make this up."</span> <span id="s2685">He answered, "No, it's true.</span> <span id="s2686">I hesitated to quit institute but after that talk I stopped hesitating."</span> <span id="s2687">I remembered that he had a oneonone conversation in another room, but I thought it was about school.</span> <span id="s2688">This is my father!</span> <span id="s2689">I remember he told me something when his mother died but I don't remember concrete words.</span> <span id="s2690">I think he educated me nonobtrusively, without pressing.</span> <span id="s2691">My mother was different.</span> <span id="s2692">she could say, "I don't care who you'll marry, I want him to be a good person."</span> <span id="s2693">But just she gave me the feeling about "Jews are good."</span> <span id="s2694">She always told me, "He is a Jew.</span> <span id="s2695">She is a Jew."</span> <span id="s2696">About scientists, famous people, writers, composers and so on.</span> <span id="s2697">Once we read or heard I don't remember exactly American article about three people who gave the most influence to Twentiethcentury culture: A. Einstein, K. Marx, Freud.</span> <span id="s2698">My mother said, "Look the three are Jews."</span> <span id="s2699">She told me stories about Jews who were treated unfairly because they were Jews and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">She was really a "Jewish mama."</span> <span id="s2701">She helped me all her life to the last day, till her death.</span> <span id="s2702">She gave us some money, she bought things, she helped with my housework.</span> <span id="s2703">She babysat my three children.</span> <span id="s2704">She lived far away but she always came to babysit if needed.</span> <span id="s2705">I could call her and say, "Ma, we are invited to a party.</span> <span id="s2706">Can you come or not?"</span> <span id="s2707">She always said, "I know if I don't come you'll be at home and Gene'll go, so I'll come."</span> <span id="s2708">She had to take bus, metro two lines and the bus again.</span> <span id="s2709">It took more than an hour, but she came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">When she moved into another apartment closer, she took only one bus.</span> <span id="s2711">She came to help me with my housework almost every day.</span> <span id="s2712">I said, "Ma, have a rest, I can do it myself."</span> <span id="s2713">She turned angry and said, "No, I come here to help you, if you don't need it, I'll go home!"</span> <span id="s2714">When we decided to emigrate, she did not want to, she was afraid for us, she thought that to live in Moscow is better than to live in another unknown country.</span> <span id="s2715">Do you know how I persuaded her?</span> <span id="s2716">Easy.</span> <span id="s2717">I said, "When we will come to another country we will not be able to find a job soon, but you are retired, you will receive a pension from the beginning, you will help us.</span> <span id="s2718">We need your help."</span> <span id="s2719">My mother wanted "to give" and she was glad to give.</span> <span id="s2720">Even up to now I miss my parents.</span> <span id="s2721">Even my husband could say, "Sometimes I would so much like to talk to your father."</span> <span id="s2722">You asked me, Elaine, when I began to understand about the system?</span> <span id="s2723">I try to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">When I studied in the institute we read so many books.</span> <span id="s2725">It was not samizdat.</span> <span id="s2726">These books were published.</span> <span id="s2727">I can recommend to you an excellent book At the place of Execution: the Literature of Moral Opposition by Gregory Silirsky.</span> <span id="s2728">This book was translated into English and published in the USA with the title, A History of PostWar Soviet Writing.</span> <span id="s2729">It's a very interesting book; it gives the whole picture of Soviet published literature of the moral opposition.</span> <span id="s2730">Thus you can understand that we could pick something up from literature that went through censorship.</span> <span id="s2731">Then we became older and could realize it ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Then was 1956 and the Party meeting where Khrushchev told about Stalinism.</span> <span id="s2733">Then in 1956 I met my husband, Gennady.</span> <span id="s2734">He was much more advanced politically.</span> <span id="s2735">Then we began to read samizdat underground typed books and articles and to listen to "Voice of America."</span> <span id="s2736">And more and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">We so early began to understand about Soviet system that we could become dissidents, I am glad that we did not become this.</span> <span id="s2738">Why?</span> <span id="s2739">Dissidents want to improve the system, everything in the country, they want to reform and so on.</span> <span id="s2740">We realized that it is not our business, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s2741">Jews in that country are considered guilty of everything bad.</span> <span id="s2742">It doesn't matter what Jews do, they will be bad and guilty forever in that antisemitic country.</span> <span id="s2743">We understood: we don't want to change, to improve, to fight the system.</span> <span id="s2744">No.</span> <span id="s2745">It's not the Jewish way: Jewish business.</span> <span id="s2746">We must leave.</span> <span id="s2747">We will live our own life, we will feel ourselves Jews how we want and understand it.</span> <span id="s2748">And nothing and nobody will press.</span> <span id="s2749">We want to do it for our children and future generations for ourselves.</span> <span id="s2750">We don't want to live in the USSR, we want to leave!</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">In 1978 my husband quit his very good, highly paid job because it was connected with some "secrecy" and could be reason to receive refusal.</span> <span id="s2752">In 1979 we applied for exit visa.</span> <span id="s2753">Approximately at that time we began to get different books about Jewish history, Israel, the magazine "Israel Today," books and magazines published abroad.</span> <span id="s2754">We got "Jewish History" by Cecil Roth in Russian.</span> <span id="s2755">I remember it was a photocopy, very small print, and I read it with a magnifying glass, all 800 pages.</span> <span id="s2756">My husband and sons read this book too.</span> <span id="s2757">In 1980 we got "Exodus" in Russian.</span> <span id="s2758">I remember it was exactly 1980 because I thought that Vladimir at ten years old is too young to read it.</span> <span id="s2759">But he read it at once.</span> <span id="s2760">We read much, we educated ourselves.</span> <span id="s2761">Formerly we were just Jews, at that time we received some knowledge.</span> <span id="s2762">We met friends who were in refusal too and educated themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">In 1983, exactly, my sons and husband began to study Hebrew and Torah.</span> <span id="s2764">In 1983 foreign Jews began to visit us.</span> <span id="s2765">We felt that Jews support Jews.</span> <span id="s2766">We appreciated it very much.</span> <span id="s2767">They supported us materially, especially morally, they brought us books.</span> <span id="s2768">My sons studied Torah in 1984 in different groups for youths.</span> <span id="s2769">They educated me.</span> <span id="s2770">Maybe they wanted that I keep kosher and other rules.</span> <span id="s2771">Some of our friends turned religious.</span> <span id="s2772">Some just kept rules.</span> <span id="s2773">I remember a period that Vladimir wore kipa and so on.</span> <span id="s2774">You know what I told them?</span> <span id="s2775">"The most important is what's inside, not outside.</span> <span id="s2776">Is it good to wear kipa and to fight with your brother?</span> <span id="s2777">You have to feel right, act right, you have to be honest, good, fair.</span> <span id="s2778">It's the most important!</span> <span id="s2779">Spirit!</span> <span id="s2780">Not appearance!"</span> <span id="s2781">I believed it and taught my sons it.</span> <span id="s2782">I don't know when my sons began to understand exactly they are Jews and what it means to be a Jew in that country.</span> <span id="s2783">I know that we always discussed everything in their presence.</span> <span id="s2784">About politics.</span> <span id="s2785">About Jews.</span> <span id="s2786">My mother exclaimed often, "Why do you talk about such things in the children's presence!?"</span> <span id="s2787">I always said, "Our children have to have the same views, the same opinions, they have to see things like we do."</span> <span id="s2788">She was afraid, she went through Stalinism, she could say, "You will be imprisoned."</span> <span id="s2789">And often we told our sons, "Never, ever say to anybody what you hear at home, which books you see, otherwise we could be imprisoned."</span> <span id="s2790">I am absolutely sure that whatever my sons think when their education, Jewish education began, they really received it always, constantly from birth.</span> <span id="s2791">I told you that Sergey clearly realized at five after our talk about his kindergarten teacher.</span> <span id="s2792">Vladimir approximately the same age.</span> <span id="s2793">I remember one conversation.</span> <span id="s2794">He was about seven years old.</span> <span id="s2795">We were talking about somebody who was going to marry.</span> <span id="s2796">I said, "Jews should not marry nonJew."</span> <span id="s2797">"Why?"</span> <span id="s2798">asked Vladimir.</span> <span id="s2799">I told him a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">I had a friend at my job.</span> <span id="s2801">She was a good Russian woman.</span> <span id="s2802">I am absolutely sure she was not antisemitic, but when we once fell out she said, "You are a Jew, everybody Jewish is so... and so..." I don't remember her exact words, only the meaning.</span> <span id="s2803">She wanted to say something bad to hurt me, so she said "Jew."</span> <span id="s2804">You'll never be the same if your wife is not Jew, and more.</span> <span id="s2805">You and your wife have to have the same views and same feelings, troubles and treatment of them, the same spirit and so on.</span> <span id="s2806">I explained it to my small seven year old boy.</span> <span id="s2807">I don't know if he remembers it now or not, but there he understood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">About Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">In general I am not religious.</span> <span id="s2810">I don't keep shabat, kosher, don't go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s2811">But I know that Judaism is mine.</span> <span id="s2812">But for example, Christmas, church no.</span> <span id="s2813">In Russia we put tree up before New Year.</span> <span id="s2814">First it was not connected with Christmas, just New Year firtree, new year tradition.</span> <span id="s2815">Second we did not know that it is not Jewish way.</span> <span id="s2816">Now I know and never be able to put newyear tree up.</span> <span id="s2817">I like Christmas beautiful trees, decorations, but I feel it's not mine, ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">When I found out about "Jews for Christ" in Chicago I felt awful about it.</span> <span id="s2819">No!</span> <span id="s2820">It's wrong.</span> <span id="s2821">When my good friend, Russian woman, not antisemitic sent me a greeting with "Christmas and New Year" I asked her, "It did not occur to me to greet you with Purim or Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s2822">Why it occurred to you to greet me with Christmas that gave to Jews, Jewry, so much suffering up to now?!"</span> <span id="s2823">I know there were many Jews who adopted Christianity and became famous Christians.</span> <span id="s2824">I think it's wrong.</span> <span id="s2825">I think they felt and other people felt it.</span> <span id="s2826">I knew one "Christian" in Russia and one "Jew for Christ" in Chicago, they both impressed me the same: they were very staunch (a kind of) but I heard in their words excuses.</span> <span id="s2827">They explained and explained but I heard them justifying themselves.</span> <span id="s2828">I have a friend who knows a woman a Bahai.</span> <span id="s2829">This Jewish woman had many troubles in her personal life.</span> <span id="s2830">She was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s2831">She needed something.</span> <span id="s2832">I believe if she would meet at that time, say, a good person, maybe a Catholic missionary, she would turn to Catholicism; or if she would meet good Jewish religious person she would turn to Jewish Orthodoxy, but she met good Bahai person and turned to Bahaism.</span> <span id="s2833">It is understandable.</span> <span id="s2834">But I hate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">When my friend said that Bahaism is very good and "maybe I'll think to go there" I had so negative a reaction.</span> <span id="s2836">I said, "You are adult and can do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s2837">But my attitude to it is so bad.</span> <span id="s2838">I consider it like apostasy."</span> <span id="s2839">She said, "You don't even go to synagogue, how can you judge me?"</span> <span id="s2840">I said, "I have a feeling."</span> <span id="s2841">I feel I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2842">I want to be a Jew or I don't want I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2843">This is mine Judaism.</span> <span id="s2844">That is not mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">I am sure that my sons and husband feel this way too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">About Jews from the USSR.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">There are many articles about "Russian Jews," much is written.</span> <span id="s2848">I cannot say anything new.</span> <span id="s2849">But you asked me.</span> <span id="s2850">So I tell something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Soviet Jewry is a special kind.</span> <span id="s2852">They were not real Jews, they were not able to find out about Jewish history, traditions, culture, language, songs and literature, about Jews in other countries.</span> <span id="s2853">My friend graduated from Moscow University.</span> <span id="s2854">Her subject was History.</span> <span id="s2855">She told me that in "History" there was not one word about Jews.</span> <span id="s2856">Like Jews don't exist in world history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Most Russian Jews had only Russian history, songs and language, culture and tradition, only "Great" Russian literature and still of life.</span> <span id="s2858">Children had Russian names.</span> <span id="s2859">My Michael's teacher once asked me why I have so strange a name.</span> <span id="s2860">She is surprised!</span> <span id="s2861">I explained.</span> <span id="s2862">She asked, "Why did he name you that?"</span> <span id="s2863">I said, "There are in your class an Uzbek girl with an Uzbek name and a Tatar boy with a Tatar name.</span> <span id="s2864">And you are not surprised.</span> <span id="s2865">But if a Jew has a Jewish name it's strange."</span> <span id="s2866">Soviet Jews were deprived of anything Jewish except the word "Jew" on passport.</span> <span id="s2867">It's on the one hand.</span> <span id="s2868">But on the other hand they were treated like people of second quality, second rate.</span> <span id="s2869">They were Jews, not the same like Russian.</span> <span id="s2870">Do you understand this situation?</span> <span id="s2871">And one point more.</span> <span id="s2872">Soviet Jews are people from Soviet system that spoils everybody and everything!</span> <span id="s2873">And these people, Soviet Jews, come to America.</span> <span id="s2874">And you ask why many of them don't look nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">First reason they don't have much Jewishness, but it's not their fault, I explained it.</span> <span id="s2876">Second reason they are spoiled by the Soviet system awful system.</span> <span id="s2877">Third every nation has right to have different people: good and bad, clever and foolish and so on.</span> <span id="s2878">Many people come.</span> <span id="s2879">Most of them are simple people from the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s2880">Emigration is a very hard thing.</span> <span id="s2881">Sometimes during difficulties the worse traits are displayed.</span> <span id="s2882">If you asked why they left... Most of them left in order to escape antisemitism and injustice.</span> <span id="s2883">Some of them to escape Jewishness to become American instead of "people of secondquality."</span> <span id="s2884">I think that there are not many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">There are people who left because of bad economy, hunger and radiation.</span> <span id="s2886">There is a big group more and not many people in America know their reason.</span> <span id="s2887">I can tell you.</span> <span id="s2888">When in the USSR were published openly books, articles and many stories about awful Soviet history, about Stalin, repressions, prisons, camps and so on.</span> <span id="s2889">Then they found out about it (they did not know it before) and when they at last learned it they were seized with terror, they realized it is necessary to leave that country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">I think they will live in this beautiful country America.</span> <span id="s2891">Some of them will acclimate, some of them will come to Jewishness from Russian adaptation.</span> <span id="s2892">Some of them will be Jews like they are now.</span> <span id="s2893">I believe in America every one of them will be happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Dear Elaine!</span> <span id="s2895">My husband has read my oral history.</span> <span id="s2896">You know what he said?</span> <span id="s2897">"Listen, we live in this excellent country, we have troubles but they are normal troubles and worries about job, children, health, it is a normal life!</span> <span id="s2898">I have already forgotten about that nightmare!</span> <span id="s2899">And now I read and remember.</span> <span id="s2900">It is so awful!</span> <span id="s2901">I doubt that I will be able to give my interview!</span> <span id="s2902">It's so frustrating!"</span> <span id="s2903">But I believe it is only an emotional reaction and when he will be available he'll tell you his story.</span> <span id="s2904">He has much about his "experience," "education," refusenik activity and so on, much more than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Sincerely, Sulamith Excuse me for the many mistakes.</span> <span id="s2906">I send you a tape.</span> <span id="s2907">On the other side are nice Jewish children's songs.</span> <span id="s2908">April 18, 1991.</span></p></body></html>
