And when and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Bendezin, on the first day of Hanukkah 1916.</span> <span id="s16">But my parents registered me February first, 1917 to make me younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Can you tell us the full name of both of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My father’s name was Herman and my mother’s name was Rifka.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Di -- your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yes, Kermer.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: K-e-r-m-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And do you know the names of your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s25">I know -- I know the first name of my grandfather, who I admired.</span> <span id="s26">His name was -- was Morchai.</span> <span id="s27">The -- my grandmother’s name I have forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And daw -- and these are your paternal grandparents?</span> <span id="s29">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">It -- no, my maternal.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Your maternal, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And on the other side, do you re --</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, my father grew up as a -- after his par -- parents -- his parents died very, very early at his age.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the town that you born in, and that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s37">There were 31,000 Jews living in Bendezin.</span> <span id="s38">Of course there’s not a trace of them today in that town.</span> <span id="s39">Life was very interesting and families were extremely close.</span> <span id="s40">My grandfather lived across the street from our home.</span> <span id="s41">Life was not abundant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we felt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given the world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples.</span> <span id="s42">To set standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men should deal with -- with man.</span> <span id="s43">I went, as a youngster to a religious, Zionist school.</span> <span id="s44">I stayed there for about four years and then my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school.</span> <span id="s45">I remember Friday -- Fridays very well.</span> <span id="s46">My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken.</span> <span id="s47">And there was excitement of a Friday.</span> <span id="s48">Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and sometimes with my father to pray.</span> <span id="s49">The town on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence.</span> <span id="s50">You see only Jewish people marching to the synagogue, quietly.</span> <span id="s51">The prayers were -- were [indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in the air.</span> <span id="s52">I loved those Fridays and I loved those Saturdays.</span> <span id="s53">Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding towns were coming to our town in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into the shochet, the ritual slaughterer.</span> <span id="s54">They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the next Friday again.</span> <span id="s55">I was extremely happy in school, learning about Zionism, learning about -- about Jewish religion, and developing an extremely fond love for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s56">The city -- the cultural life in the city was on a very high level.</span> <span id="s57">There was a Jewish theater, there was a Jewish newspaper.</span> <span id="s58">There was a voluntary symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s59">There was a -- was a big library.</span> <span id="s60">And there were sports clubs, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events.</span> <span id="s61">The community, however, was divided.</span> <span id="s62">There were people who belonged to a very radical Zionist movement, the Zhabotinsky movement.</span> <span id="s63">And there were again [indecipherable] especially where some of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s64">And in the middle there was the mean, mean Zionist.</span> <span id="s65">People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left wingers.</span> <span id="s66">The Orthodox community was also divided.</span> <span id="s67">There were strictly Orthodox groups, and then there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but forming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely important.</span> <span id="s68">My two sisters belonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the Zortinsky movement, the movement that was teaching us to go and move to it -- to Israel and fight, I felt at that time that this is the only solution.</span> <span id="s69">In my town, I did not feel any anti-Semitism when I grew up, because there were not too many Gentiles in town, and there was no contact whatsoever between the Jewish community and the Christian community.</span> <span id="s70">We lived separate -- separate lives, not mingling with each other.</span> <span id="s71">I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very, very much, they really cared.</span> <span id="s72">I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that -- more pious than their husbands.</span> <span id="s73">School friends who were bookworms, and others who really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s74">But the discussions among all those groups were very heated.</span> <span id="s75">We really believed in our cause, and tried to convince those others to join us.</span> <span id="s76">We did not have any luck.</span> <span id="s77">They were also convinced in their just cause.</span> <span id="s78">There was a communist movement in town.</span> <span id="s79">Their aim was to move to Soviet Union, create a state there.</span> <span id="s80">I remember the name of the state that they were trying to -- to establish, they call it Biro Bijam.</span> <span id="s81">Someplace in Siberia.</span> <span id="s82">I did not meet any of them after the war, and I don’t believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Can you tell me some more about --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: About the group that you were involved in --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: -- that -- can you say the name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: It was a revisionist organization formed by a leader, his name was Zeev Zhabotinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And to become a member of that did you have to petition in any way, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s91">We did not have to do anything, you have to join them.</span> <span id="s92">[indecipherable] organization, and most of the people, please understand, were my age.</span> <span id="s93">Older people did not belong to those organizations, to those radical organizations.</span> <span id="s94">Most of them were part of the general Zionist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What did it mean to be a member, and how -- how did you get together?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: We were getting together sometimes in the evenings, but mostly Saturdays afternoon, discussing events in the Jewish world, expressing our opinion, and participating in all events that were taking place in our town, whenever somebody came to our town to speak to us.</span> <span id="s97">Those were really wonderful years, really wonderful years.</span> <span id="s98">My two sisters did belong to the general Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s99">And I’m not sure that I remember, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my organization, there were mostly men.</span> <span id="s100">I don’t remember any women in my organization.</span> <span id="s101">But in the general Zionist organization, there were a lot of women.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Can you tell us the names of your sisters?</span> <span id="s103">I don’t believe you --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: My older sister’s name was Esther.</span> <span id="s105">My younger sister’s name was Rushka.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And at this point when you were in this youth group, or this group, now how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: At that time I must have been 14.</span> <span id="s108">Around 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did your parents have opinions about the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No, my parents belonged to the general Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s111">This is perhaps one of the reasons that my sis -- two sisters joined that organization.</span> <span id="s112">They felt more comfortable.</span> <span id="s113">It may be also that most of their friends belonged to that same organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did anyone in the family have a strong reaction to the fact that you were in a separate group?</span> <span id="s115">What -- what, for instance, did your father or your mother say about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: My father and my mother were very tolerant people, and they felt that if this is what I would like to do, this is the organization that I would like to belong to, they will not interfere.</span> <span id="s117">They will not interfere, as long as it is a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s118">Did my uncles, who were very pious people object to it?</span> <span id="s119">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s121">They actually also belong to -- to radical Zionist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: What were the goals of the group that you were part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: The goal was, first of all, as long as we cannot move to Israel, to develop a strong sense of Jewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we had in school, reinforcing it in such a way that -- that we were more free to discuss things.</span> <span id="s124">And I don’t [indecipherable] discussing events and problems that are taking place not only in Poland, but all over the world.</span> <span id="s125">We used to get newspapers, discuss articles, have -- have opinions.</span> <span id="s126">And all of it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s127">We were looking forward to those meetings, sometimes in the evening, but most of the time on Saturdays afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: How did -- how do you make sense of a kind of -- th-the fact that you went your separate way from the family, and that you were very passionate?</span> <span id="s129">How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I was young, and I was concerned with the rest of -- the rest of -- with the members of [indecipherable] who felt that -- especially the older [indecipherable] that felt that we should not hasten the arrival of the Messiah, that we have no right to do things like this.</span> <span id="s131">I was resentful of it.</span> <span id="s132">And I strongly believed that only power will force the English people to let us come in.</span> <span id="s133">Only our determination and our willingness to fight and not wait for the goodwill of the English government, is the only solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting smuggled in there and becoming a -- a military --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Ye -- yes, yes.</span> <span id="s136">I know that some of my friends who still live in Israel came in 1936 or 1937 as illegal immigrants, being brought into Israel in a very clandestine way.</span> <span id="s137">I’m asking myself why didn’t I go.</span> <span id="s138">It’s a very painful question.</span> <span id="s139">Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and to feel that way, you have to have courage.</span> <span id="s140">Could be that I did not have the courage to go along with, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own.</span> <span id="s141">My family was a very close family, and I never developed a feeling that I can be alone.</span> <span id="s142">And that prevented me from making that fateful decision.</span> <span id="s143">In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that bothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters after I will be there, that they should do the same thing.</span> <span id="s144">It bothers me.</span> <span id="s145">On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our parents alone.</span> <span id="s146">They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this idea of going to Israel, and abandoning -- I’m using that word because this is the way they felt probably, abandoning our parents.</span> <span id="s147">My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in Kraków when I went to the university in 19 - nine -- 1936.</span> <span id="s148">In 1937 they joined me.</span> <span id="s149">I was transferring to the business academy.</span> <span id="s150">I went to the university only to be able to get into medical school.</span> <span id="s151">But the quota was very low and I didn't make it.</span> <span id="s152">I transferred to the business academy and my si -- two sisters came to Kraków to study.</span> <span id="s153">But at the same time, I’m not proud of myself, I’m proud of my youngest sister.</span> <span id="s154">We made a deal, all three of us, that every Friday one of us would go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents.</span> <span id="s155">My youngest sister never failed to go.</span> <span id="s156">I had sometimes a -- an event that I wanted to attend in Kraków, sports event or cultural event.</span> <span id="s157">On Friday morning I was turning to my youngest sister and tell Rushka, I am not going.</span> <span id="s158">It is my turn but I am not going, you better go.</span> <span id="s159">And she always went there.</span> <span id="s160">She never left my parents alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Talk a little bit about what -- ca -- what a regular day was like in your home, I guess this is before you went to the university, but when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s162">What your mother did during the day, a little bit about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: My father was a merchant.</span> <span id="s164">My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish family at that time, maybe even every Christian family.</span> <span id="s165">We had our store and building that my father built in 1929.</span> <span id="s166">We lived on the first floor and there were three floors above us.</span> <span id="s167">Was a very, very capable man, even though he grew up without his parents.</span> <span id="s168">He was a self taught individual who cared very much about the family.</span> <span id="s169">I was very close to him.</span> <span id="s170">My father, even though he had very little schooling, became in that city of 31,000 Jews, the vice president of [indecipherable] you can call it today the federation, or whatever you want to.</span> <span id="s171">That was very unusual because every two years were elections.</span> <span id="s172">This was not an appointed position, you had to win the election to -- to -- to be part of it.</span> <span id="s173">He won every election as long as -- as much as I remember.</span> <span id="s174">He had a very wonderful way of dealing with people, and my father became the [indecipherable] a representative of a big, big manufacturing firm in Lódz, and if people that are buying anything that were produced by that -- that manufacturing outfit, they had to come to us.</span> <span id="s175">And I also remember the recession.</span> <span id="s176">My father just finished building the house and all of a sudden it became very, very difficult to accept the fact that people are not paying their bills.</span> <span id="s177">And please understand that in most of the businesses, people were buying and mi -- and signing a note.</span> <span id="s178">And my father [indecipherable] those notes in the bank, all of a sudden he confronted the fact that they’re not paying their notes, and he has to -- he has to redeem those notes.</span> <span id="s179">It was a very difficult time because he locked himself in one of the rooms, and did not want to listen to anybody.</span> <span id="s180">But as I told you, my father grew up as an orphan, and he had the -- he had three brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s181">The older brother raised the family, and was a very wise man but lived in a different city, about 15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from Bendezin.</span> <span id="s182">And he came and stayed with my father for a long time and convince him that not everything is lost, and you should get in touch with this -- with that manufacturer in Lódz and see if they will help him.</span> <span id="s183">And that what happened.</span> <span id="s184">They came and they bailed out my father, who later on, of course, became again a very, very successful businessman.</span> <span id="s185">And those were times that were really threatening.</span> <span id="s186">We -- we felt that perhaps we have to -- we have to leave school, and that was to me, to my sisters, unacceptable.</span> <span id="s187">But thank God for my uncle, and that -- that manufacturing company in -- in ro -- in -- in Lódz that saved us and our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Do you remember the -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Just a -- a couple details.</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember the name of that manufacturing company?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, Karl Eisert, E-i-s-e-r-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Was it a -- a Polish, or German --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, those are Germans [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: And the name of your uncle, the uncle that helped your father, the older uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Liam.</span> <span id="s197">We called him Libish.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Liam Stroch.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Strochlitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And can you tell us a little bit about your mother?</span> <span id="s201">H-How your mother would spend an ordinary day.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Very good question.</span> <span id="s203">We had in the city two old age homes.</span> <span id="s204">The people couldn’t afford to stay home, they came and lived in those two age -- two old age homes, supported by the community.</span> <span id="s205">We had also a very beautiful home for orphans, there were a lot of orphans.</span> <span id="s206">My mother spent most of her time volunteering in those old age homes, and in the orphan home.</span> <span id="s207">And she derived a lot of satisfaction from that.</span> <span id="s208">On top of it, from time to time I used to see her in the store, helping my father.</span> <span id="s209">And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it is not correct because we had a maid that was with us for many, many years.</span> <span id="s210">And she -- my two sisters and I, when we’re youngsters, were more afraid of her than of my mother.</span> <span id="s211">She was a strict disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s212">We were afraid but we liked her very much because we probably realized that she is trying to do her best to -- to make us avoid getting in trouble.</span> <span id="s213">She was a Polish woman, and came during the war asking my parents to move.</span> <span id="s214">I as -- I tried many, many times to remember why my parents rejected the idea.</span> <span id="s215">I wish they would have accepted the idea.</span> <span id="s216">But there must have been some reason why they rejected the idea.</span> <span id="s217">After the war, I met a neighbor of ours who survived in hiding, the age of my parents.</span> <span id="s218">They told me, they were convinced that on the same street, my parents are hiding with that lady that worked for us.</span> <span id="s219">But it is a mystery to me why they rejected to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s220">And sometimes I feel -- I don’t know if I’m justified feeling that way, that they did not want to leave us alone, we were youngsters still.</span> <span id="s221">And sometimes I do believe, especially my father, who could not -- who could not perceive that people are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s222">He somehow looked at the German nation with admiration for their accomplishments, and he couldn’t visualize, probably -- and I am guessing just -- that those people who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and Bach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, are capable of committing such crimes, such heinous crimes.</span> <span id="s223">And he felt the war will end and on the [indecipherable] but I’m guessing, just.</span> <span id="s224">But he -- if he will go into hiding and we be discovered, he’ll be shot.</span> <span id="s225">Am I sure about it?</span> <span id="s226">No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s227">But I was thinking many times about it, and those thoughts crossed my mind.</span> <span id="s228">I wish they would have listened to her.</span> <span id="s229">She was a wonderful woman, but it’s water over the dam.</span> <span id="s230">It happened, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s233">Antosia, A-n-t-o-s-i-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And she was also from Bendezin?</span> <span id="s235">Where was she from?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: From the same town, or a neighboring town [indecipherable] I’m not sure any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What language was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: We -- I mean, my sisters and I were communicating in Polish.</span> <span id="s239">But my father was a Yiddishist, and there was a newspaper in Warsaw by the name of Hient, on a very, very high level.</span> <span id="s240">I always compare it with the New York Times today.</span> <span id="s241">And we were getting that paper every day, a Yiddish paper, and if during the luncheon my two sisters and I did not know what a very famous journalist was writing today in the paper -- his name was Margoshis, my father used to be very, very upset with us.</span> <span id="s242">And he enjoyed having those discussions in that -- at the table in the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s243">There is [indecipherable] something that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s244">My youngest sister, before going in the room for lunch was telling around to me always, Sigmund, did you read Margoshis’ column today?</span> <span id="s245">You told me what it was.</span> <span id="s246">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: When do you remember becoming aware of a change in your life, o-of being apprehensive in any way about the future?</span> <span id="s248">That possibly something was going to change?</span> <span id="s249">Or would -- perhaps hearing about Hitler, or Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s251">We were glued to the radios, listening to his speeches, and we were frightened.</span> <span id="s252">But at the same time I do remember that there was a feeling among a lot of people that he is talking about it only in order to gain power, and to exercise power.</span> <span id="s253">But perhaps it’s empty talk.</span> <span id="s254">And still we were frightened.</span> <span id="s255">Now of course, on the first of September 1939, when they came to town, we immediately realized that it is not just talk.</span> <span id="s256">There were two events the first two days of -- after they came to town that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s257">One were a family by the name of Schlesinger, father and two sons, running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning synagogue, the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burned the synagogue.</span> <span id="s258">They were able to run in and bring out two Torahs.</span> <span id="s259">When they emerged from the burning synagogue, the Nazis shot them on the spot.</span> <span id="s260">That was one event that of course frightened us.</span> <span id="s261">The second, han -- in hindsight, it was a policy probably, to frighten the people.</span> <span id="s262">On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don’t remember any more, they came to -- to -- they entered homes and took out some leaders.</span> <span id="s263">And I don’t remember -- remember today how many, but must have been at least five or six, and hanged them in the middle of the market.</span> <span id="s264">For nothing.</span> <span id="s265">For the fact that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s266">That frightened us quite a bit, quite a bit.</span> <span id="s267">The people were really naïve in ’39.</span> <span id="s268">They lived during the first World War, and they felt it’s going to be a static war.</span> <span id="s269">And what my parents did is to move part of the business to a town by the name of Jarolsitsa around 30 or 40 kilometers from my town, believing that the war will not -- that the Germans will not come as far, and they will survive and return.</span> <span id="s270">Of course, it turned out to be an illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in the -- together with my parents in that town, that all of a sudden you realize that the ger -- Germans are moving very fast.</span> <span id="s271">And the young people were trying to hitchhike and go east after learning that the Soviet Union have entered the war, and occupying east of Poland.</span> <span id="s272">We strongly believed that we can survive there.</span> <span id="s273">I was one of them, and my sisters did not join me.</span> <span id="s274">Again, I was thinking why, why did it happen.</span> <span id="s275">And then I remember -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all those seven or eight or nine days that it took me to hitchhike to eastern Poland to the city of Lvov, I don’t remember seeing on the roads -- the roads were crowded -- too many young ladies, too many young women walking and trying to hitchhike and -- to the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s276">Why?</span> <span id="s277">I don’t have really a good answer.</span> <span id="s278">I don’t know why, but those were the facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Can we just go back to the first day that the Germans arrive in your town.</span> <span id="s280">If you can remember where you were, h-how you knew they were there.</span> <span id="s281">W-What it looked like, even smelled like?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: How it looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s284">When they arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: We were at the windows.</span> <span id="s286">They came in in tanks, just shooting around indiscriminately.</span> <span id="s287">We are afraid to leave the home -- our houses.</span> <span id="s288">And then, I remember the ger -- Germans breaking into stores, taking whatever they wanted as though it’s -- it’s theirs.</span> <span id="s289">Breaking into homes, and taking paintings or whatever they found, and cutting it away.</span> <span id="s290">Of course, that was really frightening, our age, to understand that people can come -- just come in and take away something that my father worked all his life, without any -- any consideration about anything.</span> <span id="s291">Was perhaps a moment when we felt that life will not be the same any more, that life has changed.</span> <span id="s292">I also remember that when they ever -- when they saw a Jew on the streets with a beard, they were cutting it off, and laughing, and kicking people.</span> <span id="s293">I don’t remember all those -- all the time that they occupied Bendezin [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s294">I don’t remember to confront or being confronted by a German who showed sympathy for us, or gave us a piece of bread, even though my wife remembers that there was a German in Kraków who helped her.</span> <span id="s295">But I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s296">All my anger at the German people blocks my -- my willingness to accept there could have been a good German.</span> <span id="s297">Of course I changed my mind lately.</span> <span id="s298">But that could have been behind me not remembering that there were at least one German who tried to show sympathy or tried to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What did you do in those days, did your -- did your father sort of give you orders to stay in the house, or were you trying to have contact with your youth group?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Oh no, we did not have any comfort of the youth group any more, everything was -- came to a standstill.</span> <span id="s301">In the first few days I stayed home, but I went with my parents to the city of Jarolsitsa, where as I told you before I was hitchhiking to the -- to eastern -- to eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s302">But after being in Lvov, and I don’t remember, three or four months, my father sent a mi -- a mis -- an emissary to tell me that I should return home, that things have calmed down and life is almost normal.</span> <span id="s303">My faith in the wisdom of my father was absolutely boundless.</span> <span id="s304">I went back.</span> <span id="s305">I had a difficult trip.</span> <span id="s306">I was on the floor -- i-in the city of [indecipherable] that were only about 10 miles from my town, on the floor of the railroad station.</span> <span id="s307">They run -- came running in, trying to find Jews and drag them out.</span> <span id="s308">I was on -- I was somehow lying between two or three Gentiles and they missed me.</span> <span id="s309">Within the next day or two days later, I came to town.</span> <span id="s310">As I told you, my father was a -- was the vice-president of [indecipherable] and he were very close to a -- to young people that were in town form -- they formed a kibbutz that they were together trying to emigrate to Israel, waiting for certificates to Israel.</span> <span id="s311">And they were -- they were involved in -- in -- in producing -- in -- in -- in planting, I’m sorry, not producing, planting food, potatoes and tomatoes.</span> <span id="s312">And that was very important and my father, on behalf of the Judenrat, this is the way they called that federation that I mentioned before, was supervising that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s313">I was -- my father brought me in and I stayed for awhile, also helping.</span> <span id="s314">And then something very unusual happened.</span> <span id="s315">I got hold of a book with certain laws that the German observe, and I notice that there is a law saying that people who work in defense industries -- and we had three enterprises working for German defense industry in town, they’re entitled to additional meat.</span> <span id="s316">They call them sverarbeiter, people who work hard.</span> <span id="s317">I took advantage of the law.</span> <span id="s318">I went to the authorities and I was successful to convince them that those people over there are entitled to more meat.</span> <span id="s319">And I used to get every week meat designated for them.</span> <span id="s320">There was a sausage factory in town [indecipherable] in the nearer -- neighbor town -- neighboring town, Sosnowiec, where we worked hard and produced sausages.</span> <span id="s321">Of course it was much easier to distribute sausages and to cut meat for [indecipherable] and this is where I worked from 1940 or ’41, until deportation of the -- in sep -- August of 1939 -- 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: I just want to go over a few details, just -- just to k-kind of clarify a few things.</span> <span id="s323">So within a few days, your parents packed up a few things and moved to a neighboring town, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: The name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Jarolsitsa</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: The day after that, it was agreed upon that you would go to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I’m not sure it was a day after or three, four days after.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Just tell us if you can, just briefly, a little bit about what you did in Lvov.</span> <span id="s330">You were there for three or four months, what -- what was it like at that point?</span> <span id="s331">Was it a refuge center?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was able to find a family.</span> <span id="s335">They were butchers, and they said to me, alright, we will give you a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s336">So basically what I needed is to earn enough money to buy food.</span> <span id="s337">The soldiers, the Russian soldiers were absolutely obsessed with getting a watch, getting watches.</span> <span id="s338">This was their mean -- mean d-desire, to get watches.</span> <span id="s339">I used to go out and try to find out who wants to sell a watch and sell it to them and buy food.</span> <span id="s340">This is the way I lived for the -- for those three or four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Were you comfortable there with the Russian soldiers versus the German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, yes, I was much more comfortable until all of a sudden the Russians were transporting my friends to Siberia.</span> <span id="s343">And -- and that bothered me.</span> <span id="s344">I thought they might be able to come and pick me up, too.</span> <span id="s345">And as I said to you before, when my father sent somebody to convince me to go back, and I said to you that I had boundless faith in the wisdom of my father, sitting here just now, I also believe that I was afraid, especially that I came from a family that was a wealthy family, that I would end up in Siberia.</span> <span id="s346">It was hard to realizing what to expect home.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: I wanted to think back, when you returned from your three to four months in Lvov, what did your hometown look like?</span> <span id="s350">Had it changed in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: As a matter of fact it did not.</span> <span id="s352">Life all of a sudden became semi-normal.</span> <span id="s353">The Germans putting men, they called them the [indecipherable] who was now [indecipherable] together with my father.</span> <span id="s354">Not giving anything to us, not -- being guided by my father.</span> <span id="s355">And we -- life became semi-normal.</span> <span id="s356">We were walking the streets.</span> <span id="s357">I am not sure that I remember if our youth group met.</span> <span id="s358">I had doubts about -- I have doubts about it.</span> <span id="s359">But people worked, as I told you in those defense factories, and the illusion that we will survive the war became much stronger.</span> <span id="s360">That was 1940 - ’41.</span> <span id="s361">And furthermore, young people were -- were taken away by the Germans to Germany to work there.</span> <span id="s362">And here the -- the image of the man who was in charge of all those communities, all those Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M-e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary.</span> <span id="s363">Perhaps in this -- that feeling came to me only after the war, because during war I was very unhappy with the fact that he is cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s364">But he understood that people who work are being sent to Germany to help in their defense industry, may have a much better chance than others.</span> <span id="s365">Even though I remember discussions in our groups at that time, quoting a very fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the enemy comes, and he is asking to hand him o -- hand them over one person that they are going to kill, the community should never accept it.</span> <span id="s366">Yes, we should all -- all of us should go.</span> <span id="s367">But Merin felt -- felt differently.</span> <span id="s368">He felt on the contrary that this cooperation with the Germans and imbu -- imbued young people -- not imbued them, but forcing young people to -- to accept the fact that they are going to be deported, and they are going to be working in Germany, was perhaps a very good idea.</span> <span id="s369">Most of them, most of them survived the war.</span> <span id="s370">[indecipherable] the war, we young people couldn’t accept his decisions of cooperation with the enemy.</span> <span id="s371">On the other hand, again in hindsight, they had -- if he would not have, the Germans would have taken over everything and massacred us, like they did later on when they invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942.</span> <span id="s372">They came to towns and just took out people and killed them, massacred.</span> <span id="s373">And maybe we avoided that fate.</span> <span id="s374">Maybe.</span> <span id="s375">But of course, that he will found that he has a good relationship with the Gestapo, and he can do many things.</span> <span id="s376">But again, misleading people.</span> <span id="s377">He couldn’t -- yes, he could get somebody out of a transport to Germany, but he was really fulfilling their wishes.</span> <span id="s378">If he had not have done it, would there be other people in town who would have taken over the function?</span> <span id="s379">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s380">I don’t condemn him any more like I used to during the war, and immediately after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s381">He fulfilled a certain function in the life of the Jewish people in Bendezin, Sosnowiec and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You -- you’re talking about Moshe Merin?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s385">Wa -- was he in your town before the Germans came, or -- how was he a part of your town before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: He was not a very highly respected person before the war.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t remember anything about his family, but I know that he was not among the people who gained the respect of others.</span> <span id="s388">How he emerged as a leader in 1939 is to me a mystery.</span> <span id="s389">Maybe there are others who lived closer to him.</span> <span id="s390">Maybe they know the answers.</span> <span id="s391">I am unable to remember and tell you why he emerged as a leader of the Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s392">He was not elected, of course, there were no elections.</span> <span id="s393">Something must have happened that the Germans either agreed or appointed him to be the head of the Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s394">Not only the Jewish community in his town, Sosnowiec, it was this -- it had a -- probably the same [indecipherable] we had probably between 30 or 31,000 Jews and next town [indecipherable] other small surrounding towns.</span> <span id="s395">He became the leader.</span> <span id="s396">Why?</span> <span id="s397">I have no answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Can you talk -- we’re talking a little bit about their being discussion within the community and some people felt that Moshe Merin was -- was collaborating, cooperating with the enemy.</span> <span id="s399">What did people who disagreed with what he was doing, what did they think should be done?</span> <span id="s400">And then of course, what did you think?</span> <span id="s401">You disapproved at that time of him.</span> <span id="s402">What did you think he should be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: What he should be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Well, you spoke about disagreeing with the fact that he cooperated in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: In many ways, with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What -- what did you think he should have done instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: He couldn’t do anything instead.</span> <span id="s410">I suppose that, as I said before, they would have found another man, another substitution to making [indecipherable] and cooperate with them.</span> <span id="s411">You know, I used an expression that I learned someplace, that Moshe Merin and we are confronted with choiceless choices.</span> <span id="s412">There was no way to -- to change anything.</span> <span id="s413">We had no choices.</span> <span id="s414">And again, I do believe that -- that his -- his cooperation saved a certain number of Jewish people who were sent to Germany and survived.</span> <span id="s415">There is nothing, no justification for cooperating with the Germans, and preparing lists of people that are going to be taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s416">No.</span> <span id="s417">No, it is not.</span> <span id="s418">But he may have thought, as I said before, that we are going to be exposed to massacres, that nobody will survive.</span> <span id="s419">Those are feelings that I had after the war, not during the war.</span> <span id="s420">There were other leaders in Poland that took upon themselves to cooperate and save.</span> <span id="s421">Perhaps under the illusion that time is -- will be on our side, if we will drag it out, the war will come to an end.</span> <span id="s422">Of course, that was an e -- just an illusion.</span> <span id="s423">That’s illusion, and before the war, when we listened to Hitler, I thought it’s just talk.</span> <span id="s424">It was not just talk.</span> <span id="s425">He meant it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Did you ever meet Moshe Merin or hear him speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s428">When you say meet, I hope you’re not implying that I was sitting down with him and having a discussion, no.</span> <span id="s429">But I met him, perhaps several times, when he came to town and was speaking and again everything -- people to follow him and to leave and be -- to accept the fact that they’re going to be shipped to Germany, and convincing -- trying to convince people that that is -- that they will survive, they will have -- they will work under completely different conditions, that they -- they will not die out of hunger or disease.</span> <span id="s430">But I was never involved in any -- in any conversations with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: When he spoke at a public rally like that, saying those kinds of things, what were people saying in the crowd?</span> <span id="s432">Did you every overhear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What were they thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s436">Not -- I assume that there were those who believed him, and those who had doubts about what he is saying.</span> <span id="s437">But this is natural, it is normal.</span> <span id="s438">If a majority believed him, or a minority believed him, who knows?</span> <span id="s439">Who knows?</span> <span id="s440">But again, as I said before, it turned out that most of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Can you describe life at this point in the town?</span> <span id="s442">Tell us a little bit more about how your father’s shop is run.</span> <span id="s443">You mentioned a German being there to help him.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Not to help him, he -- h-he -- he -- he was there to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Your father was there to help the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: What -- what was the atmosphere in the shop like, and again what was daily life like?</span> <span id="s448">Was there enough food?</span> <span id="s449">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I don’t believe that I -- I thought that I was ever hungry.</span> <span id="s451">How did we get food?</span> <span id="s452">Yes, there were some stores open and -- and I do remember that Poles, they come to town and send food.</span> <span id="s453">When I say that my father was there to help them, even though -- even though he was not paid, but I do remember that permit -- perhaps with their permission or with none -- no -- not -- not get -- getting their permission, he used to take out from the store certain things from the store and sell them.</span> <span id="s454">And that was a blessing, cause we could buy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And when the Germans came to town were there any new laws they passed, that insisted that you give them personal items?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Do you know if you were present for any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: If what?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: If -- if -- if you experienced any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, they came to town, and after a few weeks everyone had to wear that yellow band and the sign Juden here.</span> <span id="s461">Of course this was already demeaning, and something [indecipherable] and such a state of mind, you are losing your faith, yeah.</span> <span id="s462">Your world is sudden start to feel that you are something that is -- has to live on a much lower level.</span> <span id="s463">And, as I told you, we are in school -- there’s a school, we -- we were very proud of be-belonging to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s464">When they came, immediately brought us down completely, taking away our confidence.</span> <span id="s465">And perhaps [indecipherable] they -- they took away a -- our faith and resistance, even though in my town there was a group of young people who somehow were able to secure a gun or two guns.</span> <span id="s466">They killed a German in the street.</span> <span id="s467">Of course, they later, the Germans came in and of course they took most of the young people and killed them.</span> <span id="s468">I’m not sure most, but a certain number of people that they killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s469">That what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: You’ve mentioned two situations now of being -- sounded like they were asking people to go to Germany, and then in this case rounding up people after the resistance attack.</span> <span id="s471">How did you escape those two situations?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: First of all, I hope you don’t mind if I will correct something in your statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Not asking people to go to Germany, deporting people to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s475">I hope you don’t mind --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: -- but I -- I am correcting that.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Well, let me clarify.</span> <span id="s479">So at that point when Moshe Merin, it’s -- it’s not a sign up, he’s not -- he’s just justifying.</span> <span id="s480">He’s not telling people that they should volunteer to go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, he was the per --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: He’s justifying a certain deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And preparing the lists of people that should be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: What was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: I-I wanted to know in those two situations, how were you able to avoid, in the first one being chosen, in the second being rounded up perhaps if I’m -- if I’m imagining it --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes, yeah, I avoided it because of the influence of my father, and the fact that I was working on that kibbutz and being protected that way, being healed that way.</span> <span id="s492">That was [indecipherable] that I was not deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Will you tell us a little bit about the influence of your father at that point in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Oh, his influence was diminished to a great extent, but he knew the members, all the members of the Judenrat, and he was kept in very high respect, perhaps he avoided, or he was able to -- to convince them not to put me on the list, that somebody else go in -- in my place.</span> <span id="s495">I’m sure somebody else went and took my place.</span> <span id="s496">Did I think of it at that time?</span> <span id="s497">No.</span> <span id="s498">But after the war, you know, you are going back, you are trying to determine in your own mind what happened.</span> <span id="s499">And I came to the conclusion that somebody else was deported in my place.</span> <span id="s500">It’s not a very comfortable feeling, but again, that expression that I used, choiceless choices, comes to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: At this point -- at this point, is your father -- you’re a young man, is your father talking to you in any way about the future or choices that may have to be made?</span> <span id="s502">Perhaps even a strategy of how to deal with danger, I guess is the best word for it.</span> <span id="s503">At this point people are being deported, people are being rounded up, they’re being shot in the street.</span> <span id="s504">Are you and your father having any discussions about what may come for you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I don’t remember any specific discussions, but a lot of people in town were building hiding places in the basements that were really difficult to discover.</span> <span id="s506">And by -- and my father, of course, built such a place in our home.</span> <span id="s507">No, he build that place of hiding only after they brought us into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s508">In our home he did not, but after they brought us into the ghetto, he build a place of hiding.</span> <span id="s509">And that was perhaps the best indication how bad the situation is.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Can you describe where the place was, or how it was hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: The place -- yeah, the place was in our basement, and the entrance for the -- to the -- to the hiding place was -- was -- was done in a way to disguise it, how?</span> <span id="s512">By putting a -- putting a big credenza, or whatever you call it at that time to hide the entrance.</span> <span id="s513">And there were no signs, if I remember correctly that there is a [indecipherable] even if you moved out the -- the -- the furniture that was there.</span> <span id="s514">At the same time, the Germans learned, especially in homes of more important people that they build hiding places in there, and they found most of them, or all of them.</span> <span id="s515">It was again only another illusion.</span> <span id="s516">But you have to live with illusions in times like this.</span> <span id="s517">Life becomes unbearable if you don’t have any illusions.</span> <span id="s518">We lost faith, we lost confidence, but if you lose illusions too, then -- then you are hopelessly paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What do you mean when you say you lost faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: We lost faith in ourselves after they put those yellow bands and wearing that sign Juden.</span> <span id="s521">It was difficult for us to understand.</span> <span id="s522">If you are referring to faith as faith in God, I am not sure at that point that we lost faith in God.</span> <span id="s523">We lost faith in man, but I am not sure that we lost faith in God, but we lost faith after arriving in Auschwitz, completely in God, seeing what is happening.</span> <span id="s524">And there’s a very interesting change of minds among people who arrived in Auschwitz and were my friends or acquaintances.</span> <span id="s525">Maybe after the war I understood it.</span> <span id="s526">People who were in my town who I knew were very pious people, very pious people.</span> <span id="s527">[indecipherable] starting to challenge God, mocking.</span> <span id="s528">Maybe mocking is a too strong word.</span> <span id="s529">And on the contrary, my friends who are atheists in town, who belonged as I told you before to that left wing organization and communists -- I’m not sure about communist, but who belo -- belonged to the left wing organizations, and were atheists, all of a sudden became belie -- they became believers.</span> <span id="s530">Why?</span> <span id="s531">And again, after analyzing it, I have one answer.</span> <span id="s532">Here I have an answer.</span> <span id="s533">I think that the atheists became more believing, blaming themselves for creating that situation and forcing the wrath of God.</span> <span id="s534">And the other group, the religious group couldn’t understand that God is not interfering.</span> <span id="s535">They learned in Jewish history that God interfered in many instances in Egypt or -- or Persia, whatever.</span> <span id="s536">Why is He all of a sudden becoming invisible.</span> <span id="s537">Why is he not interfering?</span> <span id="s538">Seeing small children that are innocent being thrown into the fire.</span> <span id="s539">If I am innocent -- if I am guilty, fine.</span> <span id="s540">But how can you permit small children being th-thrown into the fire?</span> <span id="s541">But again, a change happened in me too, later on.</span> <span id="s542">I realized that without faith in God, or faith in a human -- in entity that is -- that is managing the world, it’s very difficult for this, very difficult for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: At some point in all of this, you -- you get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: When I came back to town, I -- perhaps several months later, either it was the second part of 1940, I got married.</span> <span id="s549">I got married to somebody who was in my class in school, and with whom I was very close all those years.</span> <span id="s550">We were what you call today sweethearts.</span> <span id="s551">And even though we accepted that we should not bring -- and we should not bring people -- well, you should not raise a family, that -- perhaps that was the expression, to have children, we wanted to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Why did you -- why did you think that you should not raise a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Because I thought at that point that perhaps there’s an uncertain future, and perhaps also it -- it will be easier to survive without having to shield or protect small kids.</span> <span id="s554">And we were young, we thought the war would end, and we can have children at that time.</span> <span id="s555">We felt it’s irresponsible for people getting married to ha -- to try to build a family, build a family into a very uncertain future and having to protect those children, that is no way for us really to protect.</span> <span id="s556">And it is a mistake, a big mistake to raise a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Can you tell us your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Sabina, S-a-b-i-n-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Koninski, K-o-n-i-n-s-k-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And can you describe your actual wedding, were you able to have a -- a -- a ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: The ceremony took place at her home, only family were invited.</span> <span id="s563">Was it a happy ceremony?</span> <span id="s564">I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s565">It was a ceremony with lack of enthusiasm, even though we were deeply in love with each other, but how could you become happy in to the [indecipherable] times when you knew that things are going very, very badly, that who knows if you will survive.</span> <span id="s566">So why did we marry?</span> <span id="s567">We married -- when you are 19 or 20, you are -- and you went out with your future wife for six, seven years, a desire to get married -- the desire to get married is stronger than logic.</span> <span id="s568">Much stronger than logic.</span> <span id="s569">Her parents were pushing, even though my parents were reluctant.</span> <span id="s570">And we got married.</span> <span id="s571">I don’t have any regrets.</span> <span id="s572">I was in love with my future wife for many years.</span> <span id="s573">I do believe that I made that -- at that time, the right decision even though my parents were not very happy about it.</span> <span id="s574">And they participated in the wedding, together with my sisters, and never mentioned anything to anybody that they are uncom -- not that I know of, that they are uncomfortable with the marriage.</span> <span id="s575">I’m -- I don’t believe that I am -- that I know more about it, or I remember more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We lived in the same town that our parents lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So you had your own apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No.</span> <span id="s580">We lived with an aunt of my wife at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And can you tell us a little bit about what work you were doing?</span> <span id="s582">You’ve mentioned it, but if you can just describe it a little bit more.</span> <span id="s583">How many days a week, where was it, how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Where you were working at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah, I was every day there.</span> <span id="s587">I was every day in that factory or trying t --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: You were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I were -- I was every day in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Every day, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: -- sausage factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: All trying to go to -- to Katowice where the headquarters were, of the German region.</span> <span id="s594">And trying to get again, permission to -- to get some meat.</span> <span id="s595">And that was my function.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And were you assigned to that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, I -- I read the law and it -- and all of a sudden I realized that maybe I can help.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: So after you read the law and brought it up, who -- who put you in that job?</span> <span id="s599">A: My father helped me to put into the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: And what did you actually do?</span> <span id="s601">Were you managing the sausage making?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I was managing and trying to be fair in distribution.</span> <span id="s605">It’s not easy to be fair in situations like this.</span> <span id="s606">Even though I don’t remember being accused of treating people -- one group of people more favorable than the other, I don’t remember being accused of that.</span> <span id="s607">Was I unfair?</span> <span id="s608">I am sure that I was trying to be fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Can you talk a little bit about people in town who were ha -- you’ve -- you felt were collaborating or you had evidence that they were collaborating with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: When you are saying people in town collaborating with the Germans, I don’t believe that I used that expression before.</span> <span id="s611">We were talking about Moshe Merin collaborating with Germans.</span> <span id="s612">Were there others?</span> <span id="s613">Of course there were others.</span> <span id="s614">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: I’m talking about someone who might -- might s -- tell a German that you had -- that a person had taken an extra sausage without asking, or inform, or spy on people.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes, unfortunately that happens.</span> <span id="s617">There were some who were informing on neighbors, leading some Germans to -- to homes where they could take more -- take -- take out valuable things.</span> <span id="s618">This is very -- was very regrettable.</span> <span id="s619">Do you have to be informer to survive?</span> <span id="s620">I don’t believe so, but there were informers, and not only there were informers, the Germans have insisted on having a police force, a Jewish police force in town.</span> <span id="s621">And those police officers, whenever there was a day that they were trying to round up people and deport them to Auschwitz or any other place, they were -- that Jewish police force were working with the Germans.</span> <span id="s622">This I wish would have never happened.</span> <span id="s623">And again, would it have led to a massacre?</span> <span id="s624">Could very well be, if they would not have -- if the Jewish police would not have cooperated with them, that could very well be.</span> <span id="s625">But -- but perhaps, same thing, who am I to judge somebody who has -- who wants to save him and his family?</span> <span id="s626">Difficult, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did you have -- can you tell us when you first heard of the idea of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: It must have been at the end of ’42 or the beginning of ’43.</span> <span id="s629">That’s -- again, we heard about the ghettos much earlier, because they have -- the Germans established ghettos in different towns before they did it in my town.</span> <span id="s630">Why?</span> <span id="s631">Maybe because my town was incorporated into Germany, and the others were in Poland, were the -- where they could -- where there were no publicity.</span> <span id="s632">Even though there were no publicity, nobody really was trying to inform the western world at that time what is happening.</span> <span id="s633">But the fact that we were incorporated into Germany must have been a factor, that we were living to the ghetto only at the end of ’42, and perhaps even ni -- perhaps -- perhaps not in ’42, but in ’43.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t remember the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So you remember the ghetto coming towards the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: ’43.</span> <span id="s637">Before we were deported to -- before the -- there was a complete liquidation of the ghetto that took place on August 1943.</span> <span id="s638">There was no -- there was -- we knew that there are -- that there are qu -- establishing ghettos in different towns, and perhaps that one day it would happened in our town too, and it happened.</span> <span id="s639">But again, I remember people who were -- who were terribly disposed to Merin, saying that he is avoiding it, that he is trying to avoid, the he is trying to convince them not to -- not to deport us into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s640">Did he have so much power?</span> <span id="s641">I doubt it very, very much.</span> <span id="s642">I doubt it very, very much.</span> <span id="s643">But people -- some people believed in his good relationship with the Gestapo and that we can avoid it.</span> <span id="s644">But the decisions were not of local Gestapo people or even district Gestapo people.</span> <span id="s645">Decisions were made in Berlin.</span> <span id="s646">They get -- they got the -- got the letter, or whatever.</span> <span id="s647">Building has to be a ghetto by the first of June or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s648">And they were just fulfilling the wishes of the main authorities in Berlin.</span> <span id="s649">So I have doubt that he could influence local authorities to postpone it.</span> <span id="s650">They would have been probably put into jail or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not obeying.</span> <span id="s651">Not obeying a decision made in Berlin would have cost them their lives.</span> <span id="s652">So I have great doubts that Merin was able to postpone our being deported into the ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Can you describe what it wa -- what actually happened when you went to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s654">I mean, how much warning were you given, did you just walk out of your house and leave most everything there, your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: -- did you try to find your parents that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No, I don’t remember, but must have been -- has -- had one or two days warnings that we have to go into the ghettos, and again that Judenrat assigned different apartments.</span> <span id="s658">It’s extremely crowded.</span> <span id="s659">We got, I believe, two rooms for the entire family.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: So this --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: But on the other hand, and again it’s hindsight -- not hindsight, but thinking about it later on, we may have felt that at that time, ’42, or the beginning of ’43, that this is the way we will survive.</span> <span id="s662">If they are creating or building ghettos, they are not going to take us to annihilation camps.</span> <span id="s663">And that was a comforting -- comforting th-thought.</span> <span id="s664">But again, an il-illusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So you had heard of annihilation camps at -- you remember hearing about them before you actually went -- went to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: I would say that in ’43, we knew, much more than in ’42.</span> <span id="s667">We knew from emissaries who came to us, warning us that -- that there’s an Auschwitz, and there’s a Birkenau, and there’s a Treblinka and they are sent -- shipping those all -- deporting those people those camps, and the older people, and the kids and children and women are being immediately sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s668">But there was one -- one event.</span> <span id="s669">One of the people who were in the train to Auschwitz from my town, were able before the train stopped in Birkenau to jump out of the train and made it back to town.</span> <span id="s670">And he came back and he was telling everybody that -- what happened, and that we are going to be all of us shipped to Birkenau and that we will not survive.</span> <span id="s671">That was a warning that came very late, must have been ’43, maybe June or July of ’43.</span> <span id="s672">But what could we have done?</span> <span id="s673">We were dealing -- or living in a country with a population who are very hostile to us.</span> <span id="s674">When I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don’t know, I will guess 85 - 90 percent of the people very hostile to us.</span> <span id="s675">They were taking some money, promising to -- to sell out -- bring out guns, never happened.</span> <span id="s676">They were denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they saw somebody who looked like Jewish and was trying to -- to go to -- to another town without that yellow band.</span> <span id="s677">They -- they had a way of recognizing Jews, and denouncing them.</span> <span id="s678">So what could we have done in June, July of 1943?</span> <span id="s679">Very little Very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: You say when you went into the ghetto that that -- it was crowded.</span> <span id="s681">Who at that point were you living with?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: With my --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: In -- in the ghetto, when you went into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s685">I was living with my wife with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So then at that point you and your wife did move in with your parents.</span> <span id="s687">And your two sisters were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Was your grandfather there?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No, my grandfather died before the war, and my grandmother died before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Describe the room -- the rooms that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: They were in a part of town they call it kamyonka.</span> <span id="s693">Very poor people lived there, very poor people, so you can imagine the rooms.</span> <span id="s694">I do believe that we had a toilet.</span> <span id="s695">I do believe that we had to go outside.</span> <span id="s696">But as I said before, and that -- I am reinforcing it now in my own mind.</span> <span id="s697">It could very well be that we thought at that time that being in the ghetto will shield us of being -- being deported to a death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: How were the sleeping arrangements?</span> <span id="s699">I mean, were -- did your mother and father have one room, or were you in --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No, I think -- I am not sure that I remember, but somehow we managed to sleep on the floor, whatever.</span> <span id="s701">We managed.</span> <span id="s702">We did not let our parents sleep on the floor, but we were probably lying down on the floor, and I can’t imagine beds for so many people in those small rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: What happened to your house?</span> <span id="s704">Your house, your parent’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yeah, the German took it over, it was a very nice house.</span> <span id="s706">The Germans took it over.</span> <span id="s707">There was one Polish family living in that town, he was a doctor, his name was Bialy, B-i-a -- B-i-a-l-y, with whom I was close.</span> <span id="s708">I used to spend some evenings in the 40’s in his apartment discussing -- discussing events.</span> <span id="s709">Was he also removed from that -- from my father’s -- or from our ho -- house, I don’t remember, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s710">I only remember that my father gave him -- we had some paintings.</span> <span id="s711">I’m not sure how valuable those paintings were, there were no -- not Picassos.</span> <span id="s712">But he gave him some paintings in order to -- in order to preserve them and give it -- give them back to us after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Was there anything else that your family did take with them into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s714">What else did your father take?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes, I am -- yes, we took certain things -- will I be able today to describe them, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s716">Of course we took certain things with us.</span> <span id="s717">Yes, I do remember that we were wheeling something, and everybody was.</span> <span id="s718">But what can you take, you know?</span> <span id="s719">You don’t have anyth -- any buses or -- or trucks to -- to transfer.</span> <span id="s720">You took something that was -- that you felt -- our parents felt it would be absolutely necessary to have.</span> <span id="s721">Pretty sure it was things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Were there any family items or religious artifacts that -- that were included in the things that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I doubt that there were religious artifacts.</span> <span id="s724">The family, I am not sure any more.</span> <span id="s725">I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And also, money, what -- what -- was there anyplace that you hid money, or hid money on -- in your clothes, or jewelry --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: M-My father hid money in a garden.</span> <span id="s728">It was not far from our home.</span> <span id="s729">Yes, I am positive about it.</span> <span id="s730">But after the war, a friend of mine who I told exactly where the money should be, went back to Poland, finally to dig -- dig the money out, didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s731">People knew probably that my father is trying to hide certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: I-In -- what were you -- were you able to cele -- you know, honor the Sabbath i-in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s733">Ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: My father was not a religious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s736">Can you tell us a little bit about that, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yes, I will tell you, my f -- we celebrated Friday nights with our families.</span> <span id="s738">They were very happy Friday nights.</span> <span id="s739">He observed most of the rituals, all the holidays.</span> <span id="s740">He observed very s -- very strictly, with one of us.</span> <span id="s741">But he -- yes, during the holidays he was going to -- to the synagogue, but every Saturday morning, my mother was taking me to my grandfather, who was waiting already on the outside, and leading me to his synagogue.</span> <span id="s742">And I will never forget the moment, I’ll never -- I loved my grandfather, I loved him very dearly.</span> <span id="s743">And I will never forget those moments sitting with him and he putting his tallit over my head.</span> <span id="s744">I was so secure, must have been six or seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s745">I was so secure sitting next to him with that tallit.</span> <span id="s746">You know, I saw him in the morning, this is very -- sometimes praying, almost by heart, and I said to myself, I’ll never be able to do that.</span> <span id="s747">But the best part was -- and he was -- he was praying the grace after meals.</span> <span id="s748">There’s one sentence that stuck into my mind when he was pronouncing loudly, I will say it in Hebrew [speaks Hebrew here].</span> <span id="s749">I was a young boy, and now I’m an old man, but I have never seen a righteous man begging for bread.</span> <span id="s750">That was very reassuring.</span> <span id="s751">I di -- always waited for that sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So then, in the ghetto, did you continue to celebrate Fridays?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: We never gave that up.</span> <span id="s756">We were a singing family.</span> <span id="s757">I mean singing not professionally, but we all loved to sing, and he loved it and we were singing Friday night until late into the night.</span> <span id="s758">Even in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: He was able to -- to separate his Friday nights from everything that happened during the week.</span> <span id="s761">This is again an afterthought.</span> <span id="s762">I never thought of it at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Were you able to separate the Friday night from the events [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: You ask the very good questions, I’m not -- I don’t -- I am not sure.</span> <span id="s765">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s766">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s767">Having said that, I have to tell you that I enjoyed very much those Friday nights.</span> <span id="s768">Was it the singing?</span> <span id="s769">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s770">Was it the fact that we all are together?</span> <span id="s771">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s772">But I have fond memories of those Friday nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: I need you to think back to this time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s776">How are people treating each other?</span> <span id="s777">Are they acting as a community and trying to support each other?</span> <span id="s778">What were you able to observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I think unfortunately, everybody was living for himself.</span> <span id="s780">Everybody was trying to survive in a situation where survival was very doubtful.</span> <span id="s781">It was difficult in [indecipherable] to create a feeling of -- of having a common cause.</span> <span id="s782">Any one of us had the one aim, to survive.</span> <span id="s783">I am sure that people today, if they will read all the books and all the diaries will really be -- they will be unable to understand what indeed took place there.</span> <span id="s784">There’s an impossibility.</span> <span id="s785">So, for me to say that there was a sense of a community is wrong; there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s786">And you may ask the question why.</span> <span id="s787">I told you why.</span> <span id="s788">Everybody lived for himself.</span> <span id="s789">We have to understand this.</span> <span id="s790">You will not be able to really know exactly, or know what was life about in those dreadful times.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Who did you trust at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: I trusted my father, and I later discovered that I could trust my instincts.</span> <span id="s793">I discovered in Auschwitz, and for certain reasons I did certain things without realizing why I am doing it, but by doing it I survived that moment.</span> <span id="s794">So yes, I -- I have trust in my instincts.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Some of the youth movements in your town were actively resisting.</span> <span id="s796">What -- what did you know about that, and were you ever able to observe any of that activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I was not part of it, so I could not observe it, but I believe I mentioned it before, there was a grou -- small group of people who were able to secure a gun or two, and killed a -- a Nazi in town.</span> <span id="s798">But that was all the extent of it -- there’s -- that’s all we have done, nothing else.</span> <span id="s799">[indecipherable] can you visualize those -- that -- that situation?</span> <span id="s800">You cannot.</span> <span id="s801">Impossible.</span> <span id="s802">[indecipherable] resistance was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did you know of any activity that went on on the -- the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s805">They were already determined to resist, those were young people determined to resist, and they were able to secure a few guns, and in August of 1943, they were shooting out from the kibbutz, and if they did some damage at all, nobody ever was able to discover.</span> <span id="s806">But they were -- they were defending themselves.</span> <span id="s807">All of them, of course, were killed on the spot there.</span> <span id="s808">But they were trying to follow the example of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s809">They had some connections with those people.</span> <span id="s810">And one woman in disguise was able to go to Warsaw and convince them to give us also a couple du -- a couple gu-guns, even though they had not too much either, not too many guns either.</span> <span id="s811">And they resisted.</span> <span id="s812">That -- that -- that I -- that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Is this woman Frumka Plotnicka?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Fr-Frumka.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Frumka Plotnicka.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yes, Frumka.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Was she from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: No, she was from eastern Poland someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Did you ever meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Wonderful person, very idealistic.</span> <span id="s823">Very idealistic, very devoted to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s824">And I’m going to contradict myself here.</span> <span id="s825">I don’t believe from talking to her that she ever lost faith.</span> <span id="s826">She still believed in the cause and she still believed that somehow they will be able to, even during the war, to smuggle themselves to Israel.</span> <span id="s827">Another illusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: It’s interesting, when you said that this woman was able to go to Warsaw and convince them to give us some guns, you put yourself in the group of resisters, in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I shouldn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Well, I think it’s interesting because I -- I -- and I wonder if -- if you’d want to explore it a little, that there was a part of you that felt that -- that you were part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: I am very little.</span> <span id="s832">They were hiding everything, not talking.</span> <span id="s833">Maybe when I use the word us, to bring guns for us, maybe I thought of them representing us.</span> <span id="s834">I was raised on the belief that we are a very tight community.</span> <span id="s835">And by using the word us, I [indecipherable] to have some conscience, but at the same time I felt probably that they are defending us, or they are work -- or they are fighting for our dignity or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Did you talk to them, did you admire them, or were you frightened to be seen with those young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Whi-Which ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: A-At the -- the kibbutz people.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: The young idealistic kibbutz --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: No, I was not frightened, I was not frightened.</span> <span id="s842">But young people who shot the German in town were much younger.</span> <span id="s843">They were the generation of my youngest sister, very idealistic, very idealistic.</span> <span id="s844">And what did they think?</span> <span id="s845">What are you trying to accomplish?</span> <span id="s846">What did they think would -- they would accomplish by shooting or killing a German?</span> <span id="s847">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s848">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s849">But [indecipherable] those young people were so -- so strong that they felt that I’m going to give my life, but I’m going to take a Nazi life, too, with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Were you ever asked to join that --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You were never asked to?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: I was never asked to.</span> <span id="s854">Would I have joined?</span> <span id="s855">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s856">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s857">The thing is, I said to you before, I did not have the courage to smuggle myself to Israel.</span> <span id="s858">I am not sure that I had at the time the courage to do something like this.</span> <span id="s859">It required a lot of courage, a lot of determination.</span> <span id="s860">Those four or five young people had it.</span> <span id="s861">And they also were students of that gymnasium that I -- that I attended.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: These were the four or five students that shot the Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: But they took their example from the Warsaw ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s866">And again, let’s look at that -- at that part of the war, or that event in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s867">Did those young fighters really believed that they can conquer or defeat the German army, the most -- the mightiest ar -- army in Europe with having some homemade bombs?</span> <span id="s868">No, they never believed it.</span> <span id="s869">But they believed in -- in exacting a -- exa -- exacting a -- a -- a price.</span> <span id="s870">And they did.</span> <span id="s871">They did.</span> <span id="s872">It took the German army longer to conquer the Warsaw ghetto than to occupy France.</span> <span id="s873">They did.</span> <span id="s874">They paid with their lives, yes, but they felt at that point I -- they had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s875">[indecipherable] I’m going to be taken to the [indecipherable] and killed anyway.</span> <span id="s876">And let’s at least die in dignity.</span> <span id="s877">I wish that the population, the Polish population would have been more cooperative and helped us.</span> <span id="s878">And helped us to secure arms and to join us -- or to join the Warsaw ghetto in -- in a quiet uprising that could have changed history, could have, if the Polish resistance that had enough arms, and was well or fairly well organized, mostly officers of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s879">If they would have joined the uprising, I wonder what would have happened.</span> <span id="s880">I wonder.</span> <span id="s881">Why didn’t they?</span> <span id="s882">Maybe they thought they are not ready, that they aren’t going to accomplish too much, that the Russians are at that time already in Poland and will be in Warsaw in a month or two, and at that point they will -- they will stage an uprising and -- and join the Russian army.</span> <span id="s883">That they have no more to lose than to gain.</span> <span id="s884">I have doubts that -- that this was their thinking, but maybe.</span> <span id="s885">But I know for sure -- not for sure, I know and I believe that if they would have joined the Warsaw ghetto uprising, things could have taken a different turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Y-Y-You’re talking about more formal resistance.</span> <span id="s887">I wonder if you could talk a bit about whether or not you or your family or anyone you knew resisted in an everyday way, living in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s888">And this could mean a lot of things.</span> <span id="s889">But were there ways that you felt you were resisting the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: I know that some of the activities, before we went to the ghetto, were activities where somehow we were saying that not losing faith, taking part in those activities as though nothing is going to be happening again -- around us.</span> <span id="s891">And that what was to some ene -- some extent, a form of resistance.</span> <span id="s892">It was -- I said I lost faith, and most of us lost faith, but those activities for --- for a moment, restored faith that -- and gave us -- gave us a reprieve of not thinking of the everyday miseries.</span> <span id="s893">That was, to some extent, a form of resistance, resistance to survive.</span> <span id="s894">And that was, you know, writing poems or taking be -- children, or coming to meetings, if there were meetings, gave us a feeling that not everything is lost.</span> <span id="s895">That we are still on a higher level than our enemies.</span> <span id="s896">That part, I consider resistance.</span> <span id="s897">But we didn’t really [indecipherable] faith or comfort in ourself, I doubt it, but for the moment it was good for our soul and our well-being.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: So a-at this point you’re living in the ghetto, you’re still working.</span> <span id="s899">Your father has a hiding place.</span> <span id="s900">Are -- tell us a bit about the deportations that are continuing.</span> <span id="s901">How are they being done, and how -- how are they being done?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Are you referring to deportation to Germany or deportations to camp -- to -- to death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: I think now to death camps.</span> <span id="s904">At what point does that start?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Start what?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: When did the deportations to the death camps start?</span> <span id="s907">Is that after you went into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Or when do you become aware of them, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Of what?</span> <span id="s911">Of the deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: The deportations to the death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I think in the beginning of 1943.</span> <span id="s914">Most or maybe all of the deportations were to Birkenau Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s915">That -- there were no more deportations to Germany to work in the defense industries.</span> <span id="s916">And we were aware of what has happened in Auschwitz, perhaps late, even though we were only several kilometers from that town -- not several, but perhaps 20 or 30 kilometers from that town.</span> <span id="s917">But we were aware of it late, perhaps not before -- and I’m guessing here, not before April - May of 1943.</span> <span id="s918">Poles were informing us what is happening.</span> <span id="s919">But we were also thinking at that time that the world must be knowing what is taking place here.</span> <span id="s920">And aren’t they going to warn the Nazis that -- that after the war, they will all be responsible for what they are doing here?</span> <span id="s921">Another illusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: You mentioned the emissary coming back who had jumped off the train.</span> <span id="s923">Did you yourself hear him speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: What -- what -- what was he saying?</span> <span id="s926">How did he describe the train ride, and getting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Train -- he described the train ride as a -- as a -- they were very crowded, they couldn’t even move around.</span> <span id="s928">And the train did not stop anyplace except Birkenau.</span> <span id="s929">He jumped out almost -- almost [indecipherable] the camp.</span> <span id="s930">He jumped out maybe -- maybe a minute or two before the train went into the camp.</span> <span id="s931">And he -- and I am not positive about it any more -- I think that he was able to see the chimneys.</span> <span id="s932">I don’t remember any more, but I think that what happened, he came back and he saw the chimneys and he saw the people being driven, you know.</span> <span id="s933">And convincing us all that we will all be brought there and to expect the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s936">Rosensaft, R-o -- R-o-s-e-n-s-a-f-t.</span> <span id="s937">Josul Rosensaft.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: He survived the war.</span> <span id="s940">He survived the war and did something that I admire him for.</span> <span id="s941">After the war -- he survived the war on the same camp as I did, Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s942">He immediately -- or a week later, formed an organization to take charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s943">That was really very reassuring and he develop good relationship with the English army.</span> <span id="s944">He used to get as much as -- as much as he could from them for us, and again reviving our spirit.</span> <span id="s945">That was so important, reviving our spirit.</span> <span id="s946">He’s responsible for that, and I -- and we should be grateful to him.</span> <span id="s947">Imagine same way as -- that Moshe Merin was not a known entity in town, he was also not a very well known entity in town, but he turned out to be a real leader, a real leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Can you tell us about the liquidation of the ghetto, or are there -- excuse, but I don’t know all the details, were you deported before the liquidation of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No, I was deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: -- the first of August 1942.</span> <span id="s952">A day before, we felt that something unusual is going to happen.</span> <span id="s953">And there were rumors and whispering around that the Germans are going to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s954">My family -- I saw my father on that day, very early in the morning, and he said to me, “I’m going into the hiding with entire family.</span> <span id="s955">Maybe you should stay outside.</span> <span id="s956">Maybe you’ll be able to warn us, or protect us.”</span> <span id="s957">And I stayed outside.</span> <span id="s958">The Germans surrounded the ghetto early in the morning, shooting and shouting and creating in [indecipherable] fear in everyone.</span> <span id="s959">I was taken to the railroad station with the first transport, the first train, so I did not see too much in town after I left, must have been 10 - 11 o’clock in the morning when they were taking me to the s -- to -- to the train station.</span> <span id="s960">I arrived in Auschwitz the same day.</span> <span id="s961">And when the train stopped, I saw an unusual scenes.</span> <span id="s962">Dogs barking and jumping, SS men shouting and shooting, and one SS man standing in the middle, he looked to me like a very high officer.</span> <span id="s963">And people are being asking to jump out of the train.</span> <span id="s964">It was complete chaos.</span> <span id="s965">Mothers looking for children, and we looking for our fathers.</span> <span id="s966">It was complete chaos.</span> <span id="s967">Cha-Chaos designed by it -- wha -- by th -- what -- chaos -- designed chaos is what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s968">I jumped out of the train too, and I was brought before that SS officer, like everyone.</span> <span id="s969">And I saw that he is -- he is directing people to the right and to the left, to the right, women with children, older people.</span> <span id="s970">To the left, young people.</span> <span id="s971">At that point I realize that what is going to happen to those older people and children is immediate death.</span> <span id="s972">And I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s973">There were inmates that were coordinating everything.</span> <span id="s974">A [indecipherable] inmate walked over to us and we said to him, “Where are those older people going?”</span> <span id="s975">He pointed out to the chimney and said, “You see?</span> <span id="s976">See that smoke coming out from both chimneys?</span> <span id="s977">Those -- in that smoke your parents will be in, and the children and older people.”</span> <span id="s978">I couldn’t believe it, even though I knew.</span> <span id="s979">But I couldn’t believe that this is happening in such a way, so fast.</span> <span id="s980">Why didn’t I believe it?</span> <span id="s981">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s982">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s983">Of course, two or three years later, when I realized that they did not mislead us, that this is what’s happened.</span> <span id="s984">I was [indecipherable] to a barrack with people from my town, but before coming to the barrack they brought us to a place where we were tattooed, taking away everything and giving us those concentration camp uniforms.</span> <span id="s985">And marching us to the -- End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Okay, you were describing the food that they [indecipherable] I think you were describing the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah, in the evening we got a piece of bread and a -- and a soup.</span> <span id="s989">We were at that time already very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s990">And I stayed in that part of the camp either two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s991">Then we were brought into another part of the camp.</span> <span id="s992">And in the morning -- in that first camp we did not work at all.</span> <span id="s993">In the morning they were dri -- you were driven outside and standing there for sometimes two, sometimes three hours before they led us into our units to work.</span> <span id="s994">I was assigned to a unit where we were trying to clear weeds on the river, the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s995">It was so difficult.</span> <span id="s996">We were standing in the water, hungry.</span> <span id="s997">And in the evening we returned, waiting for that piece of bread and soup.</span> <span id="s998">And I made at that point that -- a decision that I’m going only to eat the soup and keep the piece of bread for next day.</span> <span id="s999">That was of help.</span> <span id="s1000">I worked, and I don’t remember again, several weeks, or maybe only two weeks.</span> <span id="s1001">And luck started to play an important role in my life.</span> <span id="s1002">The Germans established a group of tailors all -- established tailors who were -- who were mending uniforms, correcting uniforms and -- I mean, fixing uniforms.</span> <span id="s1003">And sometimes bringing in certain items that they took away from survivors, like shirts and shoes and if they were in good shape, or they needed a little mending we did it.</span> <span id="s1004">And trucks were coming once a week or twice a week and carted away those -- that good stuff.</span> <span id="s1005">I suppose they -- I suppose or I am almost sure that they took it to Germany because -- because consumer goods were not available, not too much was available.</span> <span id="s1006">People could not, during the war, go out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties replacing the worn jackets or shirts.</span> <span id="s1007">And a cousin of mine was a tailor before the war.</span> <span id="s1008">He was able to bring me in into that group.</span> <span id="s1009">So I was relieved from being on the outside -- outdo -- being outdoors and being under a roof all day long.</span> <span id="s1010">He was helping me in that production 60 or 70 percent because I wa -- I did not know what to do, but he was -- everybody had to fulfill a certain quota, he was doing it for me with his brother.</span> <span id="s1011">But I guess the -- the kapo, after awhile, realized what is happening and he was singling me out many days and kicking me and hitting me.</span> <span id="s1012">But interesting, he did not -- he did not remove me.</span> <span id="s1013">He did not remove me, I still stayed under roof, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: I’m not sure what you mean by on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Under the -- under a roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Under a roof, okay, mm-hm, yeah, okay, under a roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: I -- I didn’t say it correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: No, I -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Und -- under --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Under a roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: It was under a roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: That’s right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: In -- in closed surroundings, in a building, not exposed to nature.</span> <span id="s1024">That was going on for awhile, but then for certain reasons, they closed that place.</span> <span id="s1025">And I was again -- that must have been already in ’44, either February or March ’44.</span> <span id="s1026">I was distressed, but I know that they are going to assign me to another commando.</span> <span id="s1027">Walking in Birkenau, all of a sudden, a man turns around to me and saying to me, “Are you Herman Strochlitz’ son?”</span> <span id="s1028">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1029">“I was a friend of your father.</span> <span id="s1030">What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1031">I told him the story, that I’m going to be assigned to another commando in the morning, that don’t know where I might go assign -- be -- where I will be assigned to.</span> <span id="s1032">He said, “Listen to me something.</span> <span id="s1033">I am working in the berklidinkskomer.”</span> <span id="s1034">That was an outfit that was sorting out everything, and responsible for giving survivors if they came in, and they really needed very badly to [indecipherable] we had a cruel kapo, he never gave anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s1035">But again I was under roof, and what was more important was the fact that I had smuggled out a pair of shoes and give it to the people who work in the kitchen and they, in turn, gave me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1036">And that was extremely important.</span> <span id="s1037">I was in that commando for a long time.</span> <span id="s1038">But again, luck, what happened?</span> <span id="s1039">One day a Pole came in, and -- who was bleeding, his feet -- didn’t have any shoes at all, and asked the kapo to give him a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1040">The kapo threw him out.</span> <span id="s1041">You know, it’s interesting that those kapos were very eager to hit or to abuse people who in their eyes are weak.</span> <span id="s1042">Let me finish this guy.</span> <span id="s1043">I was able to throw out a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1044">The door was open because he threw him out, and he was sitting not far from the door, I was able to throw out a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1045">Those shoes were my salvation, and I’ll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s1046">What happened was that I was shipped or deported to -- first to Stutthof, the camp in northern -- north -- north -- north Germany, where we stayed, my friend and I with whom I survived Auschwitz [indecipherable], and with whom I was very close, stayed in Stutthof, and I don’t remember if a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s1047">It’s always a mystery to me why they moved us around back and forth.</span> <span id="s1048">They shipped us to another camp, Hiflingen.</span> <span id="s1049">We also stayed there for a short period of time, and in Hiflingen, the head of the SS walked on the end, we were standing still, he looked at me and pulled me out and say, “You are staying in the barracks, you don’t have to go to work.</span> <span id="s1050">I will tell you what you are going to do.</span> <span id="s1051">If people come in and say to you they are sick, if you have anything to give them, give them, but if not, tell them we have nothing to give them.”</span> <span id="s1052">He brought a -- a bottle of aspirins after a day or two.</span> <span id="s1053">That was -- that’s the o-on thing -- the only thing that I had was that one bottle of aspirins.</span> <span id="s1054">But again, I was protected because I was inside.</span> <span id="s1055">Maybe the work inside is better than under roof.</span> <span id="s1056">After awhile we were shipped, my friend and I, to another camp [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1057">We were shipped to that camp, and we were assigned to a commando, it was already probably February, or January or February 1945.</span> <span id="s1058">It was in s -- in the south of Germany.</span> <span id="s1059">The weather was miserable, absolutely miserable.</span> <span id="s1060">Snow and rain and cold.</span> <span id="s1061">We were assigned to a commando that was going on every day and time to divide rocks, you know?</span> <span id="s1062">Why they needed it, a mystery to me.</span> <span id="s1063">We were all day long standing and hitting rocks, hitting rocks.</span> <span id="s1064">After one or two days, my friend was a little older than I was, and very wise.</span> <span id="s1065">He was able, in Auschwitz -- yes, in Birkenau to take with him a razor.</span> <span id="s1066">We hardly made it back, we couldn’t walk, we hardly made it back to camp.</span> <span id="s1067">And he said to me, “Sig, there’s no way we will survive one day, what is the difference?</span> <span id="s1068">Let’s finish it tonight.”</span> <span id="s1069">I walked in, I saw the doc -- the man that I gave the pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: The Polish man you gave --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: -- the pair of shoes to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1074">He winked as he recognizes me, but he’s -- I saw that he has an armband as a doctor, so I realize that he is a doctor in camp.</span> <span id="s1075">Couldn’t help too much as a doctor because [indecipherable] medicine.</span> <span id="s1076">After we came to our barracks, I went to see him.</span> <span id="s1077">This is exactly what he said to me, “Look sir, I cannot help you with bread, because all of us are getting one portion of bread.</span> <span id="s1078">But one thing I can do for you.</span> <span id="s1079">I can convince SS men with whom I am friendly to let you stay inside, not to go out.”</span> <span id="s1080">And here I said something and I did something, very, very proud of.</span> <span id="s1081">Very proud.</span> <span id="s1082">And here I had courage.</span> <span id="s1083">I told him, I am very grateful to you, but I will not stay inside if you cannot -- if you cannot do the same thing for my friend.</span> <span id="s1084">He threw me out and shouting to me, “Here everyone has to survive.</span> <span id="s1085">What are you going to gain?</span> <span id="s1086">You’re not going to sur -- both of you aren’t going to dri -- I cannot do more.</span> <span id="s1087">I cannot do -- I cannot save your friend, too.”</span> <span id="s1088">In the morning he walked in and they called my number, 132407 out.</span> <span id="s1089">I am not moving.</span> <span id="s1090">A second, or couple seconds later, I see the doctor whispering something to this SS man, he called my friend’s name.</span> <span id="s1091">And we were inside til about the middle of March if I remember correctly, we were shipped to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1092">I have to go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Before you do that, if you just say the name of your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Romek Vineweich.</span> <span id="s1095">I have to back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1097">You were go -- you were going to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1099">For a short period of time, I was working -- September or was it 19 -- oh, it couldn’t be that.</span> <span id="s1100">No.</span> <span id="s1101">In -- in -- no, it must have been ’43, and I’m working in a commando of -- only for a short period of time, where a transport came from Kraków.</span> <span id="s1102">And I was working there with my friend, and a woman ap -- we approached some -- some people who came from Kraków to find out what they know.</span> <span id="s1103">Then, we always ask people who came in later what they know what is happening.</span> <span id="s1104">And I said to one of them, “And you are from Kraków?</span> <span id="s1105">What is your name?”</span> <span id="s1106">Greenberg, she said.</span> <span id="s1107">I said to her, “Wha -- did you have any family in my town?”</span> <span id="s1108">She said, “Yes, I had an uncle by the name of Bookwhites.”</span> <span id="s1109">A very prominent family.</span> <span id="s1110">I said to her, “You know, your cousin is working in a commando where she can send you some -- some clothes.</span> <span id="s1111">I will get in touch with her.”</span> <span id="s1112">So people who are working in that camp with that -- where they were working on clothing.</span> <span id="s1113">“I will try to get you something.”</span> <span id="s1114">And I did, I got her some clothes.</span> <span id="s1115">And we spoke two or three times again probably, and I lost track of her.</span> <span id="s1116">When we came to Bergen-Belsen, my friend Romek Vineweich, who was standing once at the -- at the -- at the wires -- at electric wires -- I forgot [indecipherable] and he noticed her, and he noticed that she is dressed well.</span> <span id="s1117">He started to shout to her and the first question she said to him is, “Is Sigmund here?”</span> <span id="s1118">He said yes.</span> <span id="s1119">She said to him, “Look, I am the schreiberin in -- in camp.</span> <span id="s1120">That means I have to report every day in the morning how many people died during the night and how many are still alive.</span> <span id="s1121">But I have access to food because of it.”</span> <span id="s1122">This -- you know, they don’t know, the Germans if during the night 200 people died or 50 people died.</span> <span id="s1123">They have a little [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1124">“I will arrange that he has to come because we need here certain materials that only the men’s camp have, and he will come with some -- some -- with a big glass, or something like -- big -- some container.”</span> <span id="s1125">Oh, that’s better.</span> <span id="s1126">“And I will give you -- give him food.”</span> <span id="s1127">And that what happened.</span> <span id="s1128">And I was going to her every two days or three days and she give us food.</span> <span id="s1129">And what is even equally important, she became my wife.</span> <span id="s1130">I said equally important, that’s more important.</span> <span id="s1131">Have to correct myself.</span> <span id="s1132">Much more important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: What -- what is her full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Her -- her name is -- is Rushka.</span> <span id="s1135">Rose we call her here, Rose -- Rose Strochlitz, but her maiden name is Greenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: I want to go back to fill in some of the details of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1138">You know, I don’t want to forget it.</span> <span id="s1139">I mentioned before that I ha -- I was guided, or had confidence in instincts.</span> <span id="s1140">What did I mean?</span> <span id="s1141">There were, in Auschwitz, every few weeks or a month or two months, selections.</span> <span id="s1142">And even though we’re young people, again they looked at their faces because they were exhausted or -- for the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1143">And we never knew, because it’s the same young people, if the left is good or the right is good.</span> <span id="s1144">And we were pushed to the left or to the right, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1145">After a minute I turned around to Romek, and I said, “Let’s see if we can go better to the left.</span> <span id="s1146">I somehow don’t feel right here.</span> <span id="s1147">I don’t know what it is, but I feel that this is no good here.</span> <span id="s1148">I don’t why I feel that, or I think that way.</span> <span id="s1149">Let’s move to the left, not to the right.</span> <span id="s1150">Let’s try to -- to smuggle ourself to the left.”</span> <span id="s1151">I was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: I don’t completely understand how Romek was your friend, was he a friend from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: He went to the same gymnasium that I did, but he was five or six years older.</span> <span id="s1156">He came, not in ’43.</span> <span id="s1157">He was in hiding, and they brought him in 1944.</span> <span id="s1158">And they assigned him to the same barracks, and I got attached to him and he to me.</span> <span id="s1159">Why?</span> <span id="s1160">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1161">Attached very much so.</span> <span id="s1162">And who knows why?</span> <span id="s1163">He was protecting me all the time and I was protecting him.</span> <span id="s1164">In Hilflingin, on that camp, I was kept inside.</span> <span id="s1165">I had -- I could get more bread.</span> <span id="s1166">I never ate it until he came.</span> <span id="s1167">Yeah, I ate my portion, I always kept the second portion -- and I was hungry -- for him.</span> <span id="s1168">He has described that relationship [indecipherable] 1946, he described it in an article that he wrote for an Israeli newspaper, and to my great regrets, I was looking for that article many times and I cannot find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: I wonder if we -- you can go back to when you first arrive, you described arriving.</span> <span id="s1170">Can you tell us a little bit more about when you actually are given your uniforms and tattooed?</span> <span id="s1171">I mean, what actually happened and did you know that was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No.</span> <span id="s1173">We didn’t know it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1174">We knew only from the statement made by one of the inmates that those who were the people and the children are going -- th-they showed us these chimneys, you see that smoke coming out.</span> <span id="s1175">But we did not know.</span> <span id="s1176">But the fact that they tattooed us led me to believe that it’s not our end, it’s not my end.</span> <span id="s1177">Why would they go through the trouble of tattooing us?</span> <span id="s1178">So it was reassuring.</span> <span id="s1179">You know [indecipherable] they shaved us completely.</span> <span id="s1180">And I walked out and I had problems recognizing my friends and they recognizing me.</span> <span id="s1181">You look so different, you know?</span> <span id="s1182">You look so different not in your clothes and -- and your head shaved, you know, that it was really difficult to recognize each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: At this point, wh-what do you know of your family?</span> <span id="s1184">Di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Of my family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: You know something?</span> <span id="s1188">I knew that my family was brought to Birkenau on the third day.</span> <span id="s1189">Why?</span> <span id="s1190">Because on that transport were also people who were -- who were not -- who were not sent to -- to -- to -- to -- to the gas chambers, but to camp, and they told me.</span> <span id="s1191">No, that is not correct.</span> <span id="s1192">No, that is not correct.</span> <span id="s1193">Now I remember a little more.</span> <span id="s1194">I was trying to find out where’s my family.</span> <span id="s1195">I know my two young sisters should be in the -- in the camp with all the rest of the women.</span> <span id="s1196">They were not there.</span> <span id="s1197">I didn’t count on my parents, but my two sisters.</span> <span id="s1198">After awhile I found out something.</span> <span id="s1199">Found out that there was a young man in the train who had a gun, and he was shooting out of the train and he hurt an SS man.</span> <span id="s1200">And the people were -- who were there when the train arrived, you know, there were always some sof -- some -- some inmates, you know, coordinating everything, told us that on that day, one train came in that the enti -- there were no selections, entire train was taken immediately to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1201">So I found out very early that I lost my parents.</span> <span id="s1202">And because my wife was in the bunker with my parents, she was also taken immediate to -- to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: And your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: And my two sisters, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Were -- were you able to say kaddish for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: No.</span> <span id="s1207">No.</span> <span id="s1208">Why?</span> <span id="s1209">I cannot visualize staying -- or saying kaddish in the -- no, I did not.</span> <span id="s1210">Cannot visualize saying kaddish in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1211">Why?</span> <span id="s1212">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1213">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: What [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1215">We have to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Sitting here I’m thinking why I did not say kaddish.</span> <span id="s1219">I don’t have any guilt feelings about it, because I was taught that the prayer of kaddish is a reaffirmation of life.</span> <span id="s1220">Could I at that point re -- reaffirm and praise God and reaffirm that life is -- that life is -- is -- is beautiful, or whatever you want to say?</span> <span id="s1221">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1222">Did I think at that time, what I’m saying just now?</span> <span id="s1223">No.</span> <span id="s1224">But I have to analyze things later on and try to determine in your own mind what was -- what were you thinking unconsciously.</span> <span id="s1225">And I could have thought unconsciously that there’s no reason for me to say kaddish.</span> <span id="s1226">Am I sure about it?</span> <span id="s1227">No, I am not.</span> <span id="s1228">But it could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Did -- do you remember having any -- what were your thoughts at that point about God and your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I know for sure that at that point, I couldn’t believe that there is a God, a merciful, compassionate God who let tho -- whose [indecipherable] let things like this happen to his chosen people.</span> <span id="s1231">Difficult to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: What were you reactions then?</span> <span id="s1233">Was it anger, or sadness?</span> <span id="s1234">To -- to that thought about God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Perhaps no sadness, but anger.</span> <span id="s1236">Anger.</span> <span id="s1237">Even though I was not a religious person, I still felt that -- that God, or any -- that God could permit those things to take place.</span> <span id="s1238">So anger was the right reaction.</span> <span id="s1239">And as I said before, it’s very difficult to live without faith.</span> <span id="s1240">Very, very difficult to live.</span> <span id="s1241">Very difficult to justify things without faith.</span> <span id="s1242">You must live with faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Talk about that at that point in your life, you -- you had talked about losing your confidence in the ghetto, you were questioning your faith.</span> <span id="s1244">How -- how did you keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Where?</span> <span id="s1246">In camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: I-In -- in -- in -- yes, in Auschwitz, in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Luck.</span> <span id="s1249">Luck was my -- my biggest friend.</span> <span id="s1250">I described to you four situations where luck played a very important role in surviving.</span> <span id="s1251">Don’t believe that anybody will tell you -- any of the survivors will tell you that they were smart, that’s the reason they survived.</span> <span id="s1252">Oh, that is nonsense.</span> <span id="s1253">Luck, being young, or coming to Auschwitz late, at the end of ’43 or -- or ’44, end of ’44, not ’43, where -- where the war was coming -- we knew that the war was coming to an end, and that kept you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: You -- you were still there an awfully long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I was from -- first of all [indecipherable] the 26th of October 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So more than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1260">But most of the time, I was working inside, not exposed to -- to wind, rain and snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Can you describe your -- your barracks and the kapo in charge, I don’t know if you remember him in any way, the name and how he ran your barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Of course I don’t remember the name, I never spoke to him because he was god, you know.</span> <span id="s1263">You don’t talk to god, you know.</span> <span id="s1264">He was god in that barracks, that’s a ver -- he could kill you or -- or deny you the portion of bread, whatever he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1265">I never spoke to him, I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s1266">He was cold.</span> <span id="s1267">The Germans had a knack of selecting those -- those -- those kapos or people who they felt will fulfill that function that they want them to fulfill.</span> <span id="s1268">To make our life absolutely miserable, to kill us and to -- to abuse us, all right?</span> <span id="s1269">They had a knack for choosing those people.</span> <span id="s1270">It was not only in my barracks, in all the rest of the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Was this kapo German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Was he German or Polish, or -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yes [indecipherable] he was German.</span> <span id="s1275">He were a criminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: I want to go through some of the details of the -- of the day.</span> <span id="s1277">Can you tell us about roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1279">I mentioned to you before that that roll call was either five or six o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1280">We were standing outside for hours, and waiting to go out.</span> <span id="s1281">And was very difficult, especially in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s1282">Even though I knew that I will not have to go outside, that I will be able to go into the -- the [indecipherable] and be inside, those two or three hours -- it’s all by -- it was all by design, because I remember people after an hour or two just giving in, falling down and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1283">They would have died anyway, you know, cause they were already that weak, you know?</span> <span id="s1284">But even to make the strongest weaker, it was by design.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: So da -- when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: They were trying to -- the reason for that roll call was that they were trying to determine how many people are on the barrack.</span> <span id="s1287">And that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: When you went to roll call, did you have a strategy in your mind for surviving?</span> <span id="s1289">Were you standing next to your friend, were -- were you ever holding each other up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: We were -- I was standing next to my friend, holding each other up, but no strategy.</span> <span id="s1291">Don’t believe that something like this could exist in the camp.</span> <span id="s1292">What kind of strategy can you have?</span> <span id="s1293">What -- what can you do?</span> <span id="s1294">You are at the whim of people who are -- whose aim is only to kill you.</span> <span id="s1295">How can you prevent it?</span> <span id="s1296">You have nothing to -- to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s1297">You cannot run out because you are -- you have the electric wires, and it’s powerless, with SS men all over, they will shoot you immediately.</span> <span id="s1298">Even though, I have to be on record that one of my school friends was able to run away from Auschwitz, but he’s -- I believe is not the only survivor among the two or three survivors who were able to run away from Birkenau Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1299">I can tell you that he lived in Israel, and he passed away.</span> <span id="s1300">We were trying -- every time I came to Israel, all my school friends invited me in.</span> <span id="s1301">We were spending an evening together reminiscing.</span> <span id="s1302">We were trying for a year or two to convince him to tell us how he survived.</span> <span id="s1303">We couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1304">One day -- one evening, I turned around to him -- I was very close to him before the war.</span> <span id="s1305">I said, “Shumek, you have to tell us.</span> <span id="s1306">Just for history’s sake, you have to tell us.”</span> <span id="s1307">He was thinking for a moment and he said okay.</span> <span id="s1308">I can tell you he was talking for a couple hours.</span> <span id="s1309">You could cut the air, it was such a silence in the room.</span> <span id="s1310">And he told us that he had a friend who was working outside the wires, and who hid some clothes for him in a hole, and he described him -- where the hole is.</span> <span id="s1311">And he will -- he will try to get him into that commando to be outside, and then somehow during the day, watching, he should disappear.</span> <span id="s1312">And he disappeared.</span> <span id="s1313">And, you know, most of the people that tried to run away were hanged the next day.</span> <span id="s1314">We didn’t -- and we were forced to watch the hanging, of course.</span> <span id="s1315">Within a day, two or three, four, they didn't bring him back, I said to myself and to my friend, he escaped.</span> <span id="s1316">And he told us how he escaped, and what he did.</span> <span id="s1317">After two days being in that -- in that hole -- but he took with him some food, being two days and two nights in that hole, he realized on the third day that the search is off.</span> <span id="s1318">In the middle of the night he slowly crawled all out and went to town.</span> <span id="s1319">And he saw a light in one of the homes.</span> <span id="s1320">He entered.</span> <span id="s1321">He entered and the woman became very scared.</span> <span id="s1322">He reassured her, and she kept him for another two or three days.</span> <span id="s1323">And then he said to her, I have some friends -- again, the woman became his wife later, who are -- who look like Aryans not Jews, who are working in Warsaw on false papers.</span> <span id="s1324">Take me first to Bendezin.</span> <span id="s1325">We will sit together, we will look like a -- a son, a mother driving, you know, you look -- nobody will pay any attention to us.</span> <span id="s1326">And he was successful.</span> <span id="s1327">She brought him to Bendezin.</span> <span id="s1328">In Bendezin he had a friend, a Pole, with whom he was very close.</span> <span id="s1329">Very unusual to be close, but he was close with him.</span> <span id="s1330">You -- he came from a very fine family.</span> <span id="s1331">As a matter of fact, the family lived in our -- in our house on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1332">And the son was in town, and they decided, you have to bring him to Warsaw to be -- to -- they will infor -- in Warsaw they will find for him false papers, and he will survive, together with his sisters.</span> <span id="s1333">With the Pole’s sisters.</span> <span id="s1334">Now, we will survive together with -- with a -- a -- a family that he knew very well, that -- that he knew -- he knew that they are in Warsaw and where they are in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1335">That Pole was very smartly shrewd.</span> <span id="s1336">He took with him on the train, some bottles of liquor.</span> <span id="s1337">And they were sitting in the train and trying to pretend that they are drinking.</span> <span id="s1338">SS man came in and he became friend of them, let’s have a drink.</span> <span id="s1339">They all became drunk and they didn’t realize anything, they were drunk, completely drunk.</span> <span id="s1340">And they came to Warsaw with him, and found the -- his friends, and they prepared false papers for him, and he was working in a cinema.</span> <span id="s1341">He didn't look [indecipherable], but here is again something that is unexplainable.</span> <span id="s1342">In the Warsaw ghetto he was rounded up with other Poles and taken to a place.</span> <span id="s1343">He wound up place on the floor.</span> <span id="s1344">An SS man walks in, and looks around and turns round to him, “You were the one who run away from Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s1345">He knew that this is the end.</span> <span id="s1346">At that moment, and artillery shell is exploding in front of -- of the place, and everybody is running away in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1347">Was he smart?</span> <span id="s1348">No, was luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Levinstein.</span> <span id="s1351">Shumek Levinstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: How -- how was your health after several months of working in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1353">Wer -- were you underweight --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: The moment I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: -- could you -- how -- how was your health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Not too bad.</span> <span id="s1357">Well, I was sitting all day long and being able to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to smuggle something out again here as I did in the berklidinkskomer, and getting a little bit -- and getting a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1358">Was not too bad.</span> <span id="s1359">I was young.</span> <span id="s1360">You know, I had typhoid.</span> <span id="s1361">And again, it will sound too heroic, but I’m going to tell you about.</span> <span id="s1362">Maybe I should be on record, and maybe not.</span> <span id="s1363">As I told you, I worked several weeks in a camp where I met my future wife.</span> <span id="s1364">I worked not doing anything really.</span> <span id="s1365">But we had to get our food from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1366">That was a kitchen run by half women.</span> <span id="s1367">The head of that kitchen was a miserable person, and if the commando was -- consists of 12 people, she gave only 10 -- 10 pieces of -- something like this, in order to preserve and give the SS men [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1368">One day I turned around to the kapo who was the one kapo that I know that was not so cruel.</span> <span id="s1369">Said to him, “Look, today I would like to go with my friend to -- to get our soup.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Is this with Rose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: No, with your friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Shumek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: With Romek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Romek, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: We went there and she did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1378">I said, we are 12 or 15, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1379">Out!</span> <span id="s1380">I kicked the soup completely.</span> <span id="s1381">And she had a cane in her hand with a iron.</span> <span id="s1382">She took that cane an-and was standing straight.</span> <span id="s1383">It’s too heroic, but I have to be on record.</span> <span id="s1384">She took that cane and she lifted it, and was standing straight -- all of a sudden she let it down, and she started to shout, clean it up, give him 15.</span> <span id="s1385">So next day in the morning we are walking again into that camp, she is standing at the gate, and -- with SS man, and the SS man is calling my number out.</span> <span id="s1386">I said to Romek, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1387">The SS man and -- together with her brought me into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1388">And she turned around to me and said, “You are going to work here with me.”</span> <span id="s1389">I stayed in the kitchen with her.</span> <span id="s1390">And when I got the typhoid and my friend also, we knew that they are going to take us to that [indecipherable] that we were going to be one day because after one day there they were taking people to so -- after two days to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1391">I got in touch with her somehow, and I told her what is happening, and if she can get me, not into the [indecipherable], but to the unit on sil -- on my block, and I can survive there, because -- and she did it.</span> <span id="s1392">A day before I left -- before they deported us from Auschwitz she came to the -- to the electric wires, and she threw out a gold -- a piece of gold and she said to Romek, “Give it to Sigmund, gold -- this is the only way to survive.”</span> <span id="s1393">If you are going to -- you are able to buy something for the gold wherever they were -- they’re going to ship you.</span> <span id="s1394">And it helped.</span> <span id="s1395">But I have to tell you, again it sounds too heroic, but I have to be on record.</span> <span id="s1396">She was trying, after the war -- she was a Dutch woman, to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s1397">She was sending people and letters.</span> <span id="s1398">I never responded to any letters of her.</span> <span id="s1399">I never -- I said to -- to the people, I will never see her.</span> <span id="s1400">The fact that she saved me and my friend does not justify what she did by causing to have tens or hundreds of people to die by not giving them enough food.</span> <span id="s1401">I never wanted to get in touch with her, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1402">[indecipherable] sound too heroic, I was already in love with my future wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Per-Perhaps you’re saying she might have also liked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: She what?</span> <span id="s1405">Might what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Might have liked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Romantically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: The -- the woman in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1413">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yes, yes, she want probably to marry me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: I see, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: I don’t know, I cannot prove anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: But I never, ever responded to any letter.</span> <span id="s1419">Never wanted to see her.</span> <span id="s1420">My friend was one day in Amsterdam and he saw her.</span> <span id="s1421">She was crying bitterly.</span> <span id="s1422">Why doesn’t -- at least let -- let him answer a letter?</span> <span id="s1423">I said no, she is not entitled to it.</span> <span id="s1424">Does it sound too heroic?</span> <span id="s1425">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Tell us a little bit more about were you ever able to steal a moment here or there with -- with your future wife, with Rose?</span> <span id="s1427">How were you able to see her, other than the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yeah, because I was working on their camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: And I could see her, and spend the -- and as a matter of fact, I have already the typhoid and she was able, and -- with the permission of my kapo to let me go into their barracks and not be outside to sleep all day.</span> <span id="s1431">That was of help, too.</span> <span id="s1432">Again luck played a role.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Did you know you were falling in love with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: With my wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Not in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Not in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Not in camp.</span> <span id="s1439">But we were liberated together and somehow the fact that she told Romek, is Sigmund here too, indicated to me that she cares.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: I want to return to the moment, the time when you were very discouraged, and you and your friend were considering suicide.</span> <span id="s1441">Can you tell me a little bit more about that?</span> <span id="s1442">Had you thought about killing yourself before your friend showed you the razor, and why at that point were you considering it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: There was no way out.</span> <span id="s1444">I knew that I will die the next day or two days later, that we cannot walk even.</span> <span id="s1445">It was a terrible winter.</span> <span id="s1446">And I said to myself, or my friend said, why, why, why still suffer?</span> <span id="s1447">There’s no way out.</span> <span id="s1448">We cannot walk, even.</span> <span id="s1449">We cannot walk.</span> <span id="s1450">We have to all day long try to divide those rocks and we cannot do it, so somebody will shoot us anyway there.</span> <span id="s1451">If an SS man walked by and say we cannot do it, he will shoot us anyhow.</span> <span id="s1452">What is the use?</span> <span id="s1453">I am positive that we would have done it.</span> <span id="s1454">Positive, if not for the doctor.</span> <span id="s1455">I have no doubts about that, that we would have done it.</span> <span id="s1456">As I said before, and I hope I’m not offending anybody.</span> <span id="s1457">There is no way for anybody to imagine, or to try to -- to -- to understand the feeling and the mood.</span> <span id="s1458">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1459">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1460">Only people who were there are able to describe them.</span> <span id="s1461">And you have to be in the same position, the same situation, to be able to understand what was -- what -- what is happening, and how our mind worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: You know, I always thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Just a few more questions about camp.</span> <span id="s1466">Do you have any memory of what it sounded like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: What it sounded what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Imagine yourself in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1469">What were the sounds that you would hear in camp?</span> <span id="s1470">At Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: I’m not sure I understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: What would you have been hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: You see, when could I hear anything?</span> <span id="s1474">When you are standing at the appelle in the morning, we didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1475">Nobody permitted us to talk.</span> <span id="s1476">When we were coming back in the evening, we are so tired.</span> <span id="s1477">Nobody think -- we li -- nobody was thinking about trying to talk or to -- to be nostalgic.</span> <span id="s1478">No.</span> <span id="s1479">We were waiting for the piece of bread, and lie down, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1480">There was not real talk except when a new transport came in and we wanted to know what is happening in the world.</span> <span id="s1481">At that time were talk, and being encouraged, you know?</span> <span id="s1482">Believing that the war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1483">I remember -- I remember when the allied troops landed in Normandy, and there was a transport, I’d forgot from where.</span> <span id="s1484">They came and told us that the Americans are in Europe already.</span> <span id="s1485">And that was very, very reassuring, very.</span> <span id="s1486">It inspired confidence again that maybe, maybe the tragedy is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1487">But to have just -- just empty talk, that was no such thing.</span> <span id="s1488">I don’t remember ever having any empty talk during the appelle, or during -- or after we came ho -- came back from -- from our work assignment.</span> <span id="s1489">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Was there ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: I-I don’t remember, and I understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Was there ever a time, either in camp or when you might have been marching somewhere, that you were allowed to sing, for instance?</span> <span id="s1493">Were -- were you ever allowed to sing when you were in camp?</span> <span id="s1494">Or did you ever sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Could very well be, but I am not sure, but in one of the camps it could have been Hiflingen, when we were mar -- they were marching -- wo -- marching out, I’m not sure that the SS man was trying to make us sing a German song or something like this, but I’m not sure about it.</span> <span id="s1496">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: You’ve talked about your faith some, and -- and -- and the questioning of it, did you ever -- did you pray once you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: No.</span> <span id="s1499">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: So what ke -- what kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: The will to survive is a very strong will.</span> <span id="s1502">The idea that I will survive and tell the world what happened always was a very, very important element in that feeling of survival.</span> <span id="s1503">And the feeling or the statements of those who were taken to the gas chambers, don’t forget us, was also very important.</span> <span id="s1504">Don’t forget us.</span> <span id="s1505">This was also very important to me.</span> <span id="s1506">And that was kep -- kept me going.</span> <span id="s1507">That what kept me going.</span> <span id="s1508">You are talking about singing, and I would like to share something that to me was to some extent understandable, and to some extent I couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s1509">The sonderkommando came one day back and they told a story of an old rabbi who was with a group of people taken to the gas chambers, the rabbi started to sing, and asked them all to sing.</span> <span id="s1510">We are dying as martyrs, and don’t be afraid to die.</span> <span id="s1511">Singing and dancing before they entered the cha -- the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1512">It’s good to be on [indecipherable] like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: You talk about people saying don’t forget us.</span> <span id="s1514">Did anyone directly say that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: You said the people that were going into the gas chamber --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: No, but I know that people were saying things like this.</span> <span id="s1520">I don’t remember somebody saying it directly to me, but I’m sure that there are people who were told by those who were taken to the gas chambers, don’t forget me, tell the world what happened.</span> <span id="s1521">Oh, I am positive about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: How aware were you of the daily functioning of the gas chamber and the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: We saw the sonderkommando, they were in a special block, every day.</span> <span id="s1524">And they told us that the people are being taken to showers and telling them they have to be clean, and after they will come out there will be food for them, and misleading them completely.</span> <span id="s1525">When the entered the showers, of course, an SS man was throwing in a -- a gas can Zyklon B, and they heard in the -- for a couple -- for three or four minutes people shouting and then, all of a sudden everything was silent, they opened the doors and everybody was dead, of course, holding to each other, and the scene was incredible, they were -- always used to say.</span> <span id="s1526">Mothers holding children tight to them, their [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1527">And of course they were immediately -- they were in -- SS men started always to shout at them, take them out and bring them to the -- to the -- to the -- to the chimney, that’s all, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: But how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: So we knew exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s1530">We knew what transports are coming in, from where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Di -- were you ever one of the people to inform the new transports what happened to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: No, I was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: -- the people that went to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: No, I was not, because I was not in that commando, there was a special commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: I believe they called it Canada or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: What about s-sanitation, when -- were you allowed to bathe, and when were you allowed to go to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: In the morning.</span> <span id="s1539">And my friend and I were keeping it up, they were alway wa -- wa -- people stopped after a week or two weeks to wash themself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: People stopped washing themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Yes, washing themselves.</span> <span id="s1542">We never stopped.</span> <span id="s1543">But having said that, and I don’t remember why, in Bergen-Belsen, or even maybe before, we never had the place where we could wash ourself.</span> <span id="s1544">And when I was liberated, they had to use a special oil to clean me.</span> <span id="s1545">The dirt was in -- in my -- my entire body, in -- in -- in my flesh almost, you know?</span> <span id="s1546">They took a special oil to clean me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: When you and your friend, were you aw-aware that you were purposely trying to continue to bathe a-as a way to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: -- to -- to stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1551">And that is an indication where we thought we can survive.</span> <span id="s1552">The clear indication that we are young we will survive, as the war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1553">Would I have done the same thing if I would have been taken in the beginning of ’42?</span> <span id="s1554">I doubt it, because the situation was so gloomy, the ger -- the Germans were in Moscow almost, in Leningrad, all over the world, you know?</span> <span id="s1555">There was no reason for me to believe that the German army can be -- can be defeated.</span> <span id="s1556">There was no reason whatsoever, they -- they occupied all Europe and they are now next to Stalingrad and Moscow and Leningrad, and how -- and again, how do we find out?</span> <span id="s1557">New transports come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: One more question on sanitation, you said you were allowed to go to the bathroom in the morning, just once a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Of course in the evening went -- went again.</span> <span id="s1560">But during the day, I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s1561">I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s1562">First in Poland, in the place that I was working, inside, there was no rest room.</span> <span id="s1563">There were no such thing.</span> <span id="s1564">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Can -- can you tell us -- I’d just like you to tell us a little bit more about your friendship with Romek.</span> <span id="s1566">What did you tr -- were you able to be with him most days and how did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: All -- every day, all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Every day all day long.</span> <span id="s1570">You see, and again, probably subconsciously, when you know that you lost everything, that you have no family, you are trying to forge a friendship with somebody who’ll be with you, giving you the feeling that you are not alone.</span> <span id="s1571">And that cemented that friendship.</span> <span id="s1572">I can lean on him, and he on me.</span> <span id="s1573">He could watch my -- my -- my -- my piece of bread, and I can watch his piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1574">And you are as eager to make sure that he will survive as you, and he is eager to make sure that you are s -- you are going to survive.</span> <span id="s1575">That creates a lifetime friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: What about the very minor contact you’d had with Rose also, was that something that gave you a bit of hope for the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Mm, I don’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: I mean, you had lost a wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: You had what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: You had lost your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Was that something that at -- in some part of your mind you hung onto also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: I am not sure about it.</span> <span id="s1584">I am not sure about that I was thinking at that point of a marriage, but that was unthinkable, incredible, you know?</span> <span id="s1585">It never entered her mind or my mind.</span> <span id="s1586">But on the first day of liberation, I was outside with Romek and we saw her sister.</span> <span id="s1587">I asked, “Where’s Rushka?”</span> <span id="s1588">I asked.</span> <span id="s1589">She said, “We have to take her from the barracks, she has typhoid, to the krankenhaus.”</span> <span id="s1590">I said, “I will go.”</span> <span id="s1591">I will -- I had to crawl before I a -- was able to reach the barrack, she was already taken.</span> <span id="s1592">I couldn’t walk there at that time too fast, you know, I had to crawl, you know, almost.</span> <span id="s1593">So I didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s1594">But I do believe -- I do believe that I saw her in the hospital four or five days later.</span> <span id="s1595">I do believe in that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Go back just a bit in the -- the weeks before liberation, you’re describing liberation that you have to crawl.</span> <span id="s1597">Obviously you’ve deter -- your health has deteriorated, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: -- what state of health were you in right before liberation, and then sort of bring us up to liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: I mentioned to you that I had typhoid in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1601">There are two types of typhoids.</span> <span id="s1602">I had the second type [indecipherable] had in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1603">My future wife saved me.</span> <span id="s1604">She was able to get hold of some medication and send it over to me.</span> <span id="s1605">That helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: So in the weeks right before liberation, were you recovering from typhoid, or --what was your state of health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: A few weeks before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: I am not sure that I remember when I discovered that I have typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Oh, it was after liberation that you had typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: No, before liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Before, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Before liberation, but I cannot pinpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Well why -- why were you in such bad health that you had to crawl?</span> <span id="s1617">Not why, but describe your state of health.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Because -- because -- because I wa -- it was ’45, I was exhausted, tired.</span> <span id="s1619">My weight was 88 pounds at the libera -- on the liberation, 88 pounds.</span> <span id="s1620">I was weak, extremely weak from all those years.</span> <span id="s1621">And of course I do believe that on liberation day or two days -- a day later, I -- my typhoid disappeared.</span> <span id="s1622">But I was extremely weak, weighing 88 pounds.</span> <span id="s1623">Q: Well, what was it like to be in the camps, like the week before liberation, what were the Germans doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1625">A day before liberation on April 14, one day before we were liberated, we all knew or felt or sensed that the war has come to an end, that we are going to be liberated in a day or two.</span> <span id="s1626">The Germans were in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1627">We saw it that they are in a hurry, that they are trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1628">And in the morning when we opened our eyes, we saw that the towers are empty, there are no SS men any more.</span> <span id="s1629">And then we heard some shooting, artillery or something like this.</span> <span id="s1630">In an hour or two -- hours later a single tank rolled into the camp.</span> <span id="s1631">And we heard -- and this was so reassuring, y-y-yo -- you are free.</span> <span id="s1632">We are here liberating you.</span> <span id="s1633">I saw it, and I think that perhaps I was not sure that this is true, but in another tr -- ‘nother English tank rolled in and I saw them distributing chocolate to people.</span> <span id="s1634">That was a terrible mistake, people were dying like flies, taking two pieces of chocolate, they couldn’t -- their stomachs couldn’t take it, they were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s1635">Again my friend saved me.</span> <span id="s1636">He did not let me take anything.</span> <span id="s1637">And here I have to tell you a very interesting moment at night he was afraid that the -- that the hunger will -- will force me to go out and take some food that I cannot digest.</span> <span id="s1638">He tied his feet with my feet all night long.</span> <span id="s1639">I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1640">He was much more experienced than I.</span> <span id="s1641">We were -- he tied with a rope my feet to his feet.</span> <span id="s1642">This is what friendship is all about.</span> <span id="s1643">You care.</span> <span id="s1644">You care for your friend as much as you care for yourself, or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: What -- what did you think and he think you were able to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Just soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: He was constantly saying, take two soups, five soups, as many as you want, but soup, a soup, a warm soup.</span> <span id="s1649">And I followed his advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: So what did you do when you realized there were no Germans in the tower?</span> <span id="s1651">There was about an hour before the first tank.</span> <span id="s1652">What did people do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Okay, there was time.</span> <span id="s1655">What did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: We were -- we were waiting.</span> <span id="s1657">We knew that we -- we knew that something is happening.</span> <span id="s1658">We were waiting.</span> <span id="s1659">We greeted those liberators as though they are angels from heaven.</span> <span id="s1660">It was a lot of excitement, euphoric.</span> <span id="s1661">We were all euphoric.</span> <span id="s1662">But I have to mention here something.</span> <span id="s1663">That feeling of happiness, after awhile, and I cannot pinpoint it to two weeks or four weeks or six weeks, completely faded away.</span> <span id="s1664">All of a sudden, most of us es -- I, an-and I would say most of us felt that we cannot return to our homes.</span> <span id="s1665">We have no families, but all those liberators will go back to United Kingdom, the United States, and -- and live a normal life, but we are alone.</span> <span id="s1666">[indecipherable] we have to start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1667">What will I do?</span> <span id="s1668">And how will I be able to cope with that fact that I am alone, or only with one friend?</span> <span id="s1669">That was a depressing feeling.</span> <span id="s1670">Very strong, depressing feeling.</span> <span id="s1671">And that lasted for awhile.</span> <span id="s1672">But then, after that Rosensaft organized of com -- organized th-the -- all survivors, we became more active.</span> <span id="s1673">That feeling was replaced by a belief that we will manage.</span> <span id="s1674">It was interesting also that most of the survivors, and of course including me, were trying to get married, to create life again.</span> <span id="s1675">That was a -- a crucial point in our liberation, to prove to the world that we are going to bring life again.</span> <span id="s1676">And that we will be able to find a place, someplace, where we will be able to restore life.</span> <span id="s1677">And that what happened really.</span> <span id="s1678">Those who were more courageous than I went to live in Israel.</span> <span id="s1679">The rest of us went to the United States.</span> <span id="s1680">And having said that, I must express my feelings here, that people who are born here in the United States don’t appreciate at all what the United States is all about.</span> <span id="s1681">We do.</span> <span id="s1682">We do.</span> <span id="s1683">We -- I am -- I am all for the United States, it’s the greatest country that existed in all s -- all civilized life for the last two or 3000 years.</span> <span id="s1684">We have to preserve it.</span> <span id="s1685">Why am I expressing it in such a -- in such an interview?</span> <span id="s1686">I guess because I need my children and grandchildren to know how I -- how I was in awe of the United States.</span> <span id="s1687">Maybe they will understand it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: When were you able to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: I came January 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: And in between your liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: I don’t go to work on that.</span> <span id="s1692">I stay home, I read hist -- American history or the Bill of Rights, I don’t go to work on that day.</span> <span id="s1693">This is for me a day of celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Oh, now you don’t go to work on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: No, I don’t go to work on that day now, it’s a day of celebration and I sit home and I read American history or Bill of Rights, whatever -- whatever I can.</span> <span id="s1696">But I never go to work on that day.</span> <span id="s1697">This is not the way to wor -- not -- is not a day to work.</span> <span id="s1698">This is a way -- a day to celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: And just briefly, after liberation, where are you relocated to?</span> <span id="s1700">And I’m presuming that you’re able to stay with your friend and also Rose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Yeah, we were relocated -- the German -- the English army burned the entire camp because it was infested and they had to burn all the barracks.</span> <span id="s1702">And they transferred us -- they transferred us to where -- about three miles from the old barracks and two German military barracks.</span> <span id="s1703">They were, of course, completely different.</span> <span id="s1704">We had the very nice room, there were restrooms around.</span> <span id="s1705">And I lived, of course, with my friend in that room, and Rose lived with her sister in another building not far from that building.</span> <span id="s1706">I saw her every day, almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Probably at the end of 1940 -- to Rose -- or not to Rose, in December of 1945.</span> <span id="s1710">December of 1945, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1711">We have one daughter, and we have adopted three children.</span> <span id="s1712">One child was the child of Rose’s sister, that she was able after the parents were taken to Auschwitz, Rose was able to bring her to a Polish family and she survived with that Polish family.</span> <span id="s1713">After the war, we brought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile.</span> <span id="s1714">But there was a little problem.</span> <span id="s1715">She was so grateful to that Christian family that she was looking at us as people who are trying to take away her religion.</span> <span id="s1716">And it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1717">But in 1949, Rose and I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1718">I had some family in Israel from before the war, and Rose had a larger family, two uncles, and she of course went with us.</span> <span id="s1719">And here a dramatic change took place.</span> <span id="s1720">All of a sudden she fell in love with the people in Israel and she didn't want to return.</span> <span id="s1721">She wanted to live her life there.</span> <span id="s1722">And she lives there, she’s married, she has four children, we have how many?</span> <span id="s1723">Four, five [inaudible] -- we have nine grandchildren there.</span> <span id="s1724">No, we have four grandchildren and -- and how many did I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: You said nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Nine or maybe 10 great-grandchildren, you know.</span> <span id="s1727">And we are very, very attached to each other.</span> <span id="s1728">Wer -- I used to go twice a year with my wife to be with them for six, eight weeks sometimes.</span> <span id="s1729">At least six weeks.</span> <span id="s1730">And we are, as I said, very close.</span> <span id="s1731">I love my grandchildren, and I love my great-grandchildren very much.</span> <span id="s1732">They come to the States and stay with me, and we have a marvelous time with them.</span> <span id="s1733">Then, in 1966, something happened.</span> <span id="s1734">Rose had a cousin in Buenos Aires in Argentina, and they, husband and wife were involved in a terrible automobile accident and got killed.</span> <span id="s1735">A school friend of mine who lived in Buenos Aires called me up and told me the story and he said, you have to come, because those are two children and nobody knows what to do with them.</span> <span id="s1736">I will take care of.</span> <span id="s1737">I went.</span> <span id="s1738">I spent several weeks in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1739">I had difficulties communicating with them, but I was able to get some visas for them to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1740">They were tourist visas.</span> <span id="s1741">They came to the United States and they stayed with me for awhile, and even though when I came to Buenos Aires their friends were trying to tell them -- their school friends that I came maybe to take advantage of them.</span> <span id="s1742">After they came to the States and lived with me for a few weeks, I remember taking them to the airport because they had to go back to Argentina for me to get permanent visas.</span> <span id="s1743">They were so afraid that maybe I will not get those permanent visas, they were holding my hand in the airport and I reassured them.</span> <span id="s1744">And after -- and I don’t remember any more, maybe two or three months later, I got the visas and they came to live with us.</span> <span id="s1745">I love them very dearly.</span> <span id="s1746">I don’t make any distinction between my daughter and the rest of them.</span> <span id="s1747">And they made me proud of them.</span> <span id="s1748">One is a professor -- assistant professor in Boston.</span> <span id="s1749">He was first at BU, and now he’s in a different college.</span> <span id="s1750">And one is a physician in -- in New Britain, who became the chief of neurology in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1751">And the o -- his brother, extremely capable young man, who is -- wrote his story in a very moving way, and who gave us three grandchildren and the -- the younger son gave us also three grandchildren, they come very often, but really not often enough and we spend time together.</span> <span id="s1752">I try to -- to -- to direct them, or to show them the right way of life and I perhaps am successful, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: You speak about your grandchildren -- Q2: Give me one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: You speak about your grandchildren and great-grandchildren --</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: -- children, and you’re doing this interview today.</span> <span id="s1757">What do you want them to know about Auschwitz, your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: I imagine in the beginning that I was reluctant, very much so, for the last 45 or 50 years, to tell my story.</span> <span id="s1759">But I am doing it today for them.</span> <span id="s1760">They should know the story.</span> <span id="s1761">They should watch it and remember.</span> <span id="s1762">I did not speak to them enough, or perhaps at all about my life in camps.</span> <span id="s1763">Now, they will have a record, and to me that is extremely important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: What was the relux -- reluctance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: To talk to them?</span> <span id="s1766">I was reluctant to talk to anybody about it in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1767">The main -- the feeling why not was based on a certain, if not arrogance, but a certain feeling, what am I going to tell them, they don’t understand me -- they don’t understand it anyhow.</span> <span id="s1768">On that feeling disappeared.</span> <span id="s1769">And as you probably know, I was the national chairman of the Days of Remembrance, appointed by President Carter, and then the -- reappointed by President Reagan and Bush.</span> <span id="s1770">I was the chairman of the -- of the -- forgot the name of that committee.</span> <span id="s1771">Yes, dealing with the [indecipherable] of the future museum.</span> <span id="s1772">I was a member of the executive board, we worked very hard to make sure that the world cannot forget, and I became the national chairman of Days of Remembrance.</span> <span id="s1773">That first year I reported to the council that I was able to convince three governors, the governor of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey to have Days of Remembrance in their capitals and invite -- and invite all the [indecipherable] and people to -- to be present and to remember the Holocaust, lighting candles.</span> <span id="s1774">When I reported it, I got a standing ovation.</span> <span id="s1775">The next year, and I don’t remember the numbers any more, I probably reported 10 or 12.</span> <span id="s1776">After four or five years I reported, I have every state having Days of Remembrance in their capitals.</span> <span id="s1777">I have mai -- main cities.</span> <span id="s1778">I don’t remember -- don’t remember how many cities doing exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s1779">I was very, very proud -- I am very, very proud of -- of accomplishing what I have accomplished.</span> <span id="s1780">If I spent too much time, for me I did not.</span> <span id="s1781">But I -- perhaps for my family I was too -- too many days away.</span> <span id="s1782">I was in Washington very, very often, maybe five, six days a month in Washington, and traveling to -- to o -- other states and making sure that there [indecipherable] done properly.</span> <span id="s1783">But this is a legacy that I am leaving, leaving for my children and grandchildren, never to forget, to get involved in the cause of memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Thank you very much for listening to me.</span> <span id="s1786">Thank you all.</span> <span id="s1787">When I came to the United States, my aunt, the sister of my mother’s, had that picture.</span> <span id="s1788">It was sent to her before the war.</span> <span id="s1789">My parents are here, young, and to me they look beautiful.</span> <span id="s1790">I keep that picture in my room, to look at it whenever I am there, and I revive memories looking at that picture.</span> <span id="s1791">It’s very helpful.</span> <span id="s1792">That picture I received in Israel from my sister’s friends.</span> <span id="s1793">She had a -- she had quite a few friends, and I am not sure why my sister sent the picture to Israel.</span> <span id="s1794">I was thinking many times that maybe she was thinking of going there, and she sent the picture to get her some papers or something like this, but I am not positive, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Are those the only two photographs you have of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Yes.</span></p>
