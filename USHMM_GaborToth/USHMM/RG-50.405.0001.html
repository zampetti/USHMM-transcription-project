DATE: March 16, 1991</span></p> <p><span id="s15">INTERVIEWER: Elaine Snyderman I was born in Odessa, 1954.</span> <span id="s16">My mother was an oncologist.</span> <span id="s17">My father was overseeing the veterinarysanitation inspection in the rural area.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Before I started school I remember my grandmother my father's mother took care of me.</span> <span id="s19">Then I went to yasli, a nursery school, until the age of four.</span> <span id="s20">It was Okay.</span> <span id="s21">Then I went to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s22">Supper I usually had with my mother.</span> <span id="s23">My father was often away on business trips.</span> <span id="s24">I was the only child and did everything by myself.</span> <span id="s25">Nobody helped me.</span> <span id="s26">From time to time I remember I was afraid to be alone.</span> <span id="s27">Then I would phone to my mother.</span> <span id="s28">Our neighbors had a phone.</span> <span id="s29">We got a telephone only when I was grown up.</span> <span id="s30">I went to watch TV with my neighbors.</span> <span id="s31">We couldn't buy a TV until 1964.</span> <span id="s32">I remember Pesach and Purim.</span> <span id="s33">I remember Purim because I liked to eat Hamantaschen.</span> <span id="s34">I remember Pesach because we spent it with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s35">I remember matzoh and horseradish, salted eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">When I was a child I didn't like being a Jew.</span> <span id="s37">I remember coming to my mother and saying I don't want to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s38">The boys around me decided that Jews were bad people.</span> <span id="s39">As a boy I wanted to be like the others.</span> <span id="s40">When I said I didn't want to be a Jew, she said, "You're a Jew."</span> <span id="s41">And I said no.</span> <span id="s42">Mother's cousin, a very clever woman, tried to persuade me that to be a Jew was very good and it was impossible to change a nationality.</span> <span id="s43">I don't remember if I cried.</span> <span id="s44">In time I got used to the idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">The consciousness that I was a Jew, a particular kind of nationality, came to me much later, at the end of school, about 15.</span> <span id="s46">I don't know how my peers knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s47">Maybe their families discussed such things.</span> <span id="s48">But in my family we didn't touch this subject much.</span> <span id="s49">It was a sensitive question.</span> <span id="s50">If you try to speak a lot about it, it would not help you to live.</span> <span id="s51">You start thinking about it and it is not helping.</span> <span id="s52">You have to live in such a community and if you wish to have a social life you have to use the rules of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">I don't remember discussions about politics.</span> <span id="s54">Only when I became a student.</span> <span id="s55">In Russia, the official opinion which you can read about in newspapers, is just the opposite of what really is.</span> <span id="s56">It's very difficult to get information about what's happening with the Jews.</span> <span id="s57">But everybody knew if you wished to go to the medical institute, your percentage was only five percent.</span> <span id="s58">You could only be in that five percent of students and it came from the Russian government.</span> <span id="s59">If you would come to the medical institute you would have a lot of problems because you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s60">Nobody tells you anything about it.</span> <span id="s61">It's very strange.</span> <span id="s62">You come to the medical institute and you say, Okay, I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s63">Have you any discrimination?</span> <span id="s64">No, they would say, we like Jews.</span> <span id="s65">But you see, official people have two faces.</span> <span id="s66">When you ask them about Jews they show you one face but when you start to do something as a Jew they show you the other face.</span> <span id="s67">But they show you "underground."</span> <span id="s68">I didn't have much discrimination.</span> <span id="s69">I had discrimination when I entered the medical school but I passed all the exams and then came to it.</span> <span id="s70">Maybe the chief of the medical institute at that time was a very good person.</span> <span id="s71">My wife Lia couldn't go to medical school in Odessa because of that quota.</span> <span id="s72">And her father was afraid that she would be failed.</span> <span id="s73">My parents were afraid too but they didn't want me to leave Odessa.</span> <span id="s74">That's why I attempted first to attend the institute in Odessa but if I had failed I would have tried to attend in another town.</span> <span id="s75">I was 16 when I entered medical school and graduated at 22.</span> <span id="s76">In the sixth year of medical school I specialized in surgery.</span> <span id="s77">I was in the science circle from the second year on.</span> <span id="s78">This research organization helped me to become a surgeon.</span> <span id="s79">I continued research investigations all my life.</span> <span id="s80">In 1986 I earned a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s81">I got my diploma but I wasn't really a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">I had to practice another year, an internship.</span> <span id="s83">For the next three years I worked in a position, "young physician," which is residency in the USA.</span> <span id="s84">I had some privileges, for example if something happened to a patient I had a curator who looked after this patient and I was not the single responsible person looking after a patient.</span> <span id="s85">After three years I become a surgeon.</span> <span id="s86">I did an operation and someone tried to help but it's not typical.</span> <span id="s87">Usually you come into life after internship, you swim as much as you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">I had three Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s89">One was very close to me and now he's in California.</span> <span id="s90">The other guys, we were close during the medical institute and then we lost each other.</span> <span id="s91">You see, there were problems.</span> <span id="s92">Let's say I would like to become a member of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s93">It's impossible for me.</span> <span id="s94">It's very difficult for a Jew to become a member of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s95">First of all the Communist party is a career.</span> <span id="s96">Who would like the Jews to have a career?</span> <span id="s97">Second, who would choose the future members of the communist party?</span> <span id="s98">The members of the Communist party who would like to take the kind of people that resemble themselves.</span> <span id="s99">And third, I didn't show every time my wishes to become an active member of the Young Communist League or Young Communist Party.</span> <span id="s100">And that's why no one put an eye on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">This problem did not become my problem.</span> <span id="s102">It didn't stay before me and I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s103">There are two political forums in Russia.</span> <span id="s104">The international forum and the local politics, the day to day events in Russia.</span> <span id="s105">Nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s106">Everyday they would say the same thing, "Work for Russia and we will look after you."</span> <span id="s107">It was everyday the same thing without change.</span> <span id="s108">What kind of politics?</span> <span id="s109">Real politics stayed hidden under a large cover.</span> <span id="s110">They don't say anything about Jews or people who don't like to live like everybody lives.</span> <span id="s111">They gave them the name dissidents.</span> <span id="s112">They tried to say nothing about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">When Sakharov appeared, he was very popular, a great person, and when he told everybody the internal politics of our government is not good, immediately a lot of comments appeared in the newspapers that said Sakharov is a bad person.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">First of all, nobody told us what Sakharov's dreams and ideas were.</span> <span id="s115">Nobody knew, and neither did I, what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s116">And when an announcement appeared in the paper that Sakharov was a bad person, you learned that he did something wrong against the government and he was digging a grave for himself.</span> <span id="s117">It was impossible to get any information, any real information from the newspaper.</span> <span id="s118">That's why you haven't any information about political matters.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">I knew that there must be another side to the story but I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s120">I know that this was a very famous person who was in research in nuclear physics and he was a three star hero but what he would like to say and why the government published this article against him, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s121">That's why internal politics were not interesting because you knew in advance what they were going to say.</span> <span id="s122">Our friends had the same kind of reaction when they read these things, depending on their character and education.</span> <span id="s123">As a physician in my generation I had Ukrainian, Georgian, Russian friends.</span> <span id="s124">There were few Jewish physicians in my generation; the situation for Jewish guys to get a medical education became gradually worse, especially after Stalin died.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">I studied English before I started medical school, two or three 45minute lessons a week.</span> <span id="s126">We read a little article and translated if we could.</span> <span id="s127">Nobody said to learn this language because it might help you.</span> <span id="s128">They paid much more attention to the Ukrainian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">On holidays, we had one or two days off.</span> <span id="s130">Seventh of November is the day of the October Revolution in 1917, but now for the majority of people it just meant a day off.</span> <span id="s131">As a surgeon I usually worked.</span> <span id="s132">I lived with my family until the end of medical school and then I moved to another town.</span> <span id="s133">We stayed together for not just money and conditions but also social support.</span> <span id="s134">They helped me.</span> <span id="s135">I chose chemistry originally.</span> <span id="s136">But it was a very difficult way, but I knew at that time if I succeeded in entering the university for chemistry what would come after that?</span> <span id="s137">I would become a teacher.</span> <span id="s138">It was very difficult to move in research in chemistry as a Jew.</span> <span id="s139">And in science, your [development] depends on what kind of institution and what kind of research, the kind of teachers, the kind of people who surround you.</span> <span id="s140">Research didn't have any future for me and I didn't want to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s141">Friends of my parents were teachers but this specialty did not satisfy them.</span> <span id="s142">I didn't feel drawn to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">My next choice was to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s144">I can't say I wanted to be a doctor from the very beginning of my life.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe my family, the books that surrounded me, maybe the friends of my parents who were doctors, maybe my mother's advice, but step by step, at fifteen I decided to prepare for medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">In 1978 I first thought about emigrating.</span> <span id="s147">I was in BelgorodDnestrovsk, about 100 miles from Odessa.</span> <span id="s148">The institute assigned me there.</span> <span id="s149">I was there for two years.</span> <span id="s150">In 1980 I first applied to go to the United States because I thought there was no future for the Jews in Russia.</span> <span id="s151">It is something you think about when you don't have an opportunity to fulfill your dreams.</span> <span id="s152">When this choice appears before you, you have to take it.</span> <span id="s153">In 1978 we actually first applied, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s154">It was the end of the opportunity.</span> <span id="s155">In 1980 they didn't even answer.</span> <span id="s156">Nothing was moving in Odessa.</span> <span id="s157">In Moscow they could still get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">I returned to Odessa in 1979 and worked in an emergency hospital as a surgeon.</span> <span id="s159">In 1982 I went to Kiev and worked in the institute there.</span> <span id="s160">I met Lia in Odessa in 1981 and we were married in 1982.</span> <span id="s161">And then she stayed in Odessa and I went to Kiev.</span> <span id="s162">We were apart for two years.</span> <span id="s163">It was the equivalent of a fellowship here.</span> <span id="s164">When I returned to Odessa I worked at the area hospital, the largest in the city.</span> <span id="s165">Lia had just finished residency.</span></p></body></html>
