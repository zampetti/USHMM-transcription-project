1989</span></p> <p><span id="s11">01:00:26</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Could you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s13">A: Niels Bamberger.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in October 1928 in Germany.</span> <span id="s16">Würzburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s17">And I was born, as an infant, my parents fled Germany to Copenhagen in 1932, where my mother originally had come from.</span> <span id="s18">And, uh, she lived in...in Germany for nine years, ten years.</span> <span id="s19">Then she went back to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">01:00:58</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Why had she lived in Germany for ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Because she got married.</span> <span id="s23">She grew up in Denmark and lived in Denmark and then she married my father who lived in Germany and they were married in 1923 and then they went back to Denmark when it started to get...uh...with Hitler, and it started to get too hot in Germany.</span> <span id="s24">Then they went back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s25">And that's where I actually grew up and lived half of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s27">Tell me about...what did your father do?</span> <span id="s28">What was his occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, in Denmark he had an antique store.</span> <span id="s30">He had an art store; and they started that like in 1935-36 in Copenhagen, 'til we fled to Sweden in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Tell me if you would about growing up in Copenhagen before the Germans came, in the '30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I went to a non-Jewish school.</span> <span id="s33">I was...I wouldn't say I was the only Jew in school, but we were probably two or three fellows and the school was from 8 to 2 every day and then in the afternoon, we went for Hebrew...for Hebrew lessons or Hebrew school for another two, three hours.</span> <span id="s34">So we came back...we came home like 5:30, 6:00 every night and did our homework.</span> <span id="s35">And that was the same routine.</span> <span id="s36">Of course, we had no schools Saturday or Sunday.</span> <span id="s37">Then we were off and we went to football games and bicycling and things like that.</span> <span id="s38">Whatever we did with my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was your...your parents' home like.</span> <span id="s40">Did you practice...?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Well, we had a house in Copenhagen, in the center of Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s42">We had our own house that had belonged to my grandfather and great grandfather.</span> <span id="s43">It's still standing there now.</span> <span id="s44">And it's probably two or three hundred years old.</span> <span id="s45">And we had a big apartment on the second floor.</span> <span id="s46">There were other people living in the house and then there were stores.</span> <span id="s47">There were stores on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s48">And we had a synagogue that had been there for more than one hundred years also started by my great-grandfather on...in the same house we had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">01:03:15</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: In the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s52">And it's still there.</span> <span id="s53">It's not anymore there today because it was given to the city of Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s55">Tell me how that worked?</span> <span id="s56">That is were you...you must have been heavily...your family was heavily involved in that synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">We were very...I was brought up very Orthodox; and, of course, my parents were too.</span> <span id="s59">My grandfather was a Rabbi, and my brother is a Rabbi today.</span> <span id="s60">So that's the way we grew up.</span> <span id="s61">We...we had a very good life.</span> <span id="s62">Like Tove said.</span> <span id="s63">And uh...we had no problems whatsoever all the time.</span> <span id="s64">Not money-wise or economic or we had no problem until it started in October '43, and the Germans had been in the country for three years from '40 to '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Hold it for one minute.</span> <span id="s66">Before we get to the Germans, I would like to know a little more about your being Jewish in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s67">And you were so closely involved in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s68">What...what did your Jewish life consist of?</span> <span id="s69">What kinds of things did you do?</span> <span id="s70">Holidays, services, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: We had services every day in our synagogue.</span> <span id="s72">And, of course, we had the sabbath, the Jewish Sabbath every week, and we had the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s73">And uh...the reason our synagogue was started originally of...by my great grandfather or grandfather was that he didn't think that the big synagogue--they have a beautiful, large synagogue in Copenhagen-- but that wasn't Orthodox enough hundred years ago.</span> <span id="s74">They started with, uh...different reformed things; and they cut this prayer out and they cut this one out.</span> <span id="s75">And that's when my grandfather started his own synagogue, so to speak.</span> <span id="s76">And like I said, it still...it still can be seen.</span> <span id="s77">It's in the museum in Copenhagen...the city.</span> <span id="s78">You see them in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s79">They have...they removed everything when the house was sold a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s80">It...like I said, it's a very old building, and it's in the heart of the city.</span> <span id="s81">And there was no money to pay the taxes and the roof was falling apart so to speak and...uh...then it was sold.</span> <span id="s82">The house was sold, and the synagogue was removed.</span> <span id="s83">And that's the story.</span> <span id="s84">Today, it's just an old, uh...landmark building in the center of Copenhagen that's being owned by a private man or corporation.</span> <span id="s85">I don't know who has it today.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">01:06:03</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Uh, in growing up in such a very...in a Orthodox Jewish home, did you feel differently?</span> <span id="s88">Did you feel you were treated differently than your Christian neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s90">They were my friends.</span> <span id="s91">And, uh...we went together for this or for that and we had birthday parties and we went to ball games and things like that, I said before.</span> <span id="s92">And, uh...there was no difference.</span> <span id="s93">Nobody ever mentioned anything about Jewish or non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s94">We were all the same.</span> <span id="s95">We were citizens of Denmark and that's all they cared about.</span> <span id="s96">Nobody said you are Jewish or you are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s97">That made no difference to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">01:06:44</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: When the Germans invaded in 1940, you would have been 12 years old?</span> <span id="s100">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Uh, what can you tell me about, uh...the invasion itself?</span> <span id="s102">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, we know that, uh, there were soldiers all over.</span> <span id="s104">And they threw out leaflets all over the city, all over the country that people could just go now and don't make any uproar.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Everything will continue the way it was.</span> <span id="s106">Of course, everything became rationed or rationed whatever.</span> <span id="s107">And...uh... we were in school that day.</span> <span id="s108">We saw loads and loads of planes, bombing planes coming one after...I mean hundreds and hundreds of planes coming in and Germans on motorcycles, horses, dragging cannons and the big tanks all over the place.</span> <span id="s109">It didn't take more than a couple of hours 'til they took over the country.</span> <span id="s110">Like I said they [the Danes] couldn't resist.</span> <span id="s111">Denmark was a very small country.</span> <span id="s112">And, uh...life went on as before, except that that you are not allowed to walk on this side of the street in front of the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">They would post soldiers with, uh...guns and...and steel helmets and things like that in front of the banks and the hotels and important institutions that they wanted to guard.</span> <span id="s114">But besides that nothing happened really.</span> <span id="s115">The police was in force and the Danish Army was...although they were there, they had not much to say or to do, but they were all...life was continuing the way it was.</span> <span id="s116">Everything got rationed and we had to buy butter and bread and gasoline, all the things.</span> <span id="s117">You couldn't go out and buy whatever you wanted, but there was plenty of it around.</span> <span id="s118">The Germans took away whatever they needed, but there was still plenty.</span> <span id="s119">Denmark is a dairy country, so there was plenty of food for everybody.</span> <span id="s120">And then in...uh...in 1943, they took the...they arrested all the police and the Army.</span> <span id="s121">They took them away in August of '43.</span> <span id="s122">That's when we know...knew something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s123">They took them away and interned them all in camps and took their weapons away and then they said that it was the police's fault and the army.</span> <span id="s124">Then all of a sudden they switched over and they said that it's all the Jews' fault.</span> <span id="s125">I mean they didn't say it, but we knew that something was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">01:09:32</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How?</span> <span id="s128">Tell me what your life had been like in those three years and then we will continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The same thing like before.</span> <span id="s130">We went to school.</span> <span id="s131">We had food.</span> <span id="s132">We had all holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">And...uh...we went to Hebrew school, went to regular school.</span> <span id="s134">There was no difference so to speak except that...uh...we saw the Germans all over.</span> <span id="s135">And...uh...everybody despised them.</span> <span id="s136">They still do today.</span> <span id="s137">When the Germans go to Denmark with their big cars and so on, nobody likes them there.</span> <span id="s138">But otherwise, everything continued the way it had been til '43.</span> <span id="s139">I think it was August '43 that...uh...they took, the Germans...they took the police force and the soldiers and interned everybody and...uh... August...and October 1st, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah, they had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community.</span> <span id="s140">They had all the names, all the addresses of everyone in Copenhagen, which was about 6,000 Jews and they had....</span> <span id="s141">They knew where they lived, what they did, their business.</span> <span id="s142">They had everything.</span> <span id="s143">And we were informed in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go home because the Germans are going to round you up the night between the 1st and the 2nd of October.</span> <span id="s144">And those who believed it, which most of the people did, we were all scared.</span> <span id="s145">They...uh...didn't go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">We all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or where to sleep.</span> <span id="s147">Those who didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s148">They were taken, which was a very small percentage anyhow.</span> <span id="s149">And they all came back after the war.</span> <span id="s150">So we went to our grocer who was a bachelor and he said, "Come to my house and I'll take care of you."</span> <span id="s151">So after the synagogue, we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his store bread and butter and cheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s152">He took care of us for a week til we found a connection how to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s153">Copenhagen is on the seashore and we went up to Snekkersten, same place and where most of them went from.</span> <span id="s154">Everybody went to Sweden from there because it's the narrowest point between Denmark and Sweden.</span> <span id="s155">It's like three, four miles wide.</span> <span id="s156">That's the whole thing...the waterway.</span> <span id="s157">But it is very heavy stream there.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">It's a very heavy...uh... waterway.</span> <span id="s159">So we stayed in his house and....</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: In whose....</span> <span id="s161">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s162">How...first of all, how did you get to Snekkersten?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: How did we get there?</span> <span id="s164">Well, he called up every day.</span> <span id="s165">He called up somebody that he knew from the resistance movement and he didn't say...we went with...I went with my parents and my two brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s166">We were six people altogether.</span> <span id="s167">And he wouldn't say that he has some people to send.</span> <span id="s168">He didn't know if this telephone was...uh...what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Tapped?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Tapped!</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: This is your grocer calling?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">So he called up.</span> <span id="s174">He said, "I have six tons of potatoes.</span> <span id="s175">Could you come and pick them up?"</span> <span id="s176">'Til he finally got a connection.</span> <span id="s177">And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s178">And then we got a taxi; and the taxi took us up to that place up in Snekkersten, where everybody had been collected, so to speak.</span> <span id="s179">All the people were there.</span> <span id="s180">There were two or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's home, in a basement.</span> <span id="s181">And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the taxi with...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, "What's wrong?</span> <span id="s182">What do you have in there?"</span> <span id="s183">He would say, "I have a sick person.</span> <span id="s184">Just close the door.</span> <span id="s185">I have to go to the hospital."</span> <span id="s186">So we were covered up and he went up there.</span> <span id="s187">It's not more than 30, 40 minute ride by taxi.</span> <span id="s188">We went up there.</span> <span id="s189">We came to that house.</span> <span id="s190">And...uh...we met somebody from the resistance movement who took us down to the pier at night, and we came down there and we were told that the boat we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else who paid more money for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">01:13:57 He paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the fishing boat.</span> <span id="s192">So we had to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this way that the resistance movement had a big schooner-like; and they took two or three hundred people aboard.</span> <span id="s193">We went all down...down below deck, and uh...we went out there by row boats.</span> <span id="s194">It wasn't far out to the ship and when they had all the people there, first we paid them money.</span> <span id="s195">We paid like 2,000 krone a person.</span> <span id="s196">That was the going rate.</span> <span id="s197">Which was a lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to Sweden the money is worthless.</span> <span id="s198">You can't do anything with it.</span> <span id="s199">You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2, whatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford it.</span> <span id="s200">They will also get out.</span> <span id="s201">Everybody got out, whether they had money or not.</span> <span id="s202">They were all helped to get out.</span> <span id="s203">And we got aboard that ship and, uh... we got off.</span> <span id="s204">We sailed also...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the ocean we had this big Swedish torpedo boat or gunboat coming towards us.</span> <span id="s205">We all thought it was the Germans, but it was the Swedish boat.</span> <span id="s206">They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off, on the Swedish ship.</span> <span id="s207">We got aboard the Swedish ship and they gave us coffee and candy or whatever, and then we went into Sweden.</span> <span id="s208">And we were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">01:15:31 (cough) So when we arrived in Sweden, we were all listed by names.</span> <span id="s210">They wanted to know who is coming and here that they didn't have any German helpers or whoever.</span> <span id="s211">We were all listed by name and address and age and so on.</span> <span id="s212">And we came there on the night of Yom Kippur or the day before Yom Kippur, which was very unpleasant for us.</span> <span id="s213">We got food.</span> <span id="s214">We got clothing.</span> <span id="s215">We had nothing along except what we wore.</span> <span id="s216">We had no...we had nothing along with us.</span> <span id="s217">Just what we had on!</span> <span id="s218">And...uh...I remember that we went to...we were in a camp, a big camp that was guarded by the Swedish soldiers, and we could go freely.</span> <span id="s219">We could go in and out the way we wanted.</span> <span id="s220">We wanted, of course, my father wanted to go to the synagogue--which was like 10, 12 miles away.</span> <span id="s221">And we all walked in there, on Yom Kippur morning, into Hälsingborg.</span> <span id="s222">We walked in there to synagogue and we....</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You walked 12 miles just to go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">01:16:38</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s226">And we attended the services, a full day of services, without food.</span> <span id="s227">And uh...in the middle of the afternoon, a girl came in with a bus, a big bus; and they interrupted the services.</span> <span id="s228">And they said that all the people from Denmark, all the refugees who are here in the synagogue, should immediately come out to the bus and go back to camp.</span> <span id="s229">They had left the camp and we should go back.</span> <span id="s230">So my father said, "Now that we have been saved from the Germans, we are not going to go on a bus on Yom Kippur."</span> <span id="s231">We were not used to that.</span> <span id="s232">(Laughing) So we waited until after the services were over at night, and then somebody took us home from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s233">Somebody drove us back to the camp.</span> <span id="s234">And when we came back to camp, we were told, "You have to leave tonight.</span> <span id="s235">Because you didn't come back with the girl that was sent with the bus, so you have to leave tonight."</span> <span id="s236">And uh...we had no money or anything.</span> <span id="s237">So we went to the railroad station; and somebody bought us the tickets to Malmö, where my father had a cousin.</span> <span id="s238">So we came there in the middle of the night, 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s239">But we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s240">We were saved.</span> <span id="s241">We were happy.</span> <span id="s242">And uh...then we got an apartment there eventually.</span> <span id="s243">Little by little, my parents started a restaurant.</span> <span id="s244">On the card I gave you, you can see that from that time.</span> <span id="s245">My parents started a restaurant, because my mother felt if she makes food for other people--she was a very good cook--then there'll be enough for us to eat, also.</span> <span id="s246">And we all got jobs for October, November, December; and in January, the school opened...a Danish school for the...for the refugees-- children, or so to speak.</span> <span id="s247">And we went to school there where we had left it off in Denmark and continued in Sweden.</span> <span id="s248">We...it was in Lund.</span> <span id="s249">We went there by train every day, which was a 20, 25-minute train ride and we got the train...the, uh, tickets from the government, and we got pocket money.</span> <span id="s250">Each one got pocket money; and on Sunday, in order to make something extra for us, or to help our parents, we made...I remember that I delivered flowers.</span> <span id="s251">I worked in a flower shop, and delivered flowers as a boy.</span> <span id="s252">I was 15 years old, so I made extra money that way.</span> <span id="s253">And we were very happy there.</span> <span id="s254">We had all the goodies that we didn't have in Denmark.</span> <span id="s255">They didn't have bananas and oranges and chocolate and chewing gum.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">We didn't have in Denmark anymore at that time, so we could buy that in Sweden.</span> <span id="s257">Not that it was so important, but, uh...there was plenty of everything.</span> <span id="s258">Sweden was neutral, and they kept on importing whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s259">They had everything.</span> <span id="s260">And that's actually what happened to us in Sweden.</span> <span id="s261">We were there for...we were there for close to two years, 'til May '45.</span> <span id="s262">Everybody went back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s263">We were very happy.</span> <span id="s264">On May 4th, when we [were] told that the Germans gave up in Denmark and Norway, Holland, Belgium...uh, we went back....</span> <span id="s265">Everybody was celebrating.</span> <span id="s266">And the 28th of May everybody went back on the ferry boats to Denmark.</span> <span id="s267">And when we came back to Denmark, each one...there were all the Danes were there, and we all got money.</span> <span id="s268">Not a lot of money, but we got some money.</span> <span id="s269">So we could take a taxi or bus or whatever home.</span> <span id="s270">Each person got some money from the Danish government.</span> <span id="s271">And I remember we came home to our apartment and found everything the way we had left it--except, of course, there were mice and spiders and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s272">But the food was on the table, in the pots.</span> <span id="s273">Nobody had been into the apartment.</span> <span id="s274">Everything was the way we left it.</span> <span id="s275">And the synagogue that I mentioned before, our lawyer had taken away the torah scrolls and hidden them in a..</span> <span id="s276">.</span> <span id="s277">what you say, in a vault?</span> <span id="s278">Safety vault, in a bank.</span> <span id="s279">And they were all...everything was left the way, the way...uh...everything came back the way we left it two years earlier.</span> <span id="s280">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">01:21:12</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Was your father involved at all in...uh...the brigade?</span> <span id="s283">When you were in Sweden, was your father involved at all in the brigade that was being formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No.</span> <span id="s285">I applied for it, but I was only, uh...15 years old, or going on 16, and I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">They wouldn't take anybody below 18.</span> <span id="s287">And my father was actually too old.</span> <span id="s288">[In] '43, he was almost 60 at that time.</span> <span id="s289">So they had enough young people and what they actually needed them for....</span> <span id="s290">There was no fighting when we came back.</span> <span id="s291">What they needed them for was to clean up after the Germans, and take the weapons away and count this and count that.</span> <span id="s292">And the uniforms...whatever they had.</span> <span id="s293">My father was too old, and I was too young, so to speak; so they didn't take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">01:22:08</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: What did you do when you came back to Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I went back to school.</span> <span id="s297">I continued school where I had left off and...uh...there was no... I shouldn't say hard feelings.</span> <span id="s298">Everybody was...they were all helping us, all the time in Denmark.</span> <span id="s299">All the non-Jews were helping the Jews.</span> <span id="s300">There was no difference; and I am sure today they would just say, "You are Danish citizens.</span> <span id="s301">You are the same as we are."</span> <span id="s302">Nobody would ever ask, "Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s303">Are you black?</span> <span id="s304">Are you Chinese?"</span> <span id="s305">They don't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">And they helped everybody there.</span> <span id="s307">Q: What kind of help did you receive?</span> <span id="s308">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What kind of help did you receive as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Well, we had to get back on our feet.</span> <span id="s311">We had to...uh...get back to school and clean up in the house and buy new clothes and furniture or whatever we needed there.</span> <span id="s312">And my parents got back in their business which had been rented out to somebody while we were away, and the same business they got back again when we came back from...when we came back from Sweden.</span> <span id="s313">They continued that.</span> <span id="s314">(long sigh) I had my friends.</span> <span id="s315">They were all very helpful to me.</span> <span id="s316">And we spoke about Sweden.</span> <span id="s317">And they told us what had been going on in Denmark during the war.</span> <span id="s318">The synagogue...the big synagogue in Copenhagen which is one of the most beautiful one in the world had been used for the German refugees.</span> <span id="s319">They had taken everything out and put beds or cots in there and they had all the Germans who were invalids and sick people.</span> <span id="s320">They put them in there.</span> <span id="s321">That had to be cleaned up.</span> <span id="s322">And the synagogue was brought back into order in a very short time.</span> <span id="s323">And while this was going on, they used our synagogue in...in my parents' house.</span> <span id="s324">That was used as the big synagogue so to speak.</span> <span id="s325">So we have pictures from that also...from that synagogue.</span> <span id="s326">Should I mention about that pin?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">01:24:21</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">Please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: This pin?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Tell us about the pin you are wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, this is made by...it was made during the war by George Hensen.</span> <span id="s333">It was made in silver and this one was made in gold and enamel.</span> <span id="s334">It was made for the King Christian X who was one of the biggest heroes, I would say, during the war.</span> <span id="s335">Uh... whatever money it cost to make it...the excess money that was left over, went to the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s336">That's the way...almost every Dane had it or supported it this way.</span> <span id="s337">There are not many left of them today.</span> <span id="s338">It was made in 1940 for the King's 70th birthday.</span> <span id="s339">There are not many left because first of all, people needed money and they sold them for the value of the silver or gold during the war, but they are back in style today, and I have this from my father.</span> <span id="s340">That's why I wear...that's why I am wearing it now.</span> <span id="s341">The King Christian the Tenth, they always told stories about the King, about the Jewish Star, that first of all, he was riding around on a horse everyday unescorted by himself.</span> <span id="s342">Every morning he would take the same route.</span> <span id="s343">Anyone could have killed him as easy as nothing, but he was not afraid.</span> <span id="s344">And the King said if the Jews ever have to wear the...uh...the Jewish star, the six-pointed Jewish star where it said Jew on it, he would be the first one to wear it, but it never materialized during the war.</span> <span id="s345">It never happened.</span> <span id="s346">What else can I....</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s348">Is there anything else you want to add?</span> <span id="s349">01:26:14</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, I would say that the Danes are great people.</span> <span id="s351">And one of the few countries...one of the few nations that did more than their share to help the Jews all over the world and they...I am sure they would repeat the same thing and do it today again if it happened, if it should happen that they would be willing to help with money, deeds and everything.</span> <span id="s352">They are very unselfish and they are not asking for any thank you or anything in public by anyone.</span> <span id="s353">They never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s355">On that note, I thank you very much.</span> <span id="s356">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s357">My pleasure.</span> <span id="s358">That's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s360">Thank you.</span> <span id="s361">I am glad we got in about the pin.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I think it was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s364">I think we do actually.</span> <span id="s365">Okay.</span> <span id="s366">If you sit still, they are going to bring the camera in and they'll take a picture of the pin and then maybe we'll have Arnold take a picture of it as well.</span> <span id="s367">We have a gentlemen who is going to take your photograph.</span> <span id="s368">The film has stopped.</span> <span id="s369">We have a gentleman who will take your photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: How long did this take?</span> <span id="s371">45 minutes?</span> <span id="s372">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s373">I don't remember everything together at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Well, it all came together very neatly.</span> <span id="s375">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s376">As long as you are satisfied.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: I am very happy.</span> <span id="s378">Okay.</span> <span id="s379">We need you to be very still.</span> <span id="s380">They are going to bring a zoom lens in and...uh...take picture just of the pin.</span> <span id="s381">You don't move for a few seconds and they will...</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yal.</span> <span id="s384">Just don't move for a little bit, and they got a different lens on the camera and they are doing funny things to it so that... They are doing fancy things to the zoom lens so they can get a close up of that pin.</span> <span id="s385">It's a wonderful story, that pin...and...uh.</span> <span id="s386">Okay.</span> <span id="s387">If you would explain the story of the pin now.</span> <span id="s388">Don't move.</span> <span id="s389">Just explain it because we are right in on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">01:28:25</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: The pin was made in 1940.</span> <span id="s392">It was made by George Hensen, silversmith, for the King's--who was Christian the Tenth--70th birthday, and all the money, the excess money above the cost of the pin went to the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s393">The pin was made in gold and it was also made in silver and enamel.</span> <span id="s394">And it was sold almost by any silversmith or silver shop in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s395">I should say in Denmark, all over Denmark.</span> <span id="s396">It was sold for raising, in order to raise money for the resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s398">Could you point to the pin please?</span> <span id="s399">A: Point to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Just point to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: This one here?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s403">Okay.</span> <span id="s404">That's it.</span> <span id="s405">All right.</span> <span id="s406">A: That's it?</span> <span id="s407">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s409">I am delighted.</span> <span id="s410">It went very well.</span> <span id="s411">A: I am glad you have it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">01:29:37</span></p></body></html>
