Tape one, side one.</span> <span id="s13">What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My name at birth was Hugh Montfort Jenkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And what was the date and place of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born on the 29th of December 1914 in Leicester, England.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Would you talk some about your early childhood, your family, your growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, I am the youngest son of a family of eight.</span> <span id="s19">And my father was a Baptist minister and I grew up in, mostly in England.</span> <span id="s20">I – I was born in Leicester and then we went to live in Luton when my father moved to another church.</span> <span id="s21">Then we went to London, and I was sent to a boarding school in Somerset.</span> <span id="s22">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: How old were you when you were sent to boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Oh, quite young.</span> <span id="s25">About ten or something like that.</span> <span id="s26">I went to one of these schools which is erroneously known as a public school, named as public school, but the public school in those days was a private –</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Excuse me –</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: What’s that?</span> <span id="s29">Private boarding school.</span> <span id="s30">And so it was considered a very good thing, if you could afford it, to send your child to be at the boarding school, one of these boarding schools.</span> <span id="s31">And that's where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Now, you were the youngest of eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Were the older ones boys, girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, my eldest brother, my oldest two brothers were twins.</span> <span id="s36">And for reasons which I will never know, my father called them Lincoln and Garfield.</span> <span id="s37">Then I had two sisters, Myrtle and Iris.</span> <span id="s38">And then there were four boys, four more boys, Luke, David, Noel and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And how much older than you were the twins?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Oh, 14 years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: So there were eight children spread out over 14 years and mostly boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And what was your father like?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: He was a great man.</span> <span id="s47">He was a marvelous -- he was a Welshman and he was a wonderful speaker and he just had a, I guess, a very satisfactory career as a minister of different Baptist churches in England.</span> <span id="s48">And he was mildly active in politics, but not too much so.</span> <span id="s49">And he devoted himself a lot to his chapel and his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: My mother was also Welsh.</span> <span id="s52">Her name was Mary Elizabeth Peugh {ph}.</span> <span id="s53">And she was a very good singer.</span> <span id="s54">In fact, she and my father met, I think, when -- at a temperance meeting, you know, against drinking, where she was a soloist and he was a speaker.</span> <span id="s55">And that was in Wales many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s56">And, well, she had a major job, obviously, was bringing up a family.</span> <span id="s57">She had four children under three, twins and two more right off just after they were married.</span> <span id="s58">And then there was a gap and then four more, so she was busy.</span> <span id="s59">And she was also very active in the life of the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So what was the atmosphere in your home like?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Very much family oriented.</span> <span id="s62">I want to divert, I think one of the great tragedies of today's life is the fact that so many kids grow up without families.</span> <span id="s63">I can't imagine not having grown up in a family, as part of a family.</span> <span id="s64">And, obviously, when I was -- by the time was five or six my oldest brothers had already gone off to university.</span> <span id="s65">But we all came back for Christmas, and I can still remember the family gatherings at Christmas and other special occasions.</span> <span id="s66">My two sisters ran a private school and two of my brothers also became ministers and the other brother was a businessman and then there was me.</span> <span id="s67">And, well, we lived through some difficult times.</span> <span id="s68">A minister's salary, I don't know about nowadays, but in those days was not very adequate.</span> <span id="s69">And we lived through First, when I was born in 1914, right at the beginning of the First World War, and so my father had to bring up eight children.</span> <span id="s70">And so we were all very busy.</span> <span id="s71">My sisters realized that being two ladies amongst -- two girls amongst -- with six boys, that unless they put their foot down very early on they would finish up by being kind of housekeepers.</span> <span id="s72">So we all had duties, somebody had to do the washing out, somebody else had to clean all the shoes, somebody else had to make the beds.</span> <span id="s73">And we were a fairly close-knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And did you have chores also?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s76">You have to wash up.</span> <span id="s77">They say that the male members of my generation of our family were marvelous husbands because they all had this training from their sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So even though you were the youngest, you had your chores to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, Bible.</span> <span id="s80">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So then you went away to school when you were ten.</span> <span id="s82">Did you want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s84">It was a -- it was a very good experience, one I wouldn't have missed.</span> <span id="s85">It was a very tough experience because when you are at a boarding school away from your parents, a long way away from your parents, school discipline is quite tough, but as I say, I wouldn't have missed it.</span> <span id="s86">And then I -- when I came back to -- to when I finished school, I went into business and worked for a big international company, Kelly's Directory of Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers of the World.</span> <span id="s87">And then I worked for one of the big building societies, I think they are called mortgage and loan societies here.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What kind of work did you do for these companies?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Accountant, bookkeeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: And then the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Backing up a bit, how far did you go in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Oh, I went through -- I graduated from this public school.</span> <span id="s94">In those days, going to one of those schools was considered very adequate education.</span> <span id="s95">Some of the -- can I stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">{Pause.}</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: You were saying that you went about as far in school as was usual for that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: For the kind of career that I had in mind.</span> <span id="s100">Several of my older brothers went to university.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: But they went into the church or into teaching.</span> <span id="s103">But I went into business and then the war came and the –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Now, you had been working for how many years before the war came?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Let's see, 19 -- about eight years in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: About eight years in --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: My last job was in a town called Guildford in Surrey in England, and it was with the Abbey Road Building Society where I worked as a bookkeeper -- sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: You were about 25 years old then when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s110">And before the war started I had been involved somewhat with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s111">And, in fact, my wife is a Basque from the north of Spain.</span> <span id="s112">When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the British government sent over a mission to bring over children from Spain to England to look after them while the war was going on.</span> <span id="s113">The idea was that it would be a temporary arrangement.</span> <span id="s114">And with every 40 children they sent one teacher.</span> <span id="s115">And they asked various cities all over England if they would take one group of these children.</span> <span id="s116">And the city where I was working, Guildford, said they would take a group.</span> <span id="s117">And they asked for volunteers, and I volunteered to help prepare the hostel where the kids were going to live.</span> <span id="s118">And then later they asked me if I would go and live in the hostel, because there were 40 children and two girls, two teachers, a teacher and a teacher's aid.</span> <span id="s119">And there were a lot of chores to do about the house, and they wanted some manpower, so they asked me to go live in the house.</span> <span id="s120">I went to live in the house and went to the office every day as usual.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Now, was this your first association with the Quakers?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Had you done other kinds of volunteer -- other volunteer work similar to that previously?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: But that had some special appeal to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, I was there, you know.</span> <span id="s127">The children came to Guildford, and then one of my friends was a Quaker, who was very much involved in developing this project.</span> <span id="s128">And he said, you know, we need somebody to help, how about it?</span> <span id="s129">And I said, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So it was through a friend in large part?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: A friend, yes.</span> <span id="s132">So then also I had some kind of sympathy with the Quaker point of view.</span> <span id="s133">In fact, I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the land when I was called up, and had in the meantime registered with the Quakers as a volunteer for any work they wanted me to do.</span> <span id="s134">And in 1944 --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Could you -- could we back up?</span> <span id="s136">Could you say a little bit more about the working on the land?</span> <span id="s137">You were called up for the Army and you said that you were a conscientious objector?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I went to the tribunal and they were very fair, I guess.</span> <span id="s139">They listened to what I had to say and their first response was, well, we think you are quite sincere, but wrong, and so you had better go work in the Army medical corps.</span> <span id="s140">And I said, no, I wouldn't do that because that would mean I wouldn't be bearing witness that I was a conscientious objector because I would be wearing a cocky uniform like everybody else and I wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s141">And so then they went back and forth some more.</span> <span id="s142">And they came back and said, in that case you will work on the land.</span> <span id="s143">And I said, well, that's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So you did that in what capacity?</span> <span id="s145">Was it a government unit that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Well, no, they gave me so many days to find a job on the land.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: And I went to one of the local farmers and he looked at me in my office clothes and kind of grinned and he said, well, I disagree with you, but I need -- we need workers, and if you want to come and work for me, you can.</span> <span id="s149">But you are going to have to work as a -- just like a laborer.</span> <span id="s150">There is no fancy business.</span> <span id="s151">And so I did.</span> <span id="s152">I worked on the land and --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was that a difficult decision for you to make?</span> <span id="s154">To take that course?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yeah, because -- because lots of people that I very greatly admired disagreed with me.</span> <span id="s156">My own family --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Your family disagreed?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, they didn't support me.</span> <span id="s159">I mean, my brother-in-law was an officer in the Army and my brothers were both ministers at that time, and so that one of my brothers was working for the Navy.</span> <span id="s160">So I was the only one who became a conscientious objector and went to a tribunal and so forth.</span> <span id="s161">But the family were very supportive, again, they didn't agree with me, but that didn't affect their affection for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Was there -- did you have anybody or any people who did agree with you and could support you with their agreement?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, of course, a lot of the Quakers were passivists.</span> <span id="s164">And on the land, I was working on this big farm and there were quite a lot of other conscientious objectors all working on the land.</span> <span id="s165">And so that, well, you weren't entirely alone.</span> <span id="s166">On the other hand, there were a lot of people who very vehemently disagreed with us and didn't -- didn't bother to hide their feelings.</span> <span id="s167">Indeed, when I got married, in those days accommodation was very difficult and you were appointed places to live.</span> <span id="s168">That is to say, if you couldn't find a place -- and teachers had a priority.</span> <span id="s169">And my wife was teaching in the nursery school for little children, so she had a priority and she got a place, found a place.</span> <span id="s170">But when we went there, the landlady said -- looked at me and said I understand you are a conscientious objector, and I said yes.</span> <span id="s171">And she said, well, you're not going to live in my house.</span> <span id="s172">And so we had to go find somewhere else.</span> <span id="s173">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So you did get a lot of hostility?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s176">Not a lot, but enough to make you realize that you were in an awkward position.</span> <span id="s177">And it was a difficult –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Excuse me –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: It was an awkward situation, after all.</span> <span id="s180">It was what everybody felt was a very just war.</span> <span id="s181">I felt the cause was just, I just didn't believe that war would ever answer it.</span> <span id="s182">And so that you are living in -- England was in a pretty rough position from the beginning, the first few years.</span> <span id="s183">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s184">We had all sorts of, you know, military preparations for a possible invasion going on, so that kind of mindset.</span> <span id="s185">But I just went out and worked and did my job on the land.</span> <span id="s186">And in the meantime I had, as I said, registered with the Quakers that I was on their list of potential volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Now, this was a list of volunteers who would go overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yeah, anywhere.</span> <span id="s189">You see, I actually signed up during the Spanish Civil War, I would be a volunteer and I was going to Spain, but the war ended before -- before I got an assignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And so then in 1944 they called me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s193">But somewhere along here you got married; is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s195">It was very important, 1942 I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So that was after you were working on the land?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah, after working on the land.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: I have to stop for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">{Pause.}</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: You were talking about that you got married in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And that was while you were working on the land?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And your wife you met because she came with the children from the Spanish Civil War?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Was she a Quaker or –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: But she was an assistant -- she was with the Quaker refugee effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No, she was just with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: The mission for the children was arranged by the Basque government, and in conjunction with and in response to this invitation from England they would take these children.</span> <span id="s212">And so Juanita was just finishing her career, her education as a teacher, and so she volunteered to come with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: But it was -- she volunteered to the Basque government when they were looking for teachers to go with the children.</span> <span id="s215">And when the -- the end of the Spanish Civil War, when that home was closed down, and some of the children went back to Spain and some went to France where their parents were refugees, she became a teacher in an English nursery school, in a wartime nursery for children of mothers who were working in the factories.</span> <span id="s216">And this was in Guildford.</span> <span id="s217">And just near Guildford was the factory where they made the Churchill tanks.</span> <span id="s218">And there were a lot of women working there, so they had this nursery school right by the factory and she taught there.</span> <span id="s219">And so she was teaching there and I was working on the land.</span> <span id="s220">We -- at first we thought we would not get married till the war was over, but we had been engaged since 1939 or something, and by 1942 we decided why wait any longer, because there seemed to be no prospect the war was going to be over any quick moment.</span> <span id="s221">So we got married and I -- just after that in 1944, as I say, the Quakers got in touch with me and said they wanted me to come up to London to go to their training institute to work for -- to join the team that was to go and work in Europe.</span> <span id="s222">And so I did, I left the job in Guildford.</span> <span id="s223">And this was an acceptable alternative under the laws which govern me being a conscientious objector, this was something I could do.</span> <span id="s224">And so I was trained by the Quakers, very interesting experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: It was wonderful, because they did everything -- their objective was not to make you into a highly-skilled technician or anything like that, but to make you into a person who could cope with things without the usual facilities.</span> <span id="s227">So, I mean, they had the -- in the team there were social workers and people like that.</span> <span id="s228">But the training was more to teach you how to cope with new situations.</span> <span id="s229">So they had a lot of, kind of, make-believe.</span> <span id="s230">We lived in a big house in Hampstead and they would -- one day they would decide that this house was a refugee center and that thousands of refugees were coming out of Germany and they had to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s231">So half the team would be the people looking after the house and the other half of the team would be the refugees.</span> <span id="s232">And they were instructed to behave like people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in Germany, so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken.</span> <span id="s233">And our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it was really very useful.</span> <span id="s234">Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there is no -- the house is being destroyed and so we have got to make do.</span> <span id="s235">And so we were shoved out in the garden.</span> <span id="s236">And in the garden there were just a few vegetables that have to be in the garden, and we were told to find a way of keeping ourselves alive for the day.</span> <span id="s237">We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of boxes because there were no stoves or anything.</span> <span id="s238">And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things that you had never done before, and not running away from the job.</span> <span id="s239">And that certainly was very useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you train with the team that you eventually worked with?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So you started together from the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, we started together as kind of a miscellaneous group, but then they gradually selected the people that were going to be on the team.</span> <span id="s244">And then we went on training as a team and we were supposed to go to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Before we do that, as part of the training was religion a big part or any part of the training?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Quaker -- Quaker practices were part of the training.</span> <span id="s247">We went -- in our team, I think there were only two Quakers, people who were -- people who were members of a Friends Meeting.</span> <span id="s248">The rest of us were Baptists, Congregationalists, Jews and -- but we did have -- we started all our like team meetings, discussion groups, with a fairly long period of silence, which is, you know, the way the Quakers generally prepare themselves for -- in their religious service.</span> <span id="s249">So we were very much aware that we represented the Quakers and that we would be expected to behave like -- carry out the principles of the Friends.</span> <span id="s250">And this did -- this was an important factor because subsequently when we were working in Germany under the -- while the war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would think would be the appropriate thing to do weren't quite the same.</span> <span id="s251">And so we had to face up to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Our typical job was housing, you know.</span> <span id="s254">In one town where we were, this is before Belsen, in one town where we were, the Army billeted us on a house that belonged to a German family.</span> <span id="s255">And the technique was the family just had to leave and find their own place and the house was taken over by the occupation authorities.</span> <span id="s256">We didn't -- we realized that we had to be housed somewhere.</span> <span id="s257">We realized that the family that we were -- to whom the house belonged were obviously very unhappy about the whole situation.</span> <span id="s258">So we came to a compromise.</span> <span id="s259">So we -- two or three members of the family lived in the very top floor of the house, which we didn't have to use, and we took over the rest of the house so that we didn't feel that we were kind of being part of an action to take the property away from the family.</span> <span id="s260">Plus, obviously, the army would have given it back to the family eventually.</span> <span id="s261">But in the meantime they were very anxious to be able to keep some out of the place.</span> <span id="s262">That was only a little example.</span> <span id="s263">But we, actually, got on very well with the military authorities.</span> <span id="s264">They were very, very understanding of what we were doing, appreciative of what we were doing, because we did lots of jobs.</span> <span id="s265">Belson was only one of many jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Could we go back to when you were called up --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: -- in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s270">Well, after the training we were assigned to go to Holland.</span> <span id="s271">And the idea was that probably in the fighting the dikes would be broken and the place would be flooded and they would need urgent, emergency relief.</span> <span id="s272">Well, as it happened, we never did go to Holland.</span> <span id="s273">We went to Belgium and we were working as kind of just relief work, as in Antwerp, doing all sorts of odd jobs, but kind of replacing the normal civic services which would be disrupted by the war, et cetera.</span> <span id="s274">And while we were there, we got a message saying that we had to pack up our goods and be prepared to be on the road at six o'clock the next morning.</span> <span id="s275">Well, there were 12 of us in this team and we had been living in Antwerp doing odd jobs and we had our own headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And what age range?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I should think we were all in our mid 20s or early 30s.</span> <span id="s280">There was one woman who was I think in her mid 40s or perhaps even later than that.</span> <span id="s281">She was the oldest of the lot.</span> <span id="s282">But, you know, we kind of spread around in our lodgings and so on.</span> <span id="s283">And we, of course, had our own cooking things, field kitchen and all that kind of thing, and we were situated in a school that was our center of activity.</span> <span id="s284">And, you know, an empty school.</span> <span id="s285">And so it was some job to put all this stuff, get all our personal belongings and the team belongings and the team equipment and get it all packed up in our -- we had five vehicles attached to us, one ambulance -- two ambulances, one big truck and two small personnel trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">And we were on the road at six o'clock the next morning.</span> <span id="s287">And our destination after three days driving, I think it was two days driving, was Belson.</span> <span id="s288">And we didn't know we were going -- we knew we were going to a camp somewhere in Germany.</span> <span id="s289">And we arrived at Belson about four or five days after the camp being uncovered.</span> <span id="s290">So it was all just like it was, 10,000 unburied dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: It is almost time to change the tape, so maybe this would be a good place to stop so we won't have to interrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">{Pause.}</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Hugh Jenkins, tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s294">You were saying that you arrived in Belson on April --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Sunday, April the 22nd.</span> <span id="s296">The camp, I think, was -- had been found just about a week before.</span> <span id="s297">And that's the day -- I arrived in Belson on Saturday, on Saturday evening.</span> <span id="s298">And then on Sunday, when we got ourselves a place to park ourselves, I went into the camp on Sunday, the 21st -- the 22nd to Camp No. 211, which was the place where they had kept all the children.</span> <span id="s299">One of the magnificent things about the camp was the fact that -- well, let me go back a bit.</span> <span id="s300">The camp was in terrible state because it had, by lack of concern and so forth, it had been allowed to get into a horrible condition.</span> <span id="s301">It was originally a camp for about 3,000 people and there were about 50,000 people in there.</span> <span id="s302">There were, I think, 600 people in a hut that was designed for 50 and they were layered.</span> <span id="s303">But despite that, and then as the last days before the camp was overtaken, everything broke down, food, no food supply, no water supply.</span> <span id="s304">And -- but despite that, the people had put the children -- the inmates, not the -- the authorities, had put the children all into one barrack where they could look after them specially.</span> <span id="s305">And whereas in those last days it was a kind of every man for himself as far as food was concerned, they made sure that the children were looked after as best as they could in those terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s306">And my first job was to drive an ambulance down into the camp and start getting the children out.</span> <span id="s307">The arrangement was that about three miles up the road from the camp, the concentration camp, there was a big German Army establishment which, of course, was empty and -- but it had big concrete buildings, you know, barracks and so on.</span> <span id="s308">So that was made into a reception center.</span> <span id="s309">And the -- between the concentration camp and the new camp, there was what was known as a kind of human laundry.</span> <span id="s310">And we had -- the ambulances were divided into two groups.</span> <span id="s311">And some ambulances were in the camp, going from the camp to this mid station, which was just on the side of the road, it was a stable.</span> <span id="s312">But there they had set up a whole -- an arrangement for disinfecting and cleaning people up and so on.</span> <span id="s313">And then the other side of this place there were clean ambulances which were going from the -- from this place to the new -- to the new establishment.</span> <span id="s314">So that there was a kind of an insulation between the diseases and the lice and everything that the people, that the camp inmates had, that were all washed off and disinfected and stripped of their clothing and wrapped in a clean blanket.</span> <span id="s315">And then the other end of the -- the other side of the building, they would be loaded into another ambulance which took them to the -- to this new establishment.</span> <span id="s316">So you had one series of ambulances going between the camp of what they called the human laundry and another series of ambulances going from the laundry to the new camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So there were dirty ambulances taking them and then clean ambulances after they got through their laundry?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: They were kept separate, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And you were driving one of the dirty ambulances?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s321">And so that was my first job, going in and helping get these children out of the -- out of the -- then because I was the truck driver in charge of the big truck.</span> <span id="s322">Well, one of the things, when we first arrived there, the authorities would not allow the girls, the female members of the team to enter the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s323">There were seven girls and five men.</span> <span id="s324">But the men were all assigned to work in the camp and the girls were all assigned to work in the new, you know, reception center in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: What do you think the reasoning was for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, I think to begin with, things were so -- when we first got there things were so unsettled in the camp.</span> <span id="s327">There were -- the SS guards were still there.</span> <span id="s328">They were being forced to help bury the dead, and the SS women were still there.</span> <span id="s329">And it was pretty rough kind of situation and I think that the people in authority felt that they didn't want to risk the girls going into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: For their physical safety or just what they would have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, I think probably it was such a -- it was -- it was such an outrageous situation.</span> <span id="s332">Nobody, you know, people had heard of Auschwitz and the death camp and so on.</span> <span id="s333">But Belson was different.</span> <span id="s334">Belson -- nobody really knew about Belson until it was discovered because it had never been identified particularly as an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s335">So you had this peculiarly -- {beeping sound} -- turn that off -- had this peculiarly unsettled and unpleasant situation.</span> <span id="s336">And I guess the Army authorities in charge, they had the Army medical corps men working there, and in any case there were so many jobs to be done because what we were really doing was creating a new -- creating a hospital as we went along --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s339">Empty buildings and so on were being furnished and all the supportive services that you have in a hospital were trying to be set up as quickly as possible to cope with the situation.</span> <span id="s340">We -- a lot of the first things I think they did, we I think were the very first people, non Army people in the camp.</span> <span id="s341">We went up -- there were six teams that were called in, I think five -- four Red Cross teams and one girls -- girl guides team, and the one Quaker team were called in in that very first appeal for immediate help.</span> <span id="s342">But then soon after that they got a whole group of volunteer young medical students from England who came out.</span> <span id="s343">But it was a -- it was the kind of thing to begin with when everybody was doing whatever immediately needed to be done.</span> <span id="s344">There was not a highly organized and orderly procedure because you had the terrible pressure of the fact that while we were evacuating the camp I think another 15,000 died.</span> <span id="s345">25,000 were -- were saved, were taken to the new camp.</span> <span id="s346">But it was very, very haphazard.</span> <span id="s347">So, for example, after that first run in the ambulance, I was sent off in my truck and told to find whatever I could that would be useful for the camp.</span> <span id="s348">Bed linen, towels.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: This is outside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s351">So I went to the -- where this German establishment, military establishment was, there was a set of big houses which belonged to the high command.</span> <span id="s352">And the first place I went was there.</span> <span id="s353">I went through all the places -- all the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Were the houses empty?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s356">The Germans had gone a long time -- well, not a long time ago, but had gone.</span> <span id="s357">And so I used to go around picking up, getting all the bed linen, all the towels, all the kitchen utensils, anything that I could pick up in my truck and take it back to the new camp to help furnish it.</span> <span id="s358">And then after that we discovered -- I think it was our team that discovered that there were around the camp a number of farms which had vegetables, leeks, carrots and what have you, you know, just lying unharvested.</span> <span id="s359">And so my job from then on was to go out every day and go around and scour around the countryside and find out where there was a field of leeks or vegetable garden and so on and get local -- I worked with a -- a German local fellow who helped me identify a place where -- a local inhabitant who knew the country.</span> <span id="s360">So he knew where the stuff were, and also he knew the villages.</span> <span id="s361">And he used to recruit people from the village.</span> <span id="s362">And I would take them in my truck, which had a big Red Cross flag on the front of it, and take them to this field and stay with them all the while they were working, because they wouldn't work unless they had the protection of the truck and the Red Cross flag.</span> <span id="s363">And when we got -- when we got the load of vegetables, I would take these people back to the village and then would take the food back to the camp kitchens, and that's what I did most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What was the attitude of this young German man toward you and your efforts?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Oh, he was very helpful.</span> <span id="s366">He wasn't -- he was -- I'm not sure how much of a resister he was, but he certainly wasn't -- he was very anti Nazi.</span> <span id="s367">And he was known in the district for being a very -- I forget what his job was.</span> <span id="s368">I think he was working in some factory or something.</span> <span id="s369">Anyhow, he was quite well respected and known in the district, and so he helped me organize this.</span> <span id="s370">But some of the people, of course, were not very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I remember one lady who we went to her farm.</span> <span id="s373">She was married to some high official, who wasn't there, of course.</span> <span id="s374">And she was grumbling about the fact that, you know, these workers, they are terrible, the moment they got the chance they ran away.</span> <span id="s375">These are forced laborers, mind you.</span> <span id="s376">I said, well, what did you expect them to do?</span> <span id="s377">And so she was going on about this.</span> <span id="s378">And I said to her, you see that?</span> <span id="s379">You know that place over there, that concentration camp?</span> <span id="s380">And she said, well, she kind of denied knowing anything about it.</span> <span id="s381">So I told her what it was like there, and the Red Cross was there, because she was so unsympathetic.</span> <span id="s382">Lots of the people were.</span> <span id="s383">We had a lot of, I mean, you know, we weren't sunk in a sea of Nazis or anything like that.</span> <span id="s384">Most of the people who were the local inhabitants were very understand -- you know, weren't bitter or antagonistic.</span> <span id="s385">Although they did, the Army, I remember, did one day while we were there bring the mayors and the senior citizens of the -- from around Belson and make them walk through the camp, walk through all these dead bodies, et cetera.</span> <span id="s386">So I think that -- so they should know exactly what they had been putting up with.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Were you there when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Then, well, we had a little hospital in the camp, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s391">It was really kind of a first aid stand.</span> <span id="s392">Our main -- obviously, the whole priority was getting the people out.</span> <span id="s393">We had a kind of a scoreboard we used to keep of the number of people we evacuated each day.</span> <span id="s394">Like a competition, you know.</span> <span id="s395">Yesterday it was 310 people, today we managed to do 370 people.</span> <span id="s396">Always trying to beat the previous day's record.</span> <span id="s397">And the -- I forgot my train of thought now.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: You were talking about what you were doing inside the camp and that you had the first aid station.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you work at the first aid station?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh, yes, excuse me.</span> <span id="s402">And in the meantime, because there were, you know, several thousand people in the camp, we had this set up, this little first aid station to give whatever assistance one could give in a temporary way.</span> <span id="s403">And -- but the station was actually operated by inmates, by doctors who had been -- who were part of the people inside the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s404">So it was -- we had to have hours.</span> <span id="s405">We just couldn't keep the place open 24 hours a day because these people themselves were suffering.</span> <span id="s406">So we had to kind of have it open from 9:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening or something.</span> <span id="s407">I used to go down there occasionally to take some supplies or something.</span> <span id="s408">And, obviously, I went one day when we had to close the camp, close the doors.</span> <span id="s409">And it was a terrible job because there were people outside that probably spent the last two days gradually making their way to this thing because they couldn't walk, they, you know, they were too weak to just walk there.</span> <span id="s410">So you felt that, at least I felt, you know, when you looked at these people and you thought, my gosh, some of them will probably be dead before the camp -- before the place is open in the morning.</span> <span id="s411">And when I was closing the camp a young girl came up to me and said you must give me something for my mother.</span> <span id="s412">She is very ill.</span> <span id="s413">And I said, well, the aid center is closed.</span> <span id="s414">And she said but you must get me something.</span> <span id="s415">So I went inside and got some aspirins and gave them to her and said, well, maybe these will help your mother.</span> <span id="s416">It was just a gesture.</span> <span id="s417">I didn't know, the mother wasn't there.</span> <span id="s418">But, on the other hand, the girl was so desperate to have somebody do something.</span> <span id="s419">And about three or four -- three weeks later when we were in the -- when the camp was emptied eventually and it was burned down and all the people that were in the camp were now in this new -- in this new establishment, this young lady came up to me and said, oh, you are the man who saved my mother's life.</span> <span id="s420">And I -- because I didn't recognize her because before I had seen her in a concentration camp, filth, you know, now she was -- after the camp was dressed nicely and so on.</span> <span id="s421">But apparently I was the -- she was the girl I gave the aspirins to.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: That's quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: And then we had a -- we had a very, very impressive concert in the new camp.</span> <span id="s424">The day the last barrack -- the barracks were burned down.</span> <span id="s425">And the concert was given by the ex-inmates and it really was terrific.</span> <span id="s426">I mean, inside the camp there were people who had been in symphony orchestras and opera singers and all that, lots of people, mostly of Jewish extraction.</span> <span id="s427">And so they gave the concert.</span> <span id="s428">And it was really most moving.</span> <span id="s429">Everybody singing their hearts out.</span> <span id="s430">It was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And this was the night before the camp was burned down?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes, it was in the new camp.</span> <span id="s433">The old camp was burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s435">Was the old camp all burned at once or in parts?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, it was burned hut by hut.</span> <span id="s437">But it was obviously -- it was kind of accelerated as time went on.</span> <span id="s438">To begin with, obviously, it was very dangerous to start burning once you evacuated a hut.</span> <span id="s439">You couldn't burn it right away because there were huts all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So did you do other jobs inside the camp, inside the old camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes, because I was a kind of general errand boy.</span> <span id="s442">I used to take the -- anything that needed a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And who would ask you to do something?</span> <span id="s444">Would it be one of the Friends group or would it be one of the Army or anybody would ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Well, obviously, my first channel of authority was our own team and our team leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You had a team leader for the 12 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: For us 12, yes.</span> <span id="s448">So she would give me maybe some general instructions, saying why don't you go report to so-and- so and see what they need to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: That would be an Army person?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah, an Army person.</span> <span id="s451">Or as time went on, of course, more people came in, doctors and things like that.</span> <span id="s452">But most of the time, most of the time my primary job was going around and each day I did a vegetable run, which didn't take the whole day, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: But that was your primary job, to go out of the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: To get supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: -- into the surrounding area?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: That's because you had a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: That you were the one with the truck, that made you the logical person to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: My job on the team was transport officer.</span> <span id="s461">So I was responsible for keeping all the vehicles, the five vehicles operating, but -- and I myself drove the big truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So that got you away from the horror for part of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s464">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And then for the rest of the day, what would you do after you did your vegetable run?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh, let me see if I can remind myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did you have to work on your trucks and keep them running or were they working pretty well?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, the trucks, yeah, the trucks went well.</span> <span id="s469">But it was -- most of the work inside the camp was taking workers around.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Taking who around?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Oh, workers, I see.</span> <span id="s473">So you take them from one area of the camp to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s475">The camp was under the control, obviously, of the British Army, but they had a lot of Hungarian soldiers who were prisoners of war as it were, who were used to work in the camp doing various jobs.</span> <span id="s476">Another of my jobs was to report to the person in charge to take these men down to hut number so-and-so where we have a clean-up job to do or --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Were they strong enough to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh, yeah, these were Hung -- these were not camp inmates.</span> <span id="s479">These were part of the Hungarian Army.</span> <span id="s480">When the camp was taken over the by the British, it was taken over in a truce between the Eighth Army, the British Eighth Army and the German Army, whichever it was, the idea being to create a sanitation zone and there would be no fighting in that zone.</span> <span id="s481">So that you wouldn't have -- that was the great problem that when -- to begin with everybody was afraid of, but this camp was a, a hive of illness, tuberculosis, typhus and everything you can think of.</span> <span id="s482">And people were afraid, I think, the Germans were afraid that if the fighting went through that zone, then people in the camp would all get out and start trying to find their way back home and then you would have kind of a wave of diseased people off on their own.</span> <span id="s483">And so it was arranged that the camp should be handed over intact by the Germans to the British and with the condition that all the people, the Germans who had been working in the camp as guards and so on, would have to be -- would be retained there, whereas the German Army retreated from that area and the British entered without fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: And part of the deal was that among the German Army were these Hungarian troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And they were considered neutrals at that point and, I mean, they weren't the prime enemy.</span> <span id="s488">And they were -- it was agreed that -- presumably that they should stay and guard the perimeter of the camp to make sure that nobody got out.</span> <span id="s489">But under the control, obviously, of the British.</span> <span id="s490">So that at the same time they would -- they were manpower and there were lots of jobs to be done.</span> <span id="s491">The water system broke down, so you had to -- we had to find a -- and the drainage system.</span> <span id="s492">Everything was in kind of a state of disrepair and needed temporary --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So after the beginning when you were driving the ambulance, you did not have a lot of direct contact with the former --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: -- concentration camp survivors?</span> <span id="s496">You were more involved in collecting vegetables and maintenance --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s498">I was in and out of the camp all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Were you concerned that you would get sick if there was so much disease around?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No, you really didn't have time to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: What kind of a day did you work?</span> <span id="s502">How long a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Oh, as long as was necessary.</span> <span id="s504">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: I should say, how long did you get to sleep at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, I guess we probably got to bed about ten o'clock, eleven o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s507">But -- and, of course, it was an increasing deceleration as the -- each day there were less people in the camp, and each day therefore there were less crises in the camp.</span> <span id="s508">So it gradually got easier and easier.</span> <span id="s509">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: We slept in the -- in barracks in the new camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Um-hmm.</span> <span id="s513">And is that where you had your meals also?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, I think we had our meals at field kitchens.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Um-hmm.</span> <span id="s516">They were army field kitchens?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I seem to remember -- I have some pictures over here of a whole group of us standing around, just around a field kitchen eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And did you have any time when you weren't working that you had a chance to feel or talk to your team members?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Oh, yes, we had -- we met -- we were all housed in the same area and we used to have team meetings quite regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Well, they were -- they were mostly reporting sessions because all of us were doing different things and quite often we didn't see each other during the day.</span> <span id="s522">The girls were mostly working as like nurses or one of the girls was a cook -- not a cook -- a caterer and was working in the kitchens.</span> <span id="s523">And the -- we had one Jewish girl who was a very, very important member of the team.</span> <span id="s524">She got into the camp, frequented, before there was any kind of relaxation of the rules she got into the camp because she was, obviously, terribly motivated to see exactly what was happening to her people in the camp.</span> <span id="s525">And she used to wear a big copper Star of David or bronze Star of David on her uniform.</span> <span id="s526">And when she went into the camp wearing this, it was very, very impressive because for the camp inmates the Star of David was the kind of thing you had sewn on your sleeves or on your back as something to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s527">And to see this girl wearing the Star of David as something to be proud of was -- meant a lot to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So what was the morale like in your team?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I think it was pretty good because we were too busy to allow the environment to affect us.</span> <span id="s530">We always had something to do.</span> <span id="s531">And everything we had to do, even if I can't remember what it is now, what it was now, was urgent.</span> <span id="s532">And we had completely separate responsibilities, like I was on my own in this truck.</span> <span id="s533">And I think that the real impact came when we left the camp and in our next assignment when we became, I think, where we suffered a kind of delayed shock.</span> <span id="s534">We were very highly disciplined and neat and tidy team.</span> <span id="s535">But I think in our next assignment after Belson we went through a period when we were kind of untidy and people didn't turn out meals at the right time and undisciplined.</span> <span id="s536">But then we settled down again and –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did people talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Only in terms of things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: No, but I mean in the next assignment when --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, no, it wasn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: -- when the shock hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: People didn't say, oh, that was really horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, no, I mean, that went without saying.</span> <span id="s545">And then when you see perhaps -- fortunately for us, after our -- we left the day the camp was burned down, I think, the next day or something like that.</span> <span id="s546">We were sent off to another job.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Well, it was another rush job.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: I mean to leave.</span> <span id="s550">Was it a relief to get away from there or -- also hard to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, I think there was nothing more for us to do.</span> <span id="s552">We had done our job so it was just a question of getting on with the next job.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Um-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And it became part of the, well, we just focused our attention on our new work.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Um-hmm.</span> <span id="s556">What was your new work?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Well, to begin with we had a very interesting job.</span> <span id="s558">Very temporary.</span> <span id="s559">The railways in Germany had all been very badly bombed.</span> <span id="s560">And after the war they were reconstructing the, well, they were reconstructing the railways.</span> <span id="s561">So thousands of forced laborers who wanted to get back to their homes in Holland and France and so on, and so they had trains coming into Germany to the point where the German railways were bombed and trucks coming out of Germany to this point where the -- where the railway started.</span> <span id="s562">And the people were transferred from trucks to the train.</span> <span id="s563">And our job was to -- to assist in this transfer.</span> <span id="s564">People had all sorts of problems and there was a question of food and things like that.</span> <span id="s565">To get the people off the trucks and into the trains and the trains went back to say Belgium, Holland, France and so on.</span> <span id="s566">And we did that for -- not for very long, about a week or so, because very quickly the railway was repaired to another station farther on, and so -- and then we were sent to Brunswick, and we -- that was our biggest and most time-consuming job.</span> <span id="s567">We eventually became in charge of a huge Polish camp of 3,500 Poles, and the Quaker team, the 12 of us administered it.</span> <span id="s568">And that was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, it was -- it was very interesting because, see, it was a very difficult situation in some ways because the Poles consider themselves -- considered themselves the first fighters in the war.</span> <span id="s571">They were the first country attacked by Germany.</span> <span id="s572">And they, of course, the country was very badly beaten up.</span> <span id="s573">And the Germans were very bad to the Poles because they considered them kind of second-class citizens and brought them in for forced labor and so -- but when the war was over the Poles kind of felt, well, you know, they ought to be all considered heros because they were the ones who first started to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s574">And so they used to get -- and they wanted to go home, but they couldn't go home because there was a problem inside Poland as to who was going to govern the country.</span> <span id="s575">So they lived in this camp and we -- we looked after them, you know.</span> <span id="s576">We were the kind of town council -- like city government.</span> <span id="s577">One was looking after schools, one was looking after clothing.</span> <span id="s578">I was in charge of what was known as the camp commandant, and it was quite fun.</span> <span id="s579">Well, fun isn't the word.</span> <span id="s580">But it was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: We will have to turn over the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Mr. Jenkins, what are some of the reflections that you have on the Belson camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Well, the most obvious one, obviously, was its relationship to my being a conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s586">I remember standing in the camp very early on and looking at the terrible -- and I guess the people who upset me most in the camp were the living because they -- the walking dead as it were.</span> <span id="s587">They were so -- I mean, there were people who had gone beyond the state of recovery.</span> <span id="s588">The dead were dead and they were in peace.</span> <span id="s589">But the -- and the ones who were -- the survivors were getting out of the camp.</span> <span id="s590">But, in the meantime, there were these thousands of people dying.</span> <span id="s591">And they were the people, I guess, who upset me most because you see them walking around, walking from nowhere to nowhere, and then they would just kind of fall down and there you were.</span> <span id="s592">I remember thinking to myself, well, you know, while I was working on the land and the sun was shining, but under this same sky only relatively a few miles away, because England isn't all that far from Germany, these people were living under the same sky and comparing the, you know, the fact that they were so hopeless and without any -- any hope of being saved or anything because, well, before the war ended, I mean, all the while the concentration camps were going, they were going on for eternity, I mean, the people -- the Germans gave up the camps only when the war was at their very doorstep.</span> <span id="s593">And so day after day these people were in this camp and having to live under these terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s594">And it made me think about being a conscientious objector and refusing to participate in the struggle.</span> <span id="s595">And I thought about it a great deal.</span> <span id="s596">The only thing I could -- the only conclusion I kept on coming to was that I still believed that war was not the answer.</span> <span id="s597">That there must be some other answer.</span> <span id="s598">And that eventually we had to get -- we had to get rid of war as a means of settling things.</span> <span id="s599">And the only way we will do that is if -- hopefully the next generation there will be conscientious people that feel the same kind of mind and eventually come to a time where people will say we are not going to have an army, we are not going to have arms, there have to be other ways of settling our differences.</span> <span id="s600">And that's -- may seem kind of high- minded theory, but on the other hand, that was as far as I got.</span> <span id="s601">I couldn't believe, I couldn't persuade myself that I -- that it was wrong, that I should have been fighting instead, been in the army instead.</span> <span id="s602">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And do you have some of those thoughts now?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, except a sense of desolation when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the Second World War didn't solve problems.</span> <span id="s605">There are just as many problems in Europe, people fighting each other.</span> <span id="s606">So, obviously, there must be some other way.</span> <span id="s607">But whatever the way was, it was too late to save all the people who were victims of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s608">But that may be rationalizing it, but, no, I still think, I still believe that war is not -- never will be an answer to our problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Could we go back to a summary of what you did from the time you were commandant of the Polish camp until you returned home?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s611">Well, I was in charge of that camp.</span> <span id="s612">Well, the team was in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s613">But my particular job was kind of the chief administrator, I guess, whatever you call it, which was kind of fun because it put me in some very awkward situations.</span> <span id="s614">I remember the 3,500 Poles, we had a Polish police force of young Poles who kind of ran the place, who looked after the security of the place.</span> <span id="s615">And, of course, we had a lot of young people in there.</span> <span id="s616">And one day there had been some fighting and the police brought these -- had to break it up and they brought these young men in to me as camp administrator to be punished.</span> <span id="s617">And so I gave them a nice Quakerly lecture about we all ought to live together like we were members of a family and things like that and sent them off.</span> <span id="s618">And about five minutes later the head of the police force, a very nice young man, came in and said that the police force had resigned en masse.</span> <span id="s619">So I said, well, why?</span> <span id="s620">He said, look, we have this problem in the camp.</span> <span id="s621">We have a kind of a riot.</span> <span id="s622">We go in and break it up.</span> <span id="s623">We get beaten up in the process.</span> <span id="s624">And eventually we manage to settle everything and we bring the ringleaders in to see you, and you tap them on the head and say, well, go home and be good boys.</span> <span id="s625">That's not going to work.</span> <span id="s626">So I consulted with myself and my friends and decided we would have to have some kind of system.</span> <span id="s627">And so I used to dock them their cigarette rations and things like that.</span> <span id="s628">Which, of course, in those days was cigarettes were a form of currency practically.</span> <span id="s629">Everybody loved to smoke.</span> <span id="s630">That was quite a punishment to be told you were losing one month's ration of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s631">But I left the camp and went back to England.</span> <span id="s632">Oh, in the meantime, my wife had joined me because she was -- she also became a member of the Quaker elite and was trained in the same place where I was trained.</span> <span id="s633">And then she was sent out to join me in the camp.</span> <span id="s634">And she was by that time a very highly- qualified and very experienced nursery school teacher and so she came and looked after the -- because we had a lot of children of all ages, little children in the camp, she set up the nursery school in the camp and she set it up so well that the UNRA, United Nations Rehabilitation Agency, were running a lot of the camps, came to our camp and saw the nursery school and borrowed her and sent her to other camps to set up nursery schools.</span> <span id="s635">Then we both left and were assigned to this job of working with the young Spaniards, well, all the Spanish refugees in the south of France, because at the end of the Spanish Civil War there was a tremendous wave of refugees who fled over the frontier into France.</span> <span id="s636">And while a lot of them had gone back, a lot were still there.</span> <span id="s637">And the ones that were still there were very much in need of various social services.</span> <span id="s638">We had schools, retraining schools, and a lot of activities like that.</span> <span id="s639">And so I was in charge of that for six months.</span> <span id="s640">And then the Quakers brought me back to London and I was the overseas secretary for the European world.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Was that a full-time activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Oh, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s643">That was kind of -- I was responsible for all the work in Germany, Austria, Poland, wherever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And that was a big job?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Well, yeah, except in the Quaker thing you had the responsibility, but you also -- you work very much as a group.</span> <span id="s646">We had a committee that was in charge, so -- so I was the overseas secretary.</span> <span id="s647">I also had a -- I used to work very closely with the people in Friends House in London.</span> <span id="s648">But I used to have to travel to Poland to meet -- visit the teams.</span> <span id="s649">And then the Friends Relief Service was a temporary organization that -- it was kind of peculiar.</span> <span id="s650">The Friends in England did not have a permanent service group.</span> <span id="s651">What they did was to create a group or a service in time of need.</span> <span id="s652">So, for example, as I remember, there was one Quaker service in Ireland during the potato famine.</span> <span id="s653">There was one Quaker service in the Franco-Prussian War.</span> <span id="s654">There was one Quaker service in the First World War.</span> <span id="s655">And there was one Quaker service in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s656">And the Quaker service in the Second World War was -- it was agreed, long before the war ended it was agreed that failing any other unforeseen events, that would come to an end in May 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And it was called the British --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Friends Relief Service.</span> <span id="s659">And it was to come to an end in May 1948.</span> <span id="s660">So that was the period that I was the overseas secretary.</span> <span id="s661">So I -- one of my jobs was going around to all the teams that we had in Germany and Austria and working out with them the way they would hand over their work to local sources.</span> <span id="s662">It was a difficult job because -- and everybody falls in love -- when you are in relief work you fall in love with your work and you fall in love with the people you are working with.</span> <span id="s663">I mean -- I don't mean fall in love with individuals, but you fall in love with the whole situation and your companions and the local -- and it is very difficult to leave.</span> <span id="s664">You feel, you know, the job is not finished, why should we have to leave?</span> <span id="s665">But, on the other hand, the Quakers, I believe, felt very strongly that this was a job that they had to do in time of need, but they weren't about to start a permanent social service agency.</span> <span id="s666">Or they do have continuing programs right now that the British and the American Quakers, you know, countries where there are -- where there is need.</span> <span id="s667">And so I did that until May 1948.</span> <span id="s668">And then in May 1948 the American Friends Service Committee said, well, you've been working for British Friends Relief Service, and now that job is finished, why don't you come work with us for a little while.</span> <span id="s669">So I came over from England technically for two years and worked in PhiladelphiA: And then I was going to leave and they said we have a very funny project in Washington.</span> <span id="s670">We have a house which was given to us to provide accommodation and that, kind of a center for international students.</span> <span id="s671">So why don't you go and run that.</span> <span id="s672">So we came to Washington in 1951 to run the International Student House, which we did for six years.</span> <span id="s673">And we never left.</span> <span id="s674">I became -- I went from that to being the director of the Foreign Student Service Council and from that to being --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Director of Foreign Student Service Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Foreign Student Service Council in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Was that a Quaker --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No.</span> <span id="s679">The International Student House was owned by the Quakers, but it is now run, I think, by a local committee.</span> <span id="s680">The Quakers may still own the building.</span> <span id="s681">But they pulled out the administration.</span> <span id="s682">When I went to the International Student House, I went as part of the American Friends Service Committee, so kind of employed from Philadelphia to come.</span> <span id="s683">But when I left, it was sometime after I left, it became -- they divested their direct interest, involvement, and had the local committee take it over, which it is still running, of course.</span> <span id="s684">It is a very beautiful house on R Street.</span> <span id="s685">And then at the time I was leaving the International Student House there was a feeling there was a great deal of need for some service to foreign students who visited Washington on the basis of practically every student who comes to the United States will at some time during their stay here want to come to the nation's capitol.</span> <span id="s686">So they started the Foreign Student Service Council and I was the director of that, perhaps ten years, I guess.</span> <span id="s687">And then I became the executive vice-president of the National Association for College Student Affairs.</span> <span id="s688">And then I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And were you -- did you at any time become a Quaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s693">Not a very active one, but I am a member of the Meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And what time -- at what point was that that you became a member of the Meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, now, I was very much involved, I think I became a member of the Meeting in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: But you -- so you were working for them for a few years --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: -- before you became a member of the Meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah, as I said, in our team, when I joined the Friends Relief Service, in our team I think only -- I think the team leader and one other person were Quakers.</span> <span id="s700">But a lot of them were -- several of them were, I think, kind of attenders but not members.</span> <span id="s701">Went to Friends Meetings but were not members.</span> <span id="s702">But there were others who were quite different.</span> <span id="s703">Like myself, I was a Baptist, son of a Baptist minister.</span> <span id="s704">So there we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s706">Is there -- is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Well, you have told us quite a bit and you have a very interesting and important story.</span> <span id="s709">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Oh, it was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hugh Jenkins.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
