she was – she came from very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s46">They had governess from Ireland, from eng – from Germany and from France.</span> <span id="s47">So there were five children, so they all spoke right away English, German, French and Polish.</span> <span id="s48">The boys were learning Russian, but the – the girls, three girls were not learning Russian.</span> <span id="s49">They were not allowed own – to speak Russian at home, because Poland was occupied.</span> <span id="s50">So, it was like resentment.</span> <span id="s51">But later on, of course, she learned Russian.</span> <span id="s52">And she understood Italian and she understood Spanish.</span> <span id="s53">From knowing those languages, when we came to America they often ask her when she was in a hospital, to be translator for the people that they couldn’t communicate with, you know, so th-they could [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: So she – so she learned this –</span></p>

[indecipherable] and this was Ru-Rudakow(ph).</span> <span id="s59">It was very large estate, because it was 12,000 hectares.</span> <span id="s60">It was a very large estate over there.</span> <span id="s61">A lot of people were coming there.</span> <span id="s62">There was a big house, of course.</span> <span id="s63">It used to be this was Horvath’s(ph) property, actually.</span> <span id="s64">My grandfather married a Horvath girl.</span> <span id="s65">They were of Hungarian origin.</span> <span id="s66">And not fu – far from there, they had a beautiful palace actually.</span> <span id="s67">My mother said everything was carved over there.</span> <span id="s68">It was right on the river [indecipherable] and in – and there’s no sign of those buildings left, everything was completely destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So it was – she was – a-and came from a landed gentry family.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Oh yeah, she was very gentry.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Very gentry.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: You see, I found out here in America that when there were balls in – they had apartment houses they owned in Kiev, and they ha – owned a place i-in Minsk.</span> <span id="s73">And this one woman here, she married later the richest man in Poland, Boldanovitch(ph), and they were talking about their childhood.</span> <span id="s74">And she said [indecipherable] whenever you came with your sister to the dance, all the men were bending in half to dance with you, because everybody knew your money.</span> <span id="s75">My mother told me that each one of them had hundred thousand rubles put in Kiev in the bank as dowry, and it was in – it was in gold, you know.</span> <span id="s76">It was a lot of money too, but it wasn’t in Switzerland [indecipherable] the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: But the [indecipherable] grandfather put it in there, and the revolution came and that was the end of the gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Oh dear, oh – so, in other words, that way of life that she was born into all changed with World War I and the end of the revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Wi-With the revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: The Russian – the Bolshevik revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: You see, my mother always thought they had several cars over there, and one car was Minerva called.</span> <span id="s83">And when I came to America I work with very rich people in the brokerage, all of them are millionaires, and one I told him that my mother always talk about Minerva, oh it was car made in Switzerland, it was 25,000 in America before the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s85">Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: So you know, from that I got what they had because I only saw pictures of that place when I was small.</span> <span id="s87">But y-you know, they never bragged, they never bragged about anything and anything.</span> <span id="s88">They were t – we were told from childhood to be very helpful to people, to be nice to people, to be polite to everybody.</span> <span id="s89">If anybody needs help, you have to help them and everything.</span> <span id="s90">And then – then in life I learned something else too, that you have to keep your ground, and not let your people, you know step over you.</span> <span id="s91">Because some people, they [indecipherable] softness.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: And – and they try to take advantage of you, but – a-and that was life.</span> <span id="s94">But they ni – I was never told you know, something like this.</span> <span id="s95">There used to be a crazy man that used to come to our house and he was eating in the kitchen and everything, and my father sat and talked always with him.</span> <span id="s96">Eventually, during the war he attacked a local [indecipherable] killed him.</span> <span id="s97">He – he was crazy, but my father used to spend time even with him when he came, wanted to talk.</span> <span id="s98">Well, talk to the person, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s100">So, did your mother, when the revolution happened, this is, you know, several years before your birth, was she already married, was she already living there –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: They got married – I don’t know on what day they got married exactly, but they got married, and they lived still in Rudakow(ph).</span> <span id="s102">And in Rudakow(ph) there was German army stationed over there.</span> <span id="s103">This was through first World War.</span> <span id="s104">And what happened was that eventually the German army went communistic, and the other side was communistic, and they all dropped their rifles and they said, why are we fighting?</span> <span id="s105">And the Germans dress my mother and my father as German soldiers and put them on the train to evacuate that, because they started killing all the [indecipherable] over there already, and especially the bourgeois, you know.</span> <span id="s106">So the Germans evacuated them, and my father said that the Russians were shooting at that German in train, and the machinists run away.</span> <span id="s107">And my grandfather was building Trans-Siberian railroad in Russia, and my father traveled the loco – locomotive, so my father went and he was running the train to Poland because they had nobody to run the train, they didn’t know how to operate it.</span> <span id="s108">And my father said he was lucky that when he came to the Polish border – already Poland had a border, they stopped them.</span> <span id="s109">And they didn’t like people coming from the east, but my father ask, who is the commanding officer there?</span> <span id="s110">And he – my father knew him when he said, tell him that it’s me.</span> <span id="s111">So they let them go into Poland, because they could have turned them in, and there was big trouble, you know, people moving there and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So your mother’s estate and where she married your father was in what’s today Belarus?</span> <span id="s113">It was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: It – it – it was Belarus - Minsk, you know, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: But you didn’t tell my mother, you see, we could have come to America, clearly, because she was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s117">But Americans would have given her a Russian visa right away to come to America, because there was no quota number from Russia, but my mother wouldn’t let be put that she was born in Russia, because may be a Russian.</span> <span id="s118">So she refused to do it, and she said that she was born in Rudakow(ph), Poland.</span> <span id="s119">I can show her passport to you –</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: – even, I have her passport.</span> <span id="s122">Because we resented – you see, we considered Russia inhuman land, because it’s – the minute you cross – I am not talking about the Russian people, but the land is inhuman.</span> <span id="s123">When you go in there and you see, when you cross Ural mountains, you go for days and days, every now and then you see some sediment, they – where did they put coal, or something.</span> <span id="s124">And there’s nothing but rivers, forests, everything’s empty.</span> <span id="s125">People were all walking with mosquito nets on their face, million of mosquitos.</span> <span id="s126">Where they deported us there was a forest, we were asking Russians, how far does the forest go?</span> <span id="s127">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s128">They just didn’t know what it was, and they didn’t know much about the world.</span> <span id="s129">In that village a lot of people never saw a plane.</span> <span id="s130">Some of them used to go to – to deliver, you know, by truck something, so they knew – they saw trains, but the children didn’t see trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So this is – you’re talking about deep into the heart of Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Si-Siberia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And we’ll get to that part of your story when – when you end up there with your family.</span> <span id="s134">I want to establish now, get – get a sense a little bit of your early life, and of the family that you were born into, both on the mother’s side and on your father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, because wh-when my father and my grandfather was dead already, because he was building Trans-Siberian railroad, and he had ulcers operation in Moscow, and he went for recovery to Yalta, and he’s buried in Yalta actually, he died over there.</span> <span id="s136">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s138">That would have been what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I could not tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: 1890s though, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: It’s something – 18 something you know.</span> <span id="s142">My father was young still, it was before he met my mother, so he was young man.</span> <span id="s143">And m-m – well, with my mo – family, my grandfather was – everything [indecipherable] he was a banker, he was a shipbuilder, he was organizator(ph) of Polish zi-ziemianin.</span> <span id="s144">Ziemianin means people who possess land, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: – because –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Landowners.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Landowner.</span> <span id="s149">Because you have to realize that in Poland, people look down on being a trader, on being something at your business like this.</span> <span id="s150">They like to have ownership and they were [indecipherable] you know, this was the part of people, they took part in the wars.</span> <span id="s151">The peasants didn’t have to fight, but the Polish peasants were not slaves, but they didn’t have to fight.</span> <span id="s152">And that’s why so many Jews, cause [indecipherable] he had the girlfriend Jewish, and they brought a lot of Jewish people, and they open up Poland to the Jews, because they needed people in business and in everything, and a lot of Jewish people came to Poland.</span> <span id="s153">Actually, a mason showed me in America papers the Jews used to, 1600, how to come to Poland.</span> <span id="s154">It was shown that there was nothing, no towns or nothing.</span> <span id="s155">And a lot of Jews were immigrating to Poland, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You’re talking several hundred years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: And they were coming in, you know, K-Kazimierz Wielki.</span> <span id="s160">He had the stairka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Casti – so you’re talking about Casimir the Great?</span> <span id="s162">Casimir(ph) the – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yeah, yeah, this is long ago, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: And you see, I studied very little Polish history, I know, but the Jewish people were welcome in Poland because you know, some people say, well, you persecuted us.</span> <span id="s166">I said, why did you come?</span> <span id="s167">Nobody ask you.</span> <span id="s168">You were invited to come, but surely, to open the trade.</span> <span id="s169">And – and that was it.</span> <span id="s170">Very often we were told by Jewish people even in Wilno, you own the street, we own the houses, you know, so that was the – all the businesses, if you went to stores or something, like we used to go and buy clothes, and everything was in – most in Jewish stores, you know.</span> <span id="s171">Later on they started making cooperatives in Poland, so – like we had to sell a cow or a horse or a grain; everything will being always sold to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s172">But generally before the war, they started making trading organization, and you know, the – and that was different.</span> <span id="s173">But the – but the thing was, you know, who knows?</span> <span id="s174">By now everybody’s so mixed up over there, nobody knows who’s who.</span> <span id="s175">Like you knew history.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: My – my – I think it was my grandfather’s father, he was punished by the tsar for rebelling against the tsar.</span> <span id="s178">So he was sent for 12 years of katorga(ph).</span> <span id="s179">Katorga(ph), I don’t know what – you know what katorga(ph) is?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yeah, go – it’s – it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: He was chained to a wheelbarrow for 12 years in a mine.</span> <span id="s182">And when they release him, he was sent – he wasn’t allowed to return to Poland, so he went to Kaupas(ph).</span> <span id="s183">And my father told me that he married a – this miserable harrick(ph), wh-who was a Tartar or something like this, you know, from there.</span> <span id="s184">[indecipherable] supposedly, who’s princess or something, because he had money you know, when he was released already.</span> <span id="s185">And then he came back to Poland, and they – I had very dark complexion.</span> <span id="s186">My father said that this is he – that he is dark complexion, I, my sister, from that – from her.</span> <span id="s187">And they called me in Poland, Togo(ph), my grandfather called me Togo(ph) because he knew a Japanese admiral, and it was Tojo(ph).</span> <span id="s188">And he said because I had slanted eyes.</span> <span id="s189">And my experience in life was, when I was in American army, they send me to Tokyo first.</span> <span id="s190">And when I was in Tokyo I went to Japanese stores, and the Japanese right away puts chairs for me in the store, brings the tea or something to drink.</span> <span id="s191">I said, why do you do it?</span> <span id="s192">Because you’re no gook, you’re not a foreigner.</span> <span id="s193">I said, why?</span> <span id="s194">Your eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And the Japanese saw it right away, they have – you slanted eyes, and they treated me very differently from Americans.</span> <span id="s197">And when I told them that I’m Polish, well, they loved Polish people because Polish people hated the Russians.</span> <span id="s198">And this was after the Korean war, and you know, when Russians marched and took kore – up north, Japan, well they never released it, and they said that was the reason the Japanese surrendered so fast in second World War.</span> <span id="s199">It wasn’t only atomic weapons, but the Russians invaded already, Japan.</span> <span id="s200">And they were petrified that Russia will take all of Japan.</span> <span id="s201">And Japanese from first World War, they hate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s203">All of –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: I [indecipherable] too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: No, no, but it’s – it’s – it’s so many threads, and they’re very interesting, all of them.</span> <span id="s206">But let’s go back to your father, and I want to just establish one thing; when you speak of the grandfather you knew, it’s your mother’s father, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Mother’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Your – your – your grandfather whom you did not know was your father’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I only had a picture of him, but I don’t know him, I didn’t know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: He died when my father was young, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So tell me – tell me about the Kiersnowski family, about your father’s side, and were they as – as wealthy as your mother’s side, or how –</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Well, Kiersnowski, he – he – I’ll tell the story of Kiersnowski family was, there were a lot of [indecipherable] they were exceptionally wealthy, you know, for that family.</span> <span id="s214">And they used to send, if somebody was in trouble, to Oxford Un-Un-Universities and everything.</span> <span id="s215">They were known, but they were all educated, and they were engineers, lawyers, everything, and they had lands, too, property land.</span> <span id="s216">In Druskieniki, my father’s family had villas, quite a number of villas over there.</span> <span id="s217">And they sold it, and for – for marks, and the marks collapse.</span> <span id="s218">He didn’t sell it, he was mad at his – how brothers and sisters, that they sold it without his knowledge, my father said.</span> <span id="s219">He never wanted to go and see, even.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Now, you know, same with us, we were in Wilno and we went, and I saw our barn only.</span> <span id="s222">And I told the fellow turn around, I don’t want to see that.</span> <span id="s223">It brings too much memory.</span> <span id="s224">I could go and see my house.</span> <span id="s225">My Francesca was there, we were in – and the fellow says, well, it’s a big barn.</span> <span id="s226">I says yeah, it’s a very big barn.</span> <span id="s227">And I always remember that barn, there was a big storm before the war, and the wind tore the whole roof off, and we had to pay a lot of money to rebuild the roof on it, and the Polish government put a new tax on us for the new roof, instead of giving us a tax reduction.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Yeah, insult to injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: In-Insult to injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: So – so my father couldn’t go to schools.</span> <span id="s232">I told you, my father had wilchi(ph) bilet.</span> <span id="s233">He was in school and he cut out the border of Russia – of Poland from Russia during the geography lesson.</span> <span id="s234">And that was the end of his education, they wouldn’t let him go, obviously.</span> <span id="s235">So he didn’t go.</span> <span id="s236">But if you talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Excuse me, excuse me.</span> <span id="s238">They didn’t let him g – means – was he thrown out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: They call it wilchi(ph) bilet, a wolf’s ticket they used to give, and that was the end of your education in Russia, so you had to go somewhere overseas to study, you know?</span> <span id="s242">A-And – or – or something, but – but not in Russia.</span> <span id="s243">But from – but my father traveled a lot about Russia, his father was building a siber – in this Trans-Siberian railroad, my fo – his g – my grandfather took him to f – to hunt for polar bear in Russia.</span> <span id="s244">And – and they went up north, and his father said to him [indecipherable] you shoot, and you fall down.</span> <span id="s245">And – and the polar bear was coming at them.</span> <span id="s246">And then he shot, but my father says, of course I missed, I hit him in the paw.</span> <span id="s247">And his father shot him in between the eyes, and my father said that was my end of hunting, because the bear sat down and with the other paw grabbed snow and applied it to his forehead.</span> <span id="s248">And my father said, I would never hunt again in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: He says it’s awful because it was just like a human being, you know?</span> <span

Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: But it was – it was – it was a beautiful life.</span> <span id="s300">You see, I was born with a heart.</span> <span id="s301">When I went to school in Poland, they put us in front of the machine when we were small, and they looked at our lungs.</span> <span id="s302">A-And they saw my heart that I was in the wrong position, so I was not allowed to ride on the bicycle, I was not allowed to take exercises.</span> <span id="s303">They said they – by 21 my heart will come to normal position, that it happens in children.</span> <span id="s304">We had a very

grow.</span> <span id="s316">My grandfather was petrified.</span> <span id="s317">My father used to say, don’t worry, I was the same way.</span> <span id="s318">I was so small and I was dark, and in school there was war in Abyssinia.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: And [indecipherable] was there, and they carried me on the chairs in school and they made me necklace that I am, you know, the king and everything.</span> <span id="s323">And they pinch me while they carry me on the chair in schools.</span> <span id="s324">And my mother finally took me and put me in a private school.</span> <span id="s325">But over there they told me that you never get tuberculosis, because you have very, extremely large lungs, you know, in that school.</span> <span id="s326">And – but I – I – I couldn’t do a lot of things that other children were doing.</span> <span id="s327">They didn’t let me, you know, I stunk exercises.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So you first – you were first in school in a public school and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: – and then changed to a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, my – I had appendicitis operation, and I was put on the stage in school during the prayer and they told nobody to push me or anything.</span> <span id="s332">And my mother was coming to school, and there was a bunch of guys pulling me on the stairs by the legs.</span> <span id="s333">That did it, my mother took me out the school.</span> <span id="s334">And you see, I was from a farm, as my uncle, and I wasn’t living in Wilno.</span> <span id="s335">So the people from Wilno, the kids, they didn’t like me, tha – because I was from the country, you see?</span> <span id="s336">People are very clannish, immediately clannish.</span> <span id="s337">So they didn’t like me.</span> <span id="s338">And I remember one time, one guy was giving me so much trouble.</span> <span id="s339">And you know those furnaces to heat the house with –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: – hermetic things they were big iron things that you tied, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: – and he started to – accusing me, and I grabbed him by the neck and I started hitting his head into that iron.</span> <span id="s344">Thank God there was some guy and they stopped me, I could have killed the guy.</span> <span id="s345">I was pretty strong you know about things –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: About how old were you when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: And this was in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: In public school, and that’s my mother transferred me to [indecipherable] to public – to private school, and there were only 13 of us, and all 13 of us survived the war.</span> <span id="s350">Now only one lives in Warsaw and I am in America.</span> <span id="s351">We talk every week with him, I talk with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: The other – the other 11 died already.</span> <span id="s354">One boy died last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: From that private school.</span> <span id="s356">But I want to stay with the public school.</span> <span id="s357">In that public school, were there any Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: But Jewish kids were mostly in Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s361">Wilno had Jewish schools, Jewish universities, Jewish everything.</span> <span id="s362">It was a big cultural center of Judaism.</span> <span id="s363">You know, in Poland there were what, three and a half million Jews, supposedly.</span> <span id="s364">That was 10 percent of Polish population.</span> <span id="s365">So it was a great – what – what remain of Judaism.</span> <span id="s366">A lot of it was saved be – by being in Poland.</span> <span id="s367">The only thing, the Jews didn’t understand what pogrom was.</span> <span id="s368">Pogrom was when the Cossacks from Ukraine were beating, but they were beating everybody.</span> <span id="s369">They were beating Jews, they were beating us.</span> <span id="s370">There were – supposedly the tsar of Russia used Jews as tax collectors, so Russians wouldn’t like the Jews for being tax collectors.</span> <span id="s371">You know, there’s such a messy, this world always, the more you look at it, the worse it gets.</span> <span id="s372">That’s my opinion from my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Well, when you were a kid going to school, did all those – did those things play out in the classroom, or play out outside of the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh, we played outside.</span> <span id="s375">We were – no, but we had gymnastics in Poland.</span> <span id="s376">Oh, there were lines to climb, you know, there were a thing, you jump over the horses –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Oh no, but what I me – what I meant by play out, I meant, did these issues of clannishes – clannishness and you know, kids being either from wealthy parents or from poor parents, or Jewish kids, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, it wasn’t – it wasn’t that, it was – no, it wasn’t that.</span> <span id="s379">It was what region you come from.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: You see, when they played, you know, in Wilno you saw there are courtyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: So if a child from this courtyard were to come to play on this courtyard, they told him, go and play in your own courtyard, leave our courtyard alone.</span> <span id="s384">People are so clannish that –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: So it’s territorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Territorial almost, you know, and that exists everywhere that you go, and is between the nations.</span> <span id="s387">Now that I’m old, I realize it.</span> <span id="s388">I remember that when all – later on from India, I was sent to Africa, to Uganda, to a camp – Polish refugee camp.</span> <span id="s389">And the boys who are there, from India that came, and they said to me, you know, we can’t even go to a dance.</span> <span id="s390">This – Ugandan [indecipherable] won’t accept us, they call us.</span> <span id="s391">They call us Indians, and they don’t want us.</span> <span id="s392">They were there maybe four or five years in that camp, and we just came over.</span> <span id="s393">And I remember I came over and I met a very [indecipherable] girl, you know, and I went over there, and some of the guys from India went over there, and I learned to fight pretty well in India.</span> <span id="s394">And I asked them, who is the leader of those boys?</span> <span id="s395">And they told me, well I dance, and I hit him so hard dancing polka, that he fell down.</span> <span id="s396">I stood over him, I said, do you want more, or no?</span> <span id="s397">And he said no.</span> <span id="s398">And our boys got up and they could already dance and play.</span> <span id="s399">But this is the clannishness of people.</span> <span id="s400">They were considering themselves African and we were Indians already to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And you’re already Pole – and your always – you were all Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: And we were all Poles or from Russia.</span> <span id="s403">But you see, this is clannishness, this is unbelievable in people.</span> <span id="s404">I notice it everywhere.</span> <span id="s405">Everywhere I notice it, clannish.</span> <span id="s406">Look at when I was drafted into American army.</span> <span id="s407">There were five Jewish guys, and there were three Ukrainians, and we all stuck together, we were – we were the best of friends, all the time, because we were from Poland and from Ukraine, so we’re from that region, and in American army.</span> <span id="s408">We felt that we have to protect ourselves from those dumb Americans, who choose to step on our feet, you know.</span> <span id="s409">It’s right away, and it was, you know – I told you about this Jewish fellow, Jakubovic(ph) [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s410">He was in the American army, and he was in the barrack.</span> <span id="s411">He spent the whole war in a concentration camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s412">And he used to wake up at night and scream.</span> <span id="s413">I went to Americans, explaining, please do something for this guy.</span> <span id="s414">He spent – well, Americans didn’t understand what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s415">Finally, I got to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s416">In the army there are various religions, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: – people, and I got to a rabbi, went to a rabbi, and I told him, I said, this is criminal what they’re doing to these guys.</span> <span id="s419">He wakes up and he thinks, in the middle of the night that he’s in German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s420">And they moved him right away, the rabbi put him in a separate room, and no more training, military training, he was taken care of the hot water for us.</span> <span id="s421">And bu-but – we – we – but people just don’t understand, people don’t understand other people in this world.</span> <span id="s422">Very often a lot of misunderstandings are befall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: And there are – and then there are a lot of very bad people.</span> <span id="s425">I wish they would get rid of them early, when they start only.</span> <span id="s426">But how do you know that they are going to be bad [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: That’s true, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s428">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: This is [indecipherable] Jesus Christ parables, you read about it, that there is a good tree and a bad tree.</span> <span id="s430">And a good tree will give good fruits, and a bad tree will give you nothing.</span> <span id="s431">And the same thing with people.</span> <span id="s432">You get some people that will be mean, and hurt a lot of people and everything, and there are people who will help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Let’s go back to Wilno.</span> <span id="s434">I want you to paint a picture for me, of what did this city in northeast Poland look like?</span> <span id="s435">What kind of a city, how would you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Wilno.</span> <span id="s438">How – how would you describe it?</span> <span id="s439">The city</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, Wilno was a Lithuanian city.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: And when Jagiełło married the Polish queen –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And who was Jagiełło, and who was this Polish queen?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Jagiełło was the Lithuanian king.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: And he married Polish Queen Jadwiga, and – because they had a lot of trouble with [indecipherable] well, they were really knights, you know, they – who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Crusaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You mean the Crusaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah, Crusaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So we’re talking history now, we’re talking 500 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Oh yeah, we’re talking – so Wilno was a Lithuanian city, and even in the whole story how – who was it, [indecipherable] or somebody had the dream with the wolf and everything that they say, and build the castle and everything, and eventually got [indecipherable] somehow, in a big way.</span> <span id="s453">And you had [indecipherable] Prince Rageev(ph) [indecipherable] and there were only [indecipherable] might as well be in a Lithuanian family, because wich – most of the families that were Lithuanian were ending in wich, Kaskaiwich(ph), you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s455">So when you would walk down the main street in Wilno as a child, what do you remember seeing?</span> <span id="s456">What kind of people were on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Oh, they were – part of the town was Polish, and part of the town was Jewish, there were so many Jews over there, Hassidim and everything.</span> <span id="s458">And there – and there were no more people, there were very few Lith-Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s459">There were almost no Lithuanians in Wilno.</span> <span id="s460">And mo-mo-mostly Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Did you have – did you have interactions with – with any of the Jewish people there when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: In the courtyard where I lived there was a kosher butcher even, and he had sons.</span> <span id="s465">And he used to take a bladder, and he used to hang bladder and drying it out, you know.</span> <span id="s466">I don’t know [indecipherable] and he was doing something.</span> <span id="s467">So we used to steal those, with his children, and we used to tie it to the cat’s tail, and cat’s tail was running like crazy because it was rattle and making so much noise.</span> <span id="s468">And you know, we were going together, we were all playing together.</span> <span id="s469">W-We had no friction that I remember of.</span> <span id="s470">I told you that I was dark and I was very often taken as Jewish.</span> <span id="s471">When my mother used to go to stores, they used to say on za nasza, he’s from ours, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: The Jewish people thought that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s474">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What language did they speak, usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: What language did they speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh God, Yi-Yiddis-Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did you understand any?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No, no, no, no way, I didn’t understand it, but they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s481">Do you know of a Jewish writer, what’s his name, Singer?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Y-Yeah, Is-Isaac Bashevis Singer, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: And those books, you know, I read his books in Polish translated from Yiddish.</span>

way.</span> <span id="s489">But it is a nice language, but I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s490">When I came to Palestine, you could speak Polish everywhere, you know.</span> <span id="s491">The restaurants, there were villages on, there were kibbutz already, they had, you know, those collective farms over there.</span> <span id="s492">Girls used to bring us flowers in when we were marching.</span> <span id="s493">One girl I always remember, she had red, red shorts.</span> <span id="s494">Oh boy, was she pretty.</span> <span id="s495">I always tell Francesca about,

W-Well-to-do family which already lost a lot, but who will stay comfortab – but because of the taxes – remember, after the 1920 war, when we came back – I wasn’t born yet, but when my mother went west

one time there was big rain, and we had meadows, and the workers were cutting grass on the meadows, but there was water.</span> <span id="s512">And I had the teacher at home teaching me, I think four grades, first grades I was at home and we had a teacher, private teacher.</span> <span id="s513">And my father said, it’s beautiful day, we go over there.</span> <span id="s514">And we went over there.</span> <span id="s515">And there were so many snails in the grass, and I started picking them.</span> <span id="s516">And I put my hands to here and here and here in the water.</span> <span

know, that was three kilometers to go to Wilno.</span> <span id="s522">And there was Leznakow(ph), he had the store with the groceries, with everything.</span> <span id="s523">And he said, there is a famous doctor, Jewish doctor from Warsaw here on – for vacation.</span> <span id="s524">So he says, go over to him.</span> <span id="s525">And I went to him.</span> <span id="s526">He said, who the hell punctured those things?</span> <span id="s527">They didn’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s528">You cannot – he’s getting gangrene here, and under the arms already, gangrene is starting.</span> <span id="s529">So he gave some medications and there’s heat over here, bottles, we got water and everything lined, and I have to keep my hands and legs up.</span> <span id="s530">And this lasted for several weeks, you know.</span> <span id="s531">So I constantly had something.</span> <span id="s532">Either I had appendicitis, or I had that.</span> <span id="s533">I had this boil in my ear, I had boil in my throat too, you know.</span> <span id="s534">And I – tha-that was a lot of trouble, so I wouldn’t go almost anywhere.</span> <span id="s535">My sister used to go, but they kept me more or less at home.</span> <span id="s536">But I was very happy because I had a hundred rabbits and I had my pigeons and I had everything.</span> <span id="s537">And I was happy, and I had the Linden tree, and I had a house in the tree, and there was – Francesca knows, it wasn’t far I – well, maybe half a kilometer was a railroad station from us, on the top, and there was a boy there, he was my friend, and we were making a dir – from wood, we were making trains and everything.</span> <span id="s538">I wasn’t allowed to play with him, because he spoke very bad Polish.</span> <span id="s539">It was so funny, one time I came to him, and there was a fellow that was a miner in America.</span> <span id="s540">Polish were in coal mines, and he bought himself a farm and he married a young girl.</span> <span id="s541">And he bought his son very nice skis.</span> <span id="s542">And this fellow [indecipherable] he went and he stole his skis.</span> <span id="s543">And this man came to get the skis back.</span> <span id="s544">And his father was beating th – him with the belt like hell.</span> <span id="s545">And we go out from the house, and I said, why did your father beat you so much, because you stole?</span> <span id="s546">No, no, no, that I don’t know how to steal, that’s why he was beating me.</span> <span id="s547">So you see, my mother didn’t want me to play –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: – but we used to go to the river.</span> <span id="s550">There was a river maybe a kilometer away from there, there were a lot of snakes in there, you had to wear boots.</span> <span id="s551">And we used to go fishing there, and I used to catch little fish, and eat them.</span> <span id="s552">Oh, I loved fried little fish, you know.</span> <span id="s553">I – I all re – all remember that, it was so nice.</span> <span id="s554">Then one time there was, in another place there was a fellow, they had the drugstore in Wilno, and he went to school with me.</span> <span id="s555">And suddenly, a big carriage was going by.</span> <span id="s556">And he says, look at that carriage, and I stopped the carriage, it was my grandfather carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: And we got into it, and the car – they drove us around, you know, he drove us all around.</span> <span id="s559">And when I came back to school, this fellow say, did I have a ride in a – la carrozza(ph), you know, and everything.</span> <span id="s560">Then, I tell you, they came, poor children, Polish boys.</span> <span id="s561">There was a scout camp for small Polish boys, and ah – there must have been about a hundred of them, and they came to us to get straw, so they could make shiniki(ph), you know, to sleep, and what they would – can give them some food.</span> <span id="s562">So we gave them some potatoes, some meat and everything to help.</span> <span id="s563">And they invited me there for a week, and I was there.</span> <span id="s564">And not far from there was a camp from [indecipherable] I ge – I get the name.</span> <span id="s565">Oh God almighty, that was in Prussia, on the border of Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: And they were from there, the Polish.</span> <span id="s568">But they were big scouts, and they made the big campfire.</span> <span id="s569">They were staying with one parish, where the priest had the thing.</span> <span id="s570">And we went over there.</span> <span id="s571">Then they tried to kidnap us, but we defended.</span> <span id="s572">But then all those boys said, we want to make campfire big too.</span> <span id="s573">And I said, well let’s go.</span> <span id="s574">We were across from my grandfather’s f-forest.</span> <span id="s575">So I said, come on kids, let’s go and – with me, and they all went, which was private property.</span> <span id="s576">So we all went, and they were picking everything, mushrooms and fruits and wood, you know, and they was bringing and going back, bringing more and finally the forester caught us.</span> <span id="s577">And the forester said, what are you doing here, you know.</span> <span id="s578">And I said, I’m grandfather – this is my grandfather’s land, so I give them permission.</span> <span id="s579">So I came to my grandfather couple of days later and he says, boy, you pull your authority.</span> <span id="s580">He says, you don’t get away, he told them – they says, like my thing, and I give them the permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: So, you know, it was great thing with the other kids, you know, that they could do things that others could do and I – I opened up for them the forest, so – you know, in the forest there are a lot of things –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: – growing, so they were so happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So it sounds –</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Those were – those were mostly poor children –</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: – from the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: It sounds like a pretty idyllic childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Oh, a beautiful –</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I had beautiful childhood.</span> <span id="s593">You see, the day my childhood ended, when the Russians walked in, and I realized that my parents cannot protect me.</span> <span id="s594">To this day, it stays in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Tell me about that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: To this day, that realization that now I have no protection.</span> <span id="s597">There’s somebody over us that can do us harm.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Tell me about that day.</span> <span id="s599">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s601">I just realized the Russians came to our property.</span> <span id="s602">They asked for a gun, my father had a ra – gun, and when he walked out the Russians got scared because he was carrying the [indecipherable] to give it to them.</span> <span id="s603">Because they would have taken us to Siberia if they found weapons, you know.</span> <span id="s604">And it – and I realized that now is the end of that life.</span> <span id="s605">I – I realized it completely.</span> <span id="s606">And then later, when we were being taken, which I told you before –</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: But we were gonna talk about it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yeah, you will talk about, but you see, this was the realization.</span> <span id="s609">Remember, I was 13 years old, I was small and everything, and all of a sudden I realized that everything’s gone.</span> <span id="s610">It’s not mine – where – where they take the land away from you.</span> <span id="s611">They left us, I think, with 30 acres or something like that, a small field.</span> <span id="s612">I – my father lost his hand, I had to do the plowing, I had to do the sowing, I had to ca – they say, cut, you know.</span> <span id="s613">I had to feed the cows, my sister was milking the cows.</span> <span id="s614">We couldn’t have workers, our workers actually were bandits it turned out.</span> <span id="s615">There were seven sons and we had the family, and when their – it broke out, they went – there were a lot of bandits there, because there was no Polish police, there was no Russian police, and people started robbing.</span> <span id="s616">And they – I played with the boy, there was one, he was the youngest son over there in that family.</span> <span id="s617">And his brother was cleaning his gun and he shot through a wall and ripped out the stomach of that boy, and that boy died.</span> <span id="s618">And they took him to Felcher(ph), you know, the closest help, but there was nothing that can be done.</span> <span id="s619">I remember that boy died.</span> <span id="s620">So you know, all of a sudden, things started going all wrong, you know, all wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Did you da – when the Russians came, had there been, even before that, was there any talk of – of what was going on in Europe and what was Poland going to do, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Oh, my family, of course, they were talking all the time, a-all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: What kind of talks was it?</span> <span id="s624">What kind of things were being discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Well, we heard Hitler screaming on the radio all the time, you know, when he was shouting and everything.</span> <span id="s626">And wi – Russia we knew, we were afraid of Russia because we had a lot of local communists.</span> <span id="s627">There were Polish communists, there were Jewish communists, you know, over there, a lot of – I mean, Jews were communists, a lot of Poles were communists.</span> <span id="s628">Some people had all of sudden money, and you knew that it must be coming from Russia, because Russia was exporting car loads, I understand of gold for propaganda and everything.</span> <span id="s629">So you heard about it.</span> <span id="s630">There was police trouble, my mother went to governor [indecipherable] he later became president of – of Poland in London, and he told me well, it’s probably a [indecipherable] I don’t know how – what you say [indecipherable] that at police station we consider very suspicious that they are pro-Bolshevik, you know, but we cannot do anything to them, we have to prove it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Well, what was – what was the incident that brought your mother to go to him?</span> <span id="s632">What happened that she wanted to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Well, you had trouble, I don’t know, like was some friction you know, in – in everything.</span> <span id="s634">You n – you know th-this is what, if you could like, Jewish people used to come from Warsaw for vacation, like that doctor.</span> <span id="s635">They were stupid, they, instead of talking to a peasant, with a little store or something, a prusha(ph) panna(ph), you know, and something like this, they s – they used to say głupi, like stupid, to them.</span> <span id="s636">Eventually they started pulling knives out, you know, because they got insulted.</span> <span id="s637">It’s the same thing the way the British treated people in Africa, you know, they were calling them, hey boy do this, hey boy, do that.</span> <span id="s638">It’s the same thing, you know.</span> <span id="s639">And you don’t do it to people.</span> <span id="s640">You have to treat everybody with respect.</span> <span id="s641">That’s what I was told by my parents, that you treat everybody with respect, never give them a reason, you know, to be mean to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: So, when this changed, did you understand?</span> <span id="s643">I mean, there was – it was – you were hearing Hitler screaming, but it was the Russians who were coming in.</span> <span id="s644">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Well [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Did you know about it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, I don’t think we knew.</span> <span id="s648">We – we knew later what happened, but I don’t know why Hitler was afraid to allow – to a-attack Poland alone.</span> <span id="s649">While Pilsudski was alive, we knew he wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s650">When Pilsudski died, they said, well, Hitler is not scared of Pilsudski any more.</span> <span id="s651">He – he had a mental block because he beat the hell out of them, too, out of the Germans.</span> <span id="s652">So we knew that there was bad, but we didn’t know about – there was talk, and there was strange –</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Who was pa – let’s say – tell us, who was Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Who was Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Pilsudski was the Marshall of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And he died when?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: H-He died in, what was it, ’36 - ’37 he died.</span> <span id="s659">And I remember we didn’t like him too much, we didn’t like his politics, but they said now is big trouble because he – we – they knew that Hitler had his – you know superstitious or something, and then he – I si – I know now, you know, Litvinov was thrown out because he was Jewish, and they put Molotov and – Molotov and Ribbentrop decided to attack together.</span> <span id="s660">So first the Germans attacked, then the Russians.</span> <span id="s661">But you see, you hear about Poland so much, but you don’t realize that after the campaign, Hitler in Poland, for almost for a year he had to regroup his armies and everything, and then he went after England, Belgium and everything.</span> <span id="s662">He almost didn’t make war.</span> <span id="s663">He couldn’t attack anybody.</span> <span id="s664">They say his losses in Poland were tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Truly?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Because Poland had anti-tank weapon, and we wanted to make call – call in, you know, reserves all.</span> <span id="s667">And England and France said don’t do it, because it will provoke Hitler, so then don’t do it.</span> <span id="s668">So its mobilization started two days before Hitler attacked.</span> <span id="s669">And Hitler attacked accusing Poland that Polish troops went and attacked the radio station in Germany, and that’s what he told the Germans, that he sends the army over there, and they came.</span> <span id="s670">But they couldn’t even distribute the weapon, because Poland had something like a bazooka to destroy tank, and it was there, where they found it, Germany suffered tremendous losses, because those tanks weren’t good, they had to start redesigning the tanks, because they were destroying them.</span> <span id="s671">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So Germany was attacking from the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: The west.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: And about two weeks later, Russia came from the east.</span> <span id="s676">And Russia came, I’m telling you, they had strings on their horses.</span> <span id="s677">They came with the tanks that – with the lamp post and the tank would burn, but they kept coming and coming and coming.</span> <span id="s678">There were so many Russians that came over.</span> <span id="s679">I’ll tell you something better.</span> <span id="s680">To Patesha(ph), to my grandfather’s house, some Russian soldiers came over and they said [speaks foreign language here] Pani(ph), you know, when are you going to come back?</span> <span id="s681">They were from that region over there, and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: From where your mother was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: From where my mother, and they came over there and they were asking Pani(ph), when are wa – when are you going to come back, Pani(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: And that’s a – a ti – a term of respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: And those were Russians soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Yes, a term of respect saying, when are you going to come back and –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s688">Never over there –</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Back to Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: – because they were better off.</span> <span id="s691">They were living better off there.</span> <span id="s692">Russia was something – because they didn’t know about the west, you know.</span> <span id="s693">K-Karl Marx and Lenin and Trotsky, they all promise people everything.</span> <span id="s694">They said we will be paradise.</span> <span id="s695">And when you live in Siberia, in the remote areas, I told you, those people didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: They didn’t know, they thought – Francesca has a brother-in-law, a Russian from Crimea, he married.</span> <span id="s698">And he says, wa – we lived there, but we didn’t see anything better.</span> <span id="s699">We thought everybody lives like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s701">So, you see the soldiers come in, you see that your father has to give a gun up, the one weapon, and you realize that your family, your parents cannot protect you any more.</span> <span id="s702">Did they ever have conversations with you about what all this meant, about what all these si – all these political things?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I don’t know, we probably had, but I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s704">Then Stalin gave Wilno to Lithuanians, and we were in Lithuanian region.</span> <span id="s705">So I was living in grandmother’s house in Wilno, and I was going to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s706">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So that’s in the center of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: So that was a very good period for us again, you see?</span> <span id="s709">Very good period.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: How did it change?</span> <span id="s711">How did life change when it –</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, it was normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Okay, normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: It was normal life, except you didn’t want to get in the mess somewhere with [indecipherable] who hated Poles, if you came in somewhere, and there was somebody living, and somebody else was living, they said [speaks foreign language here] Polish pigs don’t live here.</span> <span id="s715">Siaulisi(ph).</span> <span id="s716">They were Lithuanian, but they had hated li-like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Siaulisi(ph) were they like –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Siauliai.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Okay, were th – who – can you explain who they were, these Siaulisi(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I – I cannot tell you, it was a party of people, Lithuanian, you know, it was a party.</span> <span id="s721">They were against Poles, against everything.</span> <span id="s722">They used to come in even to the cathedral to beat up the people when they were singing –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Hymns.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: [indecipherable] return Poland to us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: It was trouble, but otherwise it was all right.</span> <span id="s727">Police was fantastic.</span> <span id="s728">We had a – wa – carriage stolen before the war, and Lithuanians, when they came, policeman came and he told us that – and my father told them, you know, they were asking, anything stolen?</span> <span id="s729">Yeah, my father said, before the war.</span> <span id="s730">In about two weeks, they had it.</span> <span id="s731">They took my father there and they said, here is your carriage.</span> <span id="s732">One day we woke up and we had about 60 or 70 chickens, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: And we come in and there are no chickens, everything was stolen.</span> <span id="s735">By evening, Lithuanian police had it.</span> <span id="s736">They were very effective, and they were very effective with thieves, because they got scared, because the Lithuanian police used to put wet sheets and beat the hell out of the people.</span> <span id="s737">And they said, you know, across the kidneys and everything.</span> <span id="s738">So they found out that stealing doesn’t pay.</span> <span id="s739">And the Polish rule is like in America you do.</span> <span id="s740">When – when the – and you know how it is with stealing; if you steal a loaf of bread, you’re a thief.</span> <span id="s741">If you steal a million dollars, well, you defrauded somebody.</span> <span id="s742">But if you steal 10 million dollars, or 20 million, ah kleptomania, he’s sick.</span> <span id="s743">Tha-That’s the law in America, you don’t go to jail.</span> <span id="s744">Let stockholders pay, like in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s746">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I – that is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s748">And then, you know, this came and then there – the period went very fast.</span> <span id="s749">We had that thing in Wilno then, the [indecipherable] Kiersnowski, that was mine [indecipherable] he came first and he opened a nightclub, who – called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s750">So there was freedom, you know.</span> <span id="s751">And then his wife [indecipherable] cross, in the winter she got very hard time crossing the river.</span> <span id="s752">They came over and they said –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: They came from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: From Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: And oh, what’s her name?</span> <span id="s757">Oh God, I was thinking, oh well, the famous Polish, this girl singer.</span> <span id="s758">She was Jewish.</span> <span id="s759">She married Count Iscaris(ph) and he, my cousin was writing songs for her, you know, for the show and everything, so it was very successful.</span> <span id="s760">And then I don’t know how they got permission to go to Vladivostok, to Japan.</span> <span id="s761">She had connections with gemeinde.</span> <span id="s762">And then I met her father finally, in America when they came here in the show.</span> <span id="s763">They were – all the Jews in New York were there, writing in that show.</span> <span id="s764">It was itwee – and it was – it was good life o – at that period, and then all of a sudden, I remember they came, and they arrested us, and we were taking, and people were kneeling down along the road, and praying for us –</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: – when they saw us being taken in a carriage, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Who came, who took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Polish people, the rus – well, there was one Jewish NKVD officer, a Polish communist and two Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s769">And they came early in the morning, they knocked on the doors, you know, and th – and they told us to pack.</span> <span id="s770">But I told you about my sister before, my sister was packed, because she had dreams that the man comes here to prepare your things, you’re going to go for a long trip.</span> <span id="s771">She already had that thing that happened in Russia with her, but she was packed.</span> <span id="s772">And then th-they – th-they took us to – to the station, and in Charnibor(ph), my mother’s sister came with her husband and two daughters, and they brought our grandmother, and she was an old, old woman.</span> <span id="s773">She had a broken hip, and he – we begged the Russians not to take them, and they finally let her stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s774">And – and Korfs(ph) were there, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: What was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Korf(ph) too, Baron Korf(ph) was there too, brought in there.</span> <span id="s777">And then they put us in trucks and they took us to Nowa Vileka(ph) and in Nowa Vileka(ph) they separated the men.</span> <span id="s778">My father got what, 10 years or 12 years they told him in gulag, and – and – and they got it, and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s779">Well, I know that my father died, I have everything.</span> <span id="s780">The other ones were thrown out from the railroad, because they were on the railroads when they die in cars, so they just opened the door and they threw the bodies into the tundra somewhere, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: That’s after it’s all left – after –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s784">So at that point when you’re at Nowa Vileka(ph), and from what I understand, that is a train station in a small suburb of Wilno, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s785">Nowa Vileka(ph) is a –</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Nowa Vileka(ph), I cannot tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Is a small village.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I don’t remember that – well it’s a – it’s a railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: It’s small.</span> <span id="s791">It’s a small thing, but there were trains over there, and that’s where they took us, not to Wilno, but to Nowa Vileka(ph), in the trucks, and that’s where they separated, and that was the place where my father told me, when they were taking him away, Stasch(ph), I am not going to survive Russia, I’m going to die.</span> <span id="s792">From now on, you’re responsible for your mother and sister, promise me that.</span> <span id="s793">You take care, you survive Russia.</span> <span id="s794">I will not survive.</span> <span id="s795">And his last words were, when I was – I told you [speaks Polish], remember, Russia doesn’t like tears.</span> <span id="s796">Don’t ever, ever show a Russian that you’re afraid.</span> <span id="s797">And he was so right, later on in life I found out, because when they arrested me I told them, what the hell can you do to me?</span> <span id="s798">I said, you took my father away, you took me to Siberia, we’re hungry, we have no heat, we have nothing.</span> <span id="s799">What do you do?</span> <span id="s800">I told the NKVD officer, just take and shoot me if you want.</span> <span id="s801">He says, go home.</span> <span id="s802">And they had me for stealing, you know, and the other two went to jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: We’ll come to that incident, we’ll come to that incident.</span> <span id="s804">So the last time you see your father is at this Nowa Vileka(ph) train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: That’s was – I don’t know whether it was 14 or 15, I think it was 14 or 15 –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: – of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Of June, in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Seven-Seventy-three years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s811">We’re – this interview’s taking place on June 20th, so we’ve just passed that anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: We were locked up a day – the train was a small car.</span> <span id="s815">There were – this was a small cattle train.</span> <span id="s816">There were four little windows about this size, you know, and they put boards two layers of boards like this, on one side and on the other side.</span> <span id="s817">So we were lying, but you had to lie on the side, because you couldn’t lie on your back, there was no room.</span> <span id="s818">And sitting was a disaster.</span> <span id="s819">And they cut a little hole in the floor for you to go and relieve yourself, as a toilet.</span> <span id="s820">But somehow, the people had some blankets, so they put some strings around and they put blanket around, so you had privacy.</span> <span id="s821">Only twice they allowed us to – off the train, for in three weeks that we were going.</span> <span id="s822">Let me tell you, you – you never – you never know the stor – the sight of people, who when after weeks of sitting, lock, and not being able to walk, get out.</span> <span id="s823">Everybody had to go to the bathroom immediately.</span> <span id="s824">And everybody squatted, nobody cared where; women, men, everybody squatted and – a-a-and that was the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: It sounds awful.</span> <span id="s826">What was it li – yeah, I interrupted you as you were saying people, as you were being taken, were kneeling on the street, you know, kneeling on the road as you were being arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Who – wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: You said people were kneeling on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, and praying for us, in – i-in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s830">They were praying for us, there was, you know, they were – all knew what’s happening to us.</span> <span id="s831">You know, deportation to Siberia was known for a long time with the tsars and everything.</span> <span id="s832">So they knew that they want us exterminated over there, and then they’ll probably never see us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And that would be because you were rich, or because you were Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah, Polish, rich, there were some Jews taken too.</span> <span id="s835">There were some Jews not taken.</span> <span id="s836">In this car where we were, there was one Jewish nurse.</span> <span id="s837">I don’t know, she was very nice girl, and maybe she saved my life, I’ll tell you, because I got mumps, and Russian doctor, they open the door, and they gave me in a glass – I don’t know, it was enclosed glass here, there was medication.</span> <span id="s838">And they – he told us to give ookoe(ph) give me an injection, and they closed the door and he walked out.</span> <span id="s839">And she was a hospital nurse and she says, I have syringe.</span> <span id="s840">So she brought it, she took it and she gave me injection for that, you know.</span> <span id="s841">Whether it help or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s842">Maybe I would have been all right.</span> <span id="s843">But she was – she was the only Jewish person in our car, you know.</span> <span id="s844">And goo – who knows ho-ho – who they took?</span> <span id="s845">They took prostitutes too.</span> <span id="s846">They took prostitutes too, they later had problem with them in India and everywhere.</span> <span id="s847">Women, you know, you can’t tell what the hell they were doing, they were all crazy.</span> <span id="s848">They wanted to take all the people who had property, destroy them, but they also want to destroy everybody else.</span> <span id="s849">It’s madness.</span> <span id="s850">This world is mad.</span> <span id="s851">Every day, the older I get, the more I see it.</span> <span id="s852">I told after the second World War that somehow it will stabilize.</span> <span id="s853">Look what’s going on now.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: When you were in that tra – did you stay in the train station for a long time, or did the trains move out immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: I cannot tell you, I don’t remember, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: We went, and we started going, and I – I didn’t know geography that well, but the Polish people, they’re older, they knew the railroad station that we were going.</span> <span id="s858">And once a day or – or something, they used to open the door and they took four men with buckets to bring in some food, and they used to give us bread.</span> <span id="s859">But that bread was so bad that if you threw it against the wall it would stick to the wall.</span> <span id="s860">It was like thing – w-we – we took some food with us from Poland, thank God, you know, we had some – well, little food, and – but then, along the railroads, the Russians were standing, begging for food.</span> <span id="s861">What did they expect?</span> <span id="s862">People that are being deported to Russia, they were still standing with their hands outstretched, many station.</span> <span id="s863">And they had Russian soldiers, and we didn’t have enough water, it was hot.</span> <span id="s864">And I was asking Russians – soldiers, you know [indecipherable] kettle.</span> <span id="s865">I used to open the win – this – the window was open and I used to – and you – there were two Russians, I told you that before, a-a – on the side, they wouldn’t give me the water.</span> <span id="s866">But the minute there was only one Russian soldier on that side of the train, he would grab the kettle, run and bring me water.</span> <span id="s867">They were so petrified of each other, that they were afraid to – to – to give us anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: But – but it also shows that – that once they – once that fear is –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: – is gone, then it –</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: – people become human.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: People be-become human.</span> <span id="s874">We had a friend there, and he was German, he was a tank officer, and he lived, and he was with the Korfs and with [indecipherable] you know, families connected.</span> <span id="s875">And he was so nice, and then just before the war he got an order to return to Germany, to his unit.</span> <span id="s876">So we knew that something was cooking, you know, we were expecting that something will happen.</span> <span id="s877">And he was crying, he didn’t want to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s878">And then, after the war, they learned that he was killed in the last day of the wars, when Berlin fell, he was killed [indecipherable] I remember; tall, blonde, handsome fellow, and he was there.</span> <span id="s879">You remember people you know, you remember so many people, and – because you were meeting so many people.</span> <span id="s880">But you have to remember, I was 13 - 14, and what did I know, you know, I didn’t know much, except that I helped quite a lot as a child, at the parties, at meetings.</span> <span id="s881">My uncle was a senator, you know, so I heard a lot about politics always, and my grandfather was involved in parties, you know, political parties and everything.</span> <span id="s882">So we heard a lot of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Tell me, why did your family not particularly like Pilsudski’s politics?</span> <span id="s884">It’s just an interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: You wouldn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s888">I think one of the thing was that he once blew a train and sold the money.</span> <span id="s889">Or da – it was Russian money, or Austrian money, I don’t know, but the family was talking that that’s stealing.</span> <span id="s890">That that’s im-improper, you cannot steal.</span> <span id="s891">You know, I – they were talking about it.</span> <span id="s892">Pilsudski had a very hard life because his sister used to come and sit in my grandfather’s house.</span> <span id="s893">On the deck there were flowers.</span> <span id="s894">Oh, it was so beautiful over there, You cannot imagine how many flowers, agave, you know, was growing, and everything.</span> <span id="s895">Palms, little.</span> <span id="s896">And sh-she was talking and she was saying that you know, when you are in the government like my brother is, they print special papers for him.</span> <span id="s897">He cannot even get the news.</span> <span id="s898">I can tell you what’s going on in the country, but they – other groups, you know, they surround you.</span> <span id="s899">They are like plague, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s900">You have advisors, I guess in every government it’s the same thing, you know, they – th-they – they – they do everything.</span> <span id="s901">But she was saying that it’s a famous building in Warsaw, dom bez kantow.</span> <span id="s902">Kant means a corner, but it also means without cheating.</span> <span id="s903">So they said when they were building this building, they came to Pilsudski and said, well, build one building bez kantow.</span> <span id="s904">Build one building without cheating, you know.</span> <span id="s905">And they cut off the corner, it’s said to this day you can go on computer and you write dom bez kantow and they show it in Warsaw, the home.</span> <span id="s906">And this became famous dom bez kantow.</span> <span id="s907">So you know, it’s not easy to be a ruler.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Because you don’t know what influences you, or what goes on.</span> <span id="s910">I tell you, the Russian people that we met, a lot of them were very, very nice, you know?</span> <span id="s911">But when we went south in Siberia, there were Mongols, but over there it became much worse, because the people were hungry already.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: We’re gonna get to that part.</span> <span id="s913">I still want to be on the train right now.</span> <span id="s914">So when you were on the train, did you ever get any announcement, or any paper, or anything from those people who arrested you, as to why you were being deported and where you were being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: No, no, they didn’t talk to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: So you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s917">In other words, people knew the –</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Oh, we knew why, because the tsars used to do it.</span> <span id="s919">They – once you go to Siberia you saw all kinds of people, Germans, Ukrainians, they used to call [indecipherable], Tartars from Crimea they were deporting over there.</span> <span id="s920">They were deporting people for years.</span> <span id="s921">This is one procedure in Russia, take people and send them to Siberia, it’s empty.</span> <span id="s922">You know, you were going for days on, and you hardly saw a little station, where they only had water and maybe some coal for the railroad, and the train.</span> <span id="s923">It was a – it’s like a no man’s land, you go and go and there’s nothing.</span> <span id="s924">It’s a disaster.</span> <span id="s925">And then, in some places they build like [indecipherable] the soil was very good, you know.</span> <span id="s926">But this was funny.</span> <span id="s927">I’ll tell you something; we were there, I never saw a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw any animal alive or dead.</span> <span id="s928">Whether they ate them when they were starving, when there was starvation in the [indecipherable] you know, or – or what, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s929">Because I was fr – with a friend Fruzhinski(ph) later in India and he was working in sulfur mine and there was a lot of gold.</span> <span id="s930">And the mine, being broken, pressed his chest in.</span> <span id="s931">He couldn’t be in the army, you know, he had a hole – hole in there.</span> <span id="s932">And he said that that mine, all the Russians were laughing because Americans came in the 30s, engineers, and they developed that mine.</span> <span id="s933">And he said, how stupid Americans are.</span> <span id="s934">Don’t – Russians were saying, don’t they know how secretive Russians are?</span> <span id="s935">Of course they had an accident and they buried them over there.</span> <span id="s936">Once the mine was open [indecipherable] America the worst place in Russia, gold mine, and the worst concentration camp, where if you lasted two years you were lucky, they – you froze, it’s na – close to Alaska.</span> <span id="s937">That was be – opened up with American help.</span> <span id="s938">How about [indecipherable], the city Volga(ph)?</span> <span id="s939">Volga(ph) was built by all this – a fort.</span> <span id="s940">So you know, America did all the business they could, and they say Russia was starving its people, selling its food and trying to get machinery and everything from America.</span> <span id="s941">And America did business with them, capitalists, what do they care?</span> <span id="s942">They don’t care whether hundred million people died.</span> <span id="s943">To hell, as long as I make my million, that’s my opinion.</span> <span id="s944">I don’t know whether I should say that, but as long as you can make money, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s945">You see, brokerage houses, when I started, were private companies, they were partnership.</span> <span id="s946">And if they were doing business, they were very, very afraid.</span> <span id="s947">If they made something wrong, it was their pocket.</span> <span id="s948">And then they allowed them to become corporation.</span> <span id="s949">So now people who run corporation can steal, make themselves rich, and if they get punish, who pays the stockholder?</span> <span id="s950">The stockholders are punished, and they lose the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Different system.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Ju-Ju-Just look at American history now.</span> <span id="s953">They make a mistake [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s955">Where did you finally land?</span> <span id="s956">When you, you know, went for three weeks on the train –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: – where did it stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Well, it’s first – the big station was, when we stopped, Nowosibirsk.</span> <span id="s960">It’s right in the middle of Siberia, I think, it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s961">Then they turned south, to Barnaul, and then we went to Rubtsovsk.</span> <span id="s962">Gorbachev’s wife was born over there in Rubtsovsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Raisa, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: And then from there we went by carriage to the village where we were.</span> <span id="s965">And as I told you, we were very lucky that we were not sent to collective farm, or some mine, or bri – bricklayers place where they make.</span> <span id="s966">But we were in a village.</span> <span id="s967">The people were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s968">The NKVD didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s969">The only thing the bastards did to us, they came to our house, and my sister hid everything in the stove, in ashes; pictures that we had, and papers.</span> <span id="s970">And my aunt was afraid, and – my mother’s sister, she was stupid, she told them about it and they took all our pictures of my father, of the youth, you know, we had a lot of pictures from Poland, album.</span> <span id="s971">And they took everywhere, and they took all the coffee books.</span> <span id="s972">We had those coffee book with watermarks.</span> <span id="s973">When they saw watermark, ration NKVD, they never saw it, they say [speaks foreign language here] we’re German spies, right away they said, because you have watermarks on paper.</span> <span id="s974">So they think this is for sending messages.</span> <span id="s975">They never saw anything like this.</span> <span id="s976">They were very poor.</span> <span id="s977">You know, when Russians march into Poland we used to ask them, oranges [indecipherable] oranges?</span> <span id="s978">And they said, oh yeah, we have factories, they make them.</span> <span id="s979">That was the standard answer.</span> <span id="s980">They didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s981">Because I never saw sugar in Russia once.</span> <span id="s982">No, I saw one Russian woman – officer, having a piece of sugar, she was eating it with water.</span> <span id="s983">But that was the only time I saw sugar.</span> <span id="s984">I never saw sugar in Russia.</span> <span id="s985">So it was – it was in – inhuman land, it was inhuman country, and I think it is to this day.</span> <span id="s986">They said [indecipherable] there was Radio Moscow here, I was listening and they were talking, men all drinking, smoking.</span> <span id="s987">Trains you cannot travel.</span> <span id="s988">There are no roads to drive on, you know.</span> <span id="s989">And that was – that report is from Moscow saying.</span> <span id="s990">You know, that – it was – it was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: When you were – when you were first taken to Nowosibirsk, then you were diverted by train to Barnaul is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yeah, it was same train there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: The same train?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: – I tell you, I was petrified when I saw Nowosibirsk.</span> <span id="s995">I never saw such a tremendous station, and there were loudspeakers talking all the time and everything.</span> <span id="s996">And I never saw anything so big, it was tremendous.</span> <span id="s997">And then they turned around, and we went south, you know, to Barnaul.</span> <span id="s998">Then I saw much more of southern Russia when we were released already.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Oh, we’ll – we’ll get there, we’ll get there.</span> <span id="s1000">So in Barnaul then you’re – the same train goes to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah, all the way.</span> <span id="s1002">It was the same train all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: To ruda – what was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Wait – wait.</span> <span id="s1005">Nowosibirsk, Barnaul.</span> <span id="s1006">Rubtsovsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Rubtsovsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Rubtsovsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: And then you said you were taken by car from Rubtsovsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Not by car, by carriage, horse carriage.</span> <span id="s1011">There was a little carriage, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: – like you saw them in Lithuania with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: – the horse, and we had to walk most of the way because our suitcases were there.</span> <span id="s1016">It was – I don’t know, it was 30 - 40 [indecipherable] what is it, miles?</span> <span id="s1017">I don’t know, it was pretty far a whole day.</span> <span id="s1018">And we came to that village, and si – there was an empty house with two rooms.</span> <span id="s1019">There was – in one room there was a stove, and there was a little like place where they did something, so there was wood on building.</span> <span id="s1020">So we used to take that wood and burn in the stove.</span> <span id="s1021">You cou – were not allowed to go to forest and bring any forest, because this is government.</span> <span id="s1022">I told you how, one time I went to pick up szyszki – how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1023">From pine trees, you know, corns.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Yeah, the cones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: And we were – we were using them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Okay, you were using –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: – from – [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Okay, cut.</span> <span id="s1029">[tape break] Yes, all right, so you were saying, you went in the forest and you got these pine cones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1031">And the Russians, they all ran away, and I didn’t run away.</span> <span id="s1032">And the f-forest man comes, and he said kudova(ph), from where you are?</span> <span id="s1033">And I said, I’m from Poland, you know ya polak(ph).</span> <span id="s1034">And he says, why didn’t you run away, to me, you know, [speaks foreign language] Because you were stealing government pines, and you cannot steal government pines.</span> <span id="s1035">And if you – next time, you run, because otherwise I’ll go to jail for not arresting you.</span> <span id="s1036">The Russians were all running away, and he told me, you have to run.</span> <span id="s1037">And then he says [speaks foreign language] I – also, you’re from Poland, let’s sit down and talk.</span> <span id="s1038">Wha – what’s – how life is in Poland, tell me.</span> <span id="s1039">They were so curious that you [indecipherable] there was nobody around us, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: – but he pleaded with me, next time if you come to take the pines –</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Pine cones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: – take the pines, but run like a crazy when I come, because they’ll arrest me, and I’ll go to jail.</span> <span id="s1044">Then I told you about kerosene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: I went – well, no, I have to start that a little different story.</span> <span id="s1047">This is another story.</span> <span id="s1048">When the Russian woman with the daughter came to us already in that little house, and she ask whether my sister has any dresses to sell because the daughter is getting married, and she would like to have a nice dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: And my sister says, well, I can sell you one dress.</span> <span id="s1051">And – and the girl was there, you know, they measured my sister.</span> <span id="s1052">Okay, I’ll re-sew it a little, I’ll correct it for you.</span> <span id="s1053">And she – the minute she left, neighbors of ours in those buildings came and said, watch out.</span> <span id="s1054">He is the chief communist for the whole area.</span> <span id="s1055">Top communist, that’s his wife.</span> <span id="s1056">Be very careful what you do with them.</span> <span id="s1057">They are big communists.</span> <span id="s1058">And then she came few days later, she picked up the dress and she took my mother and sister to their house.</span> <span id="s1059">And listen the story about their house.</span> <span id="s1060">They walk in, they had bars on the doors and on the windows, they were so afraid.</span> <span id="s1061">And he told my mother, my family, before the revolution was fairly well-off.</span> <span id="s1062">And I decided that I won’t raise my family in poverty.</span> <span id="s1063">So I joined the party and I became a communist and I am the head of this district.</span> <span id="s1064">And he was very nice, and he said look, probably the Germans will come here.</span> <span id="s1065">We – we won’t be able to withstand their – Russian – a-a-a – the German army.</span> <span id="s1066">And, can you protect us from Germans?</span> <span id="s1067">And my mother said well, if Germans come here, they might shoot me first and then you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: You know, as a communist.</span> <span id="s1070">And – my mother said no.</span> <span id="s1071">And then he ask what I’m doing, you know, and his son was working in a place where there were repairing metal [indecipherable] tractors, combines and everything.</span> <span id="s1072">And he was bringing water.</span> <span id="s1073">So when his son went to school, they gave me that job.</span> <span id="s1074">And once a day you got food over there, so you know, what a privilege it was in that place.</span> <span id="s1075">And we didn’t have kerosene for lamp.</span> <span id="s1076">And I came to him once, he was sitting – he was the manager of the whole place, and I said to him [speaks foreign language here] because in Russian it’s kerosene, too, and I made mistake, in Polish we say nafta(ph), in Russian – so he said [speaks foreign language] Well, and he told me that I cannot give it to you.</span> <span id="s1077">This is government.</span> <span id="s1078">I’ll go and get arrested.</span> <span id="s1079">Then he says, quiet, but over there there is a woman which [indecipherable] some equipment.</span> <span id="s1080">You go to her with the bottle where nobody sees, and she will give you kerosene in a bottle.</span> <span id="s1081">But don’t let anybody see it, and run away quickly, and you will have kerosene for the lamp at home.</span> <span id="s1082">And then he locked the door, and he says, where were you li – where were you living?</span> <span id="s1083">And well, we’re deported here, and he started talking with me, and he was the guy who told me he couldn’t believe that we had farms, that we had property.</span> <span id="s1084">Nobody has property.</span> <span id="s1085">And then we tell him to America and he says, can you amer – can you imagine those strikes in America?</span> <span id="s1086">People rather die than work in America.</span> <span id="s1087">They go on strike, because see in Russia, if you went on a strike, they would have killed you.</span> <span id="s1088">So here was – they were reading in America – in their Russian papers about the strikes in America.</span> <span id="s1089">That’s how they were interpreting, that those people were so poor that they’d rather die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Yeah, they’d rather die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Because in Russia there were too main newspapers.</span> <span id="s1092">I think I told you there was Pravda [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1093">Pravda is the truth, [indecipherable] is news.</span> <span id="s1094">And the Russians were saying the problem with our papers is that in truth there is no news, and in the news there is no truth.</span> <span id="s1095">That’s what the Russians were saying.</span> <span id="s1096">They were laughing, but they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1097">They just didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: When you got there, did they put your mother and your sister to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: What did they have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, first we were digging cellars, and we were very nice.</span> <span id="s1102">Every time we took a shower – and me too – and every time we threw a shower we said, hundred Russians on the German front, you know, and – and the – and – a-and then they switched us to forests, and to work in the forest.</span> <span id="s1103">And there were – I don’t know where the other Poles came, you know, they were engineers and everything.</span> <span id="s1104">They had no idea how to cut the tree down.</span> <span id="s1105">I had to teach them, because I grew up on a farm and I saw how – how workers were cutting the tree, and which way the tree falls and every – they had no idea.</span> <span id="s1106">I had to teach them, you know, I used to walk around, big – big guy, I had big shoes.</span> <span id="s1107">I had big shoes because Germans shot up a train not far from our home, and the next thing we had [indecipherable] soldiers wore big shoes, and their shoes were long.</span> <span id="s1108">And oh God, in Russia, when I had the ax, I hit it, the shoe, I thought I cut off my fingers – my toes, but the shoe was much too large, so I didn’t cut off my legs.</span> <span id="s1109">But I thought – was afraid that I cut off.</span> <span id="s1110">They had very good steel.</span> <span id="s1111">Oh, the steel was fantastic, the axes and everything.</span> <span id="s1112">You see, we had to make so many two yards long, like – like two meters long, maybe meter wide, like this, and maybe a meter high.</span> <span id="s1113">Wood, we had to cut it in pieces, and put it.</span> <span id="s1114">And every day we had to – we had a norm, how many we had to do.</span> <span id="s1115">So, we figured very fast way, cut wood in small pieces, and on the ends we put small pieces, then everything is empty inside, and we cover with the logs on top, and the Russian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: And there’s the norm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: – and the Russian was wondering that we could make a couple of norms in a day in this way.</span> <span id="s1118">But we were cheating.</span> <span id="s1119">And they came, they counted and they went and they were happy.</span> <span id="s1120">And there was plenty of [indecipherable] cucumber woman, she was always bringing us cucumbers to eat, you know, she had cucumbers.</span> <span id="s1121">And people were very nice, they were trying to help us.</span> <span id="s1122">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: So you didn’t – there wasn’t anybody that you experienced who – who was cruel, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: – or was tough, or was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Absolutely no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1128">Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Not there.</span> <span id="s1132">Not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Well, I told you about my sister, she came over there and she started telling fortune.</span> <span id="s1135">And the next thing, the Russians were coming from all sides.</span> <span id="s1136">One thing – you know, I was laughing always at it.</span> <span id="s1137">You know, I was small, to me it was funny.</span> <span id="s1138">But she used to lay cards and look at them, and she said, I don’t see cards, I see something else.</span> <span id="s1139">And one time there was a woman that came over and she said that her husband is in jail, and do you know when he will come out and everything?</span> <span id="s1140">And my sister told him – and there were other Russian women – my sister said, vrosh(ph), you lie.</span> <span id="s1141">Why?</span> <span id="s1142">You husband is a pilot.</span> <span id="s1143">And she says no, no, he’s in jail, I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s1144">She says no, he’s a pilot.</span> <span id="s1145">One day he’s here in Russia and one day he’s over there.</span> <span id="s1146">He must be a pilot, he’s all over Russia.</span> <span id="s1147">She says yeah, he’s a pilot.</span> <span id="s1148">You know?</span> <span id="s1149">There was this other case that a Russian woman run into our house, this little house that we had.</span> <span id="s1150">She opened the window and she went ptoo, ptoo, ptoo, you know, and she ran out, closed the door and ran out.</span> <span id="s1151">And few weeks later my sister got an abscess in her throat.</span> <span id="s1152">And she – they took her to hospital, they gave her tubes, they fed her through the tubes.</span> <span id="s1153">And she came back after a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1154">And then again, same thing happened.</span> <span id="s1155">And then this old Russian woman came, and she says Ganichka(ph) she says, doctors won’t cure you, this is Siberian curse fell on you.</span> <span id="s1156">These doctors don’t know how to remove it.</span> <span id="s1157">I will remove it and it will go away, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1158">And my sister was to go again to the hospital, because the abscess is started.</span> <span id="s1159">And she says, well you are Catholic, maybe you don’t want it.</span> <span id="s1160">So she took linen piece of cloth, she put some ashes into it, and dipped it in sunflower oil, and she prayed over that.</span> <span id="s1161">And she made three balls, and she told my sister, rub your neck once, then after an hour rub it again and throw it behind you and tell time.</span> <span id="s1162">Next morning there was no sign of abscesses.</span> <span id="s1163">And this woman was a tragic story, because she had the son in the army, and she was always asking how her son is, and she used to come with friends.</span> <span id="s1164">And my sister, one day, almost broke.</span> <span id="s1165">Her son is dead, sh-she see in the cards that her son is dead.</span> <span id="s1166">She couldn’t tell her that.</span> <span id="s1167">But she told her friends; don’t say anything, but her son is dead.</span> <span id="s1168">About week later, or in 10 days, she comes over to my sister and she says, Ganichka(ph), I saved your life, I did everything I could for you.</span> <span id="s1169">How could you do it to me?</span> <span id="s1170">If you told me that my son is dead, it would have been all right, but I got a m-message from the government that my son died, and all my friends told me that you told him that he died, how could you do this to me?</span> <span id="s1171">You see how difficult it is in life?</span> <span id="s1172">My sister didn’t have the heart to tell her that her son was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: There were a lot of Jewish women who were coming, because not far from there was a resort, with salt water lake, and from there, from Moscow they flew, the Jewish women with children.</span> <span id="s1175">And they used to come – we couldn’t go over there, because we would have to get permission from police.</span> <span id="s1176">We couldn’t go anywhere from that village, we’re not allowed to go anywhere, where you had to get permission from the village.</span> <span id="s1177">But they used to come to us and they used to come to tell fortune.</span> <span id="s1178">And another thing was that there was a policeman, and he came to my sister, and she says, oh, you’re getting married tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1179">And he says, how do you know?</span> <span id="s1180">Well, I see it in the cards.</span> <span id="s1181">But today [indecipherable] to have a party.</span> <span id="s1182">And she says, no drinking, and no fighting.</span> <span id="s1183">If you drink, you fight, and you be arrested.</span> <span id="s1184">And next day, he was in jail.</span> <span id="s1185">He got into a fight.</span> <span id="s1186">But my sister told him that.</span> <span id="s1187">So, you know, Russians trusted her, and that’s why they were always fr-from our home, you know, they always gave us two eggs, or they gave us some milk, or they gave us some bread they brought us.</span> <span id="s1188">And you know, so we were getting food from them, from Hanya’s(ph) telling fortunes, and telling.</span> <span id="s1189">And then the Russians told her to stop working, because she was getting sick very often.</span> <span id="s1190">Sh – my sister [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1191">So they told her – they relieved her of all the work.</span> <span id="s1192">They said, you don’t work, only your mother and your brother work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Tell me about your father.</span> <span id="s1194">Did you have any news of where he was at the time, or what had happened to him, or where his train had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s1196">We didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: I finally learn what happen to my father when I was in Palestine already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: That’s [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: My mother met a priest somewhere, and somebody said Kiersnowski.</span> <span id="s1201">She was in some aktion, you know, in – when we were already free.</span> <span id="s1202">And when she said to my mother, did you have a husband without the hand, you know.</span> <span id="s1203">And my mother said yes.</span> <span id="s1204">Well, I buried your husband.</span> <span id="s1205">So that’s how my mother first found out.</span> <span id="s1206">But in that place where he was – died, there was his half-brother, and he was an officer in Polish army.</span> <span id="s1207">And that’s why I have a picture of his grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1209">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: And – and we have death certificate that way.</span> <span id="s1211">But we didn’t know – I didn’t know probably for close to two years.</span> <span id="s1212">And in – the Russians told us not to move south with the Polish troops that were going, and – but we went.</span> <span id="s1213">And all way there on Ferraba(ph).</span> <span id="s1214">where we were on this – on – on the river, and s – we were starving, and Polish army was sending women and men, trying to pick up the children.</span> <span id="s1215">So my sister was very sick and the woman came over and my mother gave me to her.</span> <span id="s1216">And we went to another place, over there, who was starving, we slept on the rain and everything.</span> <span id="s1217">That’s where I found turtles to eat, finally.</span> <span id="s1218">[indecipherable] And – and – but in the beginning we slept by the river on stones, and then we went – they told us one day from there that we are going to Iran.</span> <span id="s1219">We didn’t know what Iran was, I didn’t know where Teheran was, but I was sick.</span> <span id="s1220">I was, and Pushkoski(ph); was friend of mine, and they send us to the train to pick up some bread.</span> <span id="s1221">I never forget, we tied quickly the bed – bread and wu – instead of carrying bread, we’re pushing it into our pants, you see, because we’re afraid that we’ll be hungry tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1222">So we were stashing it, and we had bread.</span> <span id="s1223">And then we went, and we were coming back, and we went t-too far up over there, and I met a woman, and I said, is my mother and sister alive?</span> <span id="s1224">They said yes.</span> <span id="s1225">And I wanted to jump on that train and go out to them.</span> <span id="s1226">But [indecipherable] there is no way that they can feed me.</span> <span id="s1227">So I went to – on that train, and they took us to [indecipherable] on Caspian Sea, and they put us on an oil tanker to go to Potlevy(ph) in Iran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Okay, we’re going to stop at that point because we’ve jumped ahead in our story a little bit.</span> <span id="s1229">I want to find out more.</span> <span id="s1230">After your – you know, when you’re in this village, and you and your mother work, and your sister is telling fortunes and getting – you know, she’s getting sick and – and then is relieved from having to work like you and your mother, I want to find out what happens then.</span> <span id="s1231">How do things develop, and how long it is that you stay there.</span> <span id="s1232">So let’s talk about that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: – and then we’ll come – we’ll come to this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: I cannot give you days, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1238">But it wasn’t too long after, you know, we were there several months over there, and then we were on collective farm working.</span> <span id="s1239">And on collective farm it was a riot, because they had wopsha(ph).</span> <span id="s1240">So you got water mixed with flour to eat, and they had bread they gave you, and they had chemerchki(ph), sunflower –</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: – seeds, so you could eat.</span> <span id="s1243">And I remember we were picking – what the hell we were picking?</span> <span id="s1244">Peas, I think.</span> <span id="s1245">And the Russian girls were absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s1246">They were sitting there and I was sitting separately from them, and those Russian girls were picking that.</span> <span id="s1247">And they said [speaks foreign language] boy, come over here.</span> <span id="s1248">And I said, I don’t want to come.</span> <span id="s1249">They used to say, don’t be afraid, we won’t bite it off, you know.</span> <span id="s1250">There were no men, they were all in the army.</span> <span id="s1251">Women were going desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Don’t tell me that that’s what – really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1254">Women were desperate.</span> <span id="s1255">There were – there was a girl which – Marusha(ph), which used to give us our bread, couple of slices of bread a day.</span> <span id="s1256">She told me always, if you come for a night, I will give you more and more.</span> <span id="s1257">They were – they were desperate, you know, to get, and the hell, I was a small boy, you know.</span> <span id="s1258">I told you, I didn’t grow.</span> <span id="s1259">And I was afraid of the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Poor guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: But it was something.</span> <span id="s1262">So anyway, where was I now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: You were collective farm.</span> <span id="s1264">You were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, in co – the carriage came in and they told us to go – get in and we’re going to NKVD.</span> <span id="s1266">And we came to NKVD and NKVD said, well, you are free now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: That’s the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: That was the contract which Sikorski, Stalin and everything were going to form Polish army, and there will be trains going south in Siberia and they will organize Polish army over there.</span> <span id="s1269">So if you want to go, go.</span> <span id="s1270">We would advise you not to go because there will be starvation over there.</span> <span id="s1271">We have food over there.</span> <span id="s1272">But we didn’t listen, and you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Well, here’s an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1274">You are deported in mid-June 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: And it’s one week later that Nazi Germany attacks the Soviet Union, and breaks the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact by attacking.</span> <span id="s1277">So you’re not even at the camps yet, when –</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: – when this attack comes.</span> <span id="s1280">Did you find out about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1282">It was in every – on every station, they had the picture of the [indecipherable] German, with the big tail and big nails like this, all over Russia.</span> <span id="s1283">It appeared on every railroad station.</span> <span id="s1284">That’s why we – that’s how we found out that the war broke out, because they came with those pictures.</span> <span id="s1285">And believe me, some of the people over there were asking us deep in Siberia whether the Germans really looked like that.</span> <span id="s1286">And later on, a lot of Germans from Volga River were taken by Stalin and sent to Siberia, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Because during Catherine the Great, a lot of Germans were settled over there.</span> <span id="s1289">So the – they took them over to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: And so, you were already imprisoned when Nazi Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: – attacks the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1293">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: And you know what our biggest problem was then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Between the Russian.</span> <span id="s1299">Whose side are they going to be on?</span> <span id="s1300">You know, are they going to be on the side of the allies like Russia and England and France, and – or are they going to be on the side of Germany?</span> <span id="s1301">Nobody was sure.</span> <span id="s1302">And then, thank God when we heard, okay, Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the news came.</span> <span id="s1303">Now Japanese solved the problem.</span> <span id="s1304">They said now America will have to go to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: So, in other words, the question –</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: That’s what the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: – the question was, what side will America be on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1309">Because you know, like Kennedy’s father, he wanted to be on German side, you know, a lot of Americans, they didn’t want to be in a war.</span> <span id="s1310">The war – the draft in America started one day before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s1311">Americans didn’t want to go to war, they were only selling weapons and recession ended, depression in America ended, because they started selling weapon, and America came out because of that war from depression.</span> <span id="s1312">America was in awful depression.</span> <span id="s1313">People in the office told me they used to bring food to people, and often they used to enter apartments in New York and people were dead already from starvation.</span> <span id="s1314">They told me this was awful starvation in America too, during the depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: So wi – so in Russia, while you were deep in Siberia, you knew that the war had broken out, but when the – you go to the secret police offices, the NKVD, and they tell you you are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Was that a shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Did you believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: We knew there was a war, so we thought that there is [indecipherable] because the news was coming that there was Polish contacts already with Russian government and everything.</span> <span id="s1321">So you – you knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: – that something was going on, just like about Katyn forest.</span> <span id="s1324">There was a news in Poland that nobody knew what happened, but you see, at a period, no more letters were coming from there, and nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1325">So the Poles suspected that they were killed, but nobody could say.</span> <span id="s1326">And then Germans came in there, and when the Germans came, America and England said that it was made by the German, Katyn forest, and that the Germans killed, because they couldn’t insult Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s1327">Because they were afraid that Uncle Joe will go back and join with Germany again, maybe.</span> <span id="s1328">You know, this was very complicated, I think.</span> <span id="s1329">We were afraid of many things.</span> <span id="s1330">People didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: So when – when you hear from the secret police that you are free, and they advise you not to leave that area, this is now near that village of – how did you call it?</span> <span id="s1332">The rebo –</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Nowia – Nowia(ph) Angorivka(ph) the village was.</span> <span id="s1334">Nowia(ph) Angorivka(ph) the village was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: And they – they – they – they were, you know, the only thing they did to us [indecipherable] over there, they took our – our pictures and all our papers, you know, they took every – all the memories of Poland, you know, where we were – were without pictures, without anything.</span> <span id="s1337">But they didn’t punish us, nobody did anything to us over there.</span> <span id="s1338">It is – it’s the south, this problem started, because there was starvation over there, there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1340">So let’s le – excuse me, let’s start here.</span> <span id="s1341">So you – you decide to leave anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: – you – three of you.</span> <span id="s1344">And you b – all three of you start to go south?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Well, we went to Rubtsovsk back, and the train came, and we got on a train with Polish soldiers and we started moving south –</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: – you see, to where the Polish army was going to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1348">But the Russians took us to Amudalia(ph) river, and they put the civilians there, and the army soldiers they moved to Guzari(ph) where already Polish army was being trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: And you were with the civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: They were alre – they were already – they were already there, Poles and a lot of Jewish soldiers, Polish were there, and you know, they were all – everybody with Polish citizenship was released.</span> <span id="s1351">So the Jews were released too.</span> <span id="s1352">So th-they were in Polish army, and then they all got down to the Middle East, you know, we came to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: So what happened – so you were apart – with the civilian group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Civilian group, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1356">What happened to you guys?</span> <span id="s1357">What happened with you and your mother and your sister when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Well, well, when we came to there, they gave us – they call it white houses, you know, to live in.</span> <span id="s1359">They left us there.</span> <span id="s1360">You see, they wanted to send us down Amudalia(ph) river, we would have died.</span> <span id="s1361">But this [indecipherable] 80 men and he could resist the Russian police and everything, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: You – we have to – no, excuse me, I’m confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: They were – they were putting us on the boat already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: They were putting us on the Russians and he came over with [indecipherable] guy, and he unloaded the b-boats, and they said the rush – he told the Russians, you want to have a fight, we’ll have a fight.</span> <span id="s1368">And the Russians backed out, you see?</span> <span id="s1369">Russians are funny people, but they backed out.</span> <span id="s1370">But of course, there were 80 men, and in Russia most of the men were drafted, you know, everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: All right, but I’m confused.</span> <span id="s1372">And I’m confused because the – the – the juncture that I understand is that the military men are separated from the women, and they go off to the – where the Polish units are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: – and eventually they get to Palestine and – and are trained to fight.</span> <span id="s1375">The civilians are – are left behind, and the Russians want to put them on a boat down the river, why?</span> <span id="s1376">Why?</span> <span id="s1377">Which river, and in a different direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: To kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Par – to kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Because I saw a lot of people being brought back from there, and on barges there were nothing but dead bodies coming back from south, from the desert, and we – we were the first transport that could stop the Russians and send us [indecipherable] they stopped the Russians from doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: So now, let me te – let me ask –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: And then we are in a little –</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1384">When you say they’re sent down the river, is that actually to be shot, or to starve to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: But they was – Russians didn’t shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: They mostly made you in such a miserable place, because I knew one guy that was there, where I talked, and he said I used to walk around over there looking where I could kill a man to eat him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: I see, and this is in the desert; down that river, into the desert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: They were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1393">So this fellow comes by with the 80 soldiers.</span> <span id="s1394">What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Pischek(ph), I think his name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Pischek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Pischek(ph), something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: And was he a military person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Well, he was in Polish army, but he said that he was an officer, and he wasn’t an officer, but somewhere he got officers [indecipherable] –</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: – you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: And he had a – he just had a group of 80 men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Eighty men, and he – he was rough, and for – he used to walk to NKVD offices with those men, you know, and scare the bejesus out of them, because there would be 10 or something officers, and he comes with 80 men, and he tells them, you better give us food or else, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: And they were scared of him.</span> <span id="s1408">And then we were on that – and then we were left on that churchyard, that’s where we’re really starving, that’s where I had double pneumonia, that’s where people were dying like flies over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Is this on the si – y-you were moved to someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: N-No, that was – we were on that train, and the train took – the soldiers they took further, but they left us over there, the Russians, in – in that place, in that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: And it’s called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: That was called Farraba(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Farraba(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Farraba(ph).</span> <span id="s1415">On the other side is church of – my mother told me that it was beautiful old town, and Farraba(ph) wasn’t that nice.</span> <span id="s1416">Can you imagine, there was a huge river there, and I think now, there must have been fish in there, but nobody had the string to catch them.</span> <span id="s1417">There must have been food there in the river, but nobody was fishing.</span> <span id="s1418">I remember some soldiers were there, sometimes sitting – and I remember soldiers sitting by the water, and they were killing lice.</span> <span id="s1419">And one soldier says, oh, you are from this region of Russia.</span> <span id="s1420">He says, oh, how do you know that I’m from there?</span> <span id="s1421">The kind of lice that you have on you.</span> <span id="s1422">People were covered with lice, because when you are starve, you’re weak.</span> <span id="s1423">I don’t know why lice get to people like crazy.</span> <span id="s1424">That was a big curse, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: And so when you were in this chu – this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Farraba(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Farraba(ph), and across was a place called cher – I forgot –</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Cher Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Cher Joan.</span> <span id="s1430">And that’s where you got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: I got sick in Farraba(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: – and they took me to the hospital, and that’s where the Jewish women were.</span> <span id="s1434">I don’t know, they were from Moscow with children, I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Thirteen of us in the evening, three in the morning only left.</span> <span id="s1437">And they had food.</span> <span id="s1438">They were commissar’s wife somewhere in Moscow, or something, and they had food and everything, and they fed me.</span> <span id="s1439">If they didn’t feed me in the hospital, I would have died, because there was no food.</span> <span id="s1440">I was – I – I was there in the hospital and I was covered with bedbugs and everything.</span> <span id="s1441">It was filthy.</span> <span id="s1442">And the Russians were nice doctors, they tried to do something, there was a woman doctor.</span> <span id="s1443">But they didn’t have anything, and they didn’t have food.</span> <span id="s1444">You know, I remember there was one dog running around that place, and everybody was trying to catch him, but nobody could catch the dog.</span> <span id="s1445">So, you know, and it was various; sometimes we got onions, so for a couple of weeks we ate onions.</span> <span id="s1446">Then we went, something else we got, you know.</span> <span id="s1447">Whatever we came, we cooked.</span> <span id="s1448">But somebody caught that dog somewhere and brought us some meat after I had pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1449">And we were cooking and cooking that meat, I didn’t want to eat it.</span> <span id="s1450">I didn’t want to eat the dog, but they made me eat it, and I think that’s what I regain strength.</span> <span id="s1451">Because I couldn’t walk, I was so weak.</span> <span id="s1452">There was a step, I couldn’t stand on the step, arise myself.</span> <span id="s1453">It was – it was – it was koszmar in Polish, we say, you know, this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: It was a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: A nightmare, nightmare, period, you know.</span> <span id="s1456">People were dying.</span> <span id="s1457">Can you imagine being in a room in a hospital and 10 kids die at one night.</span> <span id="s1458">You just become inhuman, you start losing humanity, you know, when you live under those condition.</span> <span id="s1459">Because there was no – there was no help.</span> <span id="s1460">And eventually my mother gave me – and there were about seven or eight of us from that place, Polish children, my mother gave me to take me to Polish army, because they promise that they will give us food.</span> <span id="s1461">And we were writing, and we had special Russian document, and we were going with Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1462">And we were being fed well, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1463">Russian transports were – were arranged, soldiers.</span> <span id="s1464">The train comes, you stop at some station, you go inside, there’s a big building, you get the tray, you get your food, you eat.</span> <span id="s1465">You put your tray, you walk out, you get on a train and you go again.</span> <span id="s1466">And the next train come.</span> <span id="s1467">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1468">And the Russians were all looking at us kids walking in there, the [speaks foreign language here] and what kind of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: What kind of orders do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yeah, orders, exactly, you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: That was funny.</span> <span id="s1473">And then we came over there, and over there there were already soldiers, you know, and everything.</span> <span id="s1474">But it was tough over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: What were – what place was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: That – Guzarai(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Guzarai(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: A lot of people died over there.</span> <span id="s1479">My sister later came over there too, there was, you know, they were taken to Guzarai(ph) too, and Guzarai(ph) was awful thing.</span> <span id="s1480">And then we went to a – a collective farm [indecipherable] there were Muslims living over there, and they were very superstitious, and they even eat turtles, thank God.</span> <span id="s1481">That’s why the turtles kept me alive.</span> <span id="s1482">I told you, there – there is a girl that was in Russia [indecipherable] and she has [indecipherable] turtles</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Does she really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: She keeps it as a souvenir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: And so this – this is the s – part where you meet up with the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Yeah, with the Polish army, and the Polish army – and then when I was in that collective farm, it was a village Kirchen(ph) Batash(ph).</span> <span id="s1487">They told us that we’re going to Iran.</span> <span id="s1488">I didn’t know where the hell Iran was, I didn’t know what Teheran is.</span> <span id="s1489">You know, I had a friend, and we were both sick, we had diarrhea, but we told them we don’t have diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1490">In the evening they told us to bring bread, so we stacked all the bread in the pants to make sure that we’ll have something to eat.</span> <span id="s1491">You know what a great thing it is when you are hungry, and you got bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: But I – I omitted something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: – about the dreams t-to say.</span> <span id="s1496">I say those things, I don’t know why, but when – before I got pneumonia in Russia, I was dreaming that I have mouth full of bread and I couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s1497">I couldn’t swallow it.</span> <span id="s1498">And about two, three days later I had pneumonia and I was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1499">Then I came to Teheran, and we finally got to Teheran, and we were running around and everything, and I got the dream.</span> <span id="s1500">And my friend Pushkoski that was with me in Russia, I told him, you know, I probably go to hospital.</span> <span id="s1501">Why?</span> <span id="s1502">He says, I had the dream, I was eating bread, and I couldn’t swallow it.</span> <span id="s1503">I had bread in my mouth, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1504">Well, two days later I had typhoid.</span> <span id="s1505">I – I get all red stains, you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1506">And then I came to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1507">Now I’m jumping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: And we were there, oh, oh, everything, playing and everything.</span> <span id="s1510">Everybody was happy, and I got the dream, and I told boys, you know, something’s going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s1511">Why?</span> <span id="s1512">I had the dream that I’m eating bread and I cannot swallow it.</span> <span id="s1513">Next day amoebic dysentery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: So, it’s sort of like the same dream – dream –</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: The same dream that I cannot swallow the bread.</span> <span id="s1516">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1517">I’m saying it because I cannot explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: But the same dream that I got in the – well, it was awful.</span> <span id="s1520">I was praying to die over there.</span> <span id="s1521">God [indecipherable] that was so painful.</span> <span id="s1522">Because typhus you were mostly unconscious, ma – and this, how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Pneumonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Pneumonia I was mostly unconscious, but over there I was conscious.</span> <span id="s1525">Oh, God, did we suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: At this point, I think we’ll take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Because we’re almost out of Russia, and then when we resume, we’ll talk about how you left Russia specifically, and then what happened to your life after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: So, there was something I wanted to ask you before – before I forget.</span> <span id="s1534">And that was, when your father le – when you last saw your father at the train station in Wilno, in nov –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Nowa Vileka(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Nowa Vileka(ph), and he said to you, never show your tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: You started to relate a story to me later where that came into great value for you, that is, you followed his advice.</span> <span id="s1539">Tell me about that incident, when you were in trouble, and could have gotten into more trouble, and what happened then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Well, my father exactly told me [speaks foreign language] Russia doesn’t show – like tears, never show them you’re afraid, and you’ll be all right.</span> <span id="s1541">And when we were in Ferraba(ph), we di-didn’t have any coal or anything, to heat the house.</span> <span id="s1542">And next to the railroad, there was a lot of coal lying, old coal, you know, but it was par – powder, so it was useless.</span> <span id="s1543">But if you dug in it, you could get pieces of coal.</span> <span id="s1544">So it was very cold, my – my s – my sister was sick.</span> <span id="s1545">We had the little place, you know, where to make fire in the room.</span> <span id="s1546">And I was there, and there was, I think, a Russian woman or a Russian boy and a Mongol woman, I don’t remember how many, you know.</span> <span id="s1547">There were three of us, we were digging, digging, and suddenly, police came, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: The police came, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: – they – they grabbed us.</span> <span id="s1550">So I took the bag from the bottom, and I threw all the coal out on the ground, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1551">And they took us to police station, and in police station they put us against the wall, and stand here.</span> <span id="s1552">And we didn’t know why we had to stand.</span> <span id="s1553">And I was standing, standing, and after the while – they had a sofa there, and magazine – I said, I want to see magazines.</span> <span id="s1554">They said [speaks foreign language], you have dirty hands.</span> <span id="s1555">And I had a little fur coat, you know, from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1556">I clean my hands, and I said, my hands are clean.</span> <span id="s1557">So they gave me a magazine to look.</span> <span id="s1558">I couldn’t read Russian, but I was looking at the pictures, you know.</span> <span id="s1559">And then I told them, well, you know, it’s very uncomfortable standing against the wall and looking at the magazine, I want to sit down.</span> <span id="s1560">And they said, sit down.</span> <span id="s1561">And then came the chief of police, whatever he was, I don’t know what, he was NKVD probably.</span> <span id="s1562">And he started screaming, and he screams at me, where do you live?</span> <span id="s1563">I say białe domy.</span> <span id="s1564">So what do you – just because you live in white houses, you think you can steal?</span> <span id="s1565">I said well, I need heat and I don’t have heat.</span> <span id="s1566">And he started screaming at me like hell.</span> <span id="s1567">And I looked at him and I said [speaks foreign language] I don’t know where my father is, you took my father away.</span> <span id="s1568">We have no food, we have no heat, my sister is sick.</span> <span id="s1569">You took us to Siberia, I don’t know where I am and everything.</span> <span id="s1570">You shoot me!</span> <span id="s1571">And he looked at me like stupid man, and he say, go home.</span> <span id="s1572">And those two went to jail.</span> <span id="s1573">And he told me – and this was what my father told me, don’t show them that you are afraid.</span> <span id="s1574">I told him, that’s – you want to shoot me, shoot me.</span> <span id="s1575">You cannot do anything to me any more.</span> <span id="s1576">Says, go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: And you were how old at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: About 14.</span> <span id="s1579">I told them that and then – nothing.</span> <span id="s1580">And my father always told me – I remember Cuban fiasco, when Khrushchev came with the rockets here, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: And at my desk in research department, I had writers and I – I had Dow Jones tape.</span> <span id="s1583">And that was how we were getting all the news during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Be-Because I needed to read all the time everything, check it, because I was in research.</span> <span id="s1586">And a bunch of Americans, partners came, and they were all millionaires, you know.</span> <span id="s1587">And they were reading there, and what will happen with all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1588">And I was sitting on my desk, you know, I put the – on the leg, and I said, now I saw everything, but I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires afraid of a Russian peasant.</span> <span id="s1589">They walked away like you cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s1590">I told – I told them, I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires scared of a Russian peasant.</span> <span id="s1591">Because Khrushchev was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1592">You know how he got found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1595">He and Eisenhower hit it off very well, Khrushchev and Eisenhower, they were both grandfathers, and si – gri – they were going to go to Paris, and meet in Paris later on, and start talking about breaking up e-everything.</span> <span id="s1596">And the trouble was that Eisenhower gave order to the army not to fly U-2 planes over Russia, because we were flying U-2 planes, you know, over Russia, and Eisenhower ordered to stop before that flight.</span> <span id="s1597">Now, what happened in Russia, I don’t know, but the American army has some excuse to do something in case something happens, and they flew over Russia, and of course the Russians – Eisenhower was told by America that Russians can shoot U-2 any time they want.</span> <span id="s1598">That’s not [indecipherable] they have the rocket, and they shot U-2 with this pilot Power, American Power.</span> <span id="s1599">Now, he was supposed to blow himself up, but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1600">And Eisenhower said, we are not flying over Russia.</span> <span id="s1601">And all of a sudden Russia shows them Power, and they show them U-2 plane.</span> <span id="s1602">And in Russia, they broke off talking, and Khrushchev couldn’t meet with Eisenhower any more.</span> <span id="s1603">And the whole [indecipherable] breakthrough with Russia, with Khrushchev was finished.</span> <span id="s1604">Both by Russian military, because they didn’t want peace, and American military, because they send U-2.</span> <span id="s1605">So, you know, you cannot trust anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: You cannot trust anybody, because the – Kennedy fix the – this, see, but it was very simple.</span> <span id="s1608">He withdrew Russian – American rockets and bombs from Turkey, and Khrushchev withdrew them from this – from Cuba, and everything was settled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1610">Let’s go back to – let’s go back to Fera – Ferraba(ph), is that where you were arrested by this NKVD – oh no, by the police, for stealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: I don’t know whether this was NKVD or police –</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: – but stealing, you know, stealing government coal.</span> <span id="s1614">And that was not coal actually, powder –</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: No, it was just powder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: – but – but they let me go because they noticed that I’m not afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1618">Were you already released by then, or were you still in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: No, we were released already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: You were released already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: We were already released.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: That was after we came from that village, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: And they – and I was released, but you see, you could – thi-this was so important, I think later on, when we were traveling with those 80 Polish soldiers –</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: – and this Polish guy that said that he’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: An officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: – this officer, and he showed them he was not afraid, and they backed down every time, every time, they backed down.</span> <span id="s1630">They never made a friend, you know, something to restrict him, or something.</span> <span id="s1631">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s1632">They load people on the boats to send them on Amu Darya river, he goes and unloads the boats [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: And they – they backed out.</span> <span id="s1635">So it’s a – it’s a very funny psychology of that country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: It is, it is.</span> <span id="s1637">Let’s go further, about you are now – you are now taken.</span> <span id="s1638">Your mother gives you up to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: – army, so that you are then taken separately from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Yeah, because they – they said that they will feed us, you know.</span> <span id="s1642">They were driving raise the children.</span> <span id="s1643">Everywhere, all over the world they were trying to save children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: And we were over there, and they gave us some food, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: And this is this man with the 80 soldiers, I forget his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Oh, I don’t know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: He – he went after that from Ferraba(ph), where we were.</span> <span id="s1650">They didn’t send any more people on the boats, and I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1651">I understand that he was tried later –</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: – for something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: But the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: By the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: No, by the Polish authorities –</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: – for pretending that he’s an officer.</span> <span id="s1660">That’s stupidity.</span> <span id="s1661">You see how stupid people are?</span> <span id="s1662">He was pretending to be an officer, and he wasn’t an officer.</span> <span id="s1663">Supposedly he took some money somewhere.</span> <span id="s1664">Who knows, you know, you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: But it was something.</span> <span id="s1667">But it was lucky that eventually we were taken to Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Okay, so tell me about that ver – that journey.</span> <span id="s1669">After you say goodbye to your mother and your sister and you’re taken by the Polish military –</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yeah, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: – how do you get to Teheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: And eventually they came to us, I was in that village, and I was there [indecipherable] I was with mine boy Puskotski(ph), I remember his name, we were – and they came and they said, if you are not sick, you can go to Teheran.</span> <span id="s1673">Well, I would go anywhere if they told me, you know, just to get –</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: – the hell out from that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: So we went and they send us to bring food supplies, I put –</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: The bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: – bread in my pants, hiding as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1680">And then they put us on the train.</span> <span id="s1681">And we came to ma – Paklevy(ph).</span> <span id="s1682">It took two days to cross Novotsk(ph).</span> <span id="s1683">There was very little water, lines and lines of people to get water, you know.</span> <span id="s1684">And some Polish soldiers are troopers, and they told us, bring some vodka for us.</span> <span id="s1685">But I never went, but they were giving – and the Russians told us, if we catch anybody entering on the ship with Russian money, you go back to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1686">So you know, there were bags filled in, and there were two kinds of rubles.</span> <span id="s1687">There were ordinary rubles and Chervonsa.</span> <span id="s1688">Chervonsa were the money that could use in Iran, actually buy something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: So in other words, it was convertible.</span> <span id="s1690">It was convertible currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Yeah, yeah, it must have been convertible.</span> <span id="s1692">You see, I don’t understand at that time, but I must have had some, because when we came to over there, to Paklevy(ph), they were talking in Russian a lot.</span> <span id="s1693">You know, the Persians knew how to speak Russians, and they were selling varenyye yaytsa, boiled eggs.</span> <span id="s1694">But varenyye to us in Polish it says like crow’s eggs, because those eggs were so small, but they were cooked.</span> <span id="s1695">So we were – I and Puskotski(ph), we were throwing out the whites and we were only eating the yellow one, to plug up for diarrhea, because we were running to the toilet all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s1696">But on that ship when we were, I told you, we were on the front and the whole front of the ship, there were Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1697">And there was no water, and they only gave us herrings to eat [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1698">So we were all day lining with little cups, because there was one faucet by the captain’s, you know, deck, and we were carrying water to those people, it was awful.</span> <span id="s1699">And once we came there, they threw at us, dates.</span> <span id="s1700">Po-Polish soldiers were on [indecipherable] and they came – the ship was too big to go out, and there was a storm.</span> <span id="s1701">So they came – I didn’t want to eat dates ever, you know, after that, because we ate so many dates, we were hungry.</span> <span id="s1702">And then they took us off that ship, and the next day [indecipherable] I don’t remember what happened, they drove us to tur – to Paklevy(ph), and I saw stores with meat, with bread, with everything.</span> <span id="s1703">I was sure it’s propaganda.</span> <span id="s1704">I said, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1705">I wouldn’t – I couldn’t believe that somebody has bread and food and meat in this store.</span> <span id="s1706">We didn’t believe it, you know?</span> <span id="s1707">It’s – you get so brainwashed, you know, it’s so easy.</span> <span id="s1708">And then they shaved us, they cut our hair and I don’t know what the hell they did with us.</span> <span id="s1709">The next day they put us in the trucks and we went south –</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: – toward Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1713">Who is they at this point?</span> <span id="s1714">Was it Polish authorities, was it British authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: I – they were mixed up.</span> <span id="s1716">They were Poles, they were British, they tried to get the lice –</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: – away from us, you know, because from Russia we came with lice, so they were shaving us and everything.</span> <span id="s1719">So everybody looked like no hair or anything.</span> <span id="s1720">I – I fell up.</span> <span id="s1721">We went to [indecipherable] place for one night.</span> <span id="s1722">Next time and next thing was Teheran.</span> <span id="s1723">And over there I was going at night, and I fell down and it was toilets that were overflowing.</span> <span id="s1724">And I was in those Russian quilted suits, you know, I had.</span> <span id="s1725">So stink was unbelievable, and two ladies came to me in Polish, and they say [speaks foreign language] You’re so poor, you know.</span> <span id="s1726">They didn’t know that I was a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: And next day they put us in, and we came to Teheran and I went to that camp.</span> <span id="s1729">And in that camp they took all our clothes away, and the British were [indecipherable] they were burning shoes, wa – everything that he had, blankets.</span> <span id="s1730">And we found with this boy, that in a toilet, there was a fence and there was a hole.</span> <span id="s1731">So we started selling blankets and everything to the peasants, and they were giving us money.</span> <span id="s1732">You know, I don’t know how much, but one Polish officer came and we ask him whether he could go outside of that camp and bring us some fruits.</span> <span id="s1733">And he said, boys, it costs money.</span> <span id="s1734">They say, how much do you want?</span> <span id="s1735">His eyes almost rolled over how much.</span> <span id="s1736">But then I had that stupid dream again, with the bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: The next day I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1739">Of course, I don’t know what happened to my money.</span> <span id="s1740">Nobody knew what my name was, and how long I was in the hospital, I don’t know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Did you have any documents at all?</span> <span id="s1742">Any papers with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1744">We – from Russia we came with absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1745">Some people had some papers, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1746">I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1747">Because, you see, in Wilno, Nowa Vileka(ph), they took all our documents, so whatever we had Polish, and they confiscated.</span> <span id="s1748">When we came to Siber-Siberia over there, they started screaming at us [speaks foreign language], where are you documents, and you – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: You lying and everything, and the NKVD wanted our documents, and we said, you took it all in Poland already.</span> <span id="s1751">We don’t have any documents.</span> <span id="s1752">And I remember how they were cursing [indecipherable] how much, you know.</span> <span id="s1753">You understand it, you know.</span> <span id="s1754">Th-They curse something awful, fuck you God’s mother and things like this, you know.</span> <span id="s1755">And this – there was a Polish guy with us, and he started cursing at those Russians the same way.</span> <span id="s1756">And they say [speaks foreign language] Friend, why are you cursing?</span> <span id="s1757">And they made him an accountant in the village.</span> <span id="s1758">You see the result?</span> <span id="s1759">[foreign language] Th-Th-Th-They’re peculiar people.</span> <span id="s1760">A-A-And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: So – and – but then how – when you were released, didn’t you get any kind of documents –</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1763">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: – being released?</span> <span id="s1765">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1767">Nobody gave us anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s1768">It was – it – when we came to Karachi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: – we – I went to American consulate, and over there we made something like birthdays –</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: – you know, we had the birth certificate, and we applied for visa to come to America, in Karachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: So that means in Karachi you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: A-And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: – you – you – you gave information so that you could get a birth certificate issued?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: To American you know how tall it is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: – my mother took us.</span> <span id="s1779">My – you see the – we had a different situation because my mother could communicate with anybody, you know?</span> <span id="s1780">So she could communicate with the English, she could communicate with French, she could talk Lady [indecipherable] the governor’s wife over there in the province.</span> <span id="s1781">She was making Polish bibles for us, I still have them, over there.</span> <span id="s1782">And my sister was correcting, because the Indian was setting the thing for printing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: The type, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: And she she used to invite us, you know.</span> <span id="s1785">Well, my God, it was palaces where the British live, like governor.</span> <span id="s1786">In the desert, she had garments and beautiful things and servant.</span> <span id="s1787">The British live like kings, you know.</span> <span id="s1788">But that’s why, of the English language, that’s why my mother asked the British to put me in English school, and they send me to Ca-Catholic school in Karachi, and I was studying over there right away, starting to learn English.</span> <span id="s1789">So, and late –</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: But we’re – we’re getting ahead of our story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: We’re getting a little ahead of our story.</span> <span id="s1793">Let’s go back to Parlevy(ph), I believe you said it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Paklevy(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Paklevy(ph), and then you got si – you had the dream, and then you got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Well, we were – we were by – by – oh my God, if I tell you, traveling in Iran in those mountains, my cousin told me that when they were traveling through those mountains from Paklevy(ph) to Teheran, they closed all the windows somewhere, because people were afraid.</span> <span id="s1797">You are way, way up on the mountain.</span> <span id="s1798">You look straight down and you see buses and trucks and everything, destroyed, lying, cars that fell down.</span> <span id="s1799">Nobody bothered to fix it even.</span> <span id="s1800">You know, nobody looked for it.</span> <span id="s1801">It was a scary like hell.</span> <span id="s1802">And you know, Persians used to smoke hashish or something, too, and they were driving with their legs often, and when they were coming to a turn, they didn’t slow down, but they used to blow the horn.</span> <span id="s1803">So it was a harrowing experience, you were scared like hell going with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: So you were going on a bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: No, it was a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: No, on a truck, it was a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: A truck.</span> <span id="s1808">Yeah, but what you saw, you know, everything down there, it was military trucks, what Persians were driving them.</span> <span id="s1809">It was – and sometimes you stopped somewhere, and there would be a place, like a coffee place, and they had donkeys walking, and beautiful carpets lying, and this – donkeys over there, and the horses over there, and [indecipherable] walking everything.</span> <span id="s1810">But beautiful Persian rugs, you know, lying over there.</span> <span id="s1811">And you could have tea, you know, and everything, if you wanted something.</span> <span id="s1812">Of course, most of us didn’t have any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Well, so was this after you got better?</span> <span id="s1814">I mean, you – when you – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: No, no, this was on the way – on the way to Teheran.</span> <span id="s1816">In Teheran in two days –</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Is when you tried –</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: – I came down with typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: With that thing, I don’t know how long I was there, and nobody knew who I was, and I think when I became conscious, I saw that some boys are getting some money.</span> <span id="s1821">So I asked them, what was it?</span> <span id="s1822">They said, we joined the Polish [indecipherable] there was like army school</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: – [indecipherable] that’s for children.</span> <span id="s1825">So I told them I joined it too, so they started giving me – I don’t know what it was, some peanuts, you know?</span> <span id="s1826">And they didn’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s1827">So they loaded me with the – with some boys, and they said, you going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1828">But they didn’t know my name, and my mother, when she came, she couldn’t find me anywhere when she came over there.</span> <span id="s1829">And it was very nice, we were driving – this road wasn’t so bad, going that way.</span> <span id="s1830">The only thing, the minute we left Iran, we came to desert already, and Polish army surrounded us, guards around us, and they said, boys, you don’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1831">Two of you were already kidnapped by the people over here.</span> <span id="s1832">So you – you don’t go anywhere, just stay over there, because it’s a very dangerous place.</span> <span id="s1833">That was Iraq.</span> <span id="s1834">And he told us, you don’t move anywhere, we are going to be guarded by soldiers.</span> <span id="s1835">And they guarded us like hell til they brought us to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1837">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: We went through Baghdad, I remember, and then we came to Palestine and in Palestine the Jews were throwing apples and grape – not apples, but oranges, grapefruits at us and everything.</span> <span id="s1839">And they spoke Polish everywhere, and they brought us to Bashkeet(ph) the camp, where was for the boys.</span> <span id="s1840">And we were in that Bashkeet(ph), they had the school over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: What was the name of the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Bashkeet(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Bashkeet(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: It’s right next to Gedera.</span> <span id="s1845">Gedera is a – a town that is on the map –</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: – i-in Israel.</span> <span id="s1848">It was right to Gedera.</span> <span id="s1849">And there, there were several hills we had.</span> <span id="s1850">And one hill – on each hill the British built already this how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1851">Showers and things like this.</span> <span id="s1852">And over there felt that there was a Arab village.</span> <span id="s1853">And we were ordered with a stick to guard that property, so nobody can come there.</span> <span id="s1854">And they were standing there, and we’re standing at – one boy was standing guard over there, and couple of Arabs were coming on a donkey, and he tried to stop them with a bamboo stick.</span> <span id="s1855">Well, they stabbed him, and the next boy that was, he saw it, so he screamed.</span> <span id="s1856">So it went – my God, there were about 1200, I think, of us, because they used to say that it is the battalion [indecipherable] 1,200.</span> <span id="s1857">And we all grabbed stones and we started running towards the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1858">And from the Arab village, Arabs started running.</span> <span id="s1859">And – but the camp commander called Gedera, and from Gedera came tanketki, you know, the open tanks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: – with machine guns, and across the desert we saw the Polish soldiers going like hell at those Arabs, a day’s run back to their village right away.</span> <span id="s1862">Otherwise, probably a lot of us would have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s1863">But it was dangerous, it was a dangerous place.</span> <span id="s1864">You had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1865">There were some – so finally Arab boys used to come and feel your pockets.</span> <span id="s1866">And if you were going somewhere on the finger, the truck would slow down and you grab, and you had to jump in the truck.</span> <span id="s1867">So while you were jumping, once you hold the truck, you couldn’t let go, because you would fall down, and they emptied your pockets, steal everything.</span> <span id="s1868">But o-over there it was nice because everybody s-spoke Polish, you know, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1869">But one time in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: What was the purpose of this camp, and what were the kinds of activities you did there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Oh, we – well, school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: And we had wonderful professors, because the schools mostly were Polish university professors from Poland that were deported to Russia and instead of putting them in the army regular, they brought them to that school.</span> <span id="s1874">Because there was first grade, second, third, fourth, you know.</span> <span id="s1875">It was gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: But here’s a question I’ve got; tell me if I’m wrong in this, my assumption, from what I had read, is that when Sikorski made this agreement with Stalin in 1941, that the deportees from Poland, who had been deported both from Poland in 1940, and from the Wilno region, which was then Lithuania in 1941, were released.</span> <span id="s1877">And so Polish deportees across the Soviet Union, and throughout all of the gulags, were now free.</span> <span id="s1878">However, only those who could have military activity, that is, those who were young men who were fit to fight, would be allowed to leave the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Oh no, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: So that is women and children could leave as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Women and children, everybody could leave Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Everybody was allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s1884">This was thing, but then when Katyn murder came in, nobody could leave already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1886">So, until the – until the Germans unearthed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Unearthed that Katyn –</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Katyn –</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: – and they announce it, America, and England said it was done by the Germans, and Stalin [indecipherable] the exploitation, and he had Polish Jewish fellow who was a general, what was his – and he formed communist army in Poland, and that was another army over there.</span> <span id="s1890">And they went all the way to Berlin, too, with Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: They organized Polish soldiers, and they put them into that army.</span> <span id="s1893">Wha-What was called?</span> <span id="s1894">Ziemirski(ph) I think was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: So then he’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: – but he – he was a communist, that fellow.</span> <span id="s1897">They knew that he was, but he was a general in Polish army, and he commanded that army, and he got Poles into Battle of Lenino, and Poles were slaughtered by the Germans over there.</span> <span id="s1898">But they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: The Battle of Lenino?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Lenino, somewhere in Russia, and a lot of Poles were slaughtered, but they went all the way to Berlin, because I have seen pictures from Poland, of Polish, with Polish flag on bra – on Brandenburg back gate, Polish flags were hanging over there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Well, so this – what did you say his name was?</span> <span id="s1902">Zhir – general –</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: Wait, wait, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1904">You see, this is something.</span> <span id="s1905">Ziemirski(ph), I think, Ziemirski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Ziemirski(ph).</span> <span id="s1907">So that means that if you had been a deportee to the Soviet Union, and then you are released, and you didn’t make it out of the Soviet Union before the news about Katyn broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: So you are still released from the gulags, but on this case –</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Oh, it was very tricky.</span> <span id="s1911">Let me tell you what happened, because I met some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: – people, I cannot talk about.</span> <span id="s1914">But I know of the people who I knew.</span> <span id="s1915">The Russians told them, either you take Russian citizenship, or we send you back to gulag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: You see, after it, they were already released, they said [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1918">So the people who took Russian passports were later not allowed to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1919">They didn’t want them to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1920">It was very difficult, and the rest – and they put a lot into the army.</span> <span id="s1921">The people were willing to go into Polish army, soldiers, of course, you know, because they prefer that then something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: So, in other words, they could have been – this is what I was getting to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Yeah, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Some of these could have gone into that General Ziemirski’s army who had come from the gulags themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1929">There was – let’s say you’re a Polish deportee, like you were from Wilno or – or some other region of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact area, and you’re released in 1941, or the news comes in 1941 that you can be released.</span> <span id="s1930">You are released, and then with the German advances, the Katyn massacre is discovered, and the border closes to Iran and you no longer can go –</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: No, Stalin said no more.</span> <span id="s1932">He – he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Stalin says no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: – broke off relation with Polish government in London right away, Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Because the Poles said, you did it.</span> <span id="s1937">There were Americans brought, the Germans shot them, they knew it, but the Americans were petrified of losing Russia, because they were – they did the – 90 percent of fighting with the Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: – you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: So here’s – so here’s my question; if you were then free, but no longer in the gulags, as a former deportee, and you’re a Polish citizen, you then have the option of joining this new Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: And so it could be that – that many former gulag prisoners were in that army.</span> <span id="s1943">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s1945">From what I understand, Poland had the fifth largest army during the second World War.</span> <span id="s1946">What was under rations, and what was in England.</span> <span id="s1947">In England were about 200,000 Poles.</span> <span id="s1948">Pilots with parachute troops, tanks and everything, under British command.</span> <span id="s1949">And then there was another part of the army over on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1950">So the Poles fought everywhere.</span> <span id="s1951">They were bleeding like crazy for – for [indecipherable] for yours and for ours, what turned out it was for yours only, not for ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1953">So – okay.</span> <span id="s1954">How is it that your mother made it out, and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: They must have left – I left very early, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: – and – and they were a little later, because they eventually came to that place where I was in Guzari(ph), and from there, they went to Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: In Teheran, my mother spoke English, so she was interpreter, and then there was governor of southeastern Iran, came over to Polish embassy, and he said, I want to westernize my house.</span> <span id="s1960">Can you give me somebody who speaks French and English and try to [indecipherable] westernize my home, because his wife spoke only English.</span> <span id="s1961">And my mother was sent there.</span> <span id="s1962">She said, she gets in a car, he bought them beautiful suits and everything, you know, employed them.</span> <span id="s1963">And they get in the car, and there are machine guns lying, and everything, there are two cars.</span> <span id="s1964">You know, my mother said, what is this?</span> <span id="s1965">Why, we’re going through the mountains, there are bandits over there.</span> <span id="s1966">So my mother says, well what – what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1967">What happens?</span> <span id="s1968">Well, whoever shoots better, wins.</span> <span id="s1969">If they shoot at us, we will shoot back at them.</span> <span id="s1970">And this was traveling to Teheran through the mountains.</span> <span id="s1971">And eventually they went to Zahedan, and they were there in Zahedan, and there was there a Persian general Kava(ph) Kavushek(ph), who spoke very well Russian.</span> <span id="s1972">And they helped them, you know, eventually to go back.</span> <span id="s1973">My mother said it was impossible to do.</span> <span id="s1974">He was giving one direction, she was giving another direction.</span> <span id="s1975">They have a dinner ready, she goes and she prays Muslim prayers for two hours, they cannot serve it.</span> <span id="s1976">My mother said they – she gave up, and she went back to Teheran.</span> <span id="s1977">And in Teheran she was working all the time, taking transports to southern pers – t-to southern Persia, you know, to go to Africa, or to Australia or somewhere.</span> <span id="s1978">And they were busy all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: And you, in the meanwhile were in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: I was in Palestine and I was writing letters to all the camps that I hear that Polish people are.</span> <span id="s1981">And my mother was writing letters, and we hit.</span> <span id="s1982">I got a letter, and my – and my mother’s let – and my letter came to my mother.</span> <span id="s1983">And in school they knew who I was already, because the name, and she was writing for Stanislav Kiersnowski, and I got a letter and I found out that my mother and my sister is alive, that they are in Teheran.</span> <span id="s1984">That took a long time, I cannot tell you how long it was, and then my mother wrote to the camp commander a letter, telling him that my father died in Russia.</span> <span id="s1985">She didn’t write it to me.</span> <span id="s1986">And that letter – censor was – mixed up the letters, sent a letter to me, one to the camp commander.</span> <span id="s1987">And the letter with the – my father’s death came to me in the letter, because all the letter was censored during the war.</span> <span id="s1988">So somehow the letters got transferred, and then I found out my father is dead.</span> <span id="s1989">I knew very little, you know.</span> <span id="s1990">I came to a company commander.</span> <span id="s1991">I even have his picture here, in the – in the company where I was, because it was – you know, but this was for boys.</span> <span id="s1992">And I told him that my father died, and he said, I was with your father, my God [indecipherable] I don’t know whether you know any Polish [indecipherable] you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: [indecipherable] was like very happy fellow.</span> <span id="s1995">He says, you know, your father kept us all alive because he kept singing all the time.</span> <span id="s1996">He was joking all the time, and he said, one trouble was – and this is sad for me to tell.</span> <span id="s1997">There was – first a Russian commander was in that camp.</span> <span id="s1998">They told me – everybody told me that my father had no hand, so he couldn’t work, so they made him a night watchman.</span> <span id="s1999">And a Jewish man came to be the camp commander, and he was the son of a bitch, he removed my father from rations, from food.</span> <span id="s2000">He said [speaks foreign language], you don’t work, you don’t eat.</span> <span id="s2001">So my father was living on what other soldiers were bringing him, pieces of potatoes, pieces of bread, and things like this.</span> <span id="s2002">And my father was always saying that in life you can’t deny two things; that you’ll be in jail, and you di – you will be a beggar.</span> <span id="s2003">And he was like a beggar at the end.</span> <span id="s2004">But they said that he used to sing so beautifully.</span> <span id="s2005">He kept our spirits up, your father.</span> <span id="s2006">And here was, you know, the com-company commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: So tell me, how was it that he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: What age – how did he die?</span> <span id="s2010">What – what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: I don’t know whether he died of typhus, or – or whether he got poisoned, because he vrai – if he ate mutton meat, he would have been dead if they didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Okay, cause he was allergic to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Because he used to stiffen up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: He used to completely –</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: He couldn’t eat lamb.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: He couldn’t eat lamb, he was so allergic to it, that – and he died, so th – in papers it’s written that he had typhus, you know, but they said that he died very fast.</span> <span id="s2018">When you think of all of these – all the things it could have been, and turned out opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: And then when we found about Teheran and everything, oh my God, the conferences.</span> <span id="s2021">When no Polish people wanted to believe my mother about, because Polish people didn’t know about Teheran conference, what was in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: So how did your mother know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Well, she – she went in there, and spoke English, and American intelligence officer in that hotel came to my mother, where are you going after the war?</span> <span id="s2024">And my mother said well, I hope we are going return to Poland.</span> <span id="s2025">He says, you can’t.</span> <span id="s2026">Stalin a-and [indecipherable] just made a deal, Poland goes to Russia.</span> <span id="s2027">So better go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2028">And so we told all the Polish people what’s going on, none of them wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s2029">But it from – my mother got it from an officer.</span> <span id="s2030">I told you that the difference was that she knew languages, she could contact people.</span> <span id="s2031">I remember when she came in Karachi she said she came to the camp, and she went to see the camp commander, and he was sitting with his legs on the table, and my mother walked in.</span> <span id="s2032">When I walk in a room, please take your feet down and put them on the floor, she told the British camp commander.</span> <span id="s2033">And she had guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: She had guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: From then on, he was so polite, and he right away knew that he has to do something else with her other thing.</span> <span id="s2036">But you couldn’t do much with the Polish people, because they were all talking about democracy.</span> <span id="s2037">There was an old woman, friend of ours, and we had only a bench, a table and a bed, you know.</span> <span id="s2038">And she – my mother went to ask him for a chair for her, easy chair, you know, to sit down.</span> <span id="s2039">Well, he got my – for that woman Parneechee(ph) Lesker(ph), a easy chair.</span> <span id="s2040">My God, there was almost a riot in the camp by Polish people.</span> <span id="s2041">What is this?</span> <span id="s2042">What is this?</span> <span id="s2043">We’re a democracy and you give somebody an easy chair to sit.</span> <span id="s2044">They were jealous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: And they were so jealous when we were traveling first class wherever we were going, when – on the ship, you know, because of being an interpreter.</span> <span id="s2047">And then when we were coming in to India, when we were, there was a horseman, British Indian colonel.</span> <span id="s2048">And my mother ask him why do you serve in British army?</span> <span id="s2049">And he says, well, we have to learn how to fight.</span> <span id="s2050">Otherwise, the British never get out from India.</span> <span id="s2051">He says, we are going to war to learn how to fight.</span> <span id="s2052">Ah, that was something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: So, okay.</span> <span id="s2054">Let’s go back then and try a little bit chronologically.</span> <span id="s2055">You’re in the camp, and you learn of your father’s death through this misdirected letter that didn’t get to the camp commandant.</span> <span id="s2056">And your mother finds out where you were.</span> <span id="s2057">How do you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Well, my mother knew General Anders(ph), the commander of Polish troops in the Middle East, because he used to come to Rudakow(ph) when she was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: And for practice over there on – on the – on the farming, you know, they had this huge farm and he came there twice.</span> <span id="s2061">So my mother wrote a letter to him, whether it’s better to leave me in this military school, high school in Palestine, or to go to civilian life.</span> <span id="s2062">And he never answer my mother, but the order came from him, to put me on medical commission, discharge me and send me to Teheran.</span> <span id="s2063">So they discharged me and they send me to Teheran.</span> <span id="s2064">And I came, and finally I met my mother, and I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2065">I was so shocked, because when I was in Russia, I was like this, and I looked at my mother and my sister like this.</span> <span id="s2066">And I came back from Palestine, I look, here’s my mother and here’s my sister.</span> <span id="s2067">I grew up so much.</span> <span id="s2068">I was so shaken up, because my mother wasn’t big, and my sister wasn’t big, and I remember them so much bigger than I. And with all this to think, you know, what was it, about two year, a year and a half period, I grew up so much.</span> <span id="s2069">I was so shocked when I saw that my mother is so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: So it had been about a year and a half since you had seen her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Yeah, year and a half or two years.</span> <span id="s2072">I cannot really tell you exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: I’m mixed up with the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s2076">That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s2078">And then – and then once we came to India, when I went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: So when you – hang on.</span> <span id="s2080">You’re in Teheran then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: And what was your next move and where did you go with – with everybody, that is, your mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Well, the next move was to Karachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: To India, to – you see, America wouldn’t take any Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Mexico took some Polish children, and the British send the people who were coming, they send them to Australia, they send them to New Zealand.</span> <span id="s2088">They send them some to Canada when – even Mexico took some, but America didn’t take one person.</span> <span id="s2089">It’s the same thing they did to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2090">Jews came out, right, one ship went to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: The Saint Louis, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: One ship went to this Dominican Republic and the other one came back to there, and they were all killed over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Yeah, that’s the Saint Louis, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: You know that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2096">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: So the – so the same was to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: America won’t let him.</span> <span id="s2100">Quota number you had to get.</span> <span id="s2101">So we applied in quota number – it was in ’43, I think – and we applied in Karachi for quota number for America, and I went to school in Karachi and started learning English.</span> <span id="s2102">I had a wonderful time in Karachi.</span> <span id="s2103">I met British fellows, and there was American Red Cross and American police, and they used to give me magazines, and I used to sell magazines to Indian storekeepers, you know, and they – I always get money, I could rent a bicycle for myself, and I used to go and eat over there.</span> <span id="s2104">And the American soldiers were nice, you know.</span> <span id="s2105">I tell you, over there, there was a very unpleasant experience that stays with me to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: And what’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Outside of that Red Cross over there, a group of American officers were standing, and there was an Indian fellow telling them fortune, and he says, well, your wife is called – I will write it for you, I cannot pronounce it.</span> <span id="s2108">And he would write the name of the wife.</span> <span id="s2109">You know, he never knew the soldiers, it was amazing.</span> <span id="s2110">And then you know, he was telling them how their children are and everything, this Indian fellow.</span> <span id="s2111">And then one soldier, officer said, please tell me my fortune.</span> <span id="s2112">And he said, I won’t talk to you.</span> <span id="s2113">And he says, talk to me, tell me.</span> <span id="s2114">He says, no, I won’t talk to you.</span> <span id="s2115">Don’t ask me anything.</span> <span id="s2116">Please don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s2117">Just leave me alone.</span> <span id="s2118">And this American said please.</span> <span id="s2119">Another soldier said, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s2120">Tell him.</span> <span id="s2121">Well, he said, are you going to Burma tomorrow?</span> <span id="s2122">Yes.</span> <span id="s2123">And you will be killed the next day.</span> <span id="s2124">He was a pilot.</span> <span id="s2125">He says, you are a pilot and you will be killed the next day.</span> <span id="s2126">You want to know, I’ll tell you now.</span> <span id="s2127">Can you imagine how that man felt?</span> <span id="s2128">And this I remember to this day, this Indian fellow said, I don’t want to tell you – and he says, all of a sudden, are you going to Burma today?</span> <span id="s2129">He says yeah.</span> <span id="s2130">He says, tomorrow you will be killed, as a pilot.</span> <span id="s2131">And to – it – it was so shocking to me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: It must have been.</span> <span id="s2133">It must have –</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: We were be – we were being warned in India never to be bad to a beggar, never to mistreat somebody on the street, because they can curse you, and nobody can help you.</span> <span id="s2135">And they were warning us, be very careful in India.</span> <span id="s2136">Don’t – don’t ever a-annoy people in any way.</span> <span id="s2137">He may be a beggar for you, but they have powers.</span> <span id="s2138">I don’t know, th-they said it, you know, yogi, and everything that they do.</span> <span id="s2139">I saw a yogi buried in – in a grave, the next day they have to wake him up, he didn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s2140">There were two doctors, American and British checking him, and they pronounced him dead.</span> <span id="s2141">His heartbeat was so slow that they couldn’t detect it.</span> <span id="s2142">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2144">And did he wake up the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2146">They dug out him from there.</span> <span id="s2147">He was in a coffin, put in a grave, and next day they open up, and there was a man who has to wake him up.</span> <span id="s2148">I’ll tell you, he was amazing.</span> <span id="s2149">He took an umbrella and on every stick of umbrella that comes out, there was a different color ball.</span> <span id="s2150">And they were spinning it like this, so you know all the balls went flying.</span> <span id="s2151">And they say, which ball do you want to shoot?</span> <span id="s2152">And he took [indecipherable] and a ball.</span> <span id="s2153">And you said the red one, and the red ball would be shot off, in that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2154">It’s amazing – amazing concentration that those people had.</span> <span id="s2155">They had the stick, metal stick put on a table, and his eyes were tight in this case, and they spun it around and they hit the metal piece, you know, tha – tha – and it was vibrating.</span> <span id="s2156">And he turned around and he aimed the arrow and he hit it.</span> <span id="s2157">Just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: It’s just like a to-totally different world that you ended up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2160">It’s a different one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: So, in Karachi, you ended u – you started going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: And this was what kind of a school?</span> <span id="s2164">This was an English school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: This was Franciscan fathers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: They were mostly Belgian.</span> <span id="s2168">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s2169">They were fantastic priests, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s2170">They had trouble with us, because we couldn’t communicate with them.</span> <span id="s2171">But thank God they had [indecipherable] they had a Russian Cossack who spoke French, and he was teaching French.</span> <span id="s2172">He ran away after Russian revolution to Burma, and then he crossed to India.</span> <span id="s2173">And there quite a number of Russians living in Karachi from that time, from the revolution time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Revolution time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: That ran away, and they were living there.</span> <span id="s2176">And we met him, and this professor, he – when we had trouble, we communicated through him to tell the school, and the school would – told him what to tell us.</span> <span id="s2177">[indecipherable] we called him.</span> <span id="s2178">And he used to take us to Muslim restaurants.</span> <span id="s2179">We couldn’t go to a Muslim restaurant in – there were Indian restaurants, and there were Chinese, a lot of Chinese restaurants were all over the place.</span> <span id="s2180">And Muslim, he knew Muslims, and we – he took us couple of times to fantastic restaurants, and they were Mu-Muslim restaurants, but I wouldn’t be able to go without him, but he was friend with those Muslims, so they let us in, they didn’t want us otherwise come in there.</span> <span id="s2181">This –</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: So what was your – what was your mother doing, and what was your sister doing during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Well, can I go back a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: My cousin found out that we were in Russia from my cousin who went from Wilno to America through Japan and everything and he came to [indecipherable] he told them that we were deported to Russia.</span> <span id="s2186">And then we found through mail – we didn’t have her address, how we found her, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2187">And [indecipherable] went to Madera(ph) school in – for very rich girls in America.</span> <span id="s2188">She was in orphanage in America, my cousin, and a very rich man, Uncle [indecipherable] his house was next to Edison in Llewellyn Park.</span> <span id="s2189">There is a park, completely fenced in, you cannot go in there.</span> <span id="s2190">And – and he had a daughter, there was something wrong, and he wanted a girl, and she was a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s2191">So he took her as a companion for his daughter, and she went to school.</span> <span id="s2192">And then she, when she finished that school, she wa – finished Pratt Institute, and she was making bed jackets.</span> <span id="s2193">And she met one of the girls walking on the street from that school, from Madera(ph) school.</span> <span id="s2194">And she says where’s your husband?</span> <span id="s2195">Her husband was Polish, Kawalski(ph).</span> <span id="s2196">And he said, in Karachi.</span> <span id="s2197">Oh my God, I’ve got family in Karachi.</span> <span id="s2198">What does he do?</span> <span id="s2199">He’s in charge of all the offices, restaurants and everything in Far East.</span> <span id="s2200">So, he came to our camp, and he took my sister, and he ask him to be a cashier, her, in American military camp.</span> <span id="s2201">And they were paying her, and they took my mother to where they were repairing planes.</span> <span id="s2202">They were bringing a lot of planes from Burma.</span> <span id="s2203">They also were assembling planes and sending them to Russia.</span> <span id="s2204">Russia used to fly to Himalaya to pick up the planes.</span> <span id="s2205">And the hangars, would you know – would you want – guess what the hangars were, they were tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: [indecipherable] by the Germans for zeppelin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s2209">Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s2210">In Karachi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: In Karachi.</span> <span id="s2212">There were two [indecipherable] those hangars.</span> <span id="s2213">And my mother working in the secret section, everything was secret.</span> <span id="s2214">And she says, those dumb Americans.</span> <span id="s2215">I come in the morning, all the papers from the drawers are lying all over the floor, top secret papers, everything’s lying on the floor, everybody can look at it.</span> <span id="s2216">They are very messy, you know, they – they – you know, you – you – you – you’d think they wouldn’t do something, that’s why my cousin, who fought in Italy, Monte Cassino and everything, he said they were petrified of Americans, of friendly fire.</span> <span id="s2217">They constantly were bombing, because his outfit was hit.</span> <span id="s2218">He had the side blown up, he was six months in Italy in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2219">He said only two fellows from his outfit survive American bombing.</span> <span id="s2220">Instead of bombing Germans, they were bombing Polish position.</span> <span id="s2221">And, you know, everybody was afraid of friendly fire, he said, next to Americans.</span> <span id="s2222">They’re irresponsible.</span> <span id="s2223">I remember on the day I was drafted into the army, they gave us rifles.</span> <span id="s2224">And you know, you don’t pull the trigger in the rifle, you don’t fool around.</span> <span id="s2225">American soldiers were running, poof, poof, poof, playing cowboys, pointing at each other and pulling the triggers.</span> <span id="s2226">And you know, every now and then a bullet came out, and – and guys were being killed.</span> <span id="s2227">They were like children.</span> <span id="s2228">I was petrified.</span> <span id="s2229">I was petrified wa – we had barrack and the rifles were all at night put in in line and there was a chain pulled.</span> <span id="s2230">And you know, somebody didn’t take a bullet out.</span> <span id="s2231">And one guy was pulling every trigger and shooting off.</span> <span id="s2232">Upstairs, thank God, the fellow wasn’t in bed because it went through his bed and through his pillow, the bullet went.</span> <span id="s2233">And idiot was pulling triggers, he thought it was a game.</span> <span id="s2234">They were very –</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: So this i – this is when you were drafted in for – in the U.S. Army for the Korean War?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: Yeah, the Korean War.</span> <span id="s2237">There were – you were very – and the American soldiers, when we were going to Korea, they were all crying.</span> <span id="s2238">I said, what are you crying for?</span> <span id="s2239">Oh, we’ll be all dead.</span> <span id="s2240">There was no morale at all, you know?</span> <span id="s2241">They were all crying and I remember in Korea when we went, they put us into a barrack made from cans, you know, and barbed wire around, and it stunk like hell because Koreans were hanging octopus and everything to dry on the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s2242">So thank God I had some other cologne, so I used to put on that cologne when I had to walk over there.</span> <span id="s2243">But at night it was the funniest thing, we are talking, and there was a black guy who just came back from Japan.</span> <span id="s2244">And you see gunpowder in his face, you know.</span> <span id="s2245">And he said, man, I’m telling you – this black guy says – man, we were sure dying, white fellows and black fellows.</span> <span id="s2246">We were all dying like brothers, I’m telling you, man, we were all dying.</span> <span id="s2247">And those guys probably were shitting in their pants because they just came from America.</span> <span id="s2248">And then somebody walked in and he – he says something, and somebody says, you from Texas?</span> <span id="s2249">Yeah, oh.</span> <span id="s2250">And they met, you know, and they were already happy that two guys met from Texas.</span> <span id="s2251">But it was very depressing, you know, because those soldiers, they were – they – they were not prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: They were frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: When you saw – they were all 18 - 19 year old boys – when you saw Turkish army, they were all 40 or 30 year.</span> <span id="s2254">You saw English soldiers, they were all 30 - 40 something.</span> <span id="s2255">You t – you had from Abyssinia soldiers, you did [indecipherable] over there, they all wanted to die, because they swore to [indecipherable] you know, the king that they would die.</span> <span id="s2256">But you saw all those professional armies, but American army was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: A draft army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: – y-young boys, you know, from the draft.</span> <span id="s2259">And I was in 1500 division in basic training, and we had to do everything on the run, because the general that run, he lost a division because they couldn’t run from the Chinese.</span> <span id="s2260">He said, I’ll train our – my division there couldn’t run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: You mean from the Chinese, or from the North Koreans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: From the Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Because you know, the Chinese came, the Chinese then came, it was in the war, they were volunteers from China, the Chinese that came, and that’s how I wound up in Korea, because the first pilots over there were all Russian, in Korea.</span> <span id="s2265">And then they put Chinese, but they requested 34 interpreters in China of – to Japan, because they thought Russia was going into the war over there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: [phone ringing] I see, let’s break for – for the tel – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: – that reporter –</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: – went to Karachi, and he was Jewish, and he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Yes, Daniel Pearl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: And over – over here, they made a big noise over here.</span> <span id="s2272">Well, what the hell was he doing there?</span> <span id="s2273">You don’t go to Karachi and walk in a – in a town, because you’ll get killed for sure, or they’ll throw a night – night pot on you in the morning, on your head.</span> <span id="s2274">You know, they used to live in the – those apartment houses, right, and you better walk close to the street, because they will – you know what I mean by night pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: They were throwing everything out the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Let’s go back to Karachi now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: So your mother is working for the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Your sister is working for –</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Americans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: – a gentleman, American named Kawalski(ph) in – in his restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Yeah, in – in those restaurants, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: And as an a – as a cashier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Cashier.</span> <span id="s2287">Well, she could make so much money, you cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s2288">But we were honest, you know, and he ask, please, be honest.</span> <span id="s2289">Because you can steal there.</span> <span id="s2290">We don’t want that for some Indian working or something.</span> <span id="s2291">Because officers were coming from all over the world.</span> <span id="s2292">One would fly in from Africa, another one from England.</span> <span id="s2293">They were pilots all.</span> <span id="s2294">These were coming from Burma.</span> <span id="s2295">And everybody has different money.</span> <span id="s2296">And they came to restaurant to eat, and they had to pay, and they were giving her different money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Different currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: So she was getting dollars for the ones that were coming from America.</span> <span id="s2299">So she could put in place of the dollars, the rupees and go and get three times for the same price for that money, for the dollars, in town, you know, on black market.</span> <span id="s2300">They ask me, and my sister said there was so much going over there.</span> <span id="s2301">They burn my sister, she was so mad they didn’t pay for the clothes.</span> <span id="s2302">They were washing the floor with kerosene or something, and it set fire, and she had her clothes burned, everything.</span> <span id="s2303">Americans never paid her.</span> <span id="s2304">And she burned her shoes, she says she ran away.</span> <span id="s2305">And the worst experience that she had was when an American soldier – she was extremely popular, you know – she was going out with everybody.</span> <span id="s2306">They only wanted to go with the white girl, you know, to restaurant.</span> <span id="s2307">And one day they told her that a soldier is coming, and – which will be awful, please don’t get scared.</span> <span id="s2308">He was in Burma and they burned his face in – in a plane –</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: – it was completely burned.</span> <span id="s2311">And my sister said, I steel myself.</span> <span id="s2312">And he walked in, eye – eyes gone, you know, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: – burned, lips gone, awful.</span> <span id="s2315">All face burned completely.</span> <span id="s2316">He was going back to States.</span> <span id="s2317">And my sister, like nothing, you know, took the money from him, and everything, and ask him, would you like to go with me to town tonight?</span> <span id="s2318">And he said, yes, okay, you have a date.</span> <span id="s2319">We’re going to Karachi for to – for tonight.</span> <span id="s2320">So you know, i-it was something to cheer him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: She said, would you like to have a date with me tonight?</span> <span id="s2323">And she was very pretty at the time.</span> <span id="s2324">And she went with him, you know, just to cheer him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: So each of you had – said – had enormous experiences and adventures in Karachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: When we came in Karachi – oh, I can go to school [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: We came there sometimes in ’43, I think, or 40 – ’43 or ’44.</span> <span id="s2331">And then ’45, I went to school in Bombay.</span> <span id="s2332">So it must be around ’43 - ’44 and then I went to school still in three months in English school.</span> <span id="s2333">That was beautiful, but grades were very bad and people didn’t teach properly.</span> <span id="s2334">I took advantage of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: Well, that was Anglican church school.</span> <span id="s2337">And in India if you were Catholic, and you were sent to Anglican school, the people who send you were excommunicated.</span> <span id="s2338">And they send me to that school, and I came over and it was eighth grade.</span> <span id="s2339">But I only was three months, and I passed exams for three grades, for ei-eighth grade, you see, because I – I went from seven to eight, but only for three months.</span> <span id="s2340">And I figured out I don’t want to start eighth grade from the beginning, I had to start it from the beginning.</span> <span id="s2341">So I went to a priest, and I told him, you know, I’m a Catholic, and they put me in a Protestant school, I – oh, the priest something, and I called Polish people in Bombay, I knew them, and I said look, I don’t want to be in that school.</span> <span id="s2342">Put me to Bombay.</span> <span id="s2343">So they transferred me to Jesuit school.</span> <span id="s2344">When I came to Jesuit school, they said, which class did you finish?</span> <span id="s2345">I said, I finish eighth grade, I want to go to the ninth grade.</span> <span id="s2346">And I only was three months.</span> <span id="s2347">So I asked them to give me help with math, to teach me math a little, and everything.</span> <span id="s2348">And there – there was Father Beech(ph), he was fantastic.</span> <span id="s2349">Father Beech(ph) spent every night with me in his cell, locked up and teaching me English, helping me.</span> <span id="s2350">He made me buy [indecipherable] Orczy’s book, “A Scarlet Pimpernel,” and she – he made me write all the words, and memorize all the words.</span> <span id="s2351">I remember part of it to this day.</span> <span id="s2352">We seek him here, we seek him there, those Frenchies seeks him everywhere.</span> <span id="s2353">Is he in heaven, is he in hell, this damn elusive pimpernel?</span> <span id="s2354">You see how I remember?</span> <span id="s2355">There is an opera like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: But – a-and I was learning, and finally Father Beech(ph) told me that Stanley – Stanislaus, you can – we will let you go before final exam, Cambridge exam, I think you’ll pass it.</span> <span id="s2358">I got PF in English, partly fail, but the rest [indecipherable] I did very good in geography.</span> <span id="s2359">They said that I took second place in India in geography and in that exam, Cambridge exam.</span> <span id="s2360">In religion I was very good, in math.</span> <span id="s2361">In drawing, I failed, almost.</span> <span id="s2362">I me – I mistook what they wanted us to paint, you know?</span> <span id="s2363">I was to paint a design in a circle and I – I subdivided the circle, so I got zero for it.</span> <span id="s2364">But I passed it, and my certificate sank; coming back the ship sank, but I got letter from Cambridge, you know, telling that I passed it.</span> <span id="s2365">And that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: What hap –</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: – but let me tell you of fa – Father Beech(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: One time they tell me that Father Beech(ph) – did I tell you that already –</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: How do you spell his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: – that Father Beech(ph) was sunburned, he went on vacation and he’s very badly sunburned.</span> <span id="s2372">So I go to his cell, and I knock on the door.</span> <span id="s2373">Who’s there?</span> <span id="s2374">Stanislaus.</span> <span id="s2375">Oh, come on in, come on in.</span> <span id="s2376">I walk into the car – to the thing and the fan standing and blowing on him, and he has just a little piece of cloth over here, and I see nude women on his arm, on his leg, on his chest and everything, and he’s a priest.</span> <span id="s2377">And I said, Father, what is this?</span> <span id="s2378">He says, I was a merchant marine in India, and they send me – I was engaged to get married, and they send me to merchant marine school in England.</span> <span id="s2379">And when I came back, she married somebody else, I said to hell with it, I became a priest.</span> <span id="s2380">I got so mad I became a priest.</span> <span id="s2381">But, he said, when I was merchant marine, that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: He had all these tattoos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Tattoos of women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s2385">Was his – did you – I want to make sure I spell his name right, b-e-e-c-h, like Father Beech(ph), like a beach on the ocean?</span> <span id="s2386">Is that how you pronounce his name, or you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: I have somewhere a letter from him, but I don’t remember – I may have, in the school, maybe his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: I – I – I – but he was Father Beech(ph).</span> <span id="s2390">Anyway, that was b-e-e-c-h, I think it was, sounding beach.</span> <span id="s2391">He was – oh, he was the nicest – he was one of the people that influenced me more in my life than you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: In every way.</span> <span id="s2394">The sacrifice.</span> <span id="s2395">He didn’t have to do it, you know.</span> <span id="s2396">We slept on the third floor, the priests were on the second floor.</span> <span id="s2397">On the first floor, I – we ate, or something.</span> <span id="s2398">And sometimes, in the evening – and there were bathrooms on the first floor, so sometimes at night we woke up, and I would go down.</span> <span id="s2399">They always had a monk watching us in the school – in the corridor, so there would be no monkey sexual business or anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Then I would be walking, and I see Father Beech(ph) walking with praying.</span> <span id="s2402">So I come to him, hi, Father.</span> <span id="s2403">Oh, he say, Stanislaus.</span> <span id="s2404">Would you like to have a drink?</span> <span id="s2405">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2406">So, I said okay.</span> <span id="s2407">He takes me and they take whatever drink they were drinking.</span> <span id="s2408">You know, but I mean alcohol.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: And we would sit and talk and he would have a drink and everything.</span> <span id="s2411">And then I was in Africa and while I was in Africa I wrote him a story how we went hunting, and how the lions surrounded, and he wrote to me he was so proud of my English.</span> <span id="s2412">And he wrote that we have a new principal in school.</span> <span id="s2413">And he says, he’s making so many changes, that if changes are progress, then we are progressing by leaps and bounds.</span> <span id="s2414">I never forget he wrote to me.</span> <span id="s2415">And – and he said th – th-the man is whipping himself, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: They were very nice, they were very nice Fathers.</span> <span id="s2418">That was a very, very good school.</span> <span id="s2419">I understand it’s one of the best schools in India.</span> <span id="s2420">You can go on computer and write Saint Mary’s School, Bombay, and then come – Reuben Metter(ph) comes from there, he’s graduate from that school, too –</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: – from Saint Mary’s School in Bombay.</span> <span id="s2423">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s2424">Bombay was dangerous too, but Bombay had beautiful hanging gardens, swimming pool, touch my heart.</span> <span id="s2425">I was only once eating ice cream, I had no money [indecipherable] and on every bench in Bombay was written, presented by General Courva(ph).</span> <span id="s2426">And in Polish, you know what courva(ph) means.</span> <span id="s2427">So we were laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: It was a very, very strange experience being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Were your mother and sister still in Karachi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: No, they were in Kwanapur(ph) they were in southern India already, they – they put them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: And my mother was teaching over there.</span> <span id="s2434">I don’t know what my sister was doing.</span> <span id="s2435">He was mostly sick though.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: She had asthma, she was very sick and eventually from Karachi in ’46, she went to America.</span> <span id="s2438">She got her visa early, because from Karachi they sent our visas – Americans to Bombay, and of course they lost it.</span> <span id="s2439">And – and they then told us that we have to wait seven years for another –</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: They lost it becau –</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: – why did – how did they lau – lose it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Americans.</span> <span id="s2444">They lose everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: Yeah, I – I – I don’t trust Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: Well, you mentioned that there was a boat, a ship going across the ocean that – where something sank, like your – your cerifi –</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Oh, that was my school certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: That was different.</span> <span id="s2451">But this was – this was overland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: Karachi and Bombay, it was in [indecipherable] they send it, and they lost my mother application for visa and ma – and mine, you know, for quota number.</span> <span id="s2454">And when my sister came here, there was Catholic relief and there was a Polish fellow writing to immigration office, all the time explaining to them that my sister got the visa and we were together in Karachi, and we were together applying and developing birth certificates because we had nothing.</span> <span id="s2455">So we had some people testifying who we are.</span> <span id="s2456">And then one day telephone rings, and some very big shot in immigration office calls up, I’m so sorry, we make the mistake.</span> <span id="s2457">When I found out the record, I saw that there were other papers that you were – all three were in – in, and they lost the papers.</span> <span id="s2458">We’re sending right away to Nairobi non-preference visa number for my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s2459">And so in ’48 we came, otherwise we would have to wait God knows how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: So in other words, your – you’re in Bombay, and your sister gets a visa in 1946 to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: But you and your mother – how – why did –</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: No, we were sent to Africa.</span> <span id="s2464">India got independence in ’47, and they send us to Uganda, then they send us to Kenya.</span> <span id="s2465">They s – they told us that from ’46 we have to wait seven years for a quota number, Polish quota number to come here.</span> <span id="s2466">My mother didn’t want to say that she was born in Russia, and she could come under – Russian quota number was empty.</span> <span id="s2467">And my mother wouldn’t say that she was born in Russia, she was born in Poland and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2468">And there was no Poland at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: And she could have gone right away.</span> <span id="s2471">And I’ll tell you, Americans wanted to smuggle me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: [phone ringing] Let’s cut.</span> <span id="s2475">[break] All right, and we were at the point where – where you were going to be going – aha, you got a call from immigration authorities, American immigration authorities that a mistake had been made.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: My sister got it, and the non-preference visa number is being sent to us.</span> <span id="s2479">So then we were already in Tanganyika, so – Tanzania, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: So we went by bus to Nairobi.</span> <span id="s2482">And let me tell you, my mother and I went to sit with the driver in front, and the rest of the bus was black.</span> <span id="s2483">But if you went on the train in India, if you were white, you had a car.</span> <span id="s2484">If you were an Indian, you got another car, and the rest of the people were on the – on the train, black people, you know, separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: There was segregation like hell.</span> <span id="s2487">But we were going on that train –</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: You’re talking about India, but Nairobi is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: In Nairobi –</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: In – we were going to Nairobi.</span> <span id="s2492">And let me tell you, that bus stopped somewhere, and the natives went to eat, because they didn’t call them na – anything else.</span> <span id="s2493">And we said we want to eat, we’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s2494">No, no, no, you have to go to restaurant.</span> <span id="s2495">You should have seen the place, you could have fainted.</span> <span id="s2496">A whole part of the road was only lined up with ivory standing, a driveway.</span> <span id="s2497">Then we came and there were cages with birds, tropical birds.</span> <span id="s2498">Then we come and the English fellow who owns this place in the bush, asks us to go and take a shower and refresh yourself.</span> <span id="s2499">Then i-if they bring the food, you know, and all the natives are dressed in fancy hats and everything.</span> <span id="s2500">And then after a while, the horn starts blowing.</span> <span id="s2501">The bus already came for us, and we said we have to go.</span> <span id="s2502">Don’t pay any attention, enjoy yourself, have a good time while we’re here, you know?</span> <span id="s2503">Completely re-respect.</span> <span id="s2504">And then that bus continued, we came to Nairobi.</span> <span id="s2505">Nairobi was a dangerous town even then, because in Nairobi, Mau Mau was starting over there, but in Nairobi they told us that the white woman, during the day can go with the gun anywhere she goes, but at night she has to have a man with a gun to protect her too, because is dangerous, they like to attack.</span> <span id="s2506">It’s now trouble starting over there too, I see, in Africa.</span> <span id="s2507">But there was Mau Mau.</span> <span id="s2508">And anyway, we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: So you got to the American consul –</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: We went to the American embassy to get our visas.</span> <span id="s2511">So we came over there, and in – and they gave us our visas, they couldn’t sell it to anybody.</span> <span id="s2512">You see, a lot of visas were being sold to Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s2513">It – it was Polish quota number, they would sell it to anybody they wanted to, because they want money.</span> <span id="s2514">So we –</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: They being whom?</span> <span id="s2516">The American officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Who was doing the selling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: American officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: We all knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: In Israel they had to close American consulate because they were selling Arab visas.</span> <span id="s2524">And I’ll tell you, over there, they – th-they ga – they got the visa and they don’t want to give it to us.</span> <span id="s2525">So we say what – what are you doing?</span> <span id="s2526">Well, we are going to give it to [indecipherable] international refugee organization.</span> <span id="s2527">But we can order – we had 1200 dollars that my sister, was working as a governess here, and she send this to Africa.</span> <span id="s2528">So we can buy ship straight to go to America.</span> <span id="s2529">No, you have to go on that ship.</span> <span id="s2530">So from Nairobi they send us to Venice on this ship.</span> <span id="s2531">But they didn’t give us the visa – they gave it, but it said it will cost you pros – please give us 600 dollars.</span> <span id="s2532">And this was [indecipherable] ship, it was – there was no fee for it.</span> <span id="s2533">So we come later from ve – Venice, we go to Milano, and the British commander comes, and they said, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2534">And they said why?</span> <span id="s2535">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: Who’s they?</span> <span id="s2537">Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: – American visa, you not a refugee.</span> <span id="s2539">I said no, but we don’t have it.</span> <span id="s2540">Well, where is your visa?</span> <span id="s2541">I said, look at our package over there.</span> <span id="s2542">He goes, finds our visa.</span> <span id="s2543">He says, what happened?</span> <span id="s2544">Well, they – they gave it to IRO.</span> <span id="s2545">Don’t tell me they made you pay for it?</span> <span id="s2546">Son of a guns.</span> <span id="s2547">We said yes, 600 dollars.</span> <span id="s2548">Well, they stole it.</span> <span id="s2549">So you know, there was more monkey business going than you ever can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2551">Okay, so use – it was – there was a market in these visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: And – and you were supposed to get it just for free, as – as your [indecipherable] numbers</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: [indecipherable] the visa, but for what they took the money, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2555">But give us 600 dollars.</span> <span id="s2556">And all we had to get was once the visa and we could go to Mombasa and book a passage to America, like my sister, book a passage from Bombay, straight to San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: So what – you were in Venice, and then how did you get to the United States from Venice?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: Oh, from Venice they send us with refugees.</span> <span id="s2559">We were still on the refugee ship, but they send us to Milano, and from Milano they ca – the English command – the camp commander – it was refugee camp, he called Genoa, he booked us a cheap hotel in Genoa, and on [indecipherable] ship – Italian ship, he booked us a passage, and we had enough money we came to America with 30 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: From two – from 1200, and we came to America.</span> <span id="s2562">And it was winter, and the idiots in the harbor, a-all the American citizens were first and then people with – and this, and it was so cold, December 28, and they opened my mother’s paper, fine, and American doctors look, oh, you have TB, you won’t be allowed to go to America, you go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s2563">And my mother said, how is it possible, you checked my lungs there, the doctors checked.</span> <span id="s2564">Well, it’s – and finally some other doctor came in, American and he looked at it.</span> <span id="s2565">Who said you have TB?</span> <span id="s2566">Those are scars from tuberculos – from this – from pneumonia.</span> <span id="s2567">And he says, you clear, you can go.</span> <span id="s2568">And we had no warm clothes.</span> <span id="s2569">You know why?</span> <span id="s2570">When we came from Africa, we were on the ship, but we had all our clothes in the baggage.</span> <span id="s2571">And we came to Venice – and we came to Venice and they took all our suitcases, you know, the – a lot of people were like transit, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: – we were in transit through Italy going.</span> <span id="s2574">So they said, who of you has anything that is not allowed?</span> <span id="s2575">Cigarettes, alcohol and things like that.</span> <span id="s2576">And everybody said no.</span> <span id="s2577">There was a Jewish guy, Polish, and he said he had a son, who’s opera singer, and you know, the son of a gun’s, custom officials went straight to his suitcases, they opened it, there was nothing but cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2578">They sealed all our – these suitcases, and they said, when you leave Italy, you get them.</span> <span id="s2579">And we finally got them in New York, our suitcases.</span> <span id="s2580">So we had no warm clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: Because like, we were from Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2584">So tell me – so you remember the date you came here, it was December 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: December 28, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: And you came into New York harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2589">And then, was your sister already here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: My sister was here.</span> <span id="s2591">She wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: And she met you there?</span> <span id="s2593">She met you there, at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, and my cousin was there.</span> <span id="s2595">We finally got out late in the evening, and then my sister was working then for my cousin, making bed jacket, my cousin was making bed jackets.</span> <span id="s2596">She had a good business.</span> <span id="s2597">She [indecipherable] fantastic materials, you know why?</span> <span id="s2598">Because my cousin was [indecipherable] she married an Irish fellow, and she was doing all the material was Jewish, materials for making bed jackets for women, she was manufacturing bed jackets.</span> <span id="s2599">And it was very difficult to get material.</span> <span id="s2600">But when they saw my sister and she came all sunburned from Africa, they were sure she was Jewish, they gave her so much material, my cousin, to make bed jackets, she made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s2601">They thought she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2602">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q: So here’s – here’s my next question.</span> <span id="s2604">I mean, I want to go back and fill in some of the blanks that at least come to mind, of your story that I know from before, and we didn’t – we didn’t talk about.</span> <span id="s2605">And they happen to be of the more tragic events.</span> <span id="s2606">You mentioned that you had cousins who had married into the hungari – i-i-into a wealthy Hungarian family called Horvath(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: And that they had a villa in Poznan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: In Poznan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: Close to Poznan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2613">And then at some point you said that there was a wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: This – his daughter was getting married in Poland, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: So, and – okay, so this – let’s establish first, the cousin was your cousin or your mother’s cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: No, well, it was my mother’s brother daughter –</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: – who was getting married, so it’s my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Your cousin, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: And she was getting married, and what happened that it was during the war.</span> <span id="s2621">We were at that time in Teheran.</span> <span id="s2622">And what’s interesting in that story is that they – th-there was a neighbor who was a Volksdeutsche, and he supposed [indecipherable] SS drunk, or something, and he told them that it’s underground and they came and they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s2623">Only the young couple got out, and the priest, you know?</span> <span id="s2624">But the story, beside that – I’ll give you a picture of that, but the story behind it is that I was in Teheran.</span> <span id="s2625">And next day on BBC, they were announcing that murder and speaking of my mother’s brother and everybody.</span> <span id="s2626">So, you know, they say that – Americans say, we didn’t know what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s2627">How come the next day a murder of Senator Stanislav [indecipherable] was on BBC broadcast and I hear – heard it in Teheran.</span> <span id="s2628">So you know, in Teheran I was in a hospital, I had malaria and my sister was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2629">And we quickly run because they used to copy everything, and publish like a little newspaper, British news, you know, in Polish.</span> <span id="s2630">So, we run quickly and say, please don’t give it to our mother.</span> <span id="s2631">We – we have to tell her ourselves, and we told her slowly that you were all – that they were all killed over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: So tell me – tell me again, it was that they had a vi

was getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: And there was a neighbor and he was a Volksdeutsche, that is a German –</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: This was – they were in a big estate –</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: – their wedding – marriage [indecipherable] the name of – of it is – sometimes you can get it on computer, the picture of their house and everything, you – even had the grave of them that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: – and ri-right now we change.</span> <span id="s2642">And he supposedly get the Germans, because Polish army went and killed him, and his children, and his wife, in the day of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: Oh – you – okay, who was the Volksdeutsche person, how – tell me a little bit about this, the back story of what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: Well, the Volksdeutsche were Germans who were living in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: And they were living for centuries, and some, they refuse to say that they’re Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: But he pri – right away was a Volksdeutsche – German person, you know, he not Polish person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: So he was a neighbor of your uncle’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: And there was a neighbor over there, and he wanted that property, that he would get that property there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2651">So he got those SS supposedly drunk, they said.</span> <span id="s2652">And they came over there, and they came couple of times, and they came at night and they shot everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: So everyone who was in the wedding party?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: Everybody was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Bride and groom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: No, bride and groom and the priest lived.</span> <span id="s2657">They went to take pictures, and I think, and she lived.</span> <span id="s2658">He – her husband was later killed in Warsaw uprising again, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: The groom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: The groom was killed later in Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s2661">And the – but it was, you know, it was so big that it was or – I was listening about this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: – next day in Teheran.</span> <span id="s2664">So how come they didn’t know what was going on about extermination camps?</span> <span id="s2665">They knew everything.</span> <span id="s2666">They didn’t want to do anything about.</span> <span id="s2667">They didn’t give a damn that people were being slaughtered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: That’s – that – I wanted to – I wanted to get this incident recorded and – and known about.</span> <span id="s2669">And now let’s talk – you say that this neighbor, who had been the Volksdeutsche, who wanted the property, that the Polish army – what happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: They we – they were surrounded by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: There were Germans staying.</span> <span id="s2673">What happened, I don’t know, because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2674">But I understand that Polish army had a trial.</span> <span id="s2675">Polish army never killed a German without the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: So there was a trial, and there was a verdict, and this is the first time that they killed a woman and children, they said here, two children.</span> <span id="s2678">First they killed the wife and the children, and then he came later.</span> <span id="s2679">That’s what I heard, and that’s what I was told.</span> <span id="s2680">And they killed underground surrounded his place, and they killed all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: So that would have been the Armia Krajowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Armia Krajowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">Q: Krajowa.</span> <span id="s2684">The Home Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: That – that was revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: You know, there was, in Warsaw there was a – I read about it, there was a very bad governor, German, and they send him a coffin once, with the wording that he will be assassinated.</span> <span id="s2688">And in the middle of Warsaw he was riding in a car and there were cars on the side, poo, poo, poo and he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: He was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: And they executed him.</span> <span id="s2691">But he was given a verdict, that for atrocities that he commits, he will be killed, too.</span> <span id="s2692">And they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: And now I want to – so that’s one incident.</span> <span id="s2694">And now you just mentioned, at one of the points where we had a break, that you had a relative who was the ambassador to which country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: Germany.</span> <span id="s2696">Ronniker(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: Ronniker(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: Ronniker(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: And he wa – hi – and he – what kind of relation was he to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Look, don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s2701">I’ll tell you the relation he wasn’t – when I met him in America, I didn’t know him in Poland, I had to – to call him Uncle Wilko(ph).</span> <span id="s2702">He wanted me to call him Wilko(ph) and my mother.</span> <span id="s2703">Who he was married, don’t ask me too much.</span> <span id="s2704">I met him, he was an old man already.</span> <span id="s2705">Oh, I could tell you the story about him you could not believe.</span> <span id="s2706">He was tried at the end of the war in Kraków.</span> <span id="s2707">Hitler sent his personal interpreter Schmidt, and he was o-o-over there, and he was sentenced to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: By –</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: He was a ger – Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: By Germans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: – were sending – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: So – but he knew a lot of Germans, you know, people that were in Poland, and that they had to be in the army because otherwise they would be dead anyway.</span> <span id="s2714">So anyway, he said, I was waiting for my execution.</span> <span id="s2715">Now this is all hearsay because I don’t know, this is what he told me.</span> <span id="s2716">And he said, one time, all of a sudden, Germans come in very elegant uniforms with white gloves, and they take me out from the cell.</span> <span id="s2717">And I said well, they’re going to execute me in style.</span> <span id="s2718">He says, we come out, there’s a car, they put me in a car and we drive out.</span> <span id="s2719">I said, where am I going?</span> <span id="s2720">They’re going to kill me in the forest, or where?</span> <span id="s2721">He comes and he says there’s a table, and there are German generals sitting.</span> <span id="s2722">And they say Mr. Ronniker(ph), we want you to go to Warsaw, make [indecipherable] who is the head on the underground army, talk to him, not to make uprising in Warsaw, because we will devastate Warsaw and we’ll kill everybody.</span> <span id="s2723">And we want to – you to talk to him.</span> <span id="s2724">Then you have to contact underground army, Armia Krajowa to contact Polish government in London.</span> <span id="s2725">We are going to fly you to Portugal, and then from Portugal let the British pick you up, and we want to talk, to stop the war, not to let Russians go into Poland so much, and into Germany.</span> <span id="s2726">Of course, [indecipherable] didn’t see him, and England refused to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Ronniker(ph), your –</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: Well, you know why?</span> <span id="s2729">Yalta [indecipherable] they made the deals.</span> <span id="s2730">Germans didn’t know, obviously about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: So tell me, why was he sentenced to death by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Oh, they can sentence anybody.</span> <span id="s2733">They – probably he was operating in Poland and everything, you know.</span> <span id="s2734">He was saving people.</span> <span id="s2735">He said that – he – he told me that one time he was in Lwów, and the orphanages in town had no food.</span> <span id="s2736">And he said, I knew the governor of that province from Germany when I was ambassador.</span> <span id="s2737">And he said in the German [indecipherable] says, I have no food.</span> <span id="s2738">I cannot – we need food for our army.</span> <span id="s2739">What can I do for you?</span> <span id="s2740">He says, I can give you some cars.</span> <span id="s2741">You go to the villages.</span> <span id="s2742">And if the villagers give you food, you can bring in and give it to the children, to feed them.</span> <span id="s2743">And he said, I’ll make some cars available so you can go in the countryside and look for food to feed your children.</span> <span id="s2744">You know, they were reasonable people, too.</span> <span id="s2745">They said, we do – we don’t have food.</span> <span id="s2746">Because he told them that the orphan, she has no food in Lwów.</span> <span id="s2747">And he said well – and he said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: So what was his role then in – in Poland during the war?</span> <span id="s2749">If he had once been ambassador to Germany for – from Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2751">Well, I tell you what, I cannot tell you what, but he was – there was RGO.</span> <span id="s2752">That was an organization in Poland called RGO.</span> <span id="s2753">And they got money from Hoover, President Hoover.</span> <span id="s2754">He knew President Hoover, obviously, and President Hoover gave him the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: This would be in the early 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Oh, that was – yeah, early 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: First World War, you know, and after first World War and everything, maybe he knew him from there, I don’t know, he told me, you know, he was an old man, but he told me those stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Can you – okay.</span> <span id="s2760">Cut – cut for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: My life, and what I heard, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2763">I guess I just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: I-I really don’t know how he was related to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: [indecipherable] the writer of this I knew, that he was [indecipherable] you know, but – and how he was connected.</span> <span id="s2767">But him I didn’t know, but I had to – he told me I had to call him Wilko(ph), so it’s an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: And he s – he was related through some wedding, or to something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2771">Can we cut?</span> <span id="s2772">Can we cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: You are still young, and you don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Oh, don’t I like that, ha, ha.</span> <span id="s2775">I’m on the other side of 50, let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: Yeah, that’s all right, you don’t look 50.</span> <span id="s2777">People who are nice to me –</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: I’m closer to 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: People who – some people tell me, why you don’t look so old, you look like 70.</span> <span id="s2780">I said thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: But 70, I could s – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: Okay, so my interest was, why I have a question about Mr. Ronniker(ph) is this, if he was a pre-war diplomat to Germany from Poland, how is it that he even had any position at all during the war years in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Because of Hoover.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: You think that helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2789">Well look, Germans were funny people, you know.</span> <span id="s2790">But Germans respect class, Germans respect some things, you know, and everything.</span> <span id="s2791">And Ronniker(ph) could be German [indecipherable] it’s almost German name, Ronniker(ph).</span> <span id="s2792">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: So – and then, if – if it was a Hoover connection, tell me what was that connection between him and Herbert Hoover.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: If I knew, I could tell you.</span> <span id="s2795">But he knew him from first World War, because I think after the first World War, Hoover sent money to newly resurrected Poland, and somehow he must have been involved in that money.</span> <span id="s2796">Because I remember that my father became a mayor of a small town where my sister was born.</span> <span id="s2797">Actually – wait, what’s its name, you see – and over there, my father received money to give to people who have trouble.</span> <span id="s2798">So my father knew some Polish people.</span> <span id="s2799">He didn’t know the Jewish community well, and he went to a rabbi.</span> <span id="s2800">And my father said to a rabbi, give me the name of the Jewish people that need financially help, because we got some money from the government, and we can help.</span> <span id="s2801">And – and the rabbi gave him the names, and my father said, well, I know this fellow, he needs help, this guy.</span> <span id="s2802">And the rabbi said no, they are healthy, they can work.</span> <span id="s2803">Only give to them that are sick.</span> <span id="s2804">Don’t give to the people that are we – healthy, because they will stop working.</span> <span id="s2805">My father was always telling me.</span> <span id="s2806">So, you know, there was some help for people –</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: Arranged through this Mr. –</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: – arranged by the government and it could have been some help from America.</span> <span id="s2809">You see, America wanted to give Poland this Marshall Plan, but Stalin refused to have Marshall Plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Mm-hm, that’s afterwards.</span> <span id="s2811">Now, when you’re talking about the help that your father got from the government and from Ronniker(ph), you’re talking first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: The first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: After the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A: After the first World War, there was help, and then was Marshall Plan, and Marshall Plan was run by a Polish member of Federal Reserve of amer – in America.</span> <span id="s2815">And he used to come and help us [indecipherable] he used to teach us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">A: And nobody – Americans couldn’t believe that I, going to NYU, I’m talking to Federal Reserve fellow.</span> <span id="s2818">And he told me that Marshall Plan was made to rebuild quickly England, Japan, France, Germany, so we can trade wi – again.</span> <span id="s2819">Give the money to rebuild those countries to trade, and that’s what he – h-he told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Okay, so aft – during the second World War, Mr. Ronniker(ph) is still in a position – some kind of position of authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: Some kind of position of authority, in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: He’s not in the Polish government –</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: – you see, but he is RGO, or this was something called like help to the people –</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: – because he got money from Hoover.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: And now was this RGO a Polish underground organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: No, wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: Was this a German municipal organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: There was no German, there was nothing, it was Polish thing that he operated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: And he traveled.</span> <span id="s2834">He said the worst thing was like he said, underground in Poland.</span> <span id="s2835">That was crazy.</span> <span id="s2836">They would shoot the German somewhere, and then the whole village gets killed.</span> <span id="s2837">He was telling me, you know, a lot of stupid things are being done.</span> <span id="s2838">Why the hell shoot a German somewhere, where for pleasure or something, and then the Germans come and they – and kill a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2839">Now – now they say that Warsaw uprising, nobody wants to take responsibility who started it.</span> <span id="s2840">Because London says, we didn’t give the orders, nobody wants to, you know, what [indecipherable] whole population of Warsaw was evacuated and killed and everything.</span> <span id="s2841">And the – now they say that a lot of it was done from Russia, that Russia was broadcasting to Poles all the time to rise up against Germany.</span> <span id="s2842">Well, America did that with Hungary.</span> <span id="s2843">They were telling to Free Europe, to Hungarians to make a revolution.</span> <span id="s2844">And when they made a revolution over there, you remember the Hungarian revolution?</span> <span id="s2845">What was this thing – Foster Dallas said, that’s an internal Russian affair.</span> <span id="s2846">So the Russians went in there and finished that revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: Going back to Mr. Ronniker(ph).</span> <span id="s2848">You mentioned during one time when we were not filming, that after the war somebody said at a party when they found out that you should – that whoever was there should get on their knees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: Got the – got on their knees and started kissing his hands, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Who?</span> <span id="s2851">Who said that?</span> <span id="s2852">Who se –</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: She – her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Who’s her – who is the person?</span> <span id="s2855">Wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">A: I don’t know, there was a Polish woman –</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: – who was from Poland, and she found out that this is Ronniker(ph), and she says to her daughter, on your knees and start killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">Q: Kissing, kissing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: Because the Germans had us all lined up to be killed, and he came and he talked to the Germans, and they let us go.</span> <span id="s2861">You see, so he had influence with the Germans in some way.</span> <span id="s2862">How, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: Maybe because they knew of his connection, and they must have known who he was.</span> <span id="s2865">Hitler wouldn’t send his interpreter, Schmidt to his trial in Kraków, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: And – and – and – and that’s what he told us, and I – maybe he was lying, but I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: I was – he was an old man, and he se –</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Q: Well, it sounds like there’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: [indecipherable] finally run away, because you know Russian right away sentenced him to death, too.</span> <span id="s2872">And he ran away from Poland and he eventually came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: Well, it sounds like quite a story, and that there probably isn’t a lot – a lot to his story, but you ha – you only learned the fragments of it, and so can only tell us fragments of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: Yeah, I can only tell what he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">A: This is what he told me, this is his story.</span> <span id="s2877">You see, there were so many things going on over there that nobody knew, that what was going on, who was what, you know?</span> <span id="s2878">I – it’s awful, but ee – the people don’t learn to stop killing each other.</span> <span id="s2879">Those African tribes and in British.</span> <span id="s2880">Did you ever see Kuwait on the map?</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: When Churchill was drunk, as usual, they was – they were dividing after the first World War.</span> <span id="s2883">So Churchill drew a line like this, you know, one line like this, one – they cross, and they are like this.</span> <span id="s2884">So you know what this is?</span> <span id="s2885">Here is Kuwait, you know what this is?</span> <span id="s2886">No man’s land.</span> <span id="s2887">Between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, this big piece of the lines that cross like this, it’s – on the atlas if you look, it’s no man’s land, you know?</span> <span id="s2888">And this used to be a part of, once upon a time, of Iraq.</span> <span id="s2889">And – and amer – English designed the state, and they made a lot of everything.</span> <span id="s2890">And all those countries that are now fighting in Africa, they conquered the – different tribes were living, and they put different tribes together, and they all hate each other, and they are all fighting.</span> <span id="s2891">Th-Th-Th-The world is crazy.</span> <span id="s2892">They did a lot of bad.</span> <span id="s2893">And when you are – when I think of the Spanish war, they did it in South America, killing, slavering, everything.</span> <span id="s2894">A-Americans came, British [indecipherable] Indians, who are savages, let’s kill all the Indians, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: It’s a kind of sad note, and – to end our interview on, but I’d like to ask you – I mean, I think we could sit and we could talk about many things, two or three times over, but I – I want to kind of sum up our conversation today, and our interview today and d – how – how would you think some – when someone will listen to your story that has so many facets to it, that has both beautiful memories of where you grew up and how you grew up, and then great, I’d say terror and fear, and i – and poverty, after the deportation.</span> <span id="s2896">And yet, you see, you have so much variety in it; what would you want people to understand, from what you went through?</span> <span id="s2897">What would you want them to understand from your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: Well, I’ll tell you something, always expect that something better will come.</span> <span id="s2899">When you get old, you lose it already, you know, but when you young, you look and you strive, you know.</span> <span id="s2900">Like I went to NYU six years at night.</span> <span id="s2901">But I was – I knew I was getting somewhere.</span> <span id="s2902">There were people telling me, you stupid going to school.</span> <span id="s2903">I said, oh yes, I’m stupid.</span> <span id="s2904">I had a girlfriend, very nice, and she told me, you stupid going to NYU.</span> <span id="s2905">I said, well, but I’m going to study, and I’m going to finish this school.</span> <span id="s2906">And you know, there were a lot of things in life, and you always look for something.</span> <span id="s2907">And I had one big objective, that I had my father who told me, take care of your mother and your sister.</span> <span id="s2908">And I took care of them.</span> <span id="s2909">My sister died in 2001, you know, and to the last day I always took care of her, and I did everything that I could to help my sister, my mother.</span> <span id="s2910">And you know, my cousin, responsibility for that.</span> <span id="s2911">And also, in my life, it was funny, but I took care of other people.</span> <span id="s2912">I was – we were drafted into American army, and there was a Ukrainian fellow sleeping about me, and he started complaining that he has stomachache.</span> <span id="s2913">So I said, give me your knee.</span> <span id="s2914">I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis.</span> <span id="s2915">So I ran to the company headquarters and I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we have to take this fellow for operation.</span> <span id="s2916">They told me, who do you know, what do you know, you think you stupid or something, he’s goldbricking.</span> <span id="s2917">So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came back.</span> <span id="s2918">You know, we’re going to sue you if he dies.</span> <span id="s2919">He may die soon.</span> <span id="s2920">They called ambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table, it was appendicitis.</span> <span id="s2921">There was a fellow in Korea, and he used to stand and burn his legs, and I realized that he was so depressed, that he didn’t pain, because we had those Coleman stoves.</span> <span id="s2922">So, how to help him?</span> <span id="s2923">He had very thick glasses.</span> <span id="s2924">So I said, put your thick glasses right next to your bag, and in the morning step on them and crush them.</span> <span id="s2925">And he crushed them.</span> <span id="s2926">Doctors didn’t pay attention, nobody.</span> <span id="s2927">They send him to Japan, and of course he was sent back home.</span> <span id="s2928">He was a mental case, you know.</span> <span id="s2929">Look at my wife.</span> <span id="s2930">She conks out on me on the lawn, and I give CPR and I don’t know what the hell I do, but she’s alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: And you’re talking about Francesca your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: Yes, okay.</span> <span id="s2934">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: But – but you know, you have things in life, and I like to give people help.</span> <span id="s2936">Not everybody likes help.</span> <span id="s2937">She objects to me when I talk to my cousin, but I try to help them.</span> <span id="s2938">They argue with me, you know.</span> <span id="s2939">But I have more knowledge about certain things than they have, and I try to give it to them.</span> <span id="s2940">What they re – they refuse it, they fight it, but eventually they’ll take it.</span> <span id="s2941">Eventually they’ll take it.</span> <span id="s2942">You try to tell people, this is what’s important in life, this is what you do.</span> <span id="s2943">And you know, a lot of people gave up, a lot of people give up.</span> <span id="s2944">We saw this – I tell you, I saw one thing; Jewish people give up very fast.</span> <span id="s2945">They break down.</span> <span id="s2946">We saw them breaking down more than we were breaking down, you know.</span> <span id="s2947">I really saw that in my Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2948">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: Where –</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: I’m talking about Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: They were weaker, I think.</span> <span id="s2953">They were – somehow they didn’t have the consistency or something, and we – because we saw them covered with lice, standing in line.</span> <span id="s2954">Often we were trying to get the lice off; they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2955">And I understand that once a doctor walked through a hospital and – with a group of student doctors, and he asked them, which of these patients is the most sick, you know, the sickest person.</span> <span id="s2956">So one fellow said, well he – this one has this disease, this one has this disease, this one has this disease.</span> <span id="s2957">And the doctor said, you are all wrong.</span> <span id="s2958">Look at him.</span> <span id="s2959">There’s a fly walking on his face, and he reacts already.</span> <span id="s2960">He gave up.</span> <span id="s2961">He’s the sickest.</span> <span id="s2962">And you know, people, if they – if they react, you know – and I was lucky that I had a mother that could help me so much, you know, she helped me so, so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: In every way.</span> <span id="s2965">With the English language, and with the getting me to the schools, you know.</span> <span id="s2966">I wouldn’t be able, by myself to get.</span> <span id="s2967">But for her, knowing the English, knowing the French, they recognize right away that she was of a different class.</span> <span id="s2968">The English respect the class very much, so you know, they were conscious, and they saw it right away.</span> <span id="s2969">And then I took advant – and I made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s2970">In life, I made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s2971">I tell you like in Karachi, we were – there was a club for British soldiers and diving and everything.</span> <span id="s2972">I got to know the Canadian fellow who was running.</span> <span id="s2973">We used to steal Indian boats and go sailing, the two of us together.</span> <span id="s2974">And then we’d steal cookies and everything.</span> <span id="s2975">And one time, maybe I told you that, I told in Polish school that I take some boys, and they went with me over there.</span> <span id="s2976">So in Polish school they didn’t like me because I was go-going to this, to – in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Cause you were miss – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: So they loaded a bus or truck of children and they went over there, and they told that we let them into that club.</span> <span id="s2979">Of course, they threw them out.</span> <span id="s2980">But the guys with me came, and they could swim and eat and everything, because I knew this fellow.</span> <span id="s2981">You know, so I made contact.</span> <span id="s2982">I told you in American Red Cross I made contacts with those soldiers, and I have everything.</span> <span id="s2983">So I always had some money, you know, for these things.</span> <span id="s2984">Then I ran photography, and I started making money on photography.</span> <span id="s2985">You constantly had to figure out something.</span> <span id="s2986">When I came to America I had no money, so I took a course in radio and television, I started learning how to do.</span> <span id="s2987">And you know, and then I didn’t finish it because I went to Korea.</span> <span id="s2988">But I le – I learned so much about electricity that – you have to ask people, and you have to talk to people so much, because you learn something from everybody.</span> <span id="s2989">Everybody teaches you something.</span> <span id="s2990">Sicknesses.</span> <span id="s2991">If you sick, learn from them what are the symptoms, what you have and everything, so you know, and you can tell somebody too, and you can help, you know.</span> <span id="s2992">You cannot rely always on a doctor only, because s-sometimes you know you have to know a lot of things, and the more you can learn in life, the better for you in life.</span> <span id="s2993">And I think that’s what interests me.</span> <span id="s2994">The – only now, I have the seat [indecipherable] and I cannot do anything, and I say, and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: Well, you di – you’ve done something amazing.</span> <span id="s2996">You have – you have told us about your story, and it is a multi-fascinated – faceted, fascinating story, and it’s a true gift to give to us.</span> <span id="s2997">So I thank you for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2999">W-Wait, I’ll go and bring you some pizza.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s3001">I have to formally end.</span> <span id="s3002">This ends the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. stan – Stanley Kiersnowski on June 20th, 2014.</span> <span id="s3003">Thank you, again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">PAGE
