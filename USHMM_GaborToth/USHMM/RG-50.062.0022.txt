-CONTENTS- I was born June 1920 in Romania. I now live in Honolulu with my daughter and her family. My mother's name was Esther Kreisler, I have two brothers living in Israel. I was born in Breznov, learned Hungarian in school and also attended Hebrew School. We moved to another area near the Rumanian border and learned Rumanian. Early on I went to Jewish Day School, later I went to a general school.
My brothers were in the military and we moved to Bucharest. My two sisters and I moved to Bucharest with my brother. My brothers supported us. One brother was a printer.
I went to high school and finished in 1938 and continued to go to night school and worked during the day as a photographer and then as a dentist's assistant, dental technician for five or six years until 1940. In Romania there were over 800,000 Jewish people. I had non Jewish friends from the high school.
Rumanian Nazis became active after Hitler came to Bucharest. In 1939 they became active against the Jews. In 1939/40 they became strong and started to send Jews to work and to extermination camps.
My brother who was a printer secretly printed material against the Nazis and when they came to the house to pick him up, they mistook him for me. The next morning they were waiting for me and took me to a train to go to a concentration camp. This was May 1, 194(?) .
There were others on the train than Jews. The Rumanian Nazis took me together with 2000 others, 1500 Jews and the rest political prisoners. Terazu was a work camp, Jews from Poland, political prisoners, jail prisoners. The black marketeers were living very well in the camp because they had money. They put us to work as soon as we arrived.
We received a piece of bread in the morning and in the evening when we returned from work received food from the kitchen, very small amount, inadequate, beans, bones, very little meat. I made teeth out of the bones. I worked as a dental assistant. There were also women in the camp but no children. I ate a little better because I was a dental assistant(black market).
In 1942 they took all the Jewish prisoners by train to Varnecka. I learned later but did not know it at the time that they were doing experiments at the camp, giving the prisoners poison in the food.
The effect of the poison was paralysis and death. As a dental assistant I was able to smuggle medicines to the prisoners. As I ate with the dentists I was better able to survive. At the end of the war the German soldiers killed the Russians. I was in the camp from May 1941 to August 1944. They took us to another camp Groslovo. There were 600 paralyzed from the original 1500. I worked approximately 1 year at the Groslovo camp as a dental
assistant.
We heard the bombs close to us. The Commandant decided we should go back to Romania. We walked 80 miles. They had cars and horses.
They took us to Tagena. Some Jews tried to go on a ship to Palestine and all 1000 Jews died.
My brothers survived and went to Israel. After the war I joined my mother in Bucharest. My brothers joined us. I worked for the health insurance people. My father survived and joined us. Later I went to the university at night to become an engineer. I was licensed in 1969. I remained in Romania. In Romania they removed all Jews from official jobs. In 1941 I was married and had one daughter.
My wife was not in the camps. My daughter studied architecture.
When she finished she decided to go to Israel and on her way stopped at Rome and my brother in law, who lived in Michigan, was able to get her a visa to the U.S. and she went to Denver as an architecture helper. In 1985 we received a visa to visit Denver. At the airport they took away our visa and we had to remain in Romania. In 1986 again we received a visa to visit Denver.
Meanwhile my wife died. At the airport again they took away my passport. However I finally did receive a visitor's visa for the
U.S, I never went back to Romania, I left my apartment, my furnishings, a friends was instructed to pay rent, telephone, etc.
I told them my sister was dying and she did die soon after and I was ill myself. I finally was allowed to stay. I now live with my daughter and her family in Honolulu. I visited my oldest brother in Israel, my two brothers and mother died in Israel.
400,000 Jewish Rumanians were killed in camps. 400,000 went to Israel. There are 28 to 30,000 elderly Jewish Rumanians now.
