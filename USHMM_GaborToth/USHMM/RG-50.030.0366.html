thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: No, it wasn't, really.</span> <span id="s105">Where I lived there were a lot of women that helped their husbands in business or having their own business.</span> <span id="s106">I don't know, but we didn't have such gender differences because a woman was a woman.</span> <span id="s107">She had her brain and she used it as much as she could use

it.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">And then when the war broke out, he took over all the, all the merchandise we had in the factory and he's supposed to pay us.</span> <span id="s136">He never did.</span> <span id="s137">After the war I met him.</span> <span id="s138">I introduced my husband to him and he was charming, but became very, very well-to-do because he married the Bürgermeister'sdaughter of Munich.</span> <span id="s139">And he brought a lot of wealth with him.</span> <span id="s140">When he started to talk about Germany losing, he moved to Germany and made all

something is brewing here, something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s148">And my father said, "I'm not going to leave my family behind and, and go anywhere.”</span> <span id="s149">He didn't go.</span> <span id="s150">The people who went saved their life.</span> <span id="s151">They spent the war years in the United States.</span> <span id="s152">My father in the beginning he still ran the factory -- it was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">And then we had to close so this Hugo got all the stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">02:12:15 He got it.</span> <span id="s155">And he came to our house, to our apartment.</span> <span id="s156">We had an apartment and closed it up and chased us out.</span> <span id="s157">They wanted us to wait until they will get a lot of people together and they wanted to take us somewhere.</span> <span id="s158">And a friend of mine came into and saw us standing there and waiting.</span> <span id="s159">"Why do you wait?"</span> <span id="s160">I said, "They told us to wait.”</span> <span id="s161">[She said] "Don't stay here, run away.”</span> <span id="s162">So, we left.</span> <span id="s163">Just the way we were standing we left and went to the place that became later on -- we knew it was going to be the ghetto.</span> <span id="s164">The old part of town where the cemeteries were and very poor people lived in this area.</span> <span id="s165">They didn't have any facilities and this is where we went into.</span> <span id="s166">My father's uncle had a factory there, a marble factory for buildings, you know, for stairs, for all kinds of monuments.</span> <span id="s167">So, we lived in my uncle's house until they closed the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And the whole family, your brother, your mother and your father were there?</span> <span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: And when they closed the ghetto, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Then my parents moved to a room, to one room with a lady with two children.</span> <span id="s172">They lived in this room.</span> <span id="s173">It was just divided.</span> <span id="s174">A sheet was hanging there and this was, this was the room.</span> <span id="s175">They didn't have their privacy or anything, but this is how it was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">There, there were so very little places to live and they had to stick all these people in, into these places.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Now were you in that room with your father and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: In the beginning, yes, because I was married for a few months.</span> <span id="s179">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: When, when we knew that the, when the Germans came into our town, everybody was running away from them towards Russia.</span> <span id="s181">And I wanted to go but my parents said, "You are -- what do you know about life?</span> <span id="s182">You were never on your own.</span> <span id="s183">You are young.</span> <span id="s184">Where are you going to run?"</span> <span id="s185">I said, "I will get married and I will go.”</span> <span id="s186">And the fellow was my father's age.</span> <span id="s187">A nice guy, very nice.</span> <span id="s188">I got married but I wasn't material for a wife.</span> <span id="s189">I was a spoiled brat and I thought everything has to come my own way.</span> <span id="s190">And so, we married.</span> <span id="s191">My parents were against it but finally I, I had my will and I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">02:15:01 It didn't work out.</span> <span id="s193">He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s194">He treated me like a china doll and I was a spoiled brat.</span> <span id="s195">Finally we parted very good friends.</span> <span id="s196">He became very friendly later on with my husband that I married and he started going out with my cousin and they were until the last moment they were together.</span> <span id="s197">He didn't survive.</span> <span id="s198">She is alive in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So did you get a divorce from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Oh, yes, I had a divorce.</span> <span id="s201">I had to have a divorce.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: So it was a marriage in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s203">Did you have a ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: In the -- yes, we had a ceremony and we had also a divorce.</span> <span id="s205">It was some -- I'm telling you -- it was some big commotion about this, this get.They have to write it with a pen, I think you know, you know the pen they write it with.</span> <span id="s206">It's not really a pen, I think, it's from a turkey or something, the feather.</span> <span id="s207">This is with what they write and when they make a little mistake the whole thing is gone.</span> <span id="s208">Did you ever see such a pen?</span> <span id="s209">You never saw it?</span> <span id="s210">Interesting, very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Why did you think you wanted to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Because I wanted to go to Russia and then my mother said to me, "Irene, you want to go and leave us behind?</span> <span id="s213">How could you?"</span> <span id="s214">And when she said that to me I said, "All right.”</span> <span id="s215">So, here I was stuck with a husband and, and I didn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s216">I was with my parents.</span> <span id="s217">We all lived together with my parents and then it just didn't work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did your mother, did your mother take valuables from your original house before you went into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span

virgin.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So you had some sense that, that life was fragile.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: It was premonition.</span> <span id="s241">We knew if people can be so cruel, anything can happen.</span> <span id="s242">There was no consciousness anymore left in people.</span> <span id="s243">Cruelty and brutality.</span> <span id="s244">We lived every moment and we didn't know what the next moment will bring.</span> <span id="s245">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: When, when you went into the closed ghetto, when the ghetto was closed, were you in that apartment sharing it with this other person or --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, you mean if I lived with him before that?</span> <span id="s248">No, no such a thing didn't happen before

kitchen.</span> <span id="s301">They had the soup kitchens and every worker was getting soup.</span> <span id="s302">This was the only warm thing I think that we had because you didn't have facilities where to cook even.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">02:24:02</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How old would you be in 1940, '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I was, when the war broke out I was

<p><span id="s323">A: There was no way escaping.</span> <span id="s324">Escaping where to?</span> <span id="s325">You see, if we would have connections with population, the rest of the Polish population it was a different story, but the ghetto was divided.</span> <span id="s326">We had a bridge going from one side to another but the trams were going along the ghetto and the Poles would make fun of us.</span> <span id="s327">They looked at us and made all kinds of awful, awful gestures.</span> <span id="s328">So, how -- we, we couldn't connect with anybody.</span> <span id="s329">We

<span id="s334">Didn't have those things.</span> <span id="s335">We didn't have fruits.</span> <span id="s336">We were lucky when we got some potato peels, then we were lucky because you made a big feast out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: So, what, what do you remember eating most days?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: We, when we were getting some flour, were trying to make -- you wouldn't believe how people were so -- they were discovering a new way of cooking because from nothing we made something.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">02:27:12 I didn't know how to cook.</span> <span id="s340">I never learned it from my mother because she didn't know how to cook, so I never learned it.</span> <span id="s341">But in the ghetto after we got married with Bert I started to experiment and somehow I managed.</span> <span id="s342">Listen, it didn't matter anyhow whatever we ate it was just to stuff our stomachs, not to go hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Was there a black

selling.</span> <span id="s348">It was like a bartering business, you know.</span> <span id="s349">They smoked, so they would give away their last piece of bread to get a smoke, to get a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Did, did you smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s352">I never liked the smell of it and I, I was very athletic and I didn't

everything.</span> <span id="s366">You know, when something happened everybody knew.</span> <span id="s367">In two minutes everybody knew.</span> <span id="s368">It was a very close society, you know.</span> <span id="s369">You were close but you knew everything was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did you read the newspaper that came out?</span> <span id="s371">A: Oh yes.</span>

remember.</span> <span id="s376">I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s377">I only know that my professor, when I was born, he was publisher of this paper, Professor Rosenstein.</span> <span id="s378">I have a picture of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">02:30:01 I told you that I got these pictures, I have a picture of him too, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s380">It was -- I told you a lot of things I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Was there any kind of medical care?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: We had, we had hospitals, but people were afraid to go to hospitals because you never knew when the Germans will come in and take everybody out and just get rid of them.</span> <span id="s383">But we had hospitals.</span> <span id="s384">We had good doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you ever get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s387">Once I had to remove, no I had to remove the tonsils so I was in the hospital for two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: That was pretty old to have your tonsils out?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, yes, but all the unusual things happened to me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Now, what happens in terms of work under those circumstances?</span> <span id="s391">Do you lose a food ration if you're in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s393">I don't think so because it was given out I think on weekly basis if I'm not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And how long did you work in this factory?</span> <span id="s395">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: About it must be two or three years.</span> <span id="s397">I think two years, I'm not sure about the dates anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Do you remember the deportations in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I remember that they came to, to the houses, surrounded them and directed everybody out that they could lay hands on.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Were you ever in danger, do you remember?</span> <span id="s401">A: Yes, I, I was, I was a few times in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Can you tell what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes, they were, they were surrounding, they were surrounding this place where I lived and they were grabbing people.</span> <span id="s404">I don't know how, how somebody hid me somewhere.</span> <span id="s405">It's so vague.</span> <span id="s406">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s407">I told you I don't remember a lot of things, but I know somebody saved my life.</span> <span id="s408">Oh, I know, I know.</span> <span id="s409">There was I told you outside, outside of the ghetto there was this big, factory, straw factory and other factories.</span> <span id="s410">And when the Germans announced they are going to grab people, they wanted a transport, Bert sent me with a friend of ours, the one he lives, he's in Canada now, the same fellow, to hide me in one of the factories there because people weren't coming to work.</span> <span id="s411">They weren't working.</span> <span id="s412">It was -- the Germans wanted everybody to stay home so they have it easier, to grab us.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">02:33:05 This fellow took me to this place called Maryzin, part of the city, and hid me until it was over.</span> <span id="s414">I was, I was in the factory.</span> <span id="s415">I was, I was, I think I was the only person there.</span> <span id="s416">There was no one there but me and this young man was with me that brought me over there and when it was over they let us know.</span> <span id="s417">And this, oh, I was sure I was going to be finished this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What did you think was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I thought the Germans will get me, and we didn't know what they were doing with us.</span> <span id="s420">We knew it was nothing good.</span> <span id="s421">I knew it's not going to be a party for sure.</span> <span id="s422">Now I can laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: How were your parents doing during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: My father had a good position.</span> <span id="s425">He was in charge of a Kooperative.</span> <span id="s426">Rumkowski gave him a privileged job because, you know, he never forgot that my father supported him and so on, and my mother was an instructor in a underwear factory.</span> <span id="s427">She knew the business.</span> <span id="s428">This was her business so she was an instructor.</span> <span id="s429">And so, but it was hopeless for my father.</span> <span id="s430">He just, he couldn't adjust to the conditions.</span> <span id="s431">He was killed after the war, the third of May '45, he was on the walk, and they took a transport and wanted to bring them to the sea and drown them there.</span> <span id="s432">He couldn't walk so he was shot.</span> <span id="s433">My brother was there too, and my father said to him, "Run for your life, just leave me alone here and save yourself.”</span> <span id="s434">Pushed him away and my brother ran for his life.</span> <span id="s435">And since I know this story of run for your life, I ran for my life every night because I have always these nightmares and I scream, "Run, run for your life.”</span> <span id="s436">That tells me I don't, I don't remember he told me, "Run for your life."</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: That happens very often?</span> <span id="s438">A: Quite often, very often, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now, when you say that your father -- your mother obviously seemed to adjust a little more to the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: My mother, yes, she was a strong woman, a strong personality, yeah.</span> <span id="s441">She adjusted.</span> <span id="s442">She survived with me.</span> <span id="s443">She was with me in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s444">And because of her I was alive because I think I was giving in.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">02:36:01 I didn't feel like living anymore when we were in the concentration camp and the allies were bombing.</span> <span id="s446">I prayed to God that the bombs should come and get us because we were so sick of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you notice that a number of men that were in a similar position to your father also had a, I don't want to say, an inability to adjust or it was difficult for them to adjust to, to such a situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I don't know how somebody else felt.</span> <span id="s449">I know how my father felt.</span> <span id="s450">He was world -- very worldly, very sophisticated man and had such plans for his children for the future, for a good future, and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s451">He was very depressed and disappointed.</span> <span id="s452">He didn't fight enough to survive.</span> <span id="s453">You had to fight for your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Tell, tell us about meeting Bert.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Oh, as I said, I was married for a few months and was dissolved of the marriage and I was living with my parents.</span> <span id="s456">I worked on the other side of the bridge.</span> <span id="s457">Bert's office was there on the, on the other side and I, I saw him quite often and the corners of my eyes I saw.</span> <span id="s458">I would never turn around.</span> <span id="s459">A lady didn't turn around, but I, I saw him watching me and looking after me.</span> <span id="s460">I could see it.</span> <span id="s461">And one day I came from work going home, he was walking with his secretary and his secretary knew me because he used to work for my father before the war and I knew they were talking about me.</span> <span id="s462">I knew it.</span> <span id="s463">And then this fellow came to, to, to my parents house and said Irene, he wanted a date with me.</span> <span id="s464">I was, I didn't, I was very blue and I had enough.</span> <span id="s465">I didn't want anymore to go out.</span> <span id="s466">My mother said, "Don't sit home.</span> <span id="s467">You don't sit shee'va.Go out and meet people.</span> <span id="s468">Don't just go to work and come home."</span> <span id="s469">And I did and I had this date with him and I came hour earlier because I didn't want to go to this date.</span> <span id="s470">And my mother pushed me, she said, "Go" I said, "Mom it's so late.”</span> <span id="s471">"See if he's there it's fine.</span> <span id="s472">If not you come home.”</span> <span id="s473">We knew it was curfew after a certain hour, I don't remember what time it was you couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s474">So, it means I would be stuck on this date and won't be able to go home.</span> <span id="s475">But I went, an hour late, and he was just turning around to -- he didn't wait anymore and he was walking and he saw me.</span> <span id="s476">So, we went to his boss.</span> <span id="s477">He said his boss is sick, has a cold and we went there and my girlfriend supposed to be the date of his boss.</span> <span id="s478">We come, we come there, he -- and Bert opens the door and greeted me and I don't know when he greeted me, I said "This is it!"</span> <span id="s479">And I had to stay there.</span> <span id="s480">My girlfriend wasn't there, but it turned out that my girlfriend was this fellow's date and Bert was playing violin.</span> <span id="s481">He has a lovely voice and -- yes, he has a lovely voice -- he was singing and we were talking.</span> <span id="s482">And I was -- he knew my life story already from my girlfriend, everything.</span> <span id="s483">I didn't have to tell him anything, but in the morning I went straight to work.</span> <span id="s484">It was few blocks from where he lived.</span> <span id="s485">And this was, is it.</span> <span id="s486">This is how we started dating.</span> <span id="s487">About ten months later we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Then your life changed dramatically then after meeting him?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">9 The seven obligatory days of mourning for the deceased's next of kin (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, it didn't.</span> <span id="s491">No, it didn't because Bert even though he was in a privileged position and he was getting special food, extra, he sent it to my parents, yeah, and there was a girl who used to work for him and she had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s492">He took her in.</span> <span id="s493">She was with us all day long.</span> <span id="s494">At night she went to her family and he didn't want her to work.</span> <span id="s495">She had to take it easy so he made her life easy.</span> <span id="s496">She survived.</span> <span id="s497">She lives in, in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Now, during this ten months, shall I assume that you're living with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s500">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s501">Oh yes, sure I lived with my parents.</span> <span id="s502">There wasn't such a thing as -- you know.</span> <span id="s503">There was respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Did you know Bert was going to go to your parents and ask them -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s506">I didn't know, because you see he had an older sister, she wasn't married yet.</span> <span id="s507">So, when we were talking about, you know, getting -- the second day we met, he told me you are, you are going to be my wife.</span> <span id="s508">I said, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s509">I had a bad experience and I'm too young now to go through it again.</span> <span id="s510">I don't, I don't know what's going to happen.”</span> <span id="s511">And he said to me, “Even though I have an older sister but you are going to be my wife.”</span> <span id="s512">This was the second date we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">02:42:00 And so, we courted for a while and 10 months later we got married.</span> <span id="s514">We were together a few months when the evacuation came and -- oh -- this was awful.</span> <span id="s515">We met 10 months after the war.</span> <span id="s516">I found him 10 months after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did you know his sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Oh, she was with me in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: When did you meet her in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s520">After you met Bert?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes, sure, I didn't know her.</span> <span id="s522">She didn't want me to marry Bert.</span> <span id="s523">She was very much against it.</span> <span id="s524">"Oh, my, my brother is going to be married to some divorced woman."</span> <span id="s525">She was, she was giving him trouble.</span> <span id="s526">So, Rumkowski didn't know about whom they're talking, so he said -- and Bert went to Rumkowski to ask permission to marry me.</span> <span id="s527">He said I want to see your future wife.</span> <span id="s528">I want to see her because your sister is so much against it.</span> <span id="s529">And when I came to him, he invited me to his house.</span> <span id="s530">I came here and I thought he would go ballistic.</span> <span id="s531">He saw me, he says, "You are the one?"</span> <span id="s532">I said yes and I told him the story why I separated from the other one.</span> <span id="s533">And he said, "All right you will get married.</span> <span id="s534">I will give you away, and I will give Dora some sermon.”</span> <span id="s535">And he told her, he told her.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Was that typical that people would go to Rumkowski and ask for permission?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s538">It wasn't typical.</span> <span id="s539">We had a Standesamt,you know.</span> <span id="s540">We had a civil office where you got your, like you get your license here, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s541">But she was against me marrying her brother.</span> <span id="s542">He was the apple of her eye, you know, and she -- he -- thought no one was good enough for, for him, but Rumkowski told her different.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did she adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Oh, yes, she did.</span> <span id="s545">Listen, she survived because of me.</span> <span id="s546">We were in Ravensbrück and it wasn't fun and I really took care of her there.</span> <span id="s547">I took care of her and she came out of it, but she didn't live long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: When you got married, where, where were you married and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: In June, June 27, '43, and it was a place where Rumkowski was giving marriages because Jews weren't allowed to get married and you didn't have wedding bands.</span> <span id="s550">They give you a handkerchief, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">02:45:00 But there was this place that he was giving people away and we married with 18 or 19 people.</span> <span id="s552">I have part of the picture, a few couples with me.</span> <span id="s553">I have it, I told you, yeah.</span> <span id="s554">This is where we got married.</span> <span id="s555">On a honeymoon we didn't go, I assure you.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Was there a small party after?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: It was, no, Dora gave for my parents and her, her family dinner.</span> <span id="s558">This was it.</span> <span id="s559">There was no party.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: And then you had an apartment together you and Bert?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: We had a room and a tiny kitchen.</span> <span id="s562">It was like a divided room with a kitchen.</span> <span id="s563">One little room, one little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Tell me, how did -- no I'll get back to that.</span> <span id="s565">Did you change jobs after you married Bert from the rubber factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No.</span> <span id="s567">I was very low.</span> <span id="s568">I mean lying low.</span> <span id="s569">I didn't make any waves.</span> <span id="s570">I was very -- I socialized very little because after I got -- we knew, knew what was going on, how the people felt so, so, so we didn't socialize too much.</span> <span id="s571">Bert had a group of people, a few couples.</span> <span id="s572">He was the only bachelor, and we met with these people.</span> <span id="s573">We played a lot of cards at times, and we read a lot, but I didn't know many people.</span> <span id="s574">Every-everybody knew me because, you 10 Civil marriage ceremony (German) know, they knew my family.</span> <span id="s575">We, we didn't, we didn't do anything special because like life was so hard and when you, when you came from work you wanted to relax and take it easy.</span> <span id="s576">You never know what's going to happen next again.</span> <span id="s577">And we, we had always surprises.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Like, like they would surround at any time at will every place, every house and direct people out.</span> <span id="s580">We never knew who was next on the

where every dealing went through.</span> <span id="s587">I was waiting at the gate because he promised he will pay us so much merchandise he took and we could live nicely because we were hungry.</span> <span id="s588">I saw him few times pass by in a Droschke.Do you know what a Droschke is?</span> <span id="s589">A horse and a carriage, but he never gave us a penny and when I met him after the war in Munich, like nothing ever happened.</span> <span id="s590">“Oh, Irene, he showed me this big apartment house he owned and on top of the roof he had a swimming pool.”</span> <span id="s591">And he said to me, "Irene this all could you be yours.</span> <span id="s592">You didn't want it.”</span> <span id="s593">I said, "No, I wouldn't and I still don't want it.”</span> <span id="s594">But he never, never gave a penny back.</span> <span id="s595">Bert wrote him a letter that she -- he -- should at least compensate my mother.</span> <span id="s596">He begged me not to tell his wife anything and I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">He married a very lovely woman and this is it.</span> <span id="s598">The end of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Was it

life.</span> <span id="s613">A lot of people were ingenious, really very talented.</span> <span id="s614">We had very talented people.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Did you work on Sunday or Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: We worked every -- I think we didn't -- I don't know, I think we had Sunday free.</span> <span id="s617">Don't quote me, I don't know for sure.</span> <span

your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: In the ghetto yes, but when we were in the concentration camp, we couldn't.</span> <span id="s629">But we did -- you know what I did?</span> <span id="s630">We had this metal pieces coming wrapped in brown paper and we had to take off the paper and wash these pieces of metal with sudsy water.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">02:51:00 So, after we did that, we took the, the pail in the toilet, you know, in the cabin, close up and get undressed and wash with this garbagy water.</span> <span id="s632">And then I had only one pair of pants.</span> <span id="s633">This was it.</span> <span id="s634">No bra or nothing.</span> <span id="s635">So, I would take off the pants, wash it in this water and guess what I would do.</span> <span id="s636">I was working at the, at the press.</span> <span id="s637">I would hang the pants under the table and the heat of the press would almost dry it.</span> <span id="s638">It was half dry.</span> <span id="s639">I would put it on again and this is the way I kept clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: This was at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: This was in, in, in the work camp,

<span id="s647">I was in this factory and as I told you a lot of chemicals, and I was very allergic to it.</span> <span id="s648">So, the doctor gave me a testimony -- a testi -- how do you say it --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: -- to change and so he took me to the housing department.</span> <span id="s651">I was working there.</span> <span id="s652">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Oh, we were, we were designating footage, you know, in one room to people whoever needed a place to live.</span> <span id="s654">They came and we had to investigate how many people lived there and so on and this is how they got their apartments where to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: This must have been a difficult job.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh, yes, it was, it was.</span> <span id="s657">Everything was difficult in the ghetto and in these awful times.</span> <span id="s658">Q: Did you sleep

because it was always in the back of our minds that we don't know what's going to happen next.</span> <span id="s663">You couldn't plan it.</span> <span id="s664">It wasn't a normal way of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did you think about the future?</span> <span id="s666">Did you think about this ending and the war ending?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: As I told you when you are young you are very optimistic.</span> <span id="s668">We were optimistic at one time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s669">We were very -- we were in love, you know, and we were talking about things but we didn't believe we going to make it.</span> <span id="s670">Nobody did believe that we were going to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">02:54:00</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Was it strange for you and Bert to have this ring with the cyanide in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s674">We knew, we knew that we didn't want to go any more through torture and we knew what these people are capable of.</span> <span id="s675">So, Bert was prepared, but my mother one night when we were asleep she cleaned out the rings.</span> <span id="s676">We still have some left over in this ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: So you told her you had these rings?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: My mother knew everything about me.</span> <span

do that.</span> <span id="s688">I could never carry that in my heart that I would do any -- any -- anything wrong to my parents.</span> <span id="s689">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: No, I meant if they wanted an opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: They wouldn't -- they didn't want to.</span> <span id="s692">They didn't want to.</span> <span id="s693">As I told you, I survived because of my mother, my mother.</span> <span id="s694">I gave in.</span> <span id="s695">I threw in the towel.</span> <span id="s696">I didn't want anymore to go on and my mother would slap me and say, "You will see Dad and you will see Bert and you will see David.”</span> <span id="s697">She said, "Just don't give in.”</span> <span id="s698">And she kept me going.</span> <span id="s699">She kept me going.</span> <span id="s700">I didn't want to, you know, we had -- when they bombarded the Allies, the camp, we had to go in, into, go out and we go into the ditches, the anti-aircraft ditches.</span> <span id="s701">In the beginning we did it with my mother, and later on we didn't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s702">We didn't go out.</span> <span id="s703">We were staying where we are, were, and I said, “Whatever happens, happens to me, Mom, if you want to go.”</span> <span id="s704">My mother was with me.</span> <span id="s705">She, she -- somehow we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">02:56:28 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s708">03:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Irene, when you were working in the Housing Department and had to give out -- A: Assign.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: -- assign apartments, was it more difficult when the new transports were coming in since you were so overcrowded to begin with.</span> <span id="s711">What, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: It was hard because here you, came, you had transport came of very special people.</span> <span id="s713">Bright, intelligent, educated, very well to do, they came here to this, to this miserable place and they had to get adjusted.</span> <span id="s714">Was very hard for them to get adjusted.</span> <span id="s715">Then you didn't have apartments, you would give them some space, but you couldn't pick people that have something compatible and you know this was tragedy, tragedy.</span> <span id="s716">You didn't talk the same language.</span> <span id="s717">They couldn't communicate with us.</span> <span id="s718">They spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s719">We spoke mostly Polish, mostly Yiddish, all the people spoke so it was very hard on, on these people.</span> <span id="s720">I felt sorry for them, not for myself because we had a roof over our head, they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">And when they got these rooms, it was one tragedy after another.</span> <span id="s722">They were dying out.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: How did you decide where to put people?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: We tried, we tried to get people from the same cultures, from the same background.</span> <span id="s725">It was, it was a humiliating time, a humiliating experience.</span> <span id="s726">Beautiful people, we had Professor Casparithat was one of the first cancer researcher.</span> <span id="s727">He lost his life, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">03:03:08</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did you have a, a card file of where people were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s731">It was very, very orderly.</span> <span id="s732">Everything was just like clockwork, unbelievable how everything worked the way it's supposed to.</span> <span id="s733">Yeah, we had, we had -- everybody was registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: And they couldn't move unless --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, no where could they move?</span> <span id="s736">They needed space where to live, and space was precious.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">13 Professor Wilhelm Caspari (1872-1944), renown cancer researcher and bacteriologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: In that kind of a situation where people are living under such tension, yeah, with so little food and under difficult apartment situations, was there a lot of fighting and arguments?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Not really, not really, because we all were in the same situation and we all had to do our best to get along.</span> <span id="s740">Life was miserable enough without having any kind of fights, you know, and wars and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s741">Everybody had to try and they did, they did.</span> <span id="s742">My parents, we lived when I was at home we were four people before I got married and there was a lady from Vienna, German speaking with two children in the same room divided by a sheet.</span> <span id="s743">So, people had to make their best.</span> <span id="s744">They had to try very hard and they got along.</span> <span id="s745">I know my parents became very friendly with this lady and tried to help her as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You had said that there were, there were a lot of affairs going on?</span> <span id="s747">A: Yes, life was going on.</span> <span id="s748">And life is one big affair, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Do you think it was more so in some ways because of the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes, because people did things that they would probably have never done ethically or morally.</span> <span id="s751">I know when I was growing up nobody heard about somebody living together and not being married.</span> <span id="s752">It was just unheard of.</span> <span id="s753">Such a person would be ostracized, I know for sure.</span> <span id="s754">People did that in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s755">They had no choices and besides the circumstances, you know.</span> <span id="s756">Maybe he had a better apart -- room -- than I have, and maybe he had a better job than I had so there was a lot of marriages that could never happen if not these circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">03:06:00 Because very young girls sold themselves to, to old men.</span> <span id="s758">What was it?</span> <span id="s759">It wasn't love.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: So they could have a better circumstance?</span> <span id="s761">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Were the men in better working positions so that they got better apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No, no there was, there was absolutely no -- any specific, you know, nobody as I told you, it was tough enough and we had to get along and gender didn't mean a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Women were working.</span> <span id="s765">Whatever they could do.</span> <span id="s766">Naturally women cannot do physical work the way a man can do so but everybody was working.</span> <span id="s767">Otherwise they couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s768">They wouldn't get their rations.</span> <span id="s769">They wouldn't get their food.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: No, I meant you mentioned the fact that some young women would go with much older men that under ordinary circumstances they wouldn't, so it must be that these men could provide something.</span> <span id="s771">They had an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Some, some of the girls needed a father image.</span> <span id="s773">They were left alone.</span> <span id="s774">Their parents were taken away or died away and here somebody's lost and there is nothing worse than loneliness and they were lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Was that the, one of the biggest frights for, for all of you, to be separated?</span> <span id="s776">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s777">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Could you talk about Rumkowski threatening, threatening you and why he would get angry with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes, he knew me quite well, since my early childhood, and he knew me.</span> <span id="s780">I had a big mouth.</span> <span id="s781">And Bert, whenever we knew that there comes evacuation or they called it Razzia,when they surrounded the houses and, and took out the people, when we knew about it Bert was sick.</span> <span id="s782">He wasn't sick.</span> <span id="s783">I told him you are not going anywhere, you are staying here.</span> <span id="s784">Let your partner go.</span> <span id="s785">I wouldn't let him go.</span> <span id="s786">It happened a few times that whenever something was, Bert was sick.</span> <span id="s787">So, Rumkowski called me and in Yiddish he said to me I'm not going -- you want to tell in Yiddish -- he said to me I'm going to send you with a broom to sweep the, the streets because I know it's your head and you stay out of it and if ever happens I send you with a broom.</span> <span id="s788">He knew, he knew it was my idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Now, now you didn't want Bert to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I didn't want him to, to be responsible or have part on something that we don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s791">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s792">It was a good intuition of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">03:09:01</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So, he never participated in deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, he didn't.</span> <span id="s796">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s797">Every, every factory when there was an evacuation, everybody had to give a list and they gave lists of people that they couldn't use in was because, you know, everybody was registered -- even the little children.</span> <span id="s798">So, every, every factory was really responsible for the people that went.</span> <span id="s799">They had to give names.</span> <span id="s800">They had to give people.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">14 Raid (German).</span> <span id="s802">The Fascist term for a roundup of people, often Jews.</span> <span id="s803">Used by Nazis in relation to anti-Jewish Aktionen.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: A terrible responsibility.</span> <span id="s805">A: Terrible, the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Do you know whether people refused to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Not that I know, not that I know.</span> <span id="s808">I wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Do you remember the times when they took the children after Rumkowski gave that speech?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I didn't hear -- the first time I heard this speech was here when I saw the movie here.</span> <span id="s811">I never heard it, but my family was involved too, because my uncle had two little girls and they took the children.</span> <span id="s812">They took the girls.</span> <span id="s813">My aunt wouldn't go with the children.</span> <span id="s814">My uncle said he wouldn't let the children go alone.</span> <span id="s815">He doesn't -- we didn't know where they were going, but he didn't want them to be alone without somebody of parent, of a parent and he went with them.</span> <span id="s816">He went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s817">Later on we found out.</span> <span id="s818">He never made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: But the mother didn't go?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: No, she didn't survive.</span> <span id="s821">We never heard from her again after the war so we don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">But usually the mother was the tigress.</span> <span id="s823">Usually the mother was the one that was there for her children, especially a Jewish mother and here she didn't want to go so my, my uncle went.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: When, when they did the deportations and the evacuations in the factory and the houses, was there a particularly horrible atmosphere in the ghetto at these, at these times?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: It was a panic, sheer panic.</span> <span id="s826">People were running like -- did you ever see a mound -- this is the way it looked, the ghetto looked, everybody was running.</span> <span id="s827">Everyone was running aimless.</span> <span id="s828">Nobody knew where they are going.</span> <span id="s829">There was no place to run and hide but people were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Were you ever on a list before 1944?</span> <span id="s831">A: On what list?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: A deportation list, or was there not a list?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: There were no lists.</span> <span id="s834">They, they grabbed people at random.</span> <span id="s835">03:12:01 This is what I said about the Razzia.</span> <span id="s836">They just came, surrounded the place, and went from basement to attic and took everybody out whomever they could get and this was the way.</span> <span id="s837">They threw them in, in the pickup trucks like, like a piece of merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Did you see these?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Some of them I saw, some of them I saw.</span> <span id="s840">I told you I was hidden and I saw them coming with the truck and picking up people and then the truck left.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Did you have nightmares there?</span> <span id="s842">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: In the, in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: It was one big nightmare, the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s845">Q: So one didn't distinguish?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, it wasn't a real world.</span> <span id="s847">It was a night -- big, big night -- scary nightmare.</span> <span id="s848">Q: Did Bert tell you about the radio reports, the underground radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I knew it, I knew it because this oral surgeon, this friend of ours, he was very technical.</span> <span id="s850">He could do anything with his hands and one day I come into the room and I see they're listening.</span> <span id="s851">I said, "Bert you're going to pay with your life.”</span> <span id="s852">He said, "What does it matter?</span> <span id="s853">This way we, we could give people hope.”</span> <span id="s854">They were spreading whatever they heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Nothing about out lives.</span> <span id="s856">Only the western front, the eastern front, you know, Russia and the Allies and so on.</span> <span id="s857">This we knew.</span> <span id="s858">We knew exactly because they were listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Did they ever hear the reports from the Polish government in exile from Britain and what they were doing on the radio then?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s861">They just had reports were approaching our midst because they were already liberated in I think in '44.</span> <span id="s862">The Lódz ghetto was way before us liberated.</span> <span id="s863">I think in January of '44 and we were liberated in '45 in April.</span> <span id="s864">They were liberated by the end of '44, the Lódz ghetto.</span> <span id="s865">The end of '44 beginning of '45.</span> <span id="s866">This was they ended.</span> <span id="s867">We still had a year to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: What was that last deportation?</span> <span id="s869">You were on the last deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We, we were on the last deportation.</span> <span id="s871">Bert went to Koenigswusterhausen with the men and the women.</span> <span id="s872">I went to Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">03:15:03</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: They sold us after we came in Nov -- October.</span> <span id="s876">I was there maybe three weeks.</span> <span id="s877">They sold us right away.</span> <span id="s878">They put us out naked in November and the young Germans came to look us over, the transport, you know.</span> <span id="s879">The only thing was missing they didn't look at our teeth because they looked everything over.</span> <span id="s880">It was a very nice transport, young women, professional young women.</span> <span id="s881">And they sold us so we went to this working camp from Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Did they select some people out from your group or did you all go?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Older women with a few children went to the camp Bert was where the men, where Biebow'speople went -- Biebow's camp.</span> <span id="s884">This is where they went.</span> <span id="s885">And the young women, that we were, we were staying there and sent to, to the camp to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: What was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: It was, first we were in Ravensbrück and they sent us to Tzana Arado.</span> <span id="s888">There was this airplane factory, Arado, this is where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: What, what do you remember about Ravensbrück?</span> <span id="s890">Was this -- you were there for a couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I was -- what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s892">They also had crematorium also there.</span> <span id="s893">They, they did check us out.</span> <span id="s894">We had an obstetric doctor.</span> <span id="s895">You know, I was -- they knew very little because they were checking me out and injecting something.</span> <span id="s896">I don't know what it was and I heard one woman talking to the other, "Oh, she's a virgin.”</span> <span id="s897">You see how little they knew because I was already a married lady.</span> <span id="s898">They, after the war, I had problems conceiving and my brother told me that the, the obstetrician that checked me out, a friend, said that I need a miracle that I will never make it, they exper -- because of the experimentation.</span> <span id="s899">It took me a long time.</span> <span id="s900">It took me over a year and, and running from one doctor to another and a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s901">I conceived.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So, they injected you with you something?</span> <span id="s903">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: More than once?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">15 Hans Biebow (1902-1947) was the head of the Lódz Ghetto administration</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Once, once when we first arrived.</span> <span id="s907">They shaved everybody's head.</span> <span id="s908">I wasn't shaved because before we left I said to Bert, you know if they have to do the job I better do it by myself and had a crewcut like a boy's cut.</span> <span id="s909">So, they didn't touch me.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">03:18:03</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Before you left Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Be-before we left the hospital, you know.</span> <span id="s913">We were in a hospital together, like a camp, before they sent us out on the trip.</span> <span id="s914">So, I, I told you we had the last supper there and I cut my hair so short, they didn't touch me because everybody was bald.</span> <span id="s915">They, they really cut -- shaved -- them.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Where did you get that idea from to cut your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s918">I told you I lived by my intuition most of the time, not by my wits, by my intuition.</span> <span id="s919">I has a terr-it scares me sometimes because sometimes things are going to happen and I know in advance.</span> <span id="s920">I saw it and I lived it and I keep on telling Bert, “Listen to me because every time you listen to me you know I'm right,” and now he, we had to wait so many years for him to find out that I'm right, the intuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: When you got to Ravensbrück, did you begin to find out what had been happening in the, in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes, you see, we were privileged.</span> <span id="s923">We lived on the gypsy block, 2,000 gypsies and they were so proud being German gypsies, they treated us to cruelly you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s924">You know Paroe.</span> <span id="s925">they said he never went to the bathroom, the same happened to us, because as soon as we would go to, to do what we had to do, they would, they would drag us out.</span> <span id="s926">They would never let us go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s927">So, when we came to the factory, you know, every morning at 5:00 o'clock in the morning we were already walking for miles to go to the factory, this is where I washed, I told you, and this is where we did what we had to do because we couldn't do it in Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Could you speak with each other, they gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I spoke German so it was no problem.</span> <span id="s930">You had an advantage if you, if you could communicate.</span> <span id="s931">It helped so much more.</span> <span id="s932">My life was really saved by Princess Potocka, a very known Polish family.</span> <span id="s933">She was a young woman of 30 that time and she was working with us in the factory in Arado, and she had an, an affair going with some German Meisteror something.</span> <span id="s934">He was in charge, a German fellow, and then one SS woman</span></p> <p><span id="s935">16 Master (German) from the kitchen, she was in charge fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s936">She was a very attractive woman and brought her over to the kitchen, wouldn't let her go anymore to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">03:21:05 So I became the mailman.</span> <span id="s938">It, it isn't funny because I paid almost with my life once, but I was getting letters from her to give it to him.</span> <span id="s939">Before I went home in the evening, he would give me a note for her and I would stick it somewhere, you know, and every night when I came to the camp I would have a big bowl of very thick soup and I would share it with my mother, with Bert's sister and another young girl was very sick -- heart condition, I would share it with her, too.</span> <span id="s940">She passed away a few months later, but she saved my life.</span> <span id="s941">I mean, all right, I did a job for her but for until the liberation every single day I came I could count on a good soup and I think this kept me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Was the work hard in Zana, in the airplane factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes, it is hard because a little woman sitting with a, with a air hammer, which you know the body goes and the whole thing goes, it is hard and I wasn't the best worker, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Yes, it was hard, but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s945">I really was.</span> <span id="s946">I was lucky the fellow that was in charge of where I worked, a German also, he was very nice to me, a married man, middle age, and he felt sorry for us so this poor women coming here and struggling.</span> <span id="s947">He would bring me a butt of a cigar, he would bring me from his wife a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s948">At least I had a pair of pants to change.</span> <span id="s949">He would make me a comb so my hair started to grow out.</span> <span id="s950">I could -- he was really nice, nice to me, wonderful.</span> <span id="s951">With this butt, you know, I could get two pieces of bread for that.</span> <span id="s952">And this is how I survived.</span> <span id="s953">After the war we said thank you to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And now you were injured in some way in Zana, is that right?</span> <span id="s955">You had blood poisoning?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Oh, I have -- see this?</span> <span id="s957">A souvenir for life, yeah.</span> <span id="s958">From this metal, I got probably a, a cut and I had poisoning and there was one SS woman, young we called her Snow White because she was so charming and so gentle with us.</span> <span id="s959">She had to watch over us, you know, so we don't escape or anything else, and she went with me with when I had this in three places at the same time I had this blood poisoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">03:24:01 She took me to, to a doctor that came with us on the transport, a young Jewish woman, and she took the tweezers, just pulled it off.</span> <span id="s961">Opened up the -- and I don't know how it healed.</span> <span id="s962">It took a long time, you know, complications, but it healed.</span> <span id="s963">It seems that a young person can survive everything.</span> <span id="s964">So I was lucky that people took to me and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s965">I was really lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Were you ever hurt or beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No, I wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Not your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: My mother was, I wasn't.</span> <span id="s970">My mother shortly before the liberation when the Allies start to bomb, people got very uneasy, very nervous.</span> <span id="s971">The natives, the natives, and they took out Hälftling,we were Hälftling, you know.</span> <span id="s972">They took us out, they took the women, which didn't go to the factory to dig the anti-aircraft ditches.</span> <span id="s973">And I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s974">My mother didn't move fast enough.</span> <span id="s975">They beat her up, but how -- I didn't believe she was going to make it.</span> <span id="s976">She was all over black and blue.</span> <span id="s977">But they didn't touch me.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: How do you account for your mother's spirit and her ability to keep you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: I, I thought, I thought that, I always thought that she was a very smart woman, very bright woman.</span> <span id="s980">She was a young woman, after the war she was in her beginning 40s but people were always, all the people coming for advice to her because she was that kind of a person that everybody liked her.</span> <span id="s981">She corresponded with the whole world.</span> <span id="s982">The letters she was receiving even after she passed away and the pictures and so on.</span> <span id="s983">I saw it.</span> <span id="s984">She was a strong personality, you know and the chance of survival was much better than somebody that is very frugal, you know, frail.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: And she was really important to you?</span> <span id="s986">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Tell me about the -- I don't know how to -- we use the word liberation but it's such a long process.</span> <span id="s988">What, what are you thinking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: I think about that you are never liberated.</span> <span id="s990">I'm going to freak out I know it.</span> <span id="s991">Can we stop?</span> <span id="s992">03:27:01</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Irene could you describe the period of time when it looks as if the war is going to be over, what we seem to be calling liberation.</span> <span id="s994">What went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: We didn't know when it's going to be over until the moment it was over, because here we were in this working camp.</span> <span id="s996">It's true that they didn't, they didn't do anything to us.</span> <span id="s997">They didn't rape us.</span> <span id="s998">They didn't -- we were caged and went to work and came from work and we didn't know until the 26th of April '45 when we saw the women SS and the men 17 Nazi term for persons incarcerated in a concentration, slave labor, or other type of camp (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s999">packing stuff and going away.</span> <span id="s1000">Suddenly we saw everybody is running and we didn't budge.</span> <span id="s1001">We didn't move because where could we go.</span> <span id="s1002">To whom could we run?</span> <span id="s1003">And this is how we found out about the we are free, free to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: What did you do during the bombardments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I was lying on my with, with my mother on the bunk.</span> <span id="s1006">We, we didn't move.</span> <span id="s1007">In the beginning we did, but later on we didn't even move.</span> <span id="s1008">We didn't have the energy.</span> <span id="s1009">We were walking for hours every day.</span> <span id="s1010">We didn't have clothes.</span> <span id="s1011">We were wearing like blue jeans uniforms, not even with long sleeves, you know.</span> <span id="s1012">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1013">It was cold and, and we were hungry and we didn't have any, any hygienic possibilities, you know?</span> <span id="s1014">They gave us a very watery, like a Kamillenteesoup.</span> <span id="s1015">You know, I used it to wash, I didn't eat it.</span> <span id="s1016">This was only to drink, but I needed it to wash.</span> <span id="s1017">We didn't, we didn't know what was going on until we saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Then when everybody was running, the people started to look for food.</span> <span id="s1019">They went to this factory restaurant they went, and they had a warehouse full of food and they start to grab it and eat it and there's so many got dysentery and all kinds of -- and I was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1020">I was organizing the food and giving it away to everybody.</span> <span id="s1021">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1022">I didn't need to eat anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Who were the soldiers that came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: We had the Russian soldiers that came in.</span> <span id="s1025">Q: Were they kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1027">To us they were, you know, like people say, they were raping -- they didn't have to rape.</span> <span id="s1028">The German women were standing in line to be, to be raped, to get a bar of chocolate or some cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">03:30:03 They didn't have to rape.</span> <span id="s1030">In any case, we were ten women in a, in a house after the liberation when they starting shooting everybody.</span> <span id="s1031">I was the youngest woman there and all these ladies with their daughters, they wanted to, they wanted to run with me.</span> <span id="s1032">And the Russian soldiers, they were fighting.</span> <span id="s1033">It was on the Elbe River, the fighting going on.</span> <span id="s1034">This is where we were located and they, they told us not to go in groups because the Germans will think it's military and they will start shooting so I ran and all these people ran after me and we came to a small town already Russian occupied.</span> <span id="s1035">I went to the Kommandant and he gave us a house of a German doctor that run away.</span> <span id="s1036">He gave us a soldier to stay all 18 Chamomile tea (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">19 Commander (German) night long to, to watch over us so I can't complain.</span> <span id="s1038">We were very -- I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1039">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s1040">We always had nice people to take care of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: And you didn't know what was happening to Bert or where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: No, I didn't, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1043">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1044">They told me that he's dead and I didn't give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">I was looking for him every where.</span> <span id="s1046">After the war I told you we were in this small town on the Elbe River, the Commandant made me a translator, you know.</span> <span id="s1047">German, I spoke already English and Russian and we didn't have -- it was like a hole in the wall.</span> <span id="s1048">It was far away, we didn't have any, we didn't have anybody to communicate with and one day a young man, 18 years old, comes to our door.</span> <span id="s1049">He's, he's looking some place to live, a young boy, a Polish boy.</span> <span id="s1050">So, my mother said to me, ”You know Irene, we will take this boy in.”</span> <span id="s1051">Maybe somebody would take care of David.</span> <span id="s1052">We did.</span> <span id="s1053">It's a long story.</span> <span id="s1054">Through him I found Bert.</span> <span id="s1055">And Dora, Dora was with us.</span> <span id="s1056">Bert I found through him, through this young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: He was, he spoke fluent Russian.</span> <span id="s1059">He came from the Russian part of Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1060">Speaking Rus -- speaking, they spoke Russian, and the boy made accqua-acquaintances and we were close to Berlin, very short distance to Berlin and he would go to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">03:33:02 He was smuggling.</span> <span id="s1062">I was working for the commander and I had to go and buy pro -- get provisions for the commander and I did it.</span> <span id="s1063">So, to the commander went a part and a part went to our house where all the ten of us were living.</span> <span id="s1064">They had, I ate with the commandant, it was a group.</span> <span id="s1065">And one day this -- Genneg(ph) was his name -- came home and he said there is a nunnery and they have men, they are all swollen up from hunger after the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1066">He's very sick and they don't have enough food for.</span> <span id="s1067">So, my mother started to make packages.</span> <span id="s1068">We had plenty of food and this Genneg took the bicycle and every day he delivered the food.</span> <span id="s1069">Came a time when he comes and he says he's all right he's going back to Lódz and he wants you to, to write down your names and where you are and I said to my mother, so we write.</span> <span id="s1070">He will throw it away some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Mother says, “But it doesn't harm you to write it down,” so we did.</span> <span id="s1072">He went to Lódz, he put it at the town hall and my brother was there with a friend and the friend says, "Look, this is your mother and Irene here.”</span> <span id="s1073">He knew where to find us and he found us.</span> <span id="s1074">This, this was he found us.</span> <span id="s1075">The men survived and he was grateful and, and he gave me a chance to find my brother.</span> <span id="s1076">And then my brother they, they started him to get involved, you know to translate and so on and I started and he told me that he heard that Bert was alive.</span> <span id="s1077">He didn't know where but he knows he's alive.</span> <span id="s1078">So, there is nothing for me to do here anymore, I'm going to look for him.</span> <span id="s1079">Went to Berlin, got the papers because at that time -- Germany was divided already, English zone, American zone and so on -- got the papers and I brought over the first transport of people from Berlin to the English zone, 60 people of us.</span> <span id="s1080">We come to Brunswick, this is two hours from Han-Hannover, I think a short distance from, and I am at the railroad station with Dora and I said -- my mother was left behind with my brother in this small town -- I said we have to get on this train no matter what.</span> <span id="s1081">And as we talk a young man comes over and he recognized me and I said you know I heard that my, my husband is alive but I'm looking for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">03:36:02 So he says you know I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1083">Your husband is an angel.</span> <span id="s1084">Why?</span> <span id="s1085">He was working in the town hall, Bert, voluntary, and this man, it was curfew after the war.</span> <span id="s1086">Certain times you couldn't move around and you needed papers, identification.</span> <span id="s1087">Bert wrote him out the papers and gave him everything and he wanted to give him money.</span> <span id="s1088">So, Bert says when I do for someone a fa-favor I don't take pay for it and go and Gesundheit.I met this fellow at the railroad station and he told me where Bert was.</span> <span id="s1089">I knew where he was.</span> <span id="s1090">So, we got on this train at four in the morning.</span> <span id="s1091">You know people were hanging on trains.</span> <span id="s1092">You didn't have a regular, you know -- it was right after the war.</span> <span id="s1093">We got there to Hannover and then the experience how we met it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1094">But it's a long story, too long.</span> <span id="s1095">But we met.</span> <span id="s1096">I found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: And then, Dora thought I didn't have feelings because when I saw him not one tear came out of my eye.</span> <span id="s1099">I was just like a, like a piece of ice.</span> <span id="s1100">I couldn't, I couldn't comprehend and I didn't believe it's real because every man I saw on the street I thought it was Bert.</span> <span id="s1101">Well, but then two days later, I got very, very sick.</span> <span id="s1102">The reaction was delayed.</span> <span id="s1103">It came later, so, yeah, then we started our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: You stayed in Hannover for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Four years.</span> <span id="s1106">'49 we left, '45 we met, August '45 and in '49 we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1107">Q: Was that difficult to be in Germany for those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: It was very difficult because every stone was full of blood and we knew it, and we, whenever we looked at a German we thought maybe you were the killer of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did you want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yes, yes, we wanted to.</span> <span id="s1111">We wanted to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1112">Q: So, were you trying for four years to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">20 God bless you (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yes, we registered and then we, we waited for better times.</span> <span id="s1115">Q: Were, were you both able to speak English at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1117">Oh, I didn't tell you this most important thing.</span> <span id="s1118">When I met Bert I didn't speak German, and he didn't speak Polish and we communicated in English.</span> <span id="s1119">And my wedding band and his was inscribed in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">03:39:01 I wrote him down for better and for worse and he wrote me down forever yours, and the two rings survived, yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">My daughters have one and the other one has the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Now had you both learned English prior to meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1124">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1125">We grew up with learning, with languages.</span> <span id="s1126">I told you I loved languages, and they came very easy to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And what was it like for you when you came to this country?</span> <span id="s1128">Was this, was this difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Sure it was difficult because we didn't have anybody.</span> <span id="s1130">Bert started to work the second day we came here.</span> <span id="s1131">He started to walk the waterfront of New York and he saw help wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">So he was sweeping -- with all his education he was sweeping the floors.</span> <span id="s1133">Six months later he was the administrator of the place, of the factory and he stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s1134">They wouldn't give him a break.</span> <span id="s1135">He wouldn't get paid right for what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1136">He quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh, I worked, I worked all the time.</span> <span

educated.</span> <span id="s1144">You had to have your common sense and, and know what you were doing, but they sent me there and I started to work in this firm and I worked all this, through the different stages because we were moving a lot.</span> <span id="s1145">Bert was traveling and we were moving.</span> <span id="s1146">We went to Scranton.</span> <span id="s1147">We were in many

Munich.</span> <span id="s1154">When we saw him last time and we were talking he said you know Irene, these Germans, our people didn't learn yet.</span> <span id="s1155">They didn't learn from all the experience and it's so true.</span> <span id="s1156">Nobody learned because we thought it was going to be a great world that people learned from their mistakes and it's going to be a good place to be alive and live and -- but look what happens.</span> <span id="s1157">It's worse than before the second world war.</span> <span id="s1158">All the signs are there.</span> <span id="s1159">All this

with all the corpus delecti,they have everything there and the people, the soldiers, the American soldiers that came into these places and smelled the stench and, and saw this, this cruelty and people still deny it, and they're young people.</span> <span id="s1167">The future leaders of this country...Don't make me cry again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Is there anything that we have

are here.</span> <span id="s1173">That people are denying the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1174">No, you just can't let it because the, the future generations have to avoid anything like happen again, and it can happen anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Is there something particular you'd like to say to your children or to other people's children who might watch this about your life and about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Oh, my life is not extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1177">It's just a life of one of the six millions or more, and what would I want to

work out.</span> <span id="s1180">It won't.</span> <span id="s1181">You have to work for it.</span> <span id="s1182">You have to do something about it to make it a better tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: When you look at contemporary history now with Rwanda and Bosnia do you, do you wonder if civilization can ever change?</span> <span id="s1184">Does it depress you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: It's -- I think that people can change.</span> <span id="s1186">People can change, but what we lack is leadership.</span> <span id="s1187">You need somebody to look up to.</span> <span id="s1188">This is how it used to be with the movies, you know, young people I remember when I was young you went to a movie you had an idol.</span> <span id="s1189">People that did good things and, and they were heroes.</span> <span id="s1190">What kind of heroes do we have today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">To whom could we look up to?</span> <span id="s1192">Do you know someone that you can look up to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Do, do you understand why people sometimes criticize Rumkowski?</span> <span id="s1194">He has -- do you think it's totally inappropriate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: I think it's inappropriate because I can be objective about it.</span> <span id="s1196">I saw everything happening.</span> <span id="s1197">I lived through it.</span> <span

stretching the days, stretching them, and because of him a lot of people survived.</span> <span id="s1204">But you know, every -- a lot of people have grudges.</span> <span id="s1205">You do something good for them 10 times, 11 times you can't -- you make an enemy.</span> <span id="s1206">The 10 times are forgotten.</span> <span id="s1207">This is why I, I think it is disappointing but what can I say?</span> <span id="s1208">Who am I to say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Nobody can judge.</span> <span id="s1210">Nobody can judge that didn't live through it.</span></p> <p><span
