And I wanted to start by asking you what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: At birth it was Werner Walter Katzenstein and curious that the German Board of Register said, you’ve got to have a middle name, and so my father added it.</span> <span id="s7">I dropped it when I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Where were you born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I was born April 29th, 1922 in a little town called Wallensen, i-in the county of Hamelin, where -- the “Pied Piper of Hamelin”?</span> <span id="s10">Near Hannover, in that part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Can you tell me about your hometown?</span> <span id="s12">Was it big or small, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: That was not really my hometown.</span> <span id="s14">My father was a manager of a farm supply business, and in 1922 - ’23, there was the inflation in Germany and things were pretty bad for my grandparents in the town of Herleshausen, which is in the center part of Germany near the city of Eisenart.</span> <span id="s15">And my father came in ’23, and he again started to form his own business of farm supplies, which was really the -- the family business, my grandfather had it, uncles had it and th-they dealt with farmers, buying and selling.</span> <span id="s16">He started his business in the -- what was it?</span> <span id="s17">A laundry ho-house that my grandparents had.</span> <span id="s18">And he got on a bicycle and he started to build up his own business.</span> <span id="s19">That was in 1923.</span> <span id="s20">And th-the town was about 1500 people, a small Jewish congregation of about 15 families.</span> <span id="s21">My grandfather was the Gabbai of the congregation and I remember on Shabbas carrying out the aliyahs to the members o-of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s22">And I grew up, a relatively normal life, just before Hitler, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of Eisenart.</span> <span id="s23">High school was not compulsory, it was voluntary.</span> <span id="s24">There was a small tuition but not significant.</span> <span id="s25">I started there ’32, and I went to school by train.</span> <span id="s26">At the ol -- the s-students that traveled by train, traveled in one compartment.</span> <span id="s27">When Hitler came to power April 30th, 1933, they kicked me out of the compartment, they beat me up through the train, they chased me.</span> <span id="s28">In the beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in the city of Eisenart for a couple of weeks, and then I got back on the train and stayed home again.</span> <span id="s29">In school not much changed, that depended on the individual teacher.</span> <span id="s30">I can say the gym teacher used me to dust off the equipment.</span> <span id="s31">He made me sit on the equipment and he dusted [indecipherable] with my gym pants.</span> <span id="s32">There were swimming lessons.</span> <span id="s33">We were three Jewish boys in a class, we were completely ignorant.</span> <span id="s34">So that was ’33, and the next step was my father’s business.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Let -- let me stop you for a just a second, you’re running a little bit ahead of me.</span> <span id="s36">I need you to tell me your father’s name and what he did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My father na -- father’s name was Joseph Katzenstein and my mother’s name was Irma.</span> <span id="s38">He eventually built up a very good sized business that he had first a man with horse and wagon making deliveries.</span> <span id="s39">Much later on he bought a truck and the same man become a truck driver.</span> <span id="s40">My mother was in the office, she had the office, and they sold feed -- seeds, to the farmers, and also bought grain and so on from the farmers that my father sold to the mills.</span> <span id="s41">This was -- this is now the early 30’s.</span> <span id="s42">In 1935, the German government --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: I -- I wanted to ask you one more question about your father before you went ahead.</span> <span id="s44">Was your father ever in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, my father was in World War I.</span> <span id="s46">He was in Poland and he was in a prisoner of war camp and he was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s47">He said anti-Semitism was there already then.</span> <span id="s48">He remembers a bullet of one his own comrades going past his head.</span> <span id="s49">He, in 1919, when Germany ga-gave up, they just got on a train and went home.</span> <span id="s50">So that was 1919 and I’ll go back now to the -- ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: One more question, did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I had one brother who survived, and he lives in the Detroit area.</span> <span id="s53">My father’s -- the German government prohibited my father to buy grain from the farmer, and that stopped the business because the farmer could not buy from him any more.</span> <span id="s54">So he made a decision that he wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s55">I have something else to [indecipherable], which I forgot.</span> <span id="s56">In 1933, when Hitler came to power, in our county, every Jewish man was put in the county prison.</span> <span id="s57">My father was in there for about eight, 10 days.</span> <span id="s58">They were mistreated, but he didn’t tel -- talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s59">He wanted to leave Germany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here, she said, I’m supposed to leave?</span> <span id="s60">My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he’ll be voted out again.</span> <span id="s61">Th-Then, as I said, in ’35, he -- we had -- the business wa-was gone and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s62">He decided where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries weren’t open.</span> <span id="s63">He had an uncle which lived near Holland and he was able to buy two properties in Holland belonging to people in Germany.</span> <span id="s64">You were only allowed to take 10 marks out of Germany, but he bought two properties in Holland, and then we were allowed to move to Holland.</span> <span id="s65">This was 1937.</span> <span id="s66">And we had a boarding house, we had cows.</span> <span id="s67">I started farming with a big Belgian horse and what else could we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So -- be -- I want to stay with -- with Germany for just a few more moments --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: -- ask a few more questions.</span> <span id="s71">When you were a young child in school, what did you want to be when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I always wanted to be an architect, there was no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s73">I had planned that well in advance.</span> <span id="s74">But I went -- the high school that I went to was a realschule.</span> <span id="s75">We didn’t have Latin, so you couldn’t become a doctor, but it cou -- you could go on t -- to any other education.</span> <span id="s76">But then in 1935, when we decided that we had to leave Germany, I quit school, I was fo -- when I was -- no six -- ’36.</span> <span id="s77">I wa -- 14, you were no longer -- had ne -- compulsory to go to school, you could go out on your own.</span> <span id="s78">And since we were going into farming, I went to work for a gardener and learned a little bit there.</span> <span id="s79">My father knew farming quite well because he advised farmers what to do.</span> <span id="s80">So when we came to Holland, again, we went into farming.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Still on Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Can you walk me through some of the changes that the Jewish community experienced after Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s84">I -- now -- you -- you were -- you can talk about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, I know this --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: -- years from ’33 to ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I know this, they had Winterhilfe, which was they collected money to help the poor people, the Jewish cu -- community had to do that too.</span> <span id="s88">My grandfather, as the president of the congregation was in charge of that, and I was sent out to collect for Winterhilfe [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s89">We were four or five Jewish children in town and at Hebrew school we had a teacher.</span> <span id="s90">In those days that one man was a teacher, a Chazzan, a Shochet, he did everything.</span> <span id="s91">And I remember synagogue very well.</span> <span id="s92">At 1928 it was completely remo-modeled because it was very old, and I -- I remember the services and all those things as a child.</span> <span id="s93">Be -- it was part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Do you remember reading any of the newspapers in Germany while you were still living there?</span> <span id="s95">Do you remember any anti-Semitic literature?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I -- I’m sure we read a daily paper, but I-I was too young to really understand or to read it, I -- as I said, I was 12 -- ’35, I was -- I was Bar Mitzvah in ’35, and I mean, I-I -- I don’t think I read the paper much.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What were you allowed to take with you when you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: What were you -- what could you take with you?</span> <span id="s100">You personally, when you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: We were allowed to take almost anything, and we packed with the supervision of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s102">We actually took two railroad cars full of farm equipment and things we needed in the house.</span> <span id="s103">I had a stamp collection and they looked it over, obvious it wasn’t tremendous.</span> <span id="s104">And we got almost ready to take everything we wanted except they wouldn’t permit my father to take a new car.</span> <span id="s105">He wanted to take a new car and they said no way.</span> <span id="s106">A -- a little sidelight.</span> <span id="s107">My father was suing the German government then, for a tax matter.</span> <span id="s108">And they told him, if you sue the German government, we won’t let you go.</span> <span id="s109">So, of course he had to drop that.</span> <span id="s110">And then we went to Holland in ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Was Holland the place that you thought you would stay, or was it a stopping point along a -- a larger path?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: We lived right along the German border, and my father’s aim was to can you go -- continue leaving.</span> <span id="s113">I mean, he didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s114">He wanted to leave in ’33, he certainly wanted to go on.</span> <span id="s115">And of course, he wanted to take as many [indecipherable] from Germany with him.</span> <span id="s116">He tried South America, you name it, anything.</span> <span id="s117">We weren’t registered anywhere.</span> <span id="s118">And he once had permission to go to England to take -- start a training farm for the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s119">And while he was in Amsterdam to get his visa, or permit, whatever, he ran into a German Jewish attorney who knew the immigration laws.</span> <span id="s120">And he said, you’re a farmer?</span> <span id="s121">You don’t go to England, you go to United States.</span> <span id="s122">My father said, how can I go to United States, I’m not even registered in the quota.</span> <span id="s123">A skilled farmer will be automatically inserted in the quota.</span> <span id="s124">So we had to present to the American consulate in Rotterdam, my father’s background and we got permission to come to United States.</span> <span id="s125">A little sidelight here.</span> <span id="s126">My mother’s father, my grandfather had come to us, to live with us in Holland after we had applied to come to the United States, and of course we wanted to take him with us.</span> <span id="s127">And sad to say that the American consul in Rotterdam was anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s128">He told my father, if he asks me once more, I won’t get you go.</span> <span id="s129">So my grandfather stayed in Amsterdam with a cousin of my father’s, and he died a natural death in 1941.</span> <span id="s130">But the cousin, husband, they got killed.</span> <span id="s131">We left June 9th, 1939 [indecipherable] Amsterdam to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Tell me about the time that you stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s133">How -- how much were you aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s135">As I said, we lived along the border, and people came to us illegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad, where we would help the people that came in, got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen, where we lived.</span> <span id="s136">And he would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler.</span> <span id="s137">And they would then help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to stay.</span> <span id="s138">I mean, we had cases where people went right back.</span> <span id="s139">One of the Dutch border policemen ha -- was forced to put some people back into Germany, and he told me, I won’t do that again.</span> <span id="s140">And you know, thing -- when they were caught they were done for.</span> <span id="s141">This was right after Kristallnacht, yeah.</span> <span id="s142">Yeah, tha -- there wasn’t much after that.</span> <span id="s143">I mean, we got our permission to go, we sold our property and -- until everything was ordered, til we have our tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: How do people know how to find you on this underground railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Believe it or not, the German border police helped.</span> <span id="s146">They said, over there is a -- another Jew.</span> <span id="s147">He will help you.</span> <span id="s148">There were some German border police that did that.</span> <span id="s149">Some came over blind and somehow wound up with us.</span> <span id="s150">Since we had a boarding house in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them to us while they would try to get permission to stay.</span> <span id="s151">One or two did, but most of them didn’t.</span> <span id="s152">I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come right back.</span> <span id="s153">But what really happened to most of them, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s154">I know one man, he went back up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s155">And we even moved from our farm after we sold, to another town near Fendler called Blerick, and he wrote to Mr. Katzenstein, near Fendler, and the letter got to us.</span> <span id="s156">I don’t know whether he survived or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Can you tell me what you heard about Kristallnacht from where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I was in Holland, I wasn’t in Germany, and I know the -- from the Jewish point of view, we were permish -- we had permission to do anything.</span> <span id="s159">We were -- don’t -- didn’t have to observe the Jewish laws about Shabbat.</span> <span id="s160">We just helped the people that came.</span> <span id="s161">That’s -- I mean, I -- I -- as we heard -- of course we heard the news and so on, what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s162">That year, ’38, my grandmother died on the last day of Hanukah.</span> <span id="s163">And of course my father didn’t go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s164">I went back -- I was a 16 year old and I went back to the funeral.</span> <span id="s165">I’m here.</span> <span id="s166">I was -- I came back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: What was your -- what was your legal status as you were going back and forth from Holland to Germany for this fu --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: We were Germans.</span> <span id="s169">We were Germans.</span> <span id="s170">We were German citizens.</span> <span id="s171">In fact, we had to go to the German consulate in Mastreif then had the J, Jude, put into our passports.</span> <span id="s172">We had G-German passports.</span> <span id="s173">Look, our legal status in Holland was that.</span> <span id="s174">When I came to United States we were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s175">I went into the army as an enemy alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: When you left Germany, were you able to say goodbye to family and friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s178">There was one German farmer who wanted to say goodbye to us, but he couldn’t do it openly.</span> <span id="s179">And he got on the train with us to say goodbye and went with us a couple of stations and then he went back.</span> <span id="s180">So -- but otherwise, there was no saying goodbye.</span> <span id="s181">The relative -- we had no relatives in town, maybe we said goodbye to the Jewish families that were there.</span> <span id="s182">By the way, I -- the record at the Holocaust Mu-Museum, I know that all the people that didn’t get out shortly after we got out, they all got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you have any regrets at all about leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Not at all, I’ll give you a -- a [indecipherable] question.</span> <span id="s185">You know, I mentioned I was in the American army.</span> <span id="s186">And we have a reunion -- ma -- the company, not the division, I was in hundred infantry division.</span> <span id="s187">And we had a reunion and one -- the wife of one of my comrades asked me how -- how -- what did you -- how did you feel like fighting the Germans?</span> <span id="s188">I said, very gladly.</span> <span id="s189">They would have killed me if I wouldn't have go-gotten out.</span> <span id="s190">No, there was no regret about leaving Germany for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Is there anything about your time in Germany or in Holland that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to mention before we move into the next stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Probably after you leave I’ll remember, which is normal.</span> <span id="s193">I mentioned my father’s experience, I mentioned our experience in Holland.</span> <span id="s194">Nothing outstanding.</span> <span id="s195">We had -- we had the boarding house and people coming across the border.</span> <span id="s196">Ha -- ha -- I remember I had to sleep in the haystack a couple of nights once because we had so many people.</span> <span id="s197">But nothing outstanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No.</span> <span id="s200">Not at all.</span> <span id="s201">At least we didn’t.</span> <span id="s202">My wife told you the experience of her father, but we have personally -- that personal contact we had was absolutely good.</span> <span id="s203">I -- I don’t -- I could mention something, but it’s not off the record.</span> <span id="s204">You want to stop for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: No, we-we’ll continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s207">I-I met somebody recently, here, whose mother came from the same town where I lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s208">And it’s a small world, but th -- I didn't know her.</span> <span id="s209">I knew her family and we -- there are many people that we both knew.</span> <span id="s210">So, she lives right here.</span> <span id="s211">I haven’t met her yet, we just talked on the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: When you left Holland, did -- did you have any expectations about what your new home, where you’re going to be arriving soon, was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, our aim was to become farmers.</span> <span id="s214">Whe -- when and where, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s215">My f -- they were German Jewish real estate agents who took you under their wing and tried to sell you a farm.</span> <span id="s216">We were [indecipherable] into New York and my father entered a federal land pact in, I think it was Somerville, New Jersey, and he bought a farm from a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s217">We had -- had three houses.</span> <span id="s218">Had over 120 acres, 150 acres, and he bought that on a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s219">This Jewish Agricultural Society, we had some money fro -- obviously from selling our property, and the Jewish Agricultural Society gave us a second mortgage to build a chicken coop.</span> <span id="s220">There were Jewish people in the area who were very helpful and I know there was one family, they picked up my mother every week to go to Camden to the shircha to go to the butcher store and so on.</span> <span id="s221">I mean they were very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Were you helped by any Jewish agencies or were they just individuals who helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, we ha -- no -- the Jewish Agricultural Society, but o-otherwise, these real estate people were private salesmen and they -- they didn't help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Nobody like HIAS or anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, no, we were not involved with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s227">Before we get too much into your life in the United States, how did you come to the United States, how did you travel here?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: In the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s229">Was a new boat.</span> <span id="s230">We went third class, we couldn’t afford anything better, and was the time of the World’s Fair and the people were coming from all over the world.</span> <span id="s231">E-Eventually, after we were in New York we rented a room with somebody in Washington Heights, and two of my uncles were wor -- had jobs at the World’s Fair and eventually we wound up -- I said, everybody is coming, why don’t we go?</span> <span id="s232">In those days the subway was a nickel.</span> <span id="s233">And we went out there to look and the thing that impressed me most was the ice water dispenser at the General Elec -- General Motors exhibit.</span> <span id="s234">That impressed me most.</span> <span id="s235">My mother was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s236">There was a place that sold root beer and it didn’t taste at all like the beer she expected.</span> <span id="s237">We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place with three houses.</span> <span id="s238">The first we moved into one house, good one -- two story, and then we sold the two newer houses to je -- also German Jewish families that had come.</span> <span id="s239">One family came from Berlin, one family came from Frankfurt, and we moved in the old house, which had nothing.</span> <span id="s240">The -- the hot water was made on the stove in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s241">No heating system.</span> <span id="s242">Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we had a pump in there, and we couldn’t afford a deep well pump, so a plumber came and he built a platform in the well from which a regular pump could supply us with water.</span> <span id="s243">There was a Jewish plumber in Camden who would underwrite a loan so we could build a heating system, which of course he built.</span> <span id="s244">So we got a heating system, we got hot water and we started farming.</span> <span id="s245">At first I worked with a team of horses.</span> <span id="s246">Took a few years til we could afford a tractor, but again, we raised chicken feed.</span> <span id="s247">We grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we used for a chicken feed.</span> <span id="s248">The salesman for the feed dealer sold us our first car.</span> <span id="s249">This was 1939 - ’40 - ’41 -- ’40.</span> <span id="s250">And he -- was oh, I think a ’26 - ’28 Chevy or Ford, whatever.</span> <span id="s251">But now we had a car.</span> <span id="s252">My father had to get a driver’s license, but that was no problem.</span> <span id="s253">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Tell me how you found out that war had broken out in Europe.</span> <span id="s255">How did you learn about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh, we had a radio, we listened to the news, we got a daily paper.</span> <span id="s257">So we knew one what -- knew what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s258">And of course, Hitler came into Holland, what was it, we left June ninth, he went into Holland May first.</span> <span id="s259">So we knew that we got out by the skin of our teeth, and we could breathe a little heavier, although we were worried about the [indecipherable] that were left behind.</span> <span id="s260">I had, in the meantime, ’39 - ’40, most of the relatives that were in -- were left in Germany had gotten out.</span> <span id="s261">There was one uncle who was interned in England in the Kitchener camp, but he got permission to come here and he came too.</span> <span id="s262">Came to us first, working on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: When you came to this country, did anybody ask you about your experiences in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s265">I -- I didn’t go to school, I was 17, I was old enough to stay out, and maybe I’m regretting it or not, but my brother went to high school, and literally I went with him.</span> <span id="s266">I had all the books.</span> <span id="s267">I learned lot of history, I learned a lot of things by just reading.</span> <span id="s268">I’m still a -- learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were you able to keep in touch with people that you had left behind in Germany when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: In the beginning yes, but then when in ’41 the U.S. entered the war, even postal communication was difficult.</span> <span id="s271">Eventually the ones that were left behind got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: But in the correspondence that you were able to get, what kinds of things did they write about?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Literally nothing.</span> <span id="s274">The -- look, the mail was censored, they knew that.</span> <span id="s275">And they just that we do fine -- look, I -- we are now translating correspondence like that, we’re -- a-at the museum, and it’s all -- the letters are repetitive.</span> <span id="s276">That’s all the s -- because that’s all they could tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So you were in your late teens and working?</span> <span id="s278">Was that something that you wanted to continue to do indefinitely, is -- to do the --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Is that what you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, fr -- I -- I loved farming, and some people can’t understand that, but I did.</span> <span id="s282">I raised chickens, we grew corn, I worked with a tractor and my father built up a retail route in Camden.</span> <span id="s283">And the nearest congregation was in Haddonfield, New Jersey, or Haddon Heights, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s284">And since we were fairly observant, we didn't go to synagogue except at the high holidays, where we usually went to New York where a -- my uncles lived.</span> <span id="s285">So we went there.</span> <span id="s286">We had some -- some family in Philadelphia found us, distant relatives and we went there occasionally.</span> <span id="s287">Like when my brother became Bar Mitzvah on the farm, some -- he went to Philadelphia to get his Bar Mitzvah lessons, and then from Philadelphia they [indecipherable] for his Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What stands out in your mind about the time from ’39 when the war broke out in Europe until Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well, there was really -- I mean, the war was going on.</span> <span id="s290">We knew that and we were very glad that we were in the United States.</span> <span id="s291">And I had to register for the draft [indecipherable] enemy alien.</span> <span id="s292">Legally, we were not alle -- allowed to leave New Jersey.</span> <span id="s293">We weren’t supposed to go to Philadelphia or anything, and once in awhile we asked for a travel permission, but usually we went when we could.</span> <span id="s294">And I got registered for the draft and my father tried to have me deferred because he needed me for the farm.</span> <span id="s295">But after many, many applications, eventually he was denied and I had to -- to register and I was drafted in March of 1944, as an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s296">I only became a citizen after I was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Tell me your reaction to Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s298">When you heard about it, what -- what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Oh, I was shocked, of course, absolu -- heard it on the radio, and in a way a -- this happened, so we’re in -- totally involved now.</span> <span id="s300">I mean a -- in a w-way I knew that I ha-had to go in and a -- a -- it was a hundred percent American, even though I wasn’t a citizen yet.</span> <span id="s301">And I felt very glad that things had come to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Tell me about your military service.</span> <span id="s303">When exactly did you start and -- and what training did you receive?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, I was drafted March 27th, 1944, which later on turned out to be my wife’s birthday.</span> <span id="s305">And I was sent for basic training to Camp Blanding in Florida, infantry basic.</span> <span id="s306">I was classified not for i -- outright infantry, but infantry in -- I and R, Intelligence and Reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s307">Not that it helped any.</span> <span id="s308">Was still infantry basic.</span> <span id="s309">And when that was finished I had to report to Fort Mead, Maryland, and supposedly to go to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s310">But then a rule came out, anybody over 23 goes to Europe and since I was over 23, I a -- I mean a -- over -- I-I was reclassified to go to Europe.</span> <span id="s311">I was then sent to the hundred -- to join the hundred infantry division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</span> <span id="s312">Company --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Let me pause because I’m afraid I’m going to run out of tape.</span> <span id="s314">Just one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Werner Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s317">This is tape number one, side B. And you were telling me about your military service, the very beginning of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Military service.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I joined the hundred infantry division at Fort Bragg and we prepared to go overseas.</span> <span id="s321">We had some more training, obstacle course and so -- and so on, under fire.</span> <span id="s322">And then, eventually, we got ready to go.</span> <span id="s323">I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur when we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s324">We only spent a few days there.</span> <span id="s325">Since I was close to home I got permission to go home a couple of times.</span> <span id="s326">But then when we boarded the transport and we ar -- and we’re in a convoy of the hundred infantry division.</span> <span id="s327">We left about that time, we arrived [indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first.</span> <span id="s328">And then we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range.</span> <span id="s329">We actually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved the 45th infantry division.</span> <span id="s330">We went out on a patrol and I think the patrol of my first platoon was the first combat action of the division.</span> <span id="s331">And we went back and then we got into combat from -- attacked a few towns, took a few towns.</span> <span id="s332">And on the sixth or seventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded.</span> <span id="s333">You know, the saying is you take the town and the high ground beyond it.</span> <span id="s334">The Germans were on the high ground.</span> <span id="s335">We were in the town.</span> <span id="s336">And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded and came out to a field hospital -- or a field hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first aid station, then to a field hospital where they operated on me to remove the shrapnel from the wound.</span> <span id="s337">It was in my buttock.</span> <span id="s338">And I remember clearly s -- everyone saying, who do we have here?</span> <span id="s339">Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect German.</span> <span id="s340">And I was hoping this wasn’t a German doctor.</span> <span id="s341">Anyhow, I woke up the next day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner of war was lying next to me.</span> <span id="s342">Curiosity, I started talking to him.</span> <span id="s343">All I have to give you is my name and number.</span> <span id="s344">He wouldn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s345">Maybe he thought we were pulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don’t know, four or five, six days.</span> <span id="s346">Then we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besançon.</span> <span id="s347">And on that train there were only sitting and walking patients.</span> <span id="s348">I couldn’t sit.</span> <span id="s349">They had to put up a stretcher for me in the supply car.</span> <span id="s350">And I was there a few days.</span> <span id="s351">There was some movie actress with us, I don’t remember who it was.</span> <span id="s352">And as I said in the beginning I was classified lightly wounded.</span> <span id="s353">They took me now off on a stretcher and I stayed there, I don’t know, a week or so.</span> <span id="s354">And there they sewed up the buttock wound.</span> <span id="s355">Stayed there, I don’t remember, til they thought I was well enough.</span> <span id="s356">And the doctor was very kind.</span> <span id="s357">A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front too mu -- as quick as possible.</span> <span id="s358">A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long as possible.</span> <span id="s359">And this one said, evacuation to the rear.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: To the rear.</span> <span id="s362">And I wound up in a hospital which at one time had been a -- a German hospital, a army hospital in the Exon Provence.</span> <span id="s363">And stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s364">I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw.</span> <span id="s365">And somehow they found out I spoke German, so they took me and our doctor and a nurse into that room.</span> <span id="s366">The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin, and I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do.</span> <span id="s367">I really don’t know whether the man survived or not.</span> <span id="s368">I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP on Christmas.</span> <span id="s369">I had experienced that on Jewish holidays I didn’t have to -- to work, so I figured here let’s have somebody Christian have a chance to have the day off.</span> <span id="s370">So on Christmas I volunteered KP duty.</span> <span id="s371">Came back to my outfit -- what was happen -- November sixth -- around January sixth or seventh, and first to the kitchen and then they brought me up front.</span> <span id="s372">And we were in a position right in the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s373">And we were pretty scared to begin with.</span> <span id="s374">But a infantry platoon is 40 men when they are full strength.</span> <span id="s375">When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of which I knew 10.</span> <span id="s376">So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was away.</span> <span id="s377">But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more experiences, but combat was combat.</span> <span id="s378">We went through the Siegfried line, we went down towards Mannheim.</span> <span id="s379">One thing, once we were in Germany we didn’t dig f -- dig foxholes any more, we slept in houses.</span> <span id="s380">And one of the worst battle ec -- battle experience I had was the city of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s381">Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the Neckar river.</span> <span id="s382">And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance, very stiff.</span> <span id="s383">Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the other side.</span> <span id="s384">But then we had to go across.</span> <span id="s385">And on broad daylight, under German fire, we crossed the river.</span> <span id="s386">Not everybody made it.</span> <span id="s387">Then we went up the hill and through the Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill.</span> <span id="s388">And the tanks of the soup concentrate had been hit with artillery.</span> <span id="s389">We actually went up the hill in Knorr concentrate.</span> <span id="s390">And we had to take the factory.</span> <span id="s391">After we took the factory, we had then take -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s392">I mean, the Germans were just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s393">Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still holding.</span> <span id="s394">And after we took that, they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left.</span> <span id="s395">And that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I remember they sent me back to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning that President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s396">Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt had died.</span> <span id="s397">Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they decided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France.</span> <span id="s398">Then spent there a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a Seder in a German hotel.</span> <span id="s399">The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain, Herbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well.</span> <span id="s400">And we had a Seder there.</span> <span id="s401">Wasn’t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few days, and then we went back.</span> <span id="s402">And I don’t remember the date when we stopped fighting.</span> <span id="s403">When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into occupation.</span> <span id="s404">We occupied a town here, occupied at town there.</span> <span id="s405">And that was the end of combat.</span> <span id="s406">The war was -- wasn’t over yet.</span> <span id="s407">I tried to get to military government.</span> <span id="s408">I mean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s409">But -- went to the nearest -- no, I wrote to military government.</span> <span id="s410">A friend of mine was the sec -- the company clerk.</span> <span id="s411">And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through channels.</span> <span id="s412">So it went through channels.</span> <span id="s413">Company commander who during combat wouldn’t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer.</span> <span id="s414">And then I went to military government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my father came from.</span> <span id="s415">And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone, and that was the first county in the British zone.</span> <span id="s416">And there was an uncle and aunt of my father’s that had come back from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s417">And of course I went to see them.</span> <span id="s418">And everybody in the States sent me packages for them.</span> <span id="s419">And then military government was very interesting.</span> <span id="s420">It was the starting up of German government.</span> <span id="s421">First we -- they needed travel permission for anything they w-wanted to go.</span> <span id="s422">The starting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the county level, and then, of course it spread.</span> <span id="s423">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Just -- just one moment, let’s let this -- sirens pass.</span> <span id="s425">[tape break] Okay, we’re back, the sirens have passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: There isn’t much more to tell after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Let me ask a few questions.</span> <span id="s428">I wanted to know your beginning rank and your ending rank of your military service.</span> <span id="s429">Your rank.</span> <span id="s430">Your military rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: No, what was your military rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Oh, I -- I was a corporal.</span> <span id="s434">They promised me more if I would stay.</span> <span id="s435">They wanted to keep me in the worst way.</span> <span id="s436">When I had enough points to go home, I went home.</span> <span id="s437">They couldn’t keep me another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s440">There may have been a few guys that were not -- had no experiences with Jews, but in combat, there was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: When you arrived in Europe for your military service, how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, when we went into combat, we knew -- this was ’44 -- we knew that there were concentration camps and we knew that people are -- were getting killed, but not that much in detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Did you ever read the “Stars and Stripes” magazine while you were in service?</span> <span id="s444">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, we got that regularly.</span> <span id="s446">And I don’t think there was too much in there about it.</span> <span id="s447">I don’t remember, anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Where were you on V-E day?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: V-E day, I -- we were still -- I was not military government yet.</span> <span id="s450">We were in a town -- I think was Kinitling, whatever it was called.</span> <span id="s451">We were doing occupation duty.</span> <span id="s452">And we were getting ready to be shipped to Japan.</span> <span id="s453">Hundred infantry [indecipherable] we were supposed to go out by way of Marseilles.</span> <span id="s454">And when V-E day came we were unhappy that they changed our orders, because most people went to United States first and then go to Japan, even though we were supposed to go to Marseilles and then go to Japan, but for us it was over.</span> <span id="s455">I mean, the -- we did occupation duty.</span> <span id="s456">Was interesting, I mean, we started schools in -- within our units and I taught chicken farming, I taught German, and we had all kinds of talent.</span> <span id="s457">We had a guy with a Master’s degree in English, you name it.</span> <span id="s458">The most liked class was car repair because, you know, that was everybody’s interest.</span> <span id="s459">We had all kinds of interests there and that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s460">I ran the day room and I was giving news broadcasts to the company from what I heard on the radio.</span> <span id="s461">But this was now ’45, you know, the war was over, so there wasn’t much happening any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: When did you realize the full extent of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I think I’d -- I- didn’t realize it until I came out of the service, til I came back home and really learned of things that had happened.</span> <span id="s464">When I came home, th -- of course there was more information available.</span> <span id="s465">But during the time in the service, it was not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Let’s pause again.</span> <span id="s467">[tape break] Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s468">Apparently there are a lot of sirens out there.</span> <span id="s469">After the war, while you were still doing occupation service, what efforts did you make personally to try and find family or friends who might have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: I’ll be honest, I didn’t make too many efforts.</span> <span id="s471">As I said, I was in military government.</span> <span id="s472">I knew -- I found out who was killed and where the others were that I knew by then, and I really didn’t make too many efforts.</span> <span id="s473">I now feel guilty about that at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: When exactly did you leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: To come home?</span> <span id="s476">Oh, April 30th, I guess it was ’46.</span> <span id="s477">Was -- my birthday was April 29th.</span> <span id="s478">And my brother at that time was stationed at Fort Dix, and I of course ha -- I went to Fort Dix to get discharged and our -- my birthday present was a Broadway show at Fort Dix.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: How had things changed in the United States when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: How what?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: How had things changed in the U.S. when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, I remember there had been gasoline rationing and I think there were still things being rationed.</span> <span id="s483">Things -- the economy was trying -- now had to change from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy and I think one of the biggest mistakes was when people said to go back the way it was before.</span> <span id="s484">There was no way of going back the way it was before.</span> <span id="s485">That didn’t exist any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How had you changed during your time in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Well, I sort of, I guess made a promise to myself, since I survived, that I would become more observant.</span> <span id="s488">And I did this gradually, I mean from -- during the war, everything was permitted, but then I did this gradually.</span> <span id="s489">I -- at home, on the farm, I never did any work that wasn’t necessary, even before the war.</span> <span id="s490">And now there was no business on Shabbat, you know, people didn’t come in to buy eggs or things.</span> <span id="s491">And it got known.</span> <span id="s492">My parents were not quite as observant as I was, and of course I became even more observant when I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Blind date in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s495">She doesn’t like it when I give the complete story, so I won’t.</span> <span id="s496">If you want to take it off the record, I’ll take it off the record.</span> <span id="s497">I can’t do that to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: I don’t want to get in any trouble here.</span> <span id="s499">Just tell me briefly, what -- what was your wife’s background?</span> <span id="s500">Was she born in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: She was -- when I met her she was a legal secretary in New York, and when she came to Vineland there was an attorney in the neighborhood who asked her to come in to help.</span> <span id="s502">She stayed there for quite a few years to help.</span> <span id="s503">And when I came to Vineland, I worked for my in-laws.</span> <span id="s504">They had -- my father-in-law and his brother had a -- a big farm at -- a chicken farm, at first.</span> <span id="s505">And then when the chicken business went, as they say in Yiddish, indraya, he switched to dairy farming because he, after all, that was his experience, too.</span> <span id="s506">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: I have to ask you to translate.</span> <span id="s508">I know what that means, but you need to translate.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Oh, it means, in the [indecipherable] literally translate, in the [indecipherable] it’s just done for.</span> <span id="s510">The reason for this was that, you know, all these people that came out of the camps and had came to the United States, chicken farming was a very attractive business.</span> <span id="s511">You didn’t have to speak English with the chickens.</span> <span id="s512">And the only way at the end that the feed dealers could compete with each other was well, they extend more credit.</span> <span id="s513">And when that done, overextension of credit, with no help from the U.S. government, chicken business went down the drain.</span> <span id="s514">So my father then went to dairy farming.</span> <span id="s515">We converted chicken coops into cow stables and I was able to do most -- I was able to do plumbing, you name it.</span> <span id="s516">You do everything yourself.</span> <span id="s517">We had hurricanes.</span> <span id="s518">Oh yeah, hurricane Hazel, and -- destroyed in our area many chicken coops.</span> <span id="s519">In 1955 I decided I couldn’t make a living on the farm, because my wife’s paycheck had to go to the feed dealer to pay for the feed bill.</span> <span id="s520">So, my father had a small route, detail route in the Haddonfield, Haddon Heights area, Cherry Hill came just in existence.</span> <span id="s521">So I decided in ’55, I’m going to start knocking doors.</span> <span id="s522">And after a year or two I built up my own route and I built up my own business, and worked well.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Just for the record, what -- what’s your wife’s full name?</span> <span id="s524">A: Inge Eva Katzenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s527">We have three children.</span> <span id="s528">We have our oldest son, Michael lives in the Boston area, has two boys.</span> <span id="s529">Our second one, David lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s530">He has five children, four girls and a boy, and our daughter lives in Pittsburg and she has a daughter and a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the historical events.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: [indecipherable] what?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Historical events since the war.</span> <span id="s534">How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: As close as I could here, in the news I mean.</span> <span id="s536">And I knew some of the people that were being tried, I am -- I knew their backgrounds, you know, from experience.</span> <span id="s537">Ribbentrop, Papen, I mean all -- I knew the German governments then, and I knew who did what, and we knew who was lying.</span> <span id="s538">And I was not asked, you know, to get involved.</span> <span id="s539">I mean, I know people that did, but I followed it.</span> <span id="s540">Look, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s541">Ribbentrop was the foreign minister.</span> <span id="s542">A cousin of my mother’s was an ob-gyn in Berlin, he delivered Ribbentrop’s son.</span> <span id="s543">Was in those days -- later on, Pope Pius the 12th, who was in Berlin at that time, my mother’s cousin knew him.</span> <span id="s544">H-He worked in a Catholic hospital.</span> <span id="s545">I mean, this was ’37 -- ’36 - ’37.</span> <span id="s546">He got out, but that had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you feel that justice was done at Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">They -- I think they did go -- very well that -- I don’t think they let many stay alive that should have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Also, in -- at around that same time period, the U.N. debated on the partition of Palestine.</span> <span id="s551">Was that something that was of interest to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes, that was of interest to me, because after all, we did want a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s553">And at the time that seemed to be the only way possible to get it.</span> <span id="s554">And of course, the rest is history.</span> <span id="s555">What’s happening now we all know very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: There are some things that happened in this country, a-after the war -- you know, in years since the war.</span> <span id="s557">The Korean war and the war in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s558">Did these have any impact on your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Well, I followed them as much as I could.</span> <span id="s560">Whether they were justified, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s561">Did -- I gave them thought, wh -- ho -- whether we did too much, or not enough, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Also in this country, I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights movement.</span> <span id="s563">Given your personal background, how did you feel about what was going on in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: I am for the Civil Rights 100 percent.</span> <span id="s565">I know this, in the army basic training, one of the lieutenants I worked with was a college professor from Georgia, and I questioned him, how can you treat the negroes like this?</span> <span id="s566">And he says, the negro has to stay in his place.</span> <span id="s567">I mean, of course I didn't agree with him, but who was I to argue?</span> <span id="s568">He was a college professor.</span> <span id="s569">But the Civil Rights, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Oh, whatever we are able to hear here, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Did you feel that the way it was reported here in this country was -- was fair and objective?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s574">They did s -- report as much as they wanted to.</span> <span id="s575">Look, I know a friend of mine here started an organization to protest to the Washington’s Post anything that they report that’s detrimental to Israel.</span> <span id="s576">So I-I mean we -- the papers do one thing and not always what we like.</span> <span id="s577">Look, what’s happening between our government and Israel right now is ridiculous at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to share about your professional career?</span> <span id="s579">Because I have some questions about your retirement.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Well, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s581">You know, I built up a retail route, 1955, and knocked doors and eventually got acquainted with an awful lot of people, and I think in many cases I became a member of the family.</span> <span id="s582">At first we were parents talking about children.</span> <span id="s583">They we were talking about par -- children’s education, and eventually about children’s going out and gr-grandchildren.</span> <span id="s584">So -- this is, by the way is not just -- that I had just Jewish customers.</span> <span id="s585">I knocked doors to door and I sold chickens and eggs and you name it, and I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: When did you move to Washington, D.C.?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I guess it was -- be in to -- I think December ’98.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And why did you move here?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: There were several reasons.</span> <span id="s590">Number one, my wife’s mother had been mentally deteriorated, and we ha -- and physically also.</span> <span id="s591">We had her in a home in Atlantic City.</span> <span id="s592">And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she’s said the home here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew home.</span> <span id="s593">And for me again, one of the personal reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my business.</span> <span id="s594">I’d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many deliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly deliveries, then we decided to come here.</span> <span id="s595">Also religious reason.</span> <span id="s596">The synagogue in Vineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down.</span> <span id="s597">And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a little too old for that.</span> <span id="s598">And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to synagogue.</span> <span id="s599">We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and -- and from a kosher point of view everything is right at your fingertips.</span> <span id="s600">I’m enjoying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How did you get involved with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: My brother-in-law, Kurt Pauly had volunteered there already for a number of years, and we decided, if we can contribute something, we can.</span> <span id="s603">And yes, they could use people that translated German into English.</span> <span id="s604">And we got and they were very happy to have us.</span> <span id="s605">And we’ve been doing this now for a long time.</span> <span id="s606">We go in at least one day a week and it’s sometimes not so nice to do what we’re doing because we can read between the lines how people are suffering, and most of the correspondence that we translate is of people that did not survive.</span> <span id="s607">And I’m very glad we’re going.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: We ha -- didn’t volunteer at the museum for the speaker’s bureau, we haven’t been asked.</span> <span id="s610">Yeah, I think we volunteered once, but we haven’t been asked.</span> <span id="s611">Our former next door neighbor is a schoolteacher here in the Montgomery County, or Howard County, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s612">And she arranged for us to speak to a public school, one day not long ago.</span> <span id="s613">And it was something we enjoyed, and the children enjoyed, and th -- there were a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s614">I guess they were 10 or 11 year olds, and they -- I guess that they had seen -- what is it, the David’s world, or something they had seen.</span> <span id="s615">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: “Daniel’s Story”?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah, or -- no, also Anne -- Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s618">They knew about that and they asked us many personal questions and we enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s619">Look, we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s620">The city of Cologne invited people, and we were there, I guess it was ’86 - ’87.</span> <span id="s621">And they bent over backwards to supply us with kosher food and so on.</span> <span id="s622">And there also we wa -- we asked to speak to schoolchildren, school students.</span> <span id="s623">And we asked to higher school students.</span> <span id="s624">And there the questions were, of course, completely different.</span> <span id="s625">And the point I always made is -- how shall I say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I’ll pause.</span> <span id="s627">[tape break] Okay, we’re back, now that you’ve collected your thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: The point that I made was repeating something that a German mayor told me while I was in military government.</span> <span id="s629">And this was 1945.</span> <span id="s630">And he said, Mr. Katzenstein, I hope that the occupation stays here until this generation is dead.</span> <span id="s631">And this is what I repeated to the German high school students, because many of them told us, my mother is still a Nazi.</span> <span id="s632">I mean, this was now ’87.</span> <span id="s633">So this is what a German mayor told me, and that was sort of the point that I made.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: I’m going to pause and change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Werner Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s637">This is tape number two, side A. And you were telling me about your -- your visit to Germany.</span> <span id="s638">Was that the only time since the war that you’ve been to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s640">No, no, we were recently, but that had no connection.</span> <span id="s641">We were back recently going to Belgium, going to Germany, and to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s642">This time, my sister-in-law, we went together again, the two couples.</span> <span id="s643">And our oldest son came to Cologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where the family, my wife’s family came from.</span> <span id="s644">And we went to the house where my mother-in-law was born and you know, many places like that.</span> <span id="s645">We went to the house where my wife grew up.</span> <span id="s646">But that was just recently.</span> <span id="s647">When I was back in Germany, that was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel.</span> <span id="s648">That was a very interesting experience, but I don’t think it showed us much, that the Germans had changed that much.</span> <span id="s649">I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus and then we walked back to the hotel.</span> <span id="s650">And they had two men walking bus -- us, officially that we wouldn’t get lost.</span> <span id="s651">I think it was for security reasons.</span> <span id="s652">They were -- in ’87, I mean there’s -- Germany is still you don’t feel a hundred percent secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Is there anything that you and I have not spoken about today that you would like to add before we conclude?</span> <span id="s654">You had some thoughts before that you were kind of working on.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I really can’t think of anything specific that didn’t come up -- you know, a few things did come up, but as I said before, going back to Germany was nothing joyful.</span> <span id="s656">Yes, when I came home somebody said, how was it going back to your home?</span> <span id="s657">Coming back to New Jersey, that was going back home, not when I was over there.</span> <span id="s658">Yeah, we came back, I went back to farming.</span> <span id="s659">My brother, by that time was in college and he -- he took chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s660">He found quickly engineering was not for him.</span> <span id="s661">He went -- he became a chemist and he’s doing well.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: All right, if -- if you have nothing else t -- nothing else to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Can’t think of anything at this moment.</span> <span id="s664">Probably after your gone 10 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s666">I thank you very much for speaking with me today, and then this will conclude the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Werner Katzenstein.</span> <span id="s667">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">End of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s670">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s671">PAGE 37 Interview with Werner Katzenstein</span></p> <p><span id="s672">October 17, 2001</span></p></body></html>
