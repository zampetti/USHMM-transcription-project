about that time.</span> <span id="s5">What was it about Hitler that drew him to you, and people like you.</span> <span id="s6">Then go up through your relations up until the time you were ill.</span> <span id="s7">When you even thought about assassination and your last meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Speer: This is the most difficult starting place.</span> <span id="s9">I think Hitler was really a fascinating man.</span> <span id="s10">In history we have several thousands of importance which are well known for their fascination.</span> <span id="s11">Now by the means of mass communication with the gift of Hitler to receive in his hands an entire nation.</span> <span id="s12">I was fascinated by Hitler when I saw him first in a meeting with students.</span> <span id="s13">After this meeting in which he was hailed by all his students, in which no opposition would be remarked, I felt that Hitler will be the person who shall help Germany to get out of the difficulties of this time.</span> <span id="s14">This was 31.</span> <span id="s15">A great part of the population was out of work, I as an architect had no hope ever to get any important errand.</span> <span id="s16">Then 3 years later, I was already Hitler’s architect.</span> <span id="s17">And there came a new thing which was conquering me, which was putting aside all the thoughts I should have had about Hitler’s aims.</span> <span id="s18">This was that Hitler’s architect, that at the age of 28 or 29 I got to design buildings that were of importance which was unheard of at this time in the whole world.</span> <span id="s19">Of course this was such a temptation that it was even more than the fascination of Hitler’s.</span> <span id="s20">Years passed, Hitler started his war, I was to be his Minister of Armaments, one of his personal choices which one could not understand because I was only an architect but I succeeded to my own surprise.</span> <span id="s21">The war was going worse and worse and in the beginning of 44 I was very sick, horrible sick by exhaust.</span> <span id="s22">At this time, I was in the sick bed for several weeks.</span> <span id="s23">I was put out of the influence of Hitler.</span> <span id="s24">And when I came back again I saw for the first time, he really looked ugly.</span> <span id="s25">I had never seen this before but now, now a days, I think this was a sign for a certain distance I had won against Hitler during my sickness.</span> <span id="s26">Hitler ordered to destroy all the industry in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Take 2: Speer: In September 44, Hitler gave the orders to destroy everything in Germany.</span> <span id="s28">At this time the English and Americans were going so fast, they thought that the Americans were going to occupy Germany.</span> <span id="s29">I succeeded to convince Hitler, that industry shouldn’t be destroyed.</span> <span id="s30">Winter 44-45, there were other signs that Hitler really means when he said the German people have no right to survive when the war is lost, because we lost the war and in the Yalta conference he gave strict orders to his Chief to insult the people of Yalta that they would find it impossible</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Take 3: Speer: Hitler wanted the statesmen in Yalta, to make no offer to the German people.</span> <span id="s32">I saw thought that this move in Hitler, that he wants to go to the bitter end.</span> <span id="s33">Made a few memorandums and those memorandums told him that the war is finally lost and it’s the duty of him and the government and him to try everything to ease the lives of the German people after the lost war.</span> <span id="s34">He got one of these in March 45, he became furious, he said again, in one of the letters I wrote to Hitler, if the German people didn’t win the war, that’s no use to give them any chance to survive.</span> <span id="s35">Those who survive are only the weaklings.</span> <span id="s36">The brave ones will die in battle.</span> <span id="s37">I don’t like to tell but it’s necessary to show my attitude of this time that I was so despaired that I tried to kill Hitler.</span> <span id="s38">Of course this plan can’t be compared with those of 20th of July 44, because they at this time wanted to do something fundamental what I tried to do was only escape a situation which was fretful.</span> <span id="s39">Hitler made strict orders to destroy everything that I had argued with him, finally he gave me the right to fulfill his orders that I thought was right and of course I didn’t do anything and Germany’s industry was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s40">I admit that I had pity for Hitler personally even though I should not have.</span> <span id="s41">I flew into Berlin when it was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.</span> <span id="s42">He was very icy when he saw me.</span> <span id="s43">There was a lot of excitement when Goebbels said he would take over the government.</span> <span id="s44">Hitler was not moved that I made attempts to see him for the last time.</span> <span id="s45">He said goodbye in a very icy way and did not even make any greetings towards my family.</span> <span id="s46">This was my last interaction with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">I: What if Germany had won the war.</span> <span id="s48">What would the world be like what would’ve happened</span></p> <p><span id="s49">S: Of course it was only a supposition, because Hitler could not have won the war.</span> <span id="s50">His government would have led to sterile life.</span> <span id="s51">Hitler’s success was only possible because he had with him the support of all souls important leading men in the administration in the so called Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s52">In the industry that were already selected by the democratic system before 33.</span> <span id="s53">I had the impression that those who were coming after this generation, that were still leading before 33, were chosen after principles which would have led to a sterile life of civilization.</span> <span id="s54">And that after 20 or 30 years life in Germany would’ve been even more unbearable that it was in Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s55">Hitler would’ve also fulfilled all his plans in architecture, he would’ve made huge buildings.</span> <span id="s56">Those plans which I planned frighten me a little bit today.</span> <span id="s57">Hitler would have [betrayed] Germany.</span> <span id="s58">He was only up to enlarge Germany in Russia but also take great parts of France and Belgium into the hands of German administration.</span> <span id="s59">The other parts of Europe would’ve been crippled.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Tape 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Take 4:</span></p> <p><span id="s62">S: Hitler’s plans to get some men who [inaudible] were certainly not the end of his aims.</span> <span id="s63">I tell in my book that one day he had changed the sign which was on the [Capulla] of the huge assembly hall in Berlin about 1000 ft high.</span> <span id="s64">This sign was in these days before the first war world, the emblem of the Hitler party and eagle in his claws a swastika.</span> <span id="s65">But he told me, change that please I want the eagle sitting on the globe.</span> <span id="s66">I was accustomed to many such remarks of Hitler which I’m describing in my book but this certainly was the most remarkable one, this showed that he was clearly aiming to be the emperor of the world.</span> <span id="s67">And I think that if he would’ve succeeded with his plans in WWII, in Europe he would’ve made other steps towards United States and other countries together with the Japanese of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Take 5:</span></p> <p><span id="s69">S: the day after the lost war, after 20 years imprisonment in Spandau, plus 3 years together with my family.</span> <span id="s70">Of course I am shocked that I am able to tell you something like that.</span> <span id="s71">But I have to admit at the time when I was working with Hitler as an architect, I was one of the people that was working with him to fulfill his aims.</span> <span id="s72">And my buildings would have been for times it would’ve come in hundreds of years, so he thought, that monuments to glorify these times of Hitler’s.</span> <span id="s73">and then afterwards when I was minister of armament.</span> <span id="s74">I hid everything to strengthen Hitler’s armies and was on the more important point the man who helped Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">I: At Nuremberg you made the statement that if Hitler would’ve had a friend it would’ve been you.</span> <span id="s76">Can you comment on that, can you tell us a little bit about your personal relationship with the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">S: in Nuremberg, I stated that</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Take 6:</span></p> <p><span id="s79">S: In Nuremberg, I made a statement that would have had any friends, I would’ve been one of them.</span> <span id="s80">I wanted to say that Hitler wasn’t able to have any friends.</span> <span id="s81">I was close to him because he thought he was an architect too, and in some way we were colleagues.</span> <span id="s82">He admitted that and he was discussing problems of science, that I brought him to him and we were discussing this as colleagues.</span> <span id="s83">But he never came closer to a certain point.</span> <span id="s84">If it ever came to a certain point he shrank back and was again a stranger to me.</span> <span id="s85">I asked once in the Spandau prisoner, Hess his experiences with Hitler.</span> <span id="s86">And he just said the same.</span> <span id="s87">He said he could never get close to Hitler.</span> <span id="s88">He was always shunning away when I tried to be a good friend to him.</span> <span id="s89">It was obvious to me that Hitler couldn’t have any friends probably he was not a character which could have any close contact to any human being.</span> <span id="s90">And probably this sign was one of the fundamental to his character.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">I: could you give me your feelings about the people around Hitler, about the personalities, about Hess why he went to England, about Bormann.</span> <span id="s92">If you could speak a few minutes about the personalities around Hitler.</span> <span id="s93">Hitler had no friends, but to speak about these individuals as people.</span> <span id="s94">You could start with Hess.</span> <span id="s95">Again in your book, it is one of the people in your book you’ve described quite thoroughly.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">S: Hitler has had in his time, not a kind offer to society, as usual in other higher circles.</span> <span id="s97">Different important people around Hitler were surrounded by circles of their own.</span> <span id="s98">Hess had one.</span> <span id="s99">Goering or Goebbels.</span> <span id="s100">In the center of this circle was always the VIP.</span> <span id="s101">Of course he was flattered by his circle.</span> <span id="s102">That wouldn’t have been the case if they would’ve all been together because they would’ve been equals and they didn’t like to be equals with each other.</span> <span id="s103">Hess in his way was a stubborn character.</span> <span id="s104">He was so stubborn that he was giving away more months to get very close to Hitler because he obviously didn’t want to interfere.</span> <span id="s105">He was in some ways too proud to do it or some other reasons.</span> <span id="s106">But Bormann succeeded very skillfully to more and more influence on Hitler even in the time when he was only an official of Hess.</span> <span id="s107">I think that Hess felt that he was more and more in the corner by Bormann and by Hitler himself which was in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Take 7:</span></p> <p><span id="s109">S: In September 45, a few months after the Third Reich was brought down, I was brought to Nuremberg prison and the trial started against 21 people who were the most important, considered the most important, of Hitler’s government of Hitler’s party.</span> <span id="s110">There were discussions amongst us, who to defend the government and what to tell.</span> <span id="s111">It was obvious after a few of those discussions that almost everybody was aiming to show that he didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s112">And said the responsibility was left to those who were already dead.</span> <span id="s113">Like Hitler or Himmler.</span> <span id="s114">Or absent like Bormann.</span> <span id="s115">I considered this a great mistake and I thought that I have to stand for what was done in Hitler’s regime.</span> <span id="s116">I made, and I was the only one who did it, a statement that I don’t feel only responsible for all the orders in my ministry, but I am responsible in my opinion for everything which happened during the time I was minister, which means after 42, in Hitler’s government.</span> <span id="s117">This included of course all of the terrible crimes, which were witnessed in the Nuremberg trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Take 8</span></p> <p><span id="s119">S: I made the statement to the judges of the International tribunal, because I feel that in every government, in and out of authoritarian one, leading people are responsible for everything that happens.</span> <span id="s120">They have the duty to see things are going the right way and not the wrong way.</span> <span id="s121">And think afterwards and say I was under a dictator and I had just to do what I ordered.</span> <span id="s122">My lawyer was against it because he said that if you’re saying this to the tribunal this is your death sentence.</span> <span id="s123">But at this time, I was so shocked by everything which I heard in this tribunal, accusations that were brought up by the prosecution, which were right and nobody of the accused denied them, I thought it’s not important what happens to me, it is important to have made such a statement.</span> <span id="s124">I got a sentence of 20 years imprisonment.</span> <span id="s125">7 of us that were surviving, the trial were brought to Spandau in a prisoner where were kept alone, a huge place, and we were there in a few cells among hundreds of cells which were empty.</span> <span id="s126">I was more or less now in the situation to prove if my testimony was right or wrong.</span> <span id="s127">That means I insist 20 years was still saying to myself that the sentence of 20 years deserve me right.</span> <span id="s128">Of course that is a cruel thing to say when you think about your family who is separated from you for so many years which are suffering.</span> <span id="s129">In some way I was a split person because thinking of my family I highly regretted very much to be in Spandau, thinking only of myself I thought to myself you should be here because you are giving an example to the future and that was worth it.</span> <span id="s130">I don’t want to say anything about the legal point of the sentence, first of all I don’t understand anything about legal points.</span> <span id="s131">And also my lawyer and other lawyers that the sentence was too harsh.</span> <span id="s132">That’s not a legal question, that’s a question of moral that also can be sentenced and since the question of moral is, I was failing so much in morality, in a strong mute point, that this alone gives a right to keep me in Spandau in 20 years.</span> <span id="s133">But its this attitude that helped me survive those 20 years.</span> <span id="s134">Certainly I felt easier than my colleagues who were kept in prisoner with me, that were always blaming the churches of having done something.</span> <span id="s135">During this time in Spandau I was thinking what was happening to my 6 children when they were investing their faith in their father.</span> <span id="s136">There was a danger that they were getting bitter, about my fate that they would turn to some rightish wing…</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Tape 3:</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Take 9</span></p> <p><span id="s139">S: I was afraid that my children are getting bitter about my fate, that they will perhaps will turn to a rightish wing.</span> <span id="s140">So I made up my mind to write them my story as I saw it after so many years.</span> <span id="s141">Luckily enough I found a good friend who obviously to take out everything from the prisoner to take out what I was writing because it was not allowed to write your memoirs at this time.</span> <span id="s142">It was not my intent to write a memoir to be published but to write to my children to show them what and how it happened and what was my [fehler] and attitude at this time.</span> <span id="s143">And so in hundreds and hundreds of pages, developed a kind of a discussion between my 6 children and myself about my past which was certainly more frank than I should have written for publicity.</span> <span id="s144">In October 66,</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Take 10:</span></p> <p><span id="s146">S: in October 66 after those 20 years in Spandau I returned home in a family who was intact and I felt after a very short time really at home.</span> <span id="s147">I was asking my children what they think about publishing all those letters about my life.</span> <span id="s148">Because I thought it was only up to them if they decide If these letters, which in some way property of them, were published to give knowledge of the wider circles and as it looks now the whole world.</span> <span id="s149">They said well, we agree with you because what you told us was important for us to know because our future</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Take 11</span></p> <p><span id="s151">S: I asked my children what they would think about publishing what I wrote them and unanimously they said this would be good.</span> <span id="s152">Because we are young people we think that this book will help our generation to learn something from the past which is important.</span> <span id="s153">I too think its important what I wrote there in this book and am very satisfied that in Germany, the younger people are writing me many, many letters about the importance of this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">I: lets now go to Spandau and a little bit of the routine of Spandau and I think the area.</span> <span id="s155">The most difficult thing you had books but you couldn’t see your family</span></p> <p><span id="s156">S: in Spandau, life wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s157">The first years we didn’t get more food than the German population, and this was very little.</span> <span id="s158">But it improved we had plenty to eat we had all the books we wanted we could choose our books from the most important and largest library of the Berlin town.</span> <span id="s159">And it was allowed to me to choose more books of the technical university of Berlin.</span> <span id="s160">So I was able to read every day four or five hours and my [whole-ism ]was enlarging.</span> <span id="s161">I say this because my education was an education of a technical person.</span> <span id="s162">In my youth I didn’t have the time to study philosophy, psychology, or history and it’s probably because of this lack of knowledge that I was a victim of Hitler’s fascination.</span> <span id="s163">And also this [inaudible] reading, I was also changing to another personality and I was able to see things from another point of view than before.</span> <span id="s164">And this certainly helped to write the book as it is now.</span> <span id="s165">The worst in Spandau was the visits of the family.</span> <span id="s166">It was only allowed every month and only of half an hour.</span> <span id="s167">And with my 6 children and my wife, it turned out my children were only able to see me once every year because the other 6 visits I had to use to discuss family matters which were urgent and couldn’t be discussed in such a visit.</span> <span id="s168">To a child only once a year is a tremendous effort.</span> <span id="s169">Because entering the visit room, I am realizing I am seeing this child only a year afterwards and I’m setting an impression that will last 1 year.</span> <span id="s170">If I am failing in this visit, if I would have breaked down for instance, this child would have this impression for an entire year.</span> <span id="s171">I know this thinking of such an impossibility was already hindering on how I could speak how I would have liked to speak.</span> <span id="s172">I think on both parts for both me and the child, I think it was really hard to get through this half hour.</span> <span id="s173">When I was a free man again, I was astonished that also the distance between my family and myself were put away in an second and we met each it was if we were never separated</span></p> <p><span id="s174">I: what did you talk about in the half hour.</span> <span id="s175">Did you talk about terribly important or terribly unimportant things</span></p> <p><span id="s176">S: When I was talking in this half hour, I avoided all topics which could have caused emotional feeling.</span> <span id="s177">Because I had the feeling that neither the child nor me could not bear it.</span> <span id="s178">So we were mainly talking about nonsense.</span> <span id="s179">School life, teachers, etc. but we never got to the point which was really [bothering] us because it wouldn’t have been possible in this environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">I: I would like to talk about Hitler’s reason to start the extermination of the Jews.</span> <span id="s181">Why this particularly and your feelings about it.</span> <span id="s182">Starting perhaps with Hitler’s reasons.</span> <span id="s183">What first started this</span></p> <p><span id="s184">S: Hitler was hating the Jews.</span> <span id="s185">But, he allowed them to go out of the country until 39 when the war started, he made a speech in the Reichstag, and with this speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Take 12</span></p> <p><span id="s187">S: Hitler always hated the Jews and he made no secret about it.</span> <span id="s188">But, to 39 he was allowing them to go abroad to leave the country.</span> <span id="s189">After the declaration of war he obviously changed his attitude because in the first Reichstag session after the declaration of war, he said more or less that the Jewish people of Germany will be the hostages of everything that happens now to Germany.</span> <span id="s190">When things went on, the war was getting [crueler and crueler], and I think that Hitler made true what he was explaining in this first session of the Reichstag that the extermination of the Jews esd one of the consequences he drew out of this war who is going to be lost.</span> <span id="s191">I personally was warned by a friend of mine a who was a upper guard leader of [Iglesia] who told me once my office that I shall never visit a concentration camp he didn’t mention the name but as a I know now it must have been Auschwitz because he said that dreadful things were happening there and I can’t forget what I have seen.</span> <span id="s192">Those few seconds in which this friend warned me were in my opinion now a days, those seconds of my life in which I failed the most.</span> <span id="s193">Because in those few seconds, I shouldn’t have shunned away what he told me in my mind but I should’ve asked him what you mean by that.</span> <span id="s194">What happened, what can you tell me.</span> <span id="s195">I didn’t do that and I what would’ve been the next step and go to Hitler, ask him what’s up no in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s196">I didn’t do anything like that and I think that when I put responsibility on everything that happened in Hitler’s time as a statement to me in Nuremberg trial the cause of this statement that I felt from this moment on guilty for all those terrible things which happened in Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s197">Mainly the extermination of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Take 13</span></p> <p><span id="s199">S: It’s difficult to write a book which is objective because a writer always has his own point of view and my point of view was inside the events, inside the government.</span> <span id="s200">To express this I first had made up my mind to give the model of the book to some words of Monroe in his which he used in his [___ imaginare] those words are saying a fish swimming in this aquarium, he can’t see the outside of his environments and so it is with me.</span> <span id="s201">And also there is one point which I wouldn’t like to miss.</span> <span id="s202">My point of view is in some way more favorable to Hitler than it should be because I was his architect and as his architect he certainly more friendly and more charming than to other people that were working in important positions.</span> <span id="s203">I think I am covering a part of what was Hitler’s personality, I was lucky to cover him as an artist and as a minister.</span> <span id="s204">But it is not covered the most important and this is the angle which was seen certainly like a man like Himmler.</span> <span id="s205">Himmler must have had discussions about the extermination.</span> <span id="s206">He must have seen how cold blooded Hitler ordered this and how it was received when Himmler made certainly his reports about his successes in this account.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Take 25:</span></p> <p><span id="s209">S: Hitler’s parlay was here and he went directly into this huge building for his speeches.</span> <span id="s210">But here something that we didn’t think about.</span> <span id="s211">In such a huge thing, the man in the middle who should really be in the middle he is so minimized in scale he was really a nothing.</span> <span id="s212">Of course Hitler did not like this but there is nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s213">This whole front of this building, at the top is this globe which Hitler ordered shortly before the end of the second world war.</span> <span id="s214">He we see only a detail of the corner to see how huge this [Capula] would have been more like a small mountain because the whole thing was over 1000 ft. here in the foreground is the Brandenburg gate, the Reichstag.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Take 26:</span></p> <p><span id="s216">S:If I’m talking about inhuman dimensions.</span> <span id="s217">I mean something else.</span> <span id="s218">Those buildings are inhumane in themselves they are expressing the humanity of the whole system.</span> <span id="s219">When we see now a days what is left of Hitler’s time, we have an example of what he was like to do before the war started.</span> <span id="s220">Those things are only understandable connected with his will to be a powerful man in Europe and in the end to conquer Europe and to govern more or less the world.</span> <span id="s221">Hitler made designs himself.</span> <span id="s222">It is well known that he was aiming to be an architect and said towards the end of his life, he was always complaining that he didn’t succeed as an artist and an architect.</span> <span id="s223">One of the things he was drawing himself, was his own house over Salzburg.</span> <span id="s224">One day he asked me to give him tools necessary to be an architect, it was a ruler and a t-square he was designing this thing.</span> <span id="s225">Which is obviously what his house looked like afterwards.</span> <span id="s226">One things was significant, he approached this building which he wanted to build, not as a normal architect which is supposed to start some analyses and approach the problem before its decided from different angles.</span> <span id="s227">But obviously we see here one characteristic and fundamental lines of Hitler’s character.</span> <span id="s228">He couldn’t divulge from different angles, when he had once an idea he followed this idea and had only small variations.</span> <span id="s229">We see one sketch, here is another which is basically the same, here another one and a fourth one and another one.</span> <span id="s230">They all are the same only with little variations.</span> <span id="s231">When Hitler was designing his plans, he also had me ordered to build an [inaudible] so he could come and correct my plans my designs over Salzburg.</span> <span id="s232">It is still there in Salzburg as seen in this photograph.</span> <span id="s233">Hitler was a fanatic as an architect, he was also a fanatic with opera houses, this was always closely connected everything dramatic, with Wagner, and what happened on the stage was also in some way emphasized in what happened [inaudible] it was always one atmosphere of drama.</span> <span id="s234">He now was seeing that [inaudible] of an opera and I can show very shortly, and the sketches always had the same idea over many years.</span> <span id="s235">There is not a new idea and now we come to one of his sketches he made over the plan with an architect and it is the same.</span> <span id="s236">In this sketch we see something typical of Hitler, this man had will power, he was shaping out things, with pencil, getting closer to what he wanted.</span> <span id="s237">The energy and resoluteness he had in other things.</span> <span id="s238">Here again there are 2 sketches for opera houses but more or less didn’t change at all</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Take 27</span></p> <p><span id="s240">S: So we have seen that Hitler was obviously not able to change his approach to problems when he had made up his mind.</span> <span id="s241">That was 2 years later, his minister of armament, I again had to find out that also that was his approach to military problems.</span> <span id="s242">That he was always going on in one way, he couldn’t think for instance that defense is very good in Russia, he always wanted to be in the offensive side, even when his generals told him to go on the defensive side, but to lead his war to the bitter end.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Take 28</span></p> <p><span id="s244">S: those buildings, they are the expression of Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s245">Every period has in my opinion, has an artistic work with the expression it deserves.</span> <span id="s246">And when I was designing those buildings for Hitler, I in voluntary gave my pencil to make monuments that were to Hitler’s aims.</span> <span id="s247">Not just Hitler’s aims, but also the cruelties that were behind those aims.</span> <span id="s248">It’s the same that we have it now a days, we are in the industrial age, the buildings are an expression of this age.</span> <span id="s249">It sounds ridiculous, but it is the truth, that in some way Hitler with his buildings, he wanted to buy the glory of the future of his emperor, by spending a few billion marks and make the monuments to glorify his victories that were far away, by erecting monuments to place the victories that weren’t already fulfilled.</span></p></body></html>
