George S.] Patton's Army, and at that time it was very close to the breakthrough by the 3rd Army forces and we we usually during the war attached to an armored division and they were the ones that moved the fastest.</span> <span id="s38">And we rode through France at a break-neck pace until we got to the area (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) in Metz, where we stayed for about a month, six weeks, before we resumed the onslaught on Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Oh, then uh December 5th, we entered Germany.</span> <span id="s41">And again we followed uh an armored unit through; and the incidents that uh I uh am really here to tell about uh occurred in April.</span> <span id="s42">And uh it was near the town of Waldenburg in East Germany.</span> <span id="s43">We were stationed in a little town called Remse: R-E-M-S-E.</span> <span id="s44">We had just arrived there that day when uh another GI came over and told me there were three Jews across the street.</span> <span id="s45">They were dressed in the striped concentration camp uniform.</span> <span id="s46">I went over to them, and I started to speak Yiddish to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">And, oh, were they happy to be able to talk to someone who spoke Yiddish!</span> <span id="s48">And they told us some of their stories--uh the same ones that I will tell you about later--and uh we gave them food.</span> <span id="s49">We gave them some chocolate and other goodies; uh and they told us where they were from, that just down the road at the next town of Waldenburg there were a group of twenty- two hundred freed concentration victims.</span> <span id="s50">Uh there were two thousand women-- mostly from Hungary--approximately, and about two hundred men--mostly from Poland, some Germans.</span> <span id="s51">They uh were freed just that morning.</span> <span id="s52">They were being driven by a group of SS officers to be used as slave labor uh whenever the Germans were able to make a stand.</span> <span id="s53">They slept in the woods at night.</span> <span id="s54">When they got up in the morning, the SS officer led the transport to the left.</span> <span id="s55">If he had led them to the right, nothing would have happened.</span> <span id="s56">He would have been able to keep chasing them.</span> <span id="s57">Where we were, we were following the 4th Armored Division, and uh we were actually a spear-head.</span> <span id="s58">We were heading towards Chemnitz [NB: Karl-Marx-Stadt], in order to capture it.</span> <span id="s59">And we were sticking out of the main lines; uh but uh after the uh incidents that I'm going to relay, we received orders to retreat.</span> <span id="s60">And we went back a hundred and sixty miles uh west and south, out of the area.</span> <span id="s61">Because that was the area that the Potsdam Agreement had allotted to the Russians, and the Russians were on the other side of Chemnitz.</span> <span id="s62">We uh waited 'til after supper.</span> <span id="s63">I asked an officer to borrow a truck.</span> <span id="s64">I told the other soldiers in the outfit where I was going with the truck; and we got food from the kitchens.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">We got food from packages that the soldiers had received overseas.</span> <span id="s66">And we took the truck to the little town of Waldenburg, uh where these uh freed people were.</span> <span id="s67">Uh I spoke to them in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s68">At first, they were skeptical; but then they uh accepted it.</span> <span id="s69">And I started...we started, rather, to give out the things we had brought.</span> <span id="s70">And there was such bedlam.</span> <span id="s71">There was such fighting.</span> <span id="s72">It became uncontrollable.</span> <span id="s73">We could uh...they were hungry and they wanted these things that they hadn't seen for many many years.</span> <span id="s74">Oh, finally I, we stopped giving it out and uh it was given to the leader of the group who actually did distribute it later.</span> <span id="s75">But then I started to talk to the, to refugees who were there, and it it's hard to describe the mixture of happiness and sorrow that they had.</span> <span id="s76">Uh they called us belachim (ph)--angels.</span> <span id="s77">Uh they said the (ph)...the Messiah is here.</span> <span id="s78">And one man even said, "We're going to have a new Passover--the day that we got rid of the Nazis."</span> <span id="s79">So that was the happiness.</span> <span id="s80">But the sorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">They kept saying, "We are free, but we don't know what freedom means.</span> <span id="s82">We don't know what to do with the freedom.</span> <span id="s83">We don't understand freedom."</span> <span id="s84">As one man put it, he says...holding the whatever he had received, he said, "I haven't had as much in five years.</span> <span id="s85">But who can I share it with?</span> <span id="s86">I can't go home to my wife and say, 'Look what the Americans have given me.'</span> <span id="s87">I have no one."</span> <span id="s88">Besides this mixture of elation and sorrow, I heard the stories that I really already knew about how the Germans had mistreated the uh the Jews that were under their control.</span> <span id="s89">They told me, for example, how babies' heads were smashed against walls, the wanton killings that occurred for absolutely no reason at all, just for the sake of killing or for the slightest trivial thing that was done wrong.</span> <span id="s90">Uh they spoke about working twelve hours at night, after being up all day; and uh stories of that kind.</span> <span id="s91">Uh, I asked people to sign a list of names with relatives they might have had in America, England or Palestine; and I told them that I would send the list overseas.</span> <span id="s92">Which I did, eventually.</span> <span id="s93">They were reluctant to do it.</span> <span id="s94">They weren't sure that this was an honest list.</span> <span id="s95">They were afraid--some of them, at least--that some kind of deportation list was being made up.</span> <span id="s96">They hadn't overcome the fear that they uh felt.</span> <span id="s97">And uh I left.</span> <span id="s98">The next night, I came back again; but the atmosphere was entirely different.</span> <span id="s99">Instead of about fifteen GIs being there, there were several hundred.</span> <span id="s100">And they all brought things for the uh women and men that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">They were quite safe.</span> <span id="s102">Uh the day before, there was a lieutenant for the American government--uh the AMG, the American Military Government there.</span> <span id="s103">And I went over, and I spoke to him.</span> <span id="s104">I said, "Well, what can you do for these people?"</span> <span id="s105">He said, "Well, I'll try and get uh the chairman mayor--the Burgermeister--to give them some food, etc." And uh he said, "It won't do any good.</span> <span id="s106">We can't force them, and I'm too busy to really supervise them."</span> <span id="s107">But when we came the next day, we discovered they had received a hundred pounds of butter--which I figured out to be a tenth of a pound per person approximately.</span> <span id="s108">And uh in addition, the uh rest of the goodies that the uh other GIs had brought.</span> <span id="s109">They were quite uh satisfied.</span> <span id="s110">They weren't hungry anymore.</span> <span id="s111">Uh, so that that solved that problem.</span> <span id="s112">I didn't get too many more names, but I did learn a new word the second night.</span> <span id="s113">The word müssulman.</span> <span id="s114">The man who told me the story told me that a müssulman was someone who was so emaciated, so starved, so shrunken, so skinny that their features became very, very sharp--to the extent that they looked like a mouse.</span> <span id="s115">And these were the people that were screened out by the Germans for immediate death, because either they couldn't anymore or soon would not be able to do any labor.</span> <span id="s116">It was this man's job to carry the müssulmen who couldn't walk to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s117">And he did that; until he finally too became a müssulman.</span> <span id="s118">But he was lucky.</span> <span id="s119">The doctor there uh was a friend of his, and he helped him.</span> <span id="s120">And now the man was pretty husky and pretty strong.</span> <span id="s121">He was not a weakling anymore.</span> <span id="s122">As a matter of fact, uh most of the people uh in Waldenburg were pretty physically fit; because they had been chosen to be the future laborers wherever the Germans would take them.</span> <span id="s123">So in this case, instead of picking the weaklings, the strong ones were picked so that they could be transported and done some work.</span> <span id="s124">The list of names that was sent home were sent to my wife, uh who worked for the Yiddish scientific institute--YIVO.</span> <span id="s125">The letter arrived on a weekend.</span> <span id="s126">She called up the officials of the YIVO; and they immediately went to the office, read my letter, read the list of names, and they issued a press release which was published in the Times and the Jewish Daily Forward and the Aufbau.</span> <span id="s127">The Aufbau listed all the names.</span> <span id="s128">The other two didn't.</span> <span id="s129">And uh the next day, they sat my wife down in the office; and there were many many phone calls from people who were looking.</span> <span id="s130">We know that she did contact... She looked in the New York phone books and found one or two people who were listed there; and she called them up and she told them that their relatives were still alive.</span> <span id="s131">However, unfortunately, right after that--the next day--uh we were pulled out of Remse.</span> <span id="s132">And as I mentioned before, we went back and down a hundred and sixty miles.</span> <span id="s133">And I assume 4th Armored was pulled back, too; and the Russians came in and took over the area and Waldenburg and these refugees.</span> <span id="s134">So I had...I had no future information on them.</span> <span id="s135">The reason we went south was that we were heading towards the so-called Austrian redoubt.</span> <span id="s136">The story was that the Germans were going to make a last stand in the Austrian mountains; and American armies were sent there to be sure that nothing even like that happened.</span> <span id="s137">And we went and we moved just as quickly as we had always moved, ending up in a town called Vocklabruck: V-O-C-K-L-A-B-R-U-C-K.</span> <span id="s138">I hope I got it right.</span> <span id="s139">And uh we were there...we got there on May 5th.</span> <span id="s140">Uh V-E day was May 8th[, 1945].</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Meanwhile, stories started to sift through about a concentration camp in the area that uh had recently been liberated.</span> <span id="s142">The name of the concentration camp was uh Ebensee.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, again I borrowed a truck.</span> <span id="s144">Didn't take food this time, because our Army was there.</span> <span id="s145">But I took along twenty-three soldiers who wanted to go with me.</span> <span id="s146">The distance was, I..</span> <span id="s147">.</span> <span id="s148">I recall correctly, about uh twenty miles from where we were.</span> <span id="s149">We got to the camp.</span> <span id="s150">Uh I got permission, a pass, to visit the crematorium and into the camp.</span> <span id="s151">I was amazed.</span> <span id="s152">In contrast to the Waldenburg group, all I saw were living skeletons--gaunt people, many of them completely naked.</span> <span id="s153">Uh many of them, you couldn't tell whether they were walking dead or walking alive.</span> <span id="s154">Their faces were expressionless.</span> <span id="s155">Uh, I..</span> <span id="s156">.</span> <span id="s157">I really don't know how to describe it accurately.</span> <span id="s158">It...it...it was so different than anything I've every seen.</span> <span id="s159">Uh these...well, "walking skeletons" again, walking around.</span> <span id="s160">Uh people were lying on the ground--not too many--that seemed to be dead.</span> <span id="s161">Uh, I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s162">And uh here, too, I started to speak to the uh people who were in the camp.</span> <span id="s163">Uh one told me a story of how uh they performed experiments on women, of the kind that uh we perform on dogs and guineas [pigs].</span> <span id="s164">For example, the sterilization of women.</span> <span id="s165">In a different vein, a..</span> <span id="s166">.</span> <span id="s167">one man asked me, "Are the Jews going to Israel?"</span> <span id="s168">And I explained the difficulties that the uh people were having getting into Israel.</span> <span id="s169">And he says, "Oh, the Germans are such liars!</span> <span id="s170">We were told that hoards of Jews were arriving safely in Israel, and I had looked forward to uh getting there."</span> <span id="s171">There's also a story that was told of the Germans taking uh Jewish boys and girls, forcing them to get undressed, and forcing them to have sex with each other while they were watching.</span> <span id="s172">The girls, I was told, were screaming, "Kill me!</span> <span id="s173">Don't do this to me!"</span> <span id="s174">But that wouldn't have helped.</span> <span id="s175">So uh it just went on, the way I was told.</span> <span id="s176">Uh, there were many sick and dying at Ebensee.</span> <span id="s177">The American medics were taking care of them.</span> <span id="s178">Uh, while I was there, two busloads uh of sick people were transported out of uh Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">But there were any number of others who wanted to be in the bus.</span> <span id="s180">It was pitiful to see the bag of bones climbing up the side of the bus.</span> <span id="s181">It was a slippery bus; they couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s182">Or climbing on to the top of the bus, in order to be there when the bus went out.</span> <span id="s183">They did not get out, because they were taken off the bus--hopefully, to go on another load.</span> <span id="s184">We went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s185">The crematorium...and there was no gas chamber.</span> <span id="s186">This wasn't a big enough camp.</span> <span id="s187">The building had two rooms.</span> <span id="s188">One room where the bodies were kept before they were burned.</span> <span id="s189">The other room where there was an oven--one oven--that could burn eight people every two hours.</span> <span id="s190">This, I was told, was absolutely not enough; and that thousands of dead Jews and other nationalities were buried in the hillside of Ebensee.</span> <span id="s191">The...what I'm touching things, the irony was the sign the Germans had put up on the wall.</span> <span id="s192">It was a verse, went something like this: "Don't let the worms get my body; better that the fire engulf me, so instead of burying me, burn me.</span> <span id="s193">I'm trying to think if there's anything else.</span> <span id="s194">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s195">Uh, before the outfit (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) went overseas, uh every uh outfit had to have an orientation officer to give an explanation as to why we were fighting the war.</span> <span id="s196">Having been a history teacher before the war started, I was selected to do that.</span> <span id="s197">And among the reasons I gave for our being in...in the war was the inhumanity of the Germans.</span> <span id="s198">On the way back from Ebensee--and this could be almost two years later--uh I didn't stop to figure it out.</span> <span id="s199">One of the men said, "You know, and when I heard you, I thought it was all propaganda."</span> <span id="s200">I had heard the stories already, because I was interested; and I repeated them to the men.</span> <span id="s201">And he said, "I thought this was all propaganda."</span> <span id="s202">And he says, "Now, I know better."</span> <span id="s203">Went back to uh Vocklabruk; and from there, we were wondering whether we would be sent directly to Japan, or go for a leave in the States and then go fight in Japan.</span> <span id="s204">But, fortunately, the war ended.</span> <span id="s205">And after spending a lot of time in uh...in France in staging camps, uh I was sent back overseas.</span> <span id="s206">But meanwhile, the rule in the Army was that if you had a place to sleep, you could get a pass.</span> <span id="s207">Because the big problem was lodging.</span> <span id="s208">And I happen to have had relatives in Paris and in Belgium.</span> <span id="s209">As a matter of fact, uh I bugged the officer so much about going to Paris or Belgium that even at the height of the Battle of the Bulge, when the fighting was going on, they went to get their liquor rations.</span> <span id="s210">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And they came in at seven o'clock in the morning, and said, "Milbauer, you want to go to Brussels?"</span> <span id="s211">I said, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s212">"Be ready in fifteen minutes."</span> <span id="s213">And we went to Brussels during the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s214">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And uh from my uh camps in France I went to Paris several times.</span> <span id="s215">I went to Belgium again, because that was the...I had the lodging with my family.</span> <span id="s216">Uh, I used to bring food to my family in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Uh I couldn't to Brussels, because we were all in one little jeep.</span> <span id="s218">But again, I was able to borrow a truck and bring food to the Paris family.</span> <span id="s219">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Interestingly enough, uh my family story has a happier ending than some of the previous stories that I told you.</span> <span id="s220">Uh, it was not a small family; but everyone survived, uh most with an interesting story to tell.</span> <span id="s221">In Paris, uh my uncle by marriage, [Franz Van Manhut (ph)] was a painter, professional painter.</span> <span id="s222">He had at least one picture that the Louvre bought.</span> <span id="s223">He kept his wife in the basement for the whole war.</span> <span id="s224">She never went out, so she was not bothered.</span> <span id="s225">As a matter of fact, in my house I still have a mint yellow (ph) that was never sewn on any piece of clothing.</span> <span id="s226">It was hers.</span> <span id="s227">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) He had two daughters and a son.</span> <span id="s228">The youngest children--Esther and Daniel--they had baptismal papers for, so they had no problem.</span> <span id="s229">Judith entered the underground.</span> <span id="s230">Uh, her first job was to deliver the ration coupons to the people who were in hiding that were stolen by the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">And people had to eat every week, every month.</span> <span id="s232">They had to have the coupons.</span> <span id="s233">So whenever they could, they would steal them.</span> <span id="s234">It was her job to go from place to place, distribute them.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">The French police... No, not the French police--I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s236">The Germans uh tried to arrest her in a subway train, but the Frenchmen made such a commotion that she was able to escape.</span> <span id="s237">And she went up to Brussels, where the rest of the family was; and there she became a member of the Resistance, a particular group that made it their business to save Jewish children.</span> <span id="s238">And they saved four thousand Jewish children during the uh war.</span> <span id="s239">Her code name was Piron: P-I-R-O-N.</span> <span id="s240">A movie has been made which is called As If It Were Yesterday, which describes the workings of this group.</span> <span id="s241">And she was interviewed for this movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Another cousin, Helene, was called to the assembly area from which she was going to be deported.</span> <span id="s243">Instead of going there, she went into the hospital and had her appendicitis taken out.</span> <span id="s244">When she finally had to leave the hospital, she married a gentile.</span> <span id="s245">And this is called a white marriage.</span> <span id="s246">And because she was married to a gentile, in Belgium she wasn't called anymore.</span> <span id="s247">Uh I have a cousin, Henri, in Belgium, who is a native born Belgian.</span> <span id="s248">He was in the Belgian Army.</span> <span id="s249">He was captured after only sixteen days of fighting; and he ended up in Hamburg after being in seven different prison camps.</span> <span id="s250">He survived the bombing of Hamburg, which was pretty severe and did hit some of the camps.</span> <span id="s251">Uh he later went to work for the Belgian government.</span> <span id="s252">Uh there's uh another uncle--uh, Uncle Joseph-- who joined the French Army as a uh volunteer.</span> <span id="s253">He too was captured, and he ended up with Stalag 17.</span> <span id="s254">Uh he's written a number of French books.</span> <span id="s255">He's a published poet; and there are some poems about Stalag 17 in his uh books.</span> <span id="s256">He got sick in the prison camp, was repat...repatriated back to France, immediately joined the resistance.</span> <span id="s257">And after a while, he was denounced.</span> <span id="s258">And in the nick of time he managed to escape across the Pyrenees and finally ended up in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Another uncle by marriage, David Lara, worked for one of the newspapers in Belgium.</span> <span id="s260">And he was very strongly anti-Nazi before the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s261">And as soon as they were close or after...just after they came - I don't know which - he too escaped across the Pyrenees, to uh America; and his wife followed him uh not too long thereafter.</span> <span id="s262">Uh there's one more relative that I seem to have forgotten.</span> <span id="s263">Oh, yes--a cousin by marriage who was a captain in the Maquis in the Vichy area.</span> <span id="s264">After the war--I don't know exactly how this happened--he and some of his followers surrounded one of the grand houses in Paris.</span> <span id="s265">It's a big house, I was there.</span> <span id="s266">Uh, and uh they just took it over.</span> <span id="s267">And he lived there for a number of years, until his business went bad and he had to give it up.</span> <span id="s268">Uh I think that's the story.</span> <span id="s269">I mean, I..</span> <span id="s270">.</span> <span id="s271">to the best of my ability.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s275">Uh, I tried to get everything in.</span> <span id="s276">Uh (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) I can't, I told you the story of the YIVO.</span> <span id="s277">I really can't think of anything else.</span> <span id="s278">(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION).</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: You're very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
