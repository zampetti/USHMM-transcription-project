Hungary, an only child, comfortable parents.</span> <span id="s13">My husband was also an only child.</span> <span id="s14">He was also from Hungary.</span> <span id="s15">Besides the wine, because everyone was in the wine business, my husband and I had a wholesale grocery business.</span> <span id="s16">I had four children from before the war and we're from a very Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s17">My husband had semicha.</span> <span id="s18">As for me, I was always very business oriented.</span> <span id="s19">During the war I was hidden by Christians.</span> <span id="s20">My husband died in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">HW: What did you do after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">IF: I sent the boys to Canada and came after they were there to Montr√©al.</span> <span id="s23">But I decided I wanted to live in New York.</span> <span id="s24">When I told my uncle I wanted to do some business in New York, he said: "What do you think you're doing.</span> <span id="s25">You're in America.</span> <span id="s26">You think this is Tocco (Hungary)?</span> <span id="s27">You have to know the language."</span> <span id="s28">And this was my biggest handicap.</span> <span id="s29">I thought about opening a grocery store or delicatessen but then I thought I wanted to start something that could grow, not just labor.</span> <span id="s30">So I said I would start a spice business.</span> <span id="s31">I thought this wouldn't be too big.</span> <span id="s32">I saw the little jars in the grocery.</span> <span id="s33">So my uncle had a relative who imported spices who helped me.</span> <span id="s34">So I started selling the spices to the stores.</span> <span id="s35">I went into a few places and they just threw me out.</span> <span id="s36">Nobody wanted to buy from me.</span> <span id="s37">I was a woman.</span> <span id="s38">Women sold jewelry or clothing, but not spices.</span> <span id="s39">And I didn't know English.</span> <span id="s40">So someone said: Go to Harlem because the Jewish stores there use a lot of pepper.</span> <span id="s41">I sold to them.</span> <span id="s42">I didn't know Yiddish so well, but I knew German.</span> <span id="s43">But the man was very much against German and he said: "Or mama loshon (Yiddish, lit.</span> <span id="s44">mother tongue) or nothing."</span> <span id="s45">So I spoke more Yiddish and they bought from me.</span> <span id="s46">I took the subway there from Boro Park where we lived.</span> <span id="s47">I didn't see a white person on the street but I wasn't afraid.</span> <span id="s48">Nobody was afraid then.</span> <span id="s49">And I went to night school to learn English.</span> <span id="s50">I read and listened to radio.</span> <span id="s51">So I went to a place in Manhattan called Embassy to sell spices and the man I met there, a Mr. Tomaroff, said: "I don't buy these spices.</span> <span id="s52">I buy big boxes, five-pounders."</span> <span id="s53">So I said: "We pack big boxes too."</span> <span id="s54">So he said "But I have my own cans, under my own name."</span> <span id="s55">So I said: "We will pack it."</span> <span id="s56">And he was very nice and he bought from us.</span> <span id="s57">If not for him I wouldn't be in the business.</span> <span id="s58">He was my first big customer.</span> <span id="s59">Then I got another customer and I started only selling big boxes.</span> <span id="s60">And my boys came and packed after school.</span> <span id="s61">And I kept on taking bigger and bigger stores, more places in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s62">Then, after a few years we bought a big place in Ozone Park.</span> <span id="s63">Then we bought onions from Israel; we made it into dried onions.</span> <span id="s64">Then I remarried, but my husband had cancer and died after a few years I don't want to talk about it; it was a real tragedy.</span> <span id="s65">Then I went to Israel and met Shlomo Fishman.</span> <span id="s66">He proposed marriage and I told him to come to America.</span> <span id="s67">He had the Artic ice cream business.</span> <span id="s68">We married and divided our time between Israel and America.</span> <span id="s69">Unfortunately, after a few years, he died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s70">Now my sons are in the business as well as my grandchildren and we built up a big business.</span> <span id="s71">It's about 150,000 square feet and is located in Bayonne, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s72">We have 70 or 80 people working and over fifty million in sales.</span> <span id="s73">And I'm still working in the business because I enjoy it.</span> <span id="s74">I go to New Jersey every day (she's 81).</span> <span id="s75">They pick me up every day.</span> <span id="s76">I want to feel useful.</span> <span id="s77">If I don't do something every day, I'm not happy.</span> <span id="s78">Shopping is okay but only once in a while.</span> <span id="s79">I need to work to have satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HW: Are all your children religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">IF: Yes, some are modern and some are Chasidics.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HW: Do you visit Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">IF: Oh yes, I go every year and I have an apartment on the 13th floor in the Pinsker Building in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">HW: Do you think there could be a Holocaust in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">IF: No.</span> <span id="s86">I love America.</span> <span id="s87">It's too democratic for that.</span> <span id="s88">The only problem is, it's too loose.</span> <span id="s89">Everybody can say what they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Conclusion on
