id="s11">Question: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fanny Aizenberg on April 21st, 2011.</span> <span id="s14">And Fanny, first of all, I – like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our – your time today to speak with us.</span> <span id="s15">But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask – and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on.</span> <span id="s16">All of these things are very important.</span> <span id="s17">But I’d like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the – the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac – you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had.</span> <span id="s18">So I’d like to talk about that a little bit, about what is it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today.</span> <span id="s19">If you could share some of those thoughts with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: For me it’s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons.</span> <span id="s21">I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single people when the war started.</span> <span id="s22">I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.</span> <span id="s23">And we – it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I’m still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: So, in other words, every time you talk, there’s a cost, there’s a cost.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Absu-absolutely right.</span> <span id="s26">Of course it is.</span> <span id="s27">Even today, which is so many years later, when I’m in a car, and I pass where there’s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which is not the polit – polite way of saying.</span> <span id="s28">Because we had been for so long in the cattle train and I don’t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train.</span> <span id="s29">The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer – to describe such unhuman things.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Do you think –</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: And we didn’t know what was waiting for us at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Were there – were there many years when you didn’t speak about your life at all in – about this – these aspects of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, I’ve only start – what is it, Steven, 10 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">S: Ten years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes, when he was always – and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with Steven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring.</span> <span id="s37">Don’t forget, Steven, not because he’s a young person, we are from such a different background and we used to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Tell me of – tell me a little bit about this, this is – you started as a volunteer here at the museum, is this what you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And how is it – and what was Steve’s job?</span> <span id="s41">What was his way of meeting you?</span> <span id="s42">What was – how did your interactions start?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, it really started that I saw in “The Jewish Week,” which is a small magazine –</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: – advertised that the Holocaust Museum needs volunteers.</span> <span id="s46">And one way or another, I was debating for a long, long time, and there’s a lot of things which I didn’t care for to come here.</span> <span id="s47">And I have decided I want to come and see what it is.</span> <span id="s48">And I am – was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely.</span> <span id="s49">Her name is Jill and I don’t -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s50">And somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other.</span> <span id="s51">She said, look Fanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months when we have a orientation.</span> <span id="s52">And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I would never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: You knew yourself well then –</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: So she say you could do – yes, I could change my mind.</span> <span id="s55">I had many reasons for not wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: There’s a lot of things I didn’t agree the way the things were working here.</span> <span id="s58">So I had the choice and I did not wait to be oriented.</span> <span id="s59">I felt I had been oriented a lot, through the time I was – the Germans occupied Belgium and being in Auschwitz, that was enough orientation.</span> <span id="s60">Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and immediately we connected very nicely.</span> <span id="s61">At the same time, I was translating a book from Belgium, who just came out.</span> <span id="s62">This was a no – official book, how many transports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each transport, how many people made into camp.</span> <span id="s63">What many people didn’t know, that many trains had gas and people were gassed in that train before they even got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So as you were coming to – to work at the museum as a volunteer, you were also translating this book at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes, bes –</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: I’d like to stop – excuse me inter – for interrupting you Fanny, I’d like to bring Steve into this shot a little bit.</span> <span id="s67">Can we do that?</span> <span id="s68">Is there a way for Steve to stand right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: This looks like – this is two people in one shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q2: This is a two shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: That’s a two shot –</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q2: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: – yes, at this – while Steve is in the frame, then yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q2: Keep it on the two shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q2: Okay, that sounds good.</span> <span id="s78">All-righty-roo.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: We’re ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q2: We’re all set now, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s82">I’d like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I’d like Steve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of you met and interacted.</span> <span id="s83">So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is that your – your path with Fanny’s crossed.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">S: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry.</span> <span id="s85">We’ve since expanded, now we’re called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center.</span> <span id="s86">And my job then and my job now is to ensure that the individual experiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and then made available to people who are asking about them.</span> <span id="s87">So I bridge the gap between researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s – to find out what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual’s experience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we’re doing an interview with Fanny right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience.</span> <span id="s90">So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that’s otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information.</span> <span id="s91">That’s one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">S: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they’re very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways.</span> <span id="s94">And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from – she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several – working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry.</span> <span id="s95">And we often get requests not only for individual information, but information based on place.</span> <span id="s96">So for instance, all the people who were from – in Theresienstadt for instance, concentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca – particular experience, and with our database, we’re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place.</span> <span id="s97">And I had a particular request for people who were – somebody wanted information from those who were in Theresienstadt, who were registered with us.</span> <span id="s98">And Fanny was able to help me to – I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual.</span> <span id="s99">That was one database.</span> <span id="s100">The other infor – information – the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that’s a list of the deportations that took place in Belgium.</span> <span id="s101">And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy only.</span> <span id="s102">And also, it was producing.</span> <span id="s103">It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s105">I think in Belgium we have French and Flemish, as – as languages, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s106">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So which language was it, of those two?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">S: This is in French, okay, you’re right, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: It was in French, okay, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">S: But because of Fanny’s background in Belgium, I thought it would be a good fit, and this – this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that.</span> <span id="s111">And before each – it’s divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys is a description of that convoy, and – in French.</span> <span id="s112">And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those transports, but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: But cle – thank you, Steve, because I – I – I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened.</span> <span id="s114">This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you.</span> <span id="s115">And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f – that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story.</span> <span id="s117">And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening.</span> <span id="s118">Also, when we got the book from Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in the trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called “The Hidden Heroes.”</span> <span id="s119">That book was written by a German reporter.</span> <span id="s120">She is from Germany.</span> <span id="s121">She tried to interview peop – Jewish people in Germany and nobody wanted to give her any information.</span> <span id="s122">Somehow, she was so determined, she came to Belgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the underground.</span> <span id="s123">The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that.</span> <span id="s124">So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together.</span> <span id="s125">And that book wasn’t selling too well, and they had – she had to change the title, to “The 20th Transport.”</span> <span id="s126">And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group.</span> <span id="s127">Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland.</span> <span id="s128">And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can’t even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So wou –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: And many of the words from the documents from Belgium, I did not know because I didn’t learn English of those documents.</span> <span id="s133">So Steven would – made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted to know.</span> <span id="s134">Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students.</span> <span id="s135">So we really – my job really was, can we help you?</span> <span id="s136">And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted.</span> <span id="s137">And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?</span> <span id="s138">Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer.</span> <span id="s139">And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing.</span> <span id="s140">So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the – all the information, which he typed for him to take.</span> <span id="s141">So he didn’t have to go to so many places, because he was originally in the right place.</span> <span id="s142">So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Well, it – to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering – I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the Belgian underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: You’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Exactly, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And is – and is that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to America and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our stories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: That must have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable – there’s another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven’t done to such extent.</span> <span id="s151">Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent.</span> <span id="s152">[indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven.</span> <span id="s153">He made sure that I would be speaking up.</span> <span id="s154">He said, if you don’t do it now, when you gonna do it?</span> <span id="s155">And I know I’m old, so I had to do it.</span> <span id="s156">But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Steve?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I’m very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations.</span> <span id="s159">So that’s why I say –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Steve, we’re putting you on the spot all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s162">He knows I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: So ever – so I – if I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they’ve gone by, what you’ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">S: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s167">Well, the first thing I wanted to say is I br – I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I’m very fortunate in my job that I’m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os – really special.</span> <span id="s168">And again, one of my profe – jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered.</span> <span id="s169">And so, while we had great conversations, I didn’t want it to end there.</span> <span id="s170">I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story.</span> <span id="s171">I always get her – want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible.</span> <span id="s172">And so in this way, it’s sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible.</span> <span id="s173">She has so many things to teach about – I guess mainly for me is overcoming.</span> <span id="s174">Someone who’s been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through.</span> <span id="s175">And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that.</span> <span id="s176">You go through so many things and sometimes there’s no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass.</span> <span id="s177">And you’re affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards.</span> <span id="s178">And Fanny was able to do that.</span> <span id="s179">So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter.</span> <span id="s180">And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there’s a beautiful 12 year old girl that’s a friend of my son’s actually.</span> <span id="s181">And I see that if it wasn’t for Fanny just persevering and going on, that’s – if it wasn’t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn’t able to later on in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s183">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s184">And we’re going to continue now with let’s say, the usual part of our oral history.</span> <span id="s185">But I thought it was very important –</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: – that we – that we would be able to –</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Because – I’ll you why I feel it’s so important.</span> <span id="s189">It’s very difficult in this time and age, with technology that’s so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the – the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it’s growing bigger and bigger, that people still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that they have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they’re saying.</span> <span id="s190">Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt – and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about it, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I’m not like other people, which I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Because you suffered?</span> <span id="s192">Because you went through these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: As if they’re – you suffered because of something you had done, and that’s – that suffering made you less of a person rather than more of a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s196">This is because what has been done to me.</span> <span id="s197">You see, at the museum here, I am the only person who went through medical experimentation.</span> <span id="s198">I’m the only volunteer survivor who was already married and had a child at the time.</span> <span id="s199">So I had the responsibility, which is so difficult to make other people understand.</span> <span id="s200">This is why when I speak to an audience here, and when you feel the reaction of the people, like you did when you heard me talk – you know somehow it’s like a soothing medicine, or like somebody pats you on the shoulder and said you okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Well, from – from what Steve said, not only you’re okay, but you inspired others and were able to form a family that now, and that effect of – of your decisions is felt four generations later.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Mm-hm, he’s right, absolutely.</span> <span id="s203">It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Thank you –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">S: You done with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: I think we’re – I think this part – this part is – is done.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">S: It’s all yours now.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s209">All right, thank you very much, sorry you get [break] So Fanny, now – are we o – should I start?</span> <span id="s210">Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s211">So now I would like to go back to what we usually do in the beginning, and that is starting at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, I’m glad you have added to, because this is why it made it important for me to come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: To come –</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And it’s because of Steve, I know, that we’re speaking today, and I’m very grateful about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I’m glad you have added that, because very few people are lucky in their life to have a relationship –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: – as his and mine was.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: And is.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: It still is, I shouldn’t say was.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: As it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Fanny, let’s start then when you were born, where you were born, your maiden name –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: – and then we’ll go from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

Jewish holidays, of the Jewish – you know, th – for the Jewish holiday it’s a lot preparation to do, he was part of that.</span> <span id="s278">Also part of regulating the Jewish slaughter.</span> <span id="s279">I don’t know if you’re aware, but it’s a different way as animals are being slaughtered according to the Jewish rituals.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Is this about

life.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What – what kind of memories do you have?</span> <span id="s297">Did she have favorite things that she would say?</span> <span id="s298">Did she have –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: – hobbies, did she have –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: And for the holidays, Friday we used – she used to bake the challah for Friday, that’s another ritual.</span> <span id="s302">And she used to make tiny ones, just for each of the three girls.</span> <span id="s303">And our house was always open, and everybody always knew to come.</span> <span id="s304">We were the first house that we had a record player.</span> <span id="s305">Can you believe that today that the record player was so important?</span> <span id="s306">We were the first one.</span> <span id="s307">So, of course all my friends were always in our house.</span> <span id="s308">But this was a big deal.</span> <span id="s309">How do you explain that when you speak to young people today, to explain them the meaning of things which today technology is so above what I have seen through the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: They – yet, it was music.</span> <span id="s311">It was music that you could then have at any time you wanted, through that record player, which is important –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: And also –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: – to young people always.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: – my mother was a very religious person, and we were not wealthy.</span> <span id="s315">In order for her to do a good deed, which was very important to Jewish people [indecipherable] and we didn’t have money, so what she did, and this is the biggest deed you could do in your life, is helping people when they dead, to clean their body to be buried.</span> <span id="s316">Because, if you do something nice to somebody, or you help somebody, that person could always do something else for you.</span> <span id="s317">But this, nobody could pay you for, and this, of course, was not a paying job.</span> <span id="s318">This is what – just to do a very special deed, and she did that very often.</span> <span id="s319">And nobody knew about that, you know, it’s not – this is what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So she provided an example and a model for all three girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s322">Any decency we have is thanks to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: When you moved to Belgium, were there any grandparents that moved with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: It was only your mother and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, my mother had a married brother in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: And that time in Poland apparently, working is – was not as comfortable or not well enough and since my mother had a brother in Brussels, so we all came to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So that was your reason for coming to Brussels, but what was the reason for leaving Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Because of the financial situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And also, anti-Semitism started to grow to a big extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: In the early 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It has always been, but apparen – which I didn’t know, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s335">But apparently this has always been.</span> <span id="s336">And it seem Poland has always have a problem, because in 1946 – I’m just jumping from one –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: – to the other, but you’re talking about Poland.</span> <span id="s339">In 1946, many people who have survive camps, and the forest or in hiding, went back to Poland where they came from to find out if there’s some relatives, somebody’s still alive.</span> <span id="s340">And at that time, in 1946, there was a pogrom and 200 people were killed, who survived and came to look after [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s341">Just to give you an idea.</span> <span id="s342">And even today, Poland has not given any restitution.</span> <span id="s343">Not only not giving restitution, they don’t – not even willing to give back the houses of somebody who has survived, of today it’s still the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So, your parents felt that you would have a better life –</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: – not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: You’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: What are – can you remember what are some of your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Well, th – a big memory was the record player.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: The record player, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Because we had all our friends gathering in our place, and after one record we got another one.</span> <span id="s354">And then I went to high school, and then I went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: When I graduated from college in art and design.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you go to a Jewish school in Belgium –</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: – or you went to a regular public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Regular public schools, because my parents felt we should have a regular education.</span> <span id="s361">No matter what’s going to happen, they felt – so when I graduated from college in art and design with a degree, AP, a few of us were taken to work for the royal house.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: The royal house?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes, ma’am, we work for the royal hou – and this was a great honor and a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I imagine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: And for me, coming from an Orthodox house, it was so revealing, because there were so many departments.</span> <span id="s366">Everybody, like groups, we did different thing.</span> <span id="s367">Patterns, colors.</span> <span id="s368">What kind of a fair it’s gonna be and how many people are gonna be involve in the fair and what kind of clothes they would have to wear.</span> <span id="s369">It was really very exciting for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Well, I think it would exciting for anybody, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Well, because I have never lived that kind of world.</span> <span id="s372">Don’t forget in Belgium, specially girls coming from religious houses, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s373">And at that time women were either secretaries, seamstresses, which I was not, and that’s what my parents made sure we wa – wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s374">So, it was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So what – your jo – what was your job in this royal house, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: We were part of assorting colors.</span> <span id="s377">Let’s say 10 people would go to an affair.</span> <span id="s378">We were known – we were told what kind of affair is it, evening, afternoon or tea, because the royal house, those people were having different people, and different affairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And you would design the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: For the royal family to wear at these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s383">It’s wild, just what you just – to – t-today – it was very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And did you – do you remember some of the clothes that you designed?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Well, because it was not just one design.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: It was at least 50 people part of the designing.</span> <span id="s388">And about 50 at least designing what kind of color for tea, over kind of color to receive people, other dignitaries from other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: It was like – it was almost like th-the whole theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: It was.</span> <span id="s393">Somebody else mentioned that, it was like a show.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And did you meet the royal family?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No.</span> <span id="s396">Once the queen, when it was a special holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: About three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Was – did you have much interaction with non –</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Other people working?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Well, with other people working and was this the first time you – you really were in close contact with people who weren’t Jewish?</span> <span id="s402">Or had you had je – non-Jewish people –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: The – they were a few – yes, but we always lived very well with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s404">You see, another thing which we had in Belgium, at that time the Belgium Congo belonged to Belgium.</span> <span id="s405">The nuns and religious people went to teach religion.</span> <span id="s406">They built churches, schools, to [indecipherable] the people and teaching the people.</span> <span id="s407">Because of that, many people from Africa came to Belgium for their jobs, because they had a complete department, the Belgium Congo, that started way, way, generations before.</span> <span id="s408">So we have gone to school with black people, we lived in the same neighborhood with black people, and we never knew that there was a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So, Belgium was not a racist country?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Not at all, til we came to America that I have learn about racism.</span> <span id="s411">Don’t forget, all this started when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s412">But before that, we went to school to black and white and yellow, any kind of persons.</span> <span id="s413">And also because Belgium had the Belgium Congo.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did you, in school – if you were born in 1916, then by 1930 you were a teenager and were – and throughout the 1920’s at home, were there any discussions about politics in Europe, in – in Belgium, in Germany, or anything like that there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, not from – we start – that particular information we start to get in 1938, we were just married.</span> <span id="s416">And because from Austria and Germany, many young people escape and came to Belgium with an open door.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: I want to go back a little bit bi – th –</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: – however.</span> <span id="s420">Hitler came to power in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Do you remember whether or not that was discussed at home in your –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No, we had no problem, because in 19 – in 1938, before Kristallnacht, the Belgium people were assured that we would not be invaded.</span> <span id="s424">I don’t know if you’re familiar with the map, Holland and Belgium –</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: – we have the canal.</span> <span id="s427">They have install like the Maginot –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Mm-hm, line?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: – line.</span> <span id="s430">This was a canal which would have, just touching it, it would be flooded and the tanks would not be able to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: But of course this was sabotage and the German tanks were in, before even the water.</span> <span id="s433">And you see, when I talk about that, nobody has ever heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And I lived in The Netherlands and I had never heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Well, the strange thing is, I went through the museum to speak to one of the universities.</span> <span id="s436">And we stayed two nights there with somebody from the museum who took me.</span> <span id="s437">And one lady we ca – became friendly with, that was a group of teachers who gonna teach students.</span> <span id="s438">So I was chosen at that particular time, to speak to the teachers who gonna teach th-the youngsters about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s439">So when we went to dinner, the teacher came with us and she ask if she could take her husband.</span> <span id="s440">And of course, why not?</span> <span id="s441">There were the two of us, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s442">In between our conversation, which we had a lot to talk, he apparently, he was from Holland.</span> <span id="s443">And he is young, and he had parents in Holland and family, where he goes to visit.</span> <span id="s444">That was between dinner an-and conversation, he told me even today the parents talk about the canals.</span> <span id="s445">And for me it was like, you know, soothing, somebody else has ever heard about that, too.</span> <span id="s446">He say even today they still talk that we would not be occupied, because Holland had a tough time too, with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So, the canals were between The Netherlands and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Or The Netherlands and Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Correct, but that was the border of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: That’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: You know, from Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: – to come in.</span> <span id="s455">Look, the la – Maginot line didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So, when Hitler came to power in 1933 –</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: We were not affected by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: You weren’t affected, but were you – did it – were – did he – was he of interest at all in y –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Don’t forget, my husband and I, we got married in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So I cou – want to talk about that too.</span> <span id="s463">I’d like to find out, after you’re working for three years in the royal house, how is it that you meet your husband?</span> <span id="s464">How does he come into your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Well, my husband was a trained violinist.</span> <span id="s466">And he and many other musicians were playing in music houses, because there were silent movies, and that was a wonderful way of making a living.</span> <span id="s467">Except, in ’38, the talkies came in and they all lost their jobs.</span> <span id="s468">So he went to school and he became a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Through other friends, we went to a dance.</span> <span id="s471">In Belgium we went very often to dances.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: And was he at that time –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Because we were modern enough to let us go to dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s475">When you met him, was he still playing as a violinist before the talkies come in, or had he already –</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: He – it just was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s478">And what impressed you about him?</span> <span id="s479">When you first met him, what impress –</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Well, because number one, he played and it was very sophisticated, and I was much younger than he was.</span>

couples, with many dreams and many hopes for future.</span> <span id="s494">And of course never knew what the future is for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Do you remember some of those hopes and dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Do you remember some of those hopes and dreams, what you were planning to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Oh

id="s506">These almost tuxedo type –</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Those special –</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">So he got the job doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: In some ways your professional lives were very similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: So you could understand one another’s issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s515">Well, he really felt very bad that he could not continue his life with music.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: But that – again, it’s like you have a depression here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: There was a tremendous depression, because of that’s how many people were all of a sudden, you know, out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Out of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: – out of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did he have talent as a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Not as much as music, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: So, did you have discussions about at some point having the circumstances where he’d be able to go back to music?</span> <span id="s525">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Well, don’t forget, it was also a matter of making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Because he was the only one making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So it wasn’t really on the horizon –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s533">And of course, the future has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Jacques.</span> <span id="s536">Jacques Aizenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And was he from Belgium as well?</span> <span id="s538">Was his family from –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: No, he was from Poland too, and he came to Belgium I think in 1920, he and his brother came to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: What part of Poland were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Radom.</span> <span id="s543">So you had much in common when you met, both having come from Poland, as far as –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: – families.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: But we were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: In every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s550">So – but what was his personality like as you – and yours, and which way –</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well, he was much more mature than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: He thought.</span> <span id="s554">But that was okay, it was nice and like I say, we were really having big dreams and big hopes at that particular time.</span> <span id="s555">That was1938, not knowing what’s waiting for us.</span> <span id="s556">And also, in November of 1938, there was Kristallnacht, killing the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: In Germany and in Austria.</span> <span id="s559">Breaking windows.</span> <span id="s560">What they also did, and there’s a book about that, the Germans were surprised that in different cities, the population would not be against arresting the Jews.</span> <span id="s561">What they did, and I think there’s a documentary here on the fifth floor – they have treasures right here on the fifth floor for anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You’re talking about the library at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: That’s correct –</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: – the museum [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: – yes, and they have many recordings or documentaries.</span> <span id="s566">And they have like a judge, or a surgeon dressed in women’s clothes and parading in the streets.</span> <span id="s567">They had official rabbis cleaning the streets with toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s568">And when I spoke to that particular teacher’s group, which made it easier for me to speak, they had slides of what I’m telling you now.</span> <span id="s569">They had slides of those people going the street, and the Germans never thought that their neighbors would let their friends, who were in Germany for generations, let them do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So that must have come as a shock when Kristallnacht happened in 1938.</span> <span id="s571">How did – do you remember how it is you found out about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Don’t forget, we still ha – we had our radios at that time, and we knew.</span> <span id="s573">And also, right after Kristallnacht, 2,000 Jewish [indecipherable] came to Belgium, and they formed a Jewish organization, J – AJB, association of Jews in Belgium.</span> <span id="s574">And they have arranged of Jewish families to take in child.</span> <span id="s575">And my mother and father also had sheltered a little girl until 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Because the same organization picked up the children and put them in other – the reason we got – why – how come from Germany, we would have to take her off the train – not that we mind taking them in, because in ’38 we were still innocent, because the parents would have to work in different states, so those children needed a home.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So, in other words, the parents could no longer work in the same place in Germany, they’d have to work in different parts of Germany, and no one was there to take care of the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: But we don’t know if those parents have not been arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: We didn't know that til after.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So you – your parents took in one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: What was her name?</span> <span id="s585">A: Sophie.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: And where – where was she from?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: She was from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did she tell you of what her experiences were?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: She didn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Was she older than you, or was she younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: She was younger.</span> <span id="s592">I think they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Oh, she was a child –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: – yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: She was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I think she was between 12 and 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So she was a quiet child.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Right.</span> <span id="s599">Very hurt, not quiet.</span> <span id="s600">Very hurt, very hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: So she was traumatized?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, because she was an only child, and probably extremely spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: What told you that?</span> <span id="s604">Why did you think that?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Because we learned it from other families who had children who were more outspoken.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s607">So they were, you know, in other words, maybe she was totally unprepared.</span> <span id="s608">No one was really prepared, but – but someone who came from a privileged life would be far less able.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Right.</span> <span id="s610">And of course, many traumas happen in our lives –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: – affect people in different ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Which we never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Including myself.</span> <span id="s617">You never know the – the reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So this was your first taste of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Do you remember, were there discussions about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Then the discu – everybody was a politician.</span> <span id="s622">You know, coming back Friday from shul, or in the morning after shul, this is the only topic.</span> <span id="s623">And also, another thing what has been happening, many people from Austria and Germany, young, single men came to Belgium and that’s how we connect and we got to know many of those people.</span> <span id="s624">But they didn’t know, they only knew Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s625">And they felt it’s gonna go away shortly, and it’s not gonna continue to the way.</span> <span id="s626">And of course, then the Germans started to arrest the Jewish people, beating them, putting them into jails and never knowing what has happened to them.</span> <span id="s627">And that’s what I feel, it was the end of the civilization of Germany.</span> <span id="s628">And I tell you why I say that, because in Belgium, if a family had a lot of money, and especially having boys, they would send them to Germany to study, because this was the ultimate of an education.</span> <span id="s629">But of course, afterwards we have learned what those educated people were able to do.</span> <span id="s630">And we became very friendly with those people and that’s how we got involved, and we got to know those people who have joined the underground of the solidarity or the resistance, whatever you called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So it was through the refugees coming in from Germany and Austria – I want to s – go back and then I’ll talk about this a little bit.</span> <span id="s632">When Kristallnacht happened, you had just been married a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Were you pregnant at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So your baby hadn’t been born when all of these things started to erupt?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, she was born in March ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you have any thoughts when – when your daughter was born, of –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Any trauma?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Yeah, or – or – or fear of what – what were –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, because on the radios, on the ne – in the newspapers, Belgium is gonna be free, you don’t have to worry, we gonna be free.</span> <span id="s642">We not going to be occupied, that’s what was used.</span> <span id="s643">And of course then we were almost reassured, because of the Maginot line.</span> <span id="s644">And like I say, then everybody became a politician, and we believed the papers.</span> <span id="s645">And we did believe, because we felt reassured with friends, having the Maginot line, til it became, you know, a sad story, cause they went all around.</span> <span id="s646">Imagine such a big army, only 18 days they lasted.</span> <span id="s647">And France was occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: What – do you remember what – where you were on September 1st, 1939?</span> <span id="s649">That’s half a year after your daughter’s born.</span> <span id="s650">That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: A year after?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: No, half a year after?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: September 1st, 1939, half a year after your daughter is born, is the invasion of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Well, this is what started us really being scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Because, since we were told that Belgium and Holland are gonna remain free, the Belgium government asked people to si – young men to sign up.</span> <span id="s658">They didn’t know for what and for where, and many, many have signed up, including my husband.</span> <span id="s659">Also many people who have come from Germany and Austria have also signed up.</span> <span id="s660">And they, in 1940, when the Germans invaded, they all got the call where to meet, in Dunkirk.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So your husband signed up to be part of the Belgian military forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, we didn't know what they’re gonna do.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Many for military – don’t forget that afterwards we have learned that in England they had divisions of people from different countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s665">Some have mixed with the British and many have remain independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So, in other words, when Germany invades Poland, there’s a mi – mobilization effort taking place in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Wa – we didn’t know it’s gonna be a mobilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: We only thought in case of need.</span> <span id="s670">Those were the words, in case of need.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: But signing up, what did that mean at that point?</span> <span id="s672">Did that mean your husband left the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Okay, it just meant he registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: In case they would meet and we felt well, maybe, you know, to be at the borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: And of course, none of them have ever been in the army, so we never thought that that would be the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did your life change much, your own personal life, after the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: It did, because the fear grew so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Because here we were living peacefully, and really innocent, completely.</span> <span id="s682">Innocent is really the word you could use, because we couldn’t believe anything could happen, because even when the young people who came from Germany and Austria, didn’t know that Jews were killed, they only knew Kristallnacht, they only knew the damage they were doing.</span> <span id="s683">But they didn’t know what was happening to the Jews at that particular time already.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: And the fear grows.</span> <span id="s685">When the war starts, the fear grows.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Tremendously.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: How would –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Because we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s689">How do you put that in words?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: It’s really being scared for your own shadow.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s693">Were your sisters also married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: My oldest sister was married and she had already two sons at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Her name was Theresa, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Terez(ph), mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Terez(ph), uh-huh</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: And my younger sister took courses in English, and they had a very special store in Belgium for tourists –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Un-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: – where they make lace, and selling the lace.</span> <span id="s701">And also because she knew already English at that time, that was her main thing.</span> <span id="s702">So that’s what she was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Your parents – it sounds to me, and correct me if I’ve misunderstood this, it sounds your – like your parents were very much part of the je – Orthodox Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: So that was their – their world.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: And their life, with the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s710">And your father made his living through his –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s713">What were some of the discussions going on –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s715">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s716">Everybody was guessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: They were guessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: And everybody was a politician, everybody knew what’s gonna happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So everybody was sure of this and sure of that and nobody really knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: You’re right.</span> <span id="s721">Not only that, we couldn’t believe in the wildest imagination that anything was happening the way it was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So, in other –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: And that it could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: So, you’re f – everyone’s afraid, not – the boom hasn’t fallen yet, though.</span> <span id="s725">How did the boom fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q2: Maybe we should change tape here.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q2: Cause I’m only one minute from –</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Okay [break] Your daughter said that the – last night you were nervous about coming in today?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: I’m always nervous before I come to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s735">And your friend who has not spoken about her story, she doesn’t even talk to people about it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Di – has she told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: No.</span> <span id="s739">But we became very close friends and she – what she does, which I would like to do, is go to the writing class.</span> <span id="s740">That, I have a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I really – I went twice to the class and I went home very unhappy.</span> <span id="s743">I would like to start writing.</span> <span id="s744">You know, just take –</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: And what – i-if I can ask you, what was it that made you unhappy about the class, or about your experience there?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I’m really very shy by nature, and when there’s a group of people who talk loudly, I get quieter.</span> <span id="s747">Here you thought I have all the qualities.</span> <span id="s748">I am far – I’m far from it.</span> <span id="s749">No, I get very agitated.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s751">I – I think writing does do many good things, beca – and I think that it helps.</span> <span id="s752">It helps get the story down.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: You often find – I often find when I write, I discover what it is that I’m thinking.</span> <span id="s755">It’s almost – in the beginning you think you know what you’re going to say, but as you’re writing, you discover new thoughts.</span> <span id="s756">And those are very important, you know, you let yourself develop –</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I would love to do that, but I don’t have much time.</span> <span id="s758">I’m too busy.</span> <span id="s759">My son-in-law makes fun of me because – and then I’m going to tell you the joke.</span> <span id="s760">Whenever he calls, I’m not home.</span> <span id="s761">So I said once to Freddie, you have two choices.</span> <span id="s762">Would you like to have a mother-in-law who’s drunk and always home?</span> <span id="s763">Or a mother-in-law who’s never home.</span> <span id="s764">Didn’t get an answer.</span> <span id="s765">No, I have to be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I ha – do many things, except I’m slowing down very fast because of different health problems and I’m having many.</span> <span id="s768">I even may need eye surgery, which scares me to death.</span> <span id="s769">I had two cataracts remove and now I have glaucoma on one eye, and because of the clo – glaucoma they have like a film over.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: In order to remove that and not to lose the eyesight, they need surgery.</span> <span id="s772">And I’m scared to death at my age to have eye surgery.</span> <span id="s773">I said, if I lose my eyesight, okay, walking, it’s not a problem, I’m not walking, but this is a problem and scares me, he couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s774">He said, I will be [indecipherable] already.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: But I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Well, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Don’t forget, I live alone.</span> <span id="s779">And that’s not easy, but I hope to remain independent as long I can.</span> <span id="s780">And then say my goodbyes and go.</span> <span id="s781">That would be nice.</span> <span id="s782">That would be nice, cause I see too many people much younger than I am dying of Alzheimer’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Or from cancer, it’s – my daughter had a fr – had somebody she took care, I think I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Cancer, 52.</span> <span id="s787">She died about a month ago.</span> <span id="s788">The synagogue has a sign, people to go and help, and she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Fanny, let’s go back –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Her job really was –</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: – she was a social worker and she got a degree in psychology, and she was working for Montgomery county as a child sexually abuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: This is your daughter, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: My daughter.</span> <span id="s795">I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: It’s heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I couldn’t do the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: It’s heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s802">And the sad thing is, we have that much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Can you imagine a woman giving birth, at the age of six, having that child to be sexually abused because she needs drugs?</span> <span id="s805">To me when I heard that, it was – when I think what some mothers did to have their child, it’s – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Fanny, I need to bring you back to 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: We have to go back to when the boom fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Are we gonna talk now?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Yeah, we’re talking now.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: We were rolling, we were rolling.</span> <span id="s813">But that’s okay, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: That’s – no, no, no, it’s fine, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s816">1940, and the war has started in Poland and people are frightened, and everyone’s a politician finally, in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: That was before they invaded Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And how did the – how did you experience the invasion of Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Scared.</span> <span id="s820">Worried.</span> <span id="s821">And not realizing what’s really happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: No.</span> <span id="s824">My husband left May the 10th.</span> <span id="s825">My sister-in-law, who was – my husband’s brother, they both left, and my sister-in-law had a little child, she brought the crib downstairs to my apartment so we would be together.</span> <span id="s826">And she had a br – she wasn’t Jewish, and she became Jewish and then she didn't know what to leave – what to do with her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s827">Anyway, she and the baby, they left – they went to live with the brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So this was your husband’s brother’s wife?</span> <span id="s829">Yeah.</span> <span id="s830">You’re saying May 10th.</span> <span id="s831">Was that the day that Belgium was invended – i-invaded?</span> <span id="s832">May 10th.</span> <span id="s833">And your husb –</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: That’s when the Germans marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And your husband left that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: He was mobilized, or he –</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Well, that’s where they got the signal.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s840">And you were left alone then, with you – your daughter and with the other little child?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Well, my sister-in-law –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: – about a week later she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s845">I see.</span> <span id="s846">And what was –</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: And my mother lived about – my mother and father lived about 10 minutes, but the day before the Germans invaded, the bridges were there for three days, and in three days they bombed the bridges.</span> <span id="s848">You know, bridges from one neighborhood to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: They bombed those bridges, and left.</span> <span id="s851">And then the Germans had a hard time coming in, but apparently they had enough forces to close those things.</span> <span id="s852">And that’s when our pain started.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: What were your final conversations like with your husband before he left?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s855">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s856">He didn't know what to do and he wanted to stay and I didn't think it would be right, if we – number one, we never thought of the massacre waiting for us.</span> <span id="s857">We never knew of deportation, we never knew of – we knew of working with the children who have been collected the same day.</span> <span id="s858">Not collected, they’ve been taken care of by the same organization who have put them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: You’re talking about the German children.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Who came to us –</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Yeah, who came to you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: – from Germany, or from Austria.</span> <span id="s863">It was frightening, it was scary, it was unbelievably scary, and I don’t have another word of scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: So it was ma –</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Of such a uncertainty of what’s going to be from now on.</span> <span id="s866">We knew we gonna have to work.</span> <span id="s867">That’s what was told from the youngsters who came, that we’re gonna have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: But that’s all you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah, but we never knew that there’s gonna be a separation of people.</span> <span id="s870">Now, the young people who came before from Austria and Germany, they never te – told us, or they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s871">They only knew Kristallnacht, then we run away.</span> <span id="s872">And already at that time, they have groups to go to other countries and organize people, just telling them.</span> <span id="s873">And that’s how the underground has started.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: And those people joined with the und – and like I said before, the only thing which has saved the Jews who were saved in Belgium is because the resistance or underground, whatever you call it, were one group, Jews and non-Jews, where France didn’t have that and Holland didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s876">You know, at the museum here, you have the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: There’s one young man who was a physician in Belgium and h-he was Jewish and he was one of the first organizers.</span> <span id="s879">Somehow he was able to get a message to England, and a friend of his stole a plane and bombed the Gestapo in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: It just broke windows, but there was a way to respond to anything.</span> <span id="s882">And at least you felt there’s somebody else who is having that fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: If your husband had realized that you really were in danger, do you think he would have left?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I hope not.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I hope not.</span> <span id="s887">I never thought of it.</span> <span id="s888">You know, that thought never came to me, that he would leave his child.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s890">He didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: She was just 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s894">I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: And when you saw him, what was the last glimpse you had of him, as he was leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: What was the last glimpse you had of him as he was leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Crying and hugging Josiane til the last second.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So he was crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: He was crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: How could anybody not?</span> <span id="s903">Like I say, we just started.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What was – what was going on with your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Well, they were surprised that my husband would go, but I felt it would be wrong of me – why shouldn’t he go if he could help us?</span> <span id="s906">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s907">Like I say, in the wildest dreams you couldn’t imagine what was waiting for the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: When did the underground that you’ve spoke of, that you’ve mentioned, when did it really start functioning in your life?</span> <span id="s909">How did you get involved with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Well, we know the – we knew those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Okay, you knew the people who were in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Some of them.</span> <span id="s914">Your husband and yourself, or just yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: No, he too knew those people.</span> <span id="s916">Don’t forget, we were young – we were young, and we have met those young people coming, through other young people in Belgium who were ready to fight.</span> <span id="s917">Not every young man left, because they felt we have to defend the people who are still there, which they did.</span> <span id="s918">And mainly the people who came from Austria and Germany, they needed a place to stay, and we have a attic.</span> <span id="s919">We call it the mansard.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s921">Marsat(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Marset(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Marseille?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: No, no, no, in mansard.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: That’s a attic.</span> <span id="s927">But anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Ah, mansard, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: And then we made keys.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: So you kept some of the people in your attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: We didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s934">And once my sister-in-law left, I took her apartment.</span> <span id="s935">She moved her things, we had the main floor, because my husband had the room where he was doing tailoring at home to make some money.</span> <span id="s936">And when she moved, I moved to her apartment on the third floor, and the downstairs we rented to an elderly couple who had the grocery stores, the little they could get.</span> <span id="s937">And so mainly they were selling flowers.</span> <span id="s938">But that was it.</span> <span id="s939">And the people stayed there til the beginning of ’43, but they were not there all the time.</span> <span id="s940">Those two people –</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Talking about the underground people?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes, the two people who’s there permanently had people coming with information, with pamphlets.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And was your involvement that you provided this place to stay –</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: – and that’s all you did, or were you involved in other ways in this –</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: That was my main involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Is to provide the place to stay.</span> <span id="s948">Did your – did your rest of your family know that you were involved in this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s950">You don’t talk about those things.</span> <span id="s951">And another thing, we didn’t even know what they were exchanging.</span> <span id="s952">Like my sister and brother-in-law, they were in the ar – my married sister and her husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Your older one.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yes, they were with the underground, and they were working in a basement of a church the whole time of the war, since 1940.</span> <span id="s955">Food was supplied and anything.</span> <span id="s956">That was an exchange place for ammunition.</span> <span id="s957">I didn’t know, and they didn't know of what I have there.</span> <span id="s958">And they didn't know the exchange over there.</span> <span id="s959">But where they were is false pay – papers and ammunition exchange.</span> <span id="s960">People brought and other people came to get the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: How did things change for your mother and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: They changed because my father was at the rabbi’s house with 10 other people to arrange for a burial, which was in secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: And this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: And one of them, they were denounced and they were arrested in August of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: So two years after the Germans have arrived –</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: – they were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s969">Q: Let’s go back a little bit, to May 1940, when your husband leaves –</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: – and we’ve talked about how you got involved in resistance.</span> <span id="s972">When is the first time you saw a German soldier, or you came face to face with a sol –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: I have a picture of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: You do?</span> <span id="s975">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yeah, because once we had the yellow star, that was in – the yellow star, we got the yellow star in 1940, and the Germans were walking freely in the cafés in Belgium, sure, because they felt they were the – the heroes, the victors.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Did you have any experience of – of a German who would treat you differently on the street when they saw you – you wearing the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: No, unless they were in charge to check our papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: And did you have that happen?</span> <span id="s980">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Your papers weren’t checked.</span> <span id="s982">Okay.</span> <span id="s983">So would it be fair to say that in the first year or two you really never had any direct contact with the occupiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well, we were on a streetcar, and we had to run because they were on one side, then they would – came smart, and they were on both side of the tram, you know, the entrance and the exit.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s986">And you weren’t supposed to be on the tram?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Not as Jewish, they would take you.</span> <span id="s988">They would arrest you.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So you couldn’t tra –</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Or when people were stand – in 1940, we had to buy the yellow star and we had to stay in line to get the food rations, because food was on rations.</span> <span id="s991">And of course you stayed in line in this small grocery store, wherever they had food, they had.</span> <span id="s992">And that’s where they come and examine Jews.</span> <span id="s993">So you were lucky if you passed, and if got a half a bread or something, or certain things, and not being caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Did you have to go to work again?</span> <span id="s995">Once your husband left, did you have to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: To work?</span> <span id="s997">No, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s998">I didn't go to work any more once I became pregnant.</span> <span id="s999">And you know, in the middle months –</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: How did – how did you live?</span> <span id="s1003">Once your husband left, how did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Well, whatever food my mother has, we shared.</span> <span id="s1005">And I was selling my husband’s clothes, and that gave me food.</span> <span id="s1006">And also, what we had in Belgium, young women with their babies – we had to go to clinics where we got – where the babies were examine.</span> <span id="s1007">You had to go every week til the baby was six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: In those places you have physicians or doctors, whatever you call it, with medications, care and food for the child.</span> <span id="s1010">There was one lady by the name Madame Louise who was kind and generous and giving me once in awhile food for Josiane.</span> <span id="s1011">But it’s so unbelievable today to realize that those kind and generous people were risking their own lives, because if they would be caught, they would be shot on the spot, no question ask.</span> <span id="s1012">They have a monument in Brussels, with two people who were trying to run away, and they were shot by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1013">It’s hard today to think of the courage and the bravery of so many kind people.</span> <span id="s1014">There was no money involved, there was no glory involved.</span> <span id="s1015">Here on the fifth floor, if you ever have a chance, see that documentary of five people.</span> <span id="s1016">There’s two priests and three women, and they were ask – because thanks to them who started to organize it, that we had 4,000 Jewish people who were saved in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So these were people who were part of these clinics, who would – gave food – who would check the babies every week and would give food.</span> <span id="s1018">Now, a few questions.</span> <span id="s1019">Did you know what happened to your husband?</span> <span id="s1020">When he left, did you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: No.</span> <span id="s1022">What did really happen, there were three ships.</span> <span id="s1023">Two were put in flames and burn, and one made it to England.</span> <span id="s1024">My husband happened to be on the one who came to England, but we didn’t know about that tragedy til after the war, because the first things the Germans did is t-take away the radios.</span> <span id="s1025">You had to bring the radios to a destination, and eve –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Was that for everybody, every citizen, or just the Jews?</span> <span id="s1027">A: Just the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And it was easy for them to find out who has a radio, because you had to register your radio and you paid like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Oh, I see –</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: – you – a fee, or taxes, whatever you call.</span> <span id="s1032">And it’s so hard when I speak to young people to make them understand the importance of not having a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You’re cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: – because today you have so many gadgets of communication, so there’s not the problem, and that was our biggest problem, that we were cut off completely from the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s1035">Also, bicycles were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Only from Jews again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: The bicycles were – but the first order of confiscation thing – and you got a number – they were so organized during it, they had the number to give you when they took the radio away.</span> <span id="s1038">And just to give you an idea of the importance of the radio, when we got married in 1938, part of the family got together, in order to be able to buy us a radio.</span> <span id="s1039">My parents didn’t have a radio, because it was too costly.</span> <span id="s1040">So how you explain to young people today – I always mention that, and once when I spoke to another place, one of the teachers had slides that in German this – they did that, take away the radios.</span> <span id="s1041">But my son-in-law Freddie, who is from Austria, he said – he lived in an apartment building, and he said he was not 10, because at 10 he left already for England, and he said they had a German neighbor, and he got a radio, because that’s the only way you heard Hitler’s speeches.</span> <span id="s1042">Where in Belgium was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1043">But it’s very di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: – fficult for young people who just, you know, have in their pocket, and technology so advance, while you and I are even talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Well, it’s very hard for a person to imagine to be completely cut off, to have no means of communication, not know what the outside world is.</span> <span id="s1047">That’s so not the current kind of experience that most modern people ex – have, you know?</span> <span id="s1048">It’s – you have to make an effort to be cut off, to go away and turn off your computer and turn off your mobile phone, but it’s your choice.</span> <span id="s1049">It’s not taken from you.</span> <span id="s1050">And in this case, your means of knowing of what was going on in the outside world was taken.</span> <span id="s1051">So – so you didn’t know if your husband survived or didn’t survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No, we only learn about that tragedy after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: So you were – and that unknowing, that adds stress too, that adds fear, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: That’s why I’m so surprised that my brain is – didn’t take a off – tension?</span> <span id="s1055">It – it was just like we were wired and the wires gonna just explode.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Did your daughter notice this?</span> <span id="s1057">I mean, she’s a toddler, she’s a baby.</span> <span id="s1058">And daughters – children notice how parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: She was the happiest child you want to know.</span> <span id="s1060">She walked at nine months, under the table.</span> <span id="s1061">She was singing for her food, you wouldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So she was oblivious, thankfully oblivious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: And she loved my mother.</span> <span id="s1066">There’s a picture here, I think I have it, home, her and my mother at the age of two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: We can look at those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: There’s some pictures here which are much better than those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Let me take a look at that.</span> <span id="s1070">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: When she hugs my mother on the balcony where they living.</span> <span id="s1072">My mother used to sing with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1074">She would – I see that picture.</span> <span id="s1075">So, remind me again, right in 1940, your parent – I – I know you talked about your father being arrested in 1942, but did their lives change much in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Sure, they had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s1077">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Star.</span> <span id="s1079">Okay.</span> <span id="s1080">Could he still earn a living through working with the community, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Well, at that time the organizations were trying to help, because don’t forget, they were still conducting funerals, and that’s why they were together.</span> <span id="s1082">You know, how you just – the more and more – this – this is in me, and I have a hard time.</span> <span id="s1083">How did those people survive those agony, the daily agony, I think?</span> <span id="s1084">The daily fears.</span> <span id="s1085">And you didn’t know if next minute you gonna be arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: When did the arrests start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: When did the arrests start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Oh, the arrests start in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: So fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Oh yes, oh yeah, they were very well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And were Jews arrested en masse, or were simply certain people picked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Wherever.</span> <span id="s1094">We were hounded like dogs.</span> <span id="s1095">Standing in line in the grocery place, going on the tram.</span> <span id="s1096">It was easy for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Did you get an order at one point that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: We all got orders to report for work, and many of my friends who were not married at the time reported for work.</span> <span id="s1099">Not only they reported for work, they had to bring certain items to work.</span> <span id="s1100">And don’t forget that was 1940, where many people were just – who had money, bought things and to be able to sell it.</span> <span id="s1101">I was selling all the clothes from my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: They were brou – what – what was the purpose of these items that they had to bring to work?</span> <span id="s1103">They had to give them up to the – to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1105">And of course we never heard of them.</span> <span id="s1106">None of my school friends had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: So that means when they reported to work –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: – it wasn’t really work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Of course it wasn’t, but we didn’t know then.</span> <span id="s1111">The order to come to work was the order of what to bring for them to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: So they just disappeared from your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: You know, this is why today, with mainly American friends, they talk about I went to school there – like I belong to an organization which is called Coming of Age, to encourage seniors to remain in their place.</span> <span id="s1114">And they have different program, mainly lunches, shows, and just a matter of getting people together before they have to go to assisted living or have to live with somebody else to be helped.</span> <span id="s1115">You know, I went to school in the Bronx, I went to school in New York, and they still talk about that period, which is wonderful.</span> <span id="s1116">But I can’t describe – I don’t have that.</span> <span id="s1117">I don’t have that conversation.</span> <span id="s1118">And we were very close with our friends.</span> <span id="s1119">I had two friends, they had money, a lot.</span> <span id="s1120">They hired somebody to take them to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1121">And some people managed, and they arrived.</span> <span id="s1122">But those two, with their brothers, wer – the money was taken, they never made it in Switzerland, and then after we learned that everything was taken, then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: They were betrayed, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1125">There was a lot of betrayal, a lot.</span> <span id="s1126">Like my father would never be discovered if somebody would not betray them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Fanny, describe for me the – I’m finding it hard to un – understand the overall danger.</span> <span id="s1128">I know that it’s existed and so on, but I’m trying to get a sense of, when you went out in the morning to go buy milk for Josy, yeah, did you fee –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Which wasn’t often, and we didn’t go in the morning.</span> <span id="s1130">We ta – we have find out –</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: – where more guards are in that street, or in this street.</span> <span id="s1133">Don’t forget, those were neighborhoods, with neighborhood stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay, so you would find out what place was guarded, and what – so does this mean that every time you stepped out of your apartment, you were in danger that you could be arrested and not come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1136">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: From day one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1139">Which has happened.</span> <span id="s1140">But they made it easy, because they send out working sheets, for people to report to certain places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Did you ever get such a working sheet for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Why do you think that didn’t happen?</span> <span id="s1144">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1145">You may not have been on a register.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: I was.</span> <span id="s1147">That’s the only way you – you could get your food stamps, and that’s the only way that you bought your star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: You had to have money, buy your star and get the food st – the – the coupons, in order to buy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: And in 1942, when your father was arrested, what made that particularly – beca – he was arrested simply for being Jewish in that place, you know, in the – in the – in the circle of people.</span> <span id="s1151">Had he not gone that day to that meeting, would have he been safe for one more day?</span> <span id="s1152">Is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1154">I don’t know, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: And remind me again, it was to discuss the funeral of somebody in the community, and there were a group of people who gathered together, and all of them were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1157">Including the rabbi’s two granddaughters.</span> <span id="s1158">But they were taken to Breendonk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1160">And what is Breendonk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Breendonk was a torture camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: – in Belgium, which they took the Jewish people, they tortured them, and then they send them to Auschwitz, which we didn’t know that name, but they were dead already, before they got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Because I went to Belgium, they had a reunion of survivors and children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1166">Children of survivors who were already 10 - 12 and grew up in hiding.</span> <span id="s1167">What’s happening to them, their mental state, it – it just – it just unbelievable what has happened to people off the sca – and of the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: I mean, those were people who were normal people living normal lives, either school or working or being married, or trying to get married, and all of a sudden – and they were lucky that they wound up in hiding, but that has affected their lives.</span> <span id="s1170">They antisocial.</span> <span id="s1171">Many couldn’t have a relationship to marry, and many have many more problems.</span> <span id="s1172">They had a reunion quite a number of years ago in Belgium and I went.</span> <span id="s1173">I don’t know, did you know a Flora Singer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I’ve heard of her yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: She was very much involve and we – we went.</span> <span id="s1176">And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: You went.</span> <span id="s1178">And is that when you found out about what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, we knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: You said that they died before Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: How did you know about how they died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: We didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: We only know when we came, because we cou – we had a choice to go to Breendonk, and today Breendonk is a museum where they still have the tools what they have used –</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: In torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: – to torture the Jews.</span> <span id="s1188">Not only the tools, but there’s a voice of what they were doing and what they were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: And nobody has ever come out alive from Breendonk, and it’s still a museum today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: So I want to go back to your father’s fate.</span> <span id="s1192">You heard about what happened to him through your mother, or through somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: We only knew that they were arrested, we would – never knew of deportations.</span> <span id="s1194">We only knew people who were – got those sheets to go to work, but we didn’t know of deportations.</span> <span id="s1195">Like I have learn about the deportations when I was working with Steven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: The time and the dates and how many people on each one.</span> <span id="s1198">And that’s how I have learned, through the German young woman, the reporter, about all those things which – which has happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Okay, I think we’re gonna take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s1201">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Okay, so Fanny, I wanted to ask a few questions for clarification.</span> <span id="s1203">I wanted to get a sense of what was it like personally – as a person who is Jewish when the invasion happened.</span> <span id="s1204">How did you go from feeling fear to actually experiencing the danger?</span> <span id="s1205">How did things become more and more dangerous?</span> <span id="s1206">Can you take us through some of those steps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: As soon each day were passing, we were more frightened, more – petrified would be better words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Because we were not prepared for that, specially we have been advised that we would not be occupied, so we were still hoping that things would remain as normal, if you could use the word normal for such a situation.</span> <span id="s1210">But it didn’t happen, so – an –</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: So – what were the f – [technical adjustments] Sorry Fanny, the – you were petrified, and wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Of the unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Of the unknown.</span> <span id="s1214">Ho – what started to become known?</span> <span id="s1215">How did things start to get to be known about what your situation was?</span> <span id="s1216">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Okay, first of all it started out that the Germans in big trucks passed different neighborhoods with loudspeaker and announcing of the different rules they gonna have.</span> <span id="s1218">And if we are not gonna obey, we gonna be punished.</span> <span id="s1219">The first assignment was to take our radios, to bring them to a different destination.</span> <span id="s1220">Then also the Jewish organizations has had our yellow stars, which we had to buy.</span> <span id="s1221">We also had to collect our food stamps, and with those stamps you are allowed to buy whatever any store had available, but you had to have the food stamps in order to buy.</span> <span id="s1222">The Germans started to – and people lined up in different little store.</span> <span id="s1223">Don’t forget there was not like a big shopping center or a big food market you go today with the list and you buy whatever you need.</span> <span id="s1224">You could only buy certain thing.</span> <span id="s1225">And in Belgium they still had small stores, and each stores had different products to sell.</span> <span id="s1226">So you know one day this store is gonna have certain thing, and that this day another store is gonna have the – have thing.</span> <span id="s1227">And the Germans started to check the people in line, and you never know who was gonna be checked, and you never knew which store is gonna be checked.</span> <span id="s1228">So you see, our fear – there must be a better word than I use, fear, because it was more than just fear.</span> <span id="s1229">Because you were just looking in the side or on the back of – if somebody is following you.</span> <span id="s1230">And another thing what the Germans did already in the beginning on, in Belgium they had street cars.</span> <span id="s1231">There’s an entrance and an exit, so what they were doing, one soldier at the exit, one at the entrance, and in between time to check people.</span> <span id="s1232">They started to do that at the end of 1940.</span> <span id="s1233">In the beginning people were using the streetcar and whenever you saw somebody coming up, you went down on the other side.</span> <span id="s1234">But this way you had no chance of going there, or going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">And after you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And if they check you and they find you, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Well, they haven’t found me, not at that time.</span> <span id="s1238">And many others they did.</span> <span id="s1239">And a friend of mine who was on one of those cars, and there were a lot of people so she was standing and holding on where you stand here on a streetcar, and she got so scared, and she wanted to jump off it and she fell off it and got killed on the spot, jumping off.</span> <span id="s1240">Because – I don’t know if you could say it’s fear, was more –</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Terror, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: – than fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: It sounds like terror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Terror is the word, I couldn’t find that one.</span> <span id="s1245">We were really terrorized.</span> <span id="s1246">And also there was a time when we had to put our radios to a certain destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: And that made it even worse, because then it cut completely off communication.</span> <span id="s1249">And that’s the only communication we had in Belgium from the outside world, and we didn't have the radio.</span> <span id="s1250">And then they confiscated the bicycles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Fanny, as this – as th – as – [technical interruption] Okay.</span> <span id="s1252">As the months went by, how did it come – occur to you, how did it come into your mind that maybe you had to give Josy away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Oh, that was not til my father was taken away.</span> <span id="s1254">That really made up the decision for me, if I wanted or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: I see, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Because I could never imagine if that’s a possibility.</span> <span id="s1257">Somehow I felt those people would be protected, and I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1258">So once my father was taken away in ’42, I really had absolutely no choice, but I still couldn’t make up a decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Did you talk about this with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: With your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: So – what did your sisters do, sh – her – she had two boys, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: At that time she had already three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: She had three boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1267">And before she went to work in the basement of the church, they took the three boys away in hiding.</span> <span id="s1268">Because the same group who put them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: – in the particular job, they had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: I see, so – so her sons were in hiding and as far as she knew, they were safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Her boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Hopefully, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: You know, even putting a child in hiding, you still didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Because we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1279">And another thing, we were not allowed to know where those children would be put into hiding, because in case we would be arrested, or stopped, we used to call it, we would be beaten and probably give out the names.</span> <span id="s1280">And that was the reason of not knowing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: So wa – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: – where the children would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: So in some ways the – your sister had already done this, she had already given her children to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: But it was differently [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1285">Don’t forget, she was with her husband through the time, so there was two people deciding, and they couldn’t keep the three boys together if they wanted to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1287">T – in the resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: In the resistant movements, and their job was in that basement, which they haven’t gone out from ’40 til the end of ’44 when Belgium was liberated.</span> <span id="s1289">They were making false papers.</span> <span id="s1290">They were also making exchange of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1291">People knew where to deposit whatever they had to deposit and pick up what has to be pick up.</span> <span id="s1292">Even without names this was – that’s why it was so difficult, and that’s why Belgium was very lucky that the resistant, with Jewish people and non-Jewish people had been working together.</span> <span id="s1293">And because of that, and the dedication of so many brave and – and kind people, so many, like I said before, 4,000 Jewish chil-children were able to be saved.</span> <span id="s1294">Don’t forget among the children saved were also children who came previously from Belgium and from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: – Austria and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1298">So wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: So for small country, the more you think about it today, and the more and more people study the history of that period of time, it’s hard for them even to imagine the possibility of people, who knowing – they had big signs or posters on each corners, if we find a Jewish person, the person’s gonna be shot for hiding a Jew.</span> <span id="s1300">And they did that, killing people.</span> <span id="s1301">Some teachers have been arrested because they were – it’s – it was easier for them to hide some children.</span> <span id="s1302">So it’s really unbelievably like a miracle, you would say –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: – to be able to save that number of children in a very small country, because Belgium is about the size of New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1305">Food was rationed and there was no money exchanged, and pille – people were willing to risk their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: But still, when it comes to your own baby, I can’t – I can’t imagine it, being a mother myself, I can’t imagine it, particularly when my child would be so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1308">I still today have the pain of her crying and leaving, can you believe that?</span> <span id="s1309">You ca – it’s – you can’t say that, because we didn't know if the decision we made was right or not.</span> <span id="s1310">We didn’t know what ever gonna happen to us.</span> <span id="s1311">We never know who’s gonna take care of mine child, my precious child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: You describe Josy as a baby of being a very happy baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Very much so, because everybody just loves her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: She used to sing for her supper at the age of one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: How sweet, how sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: That’s why you see that picture, she and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: When she used to get – I used to make her clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: And whenever she got something new she used to come to my mother.</span> <span id="s1322">And she didn’t speak at that time, but she was just showing her, like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Her new clothes.</span> <span id="s1324">And was this the first time that she had ever been with a stranger, even?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: So she had never seen strangers before, everyone in her world, she had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1328">Except the two ladies who came, and also friends who came til she was three.</span> <span id="s1329">So she had seen people with me, and people with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: But the first time she’s taken by somebody – so why would she cry?</span> <span id="s1331">Why w –</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Because, number one, she didn’t want to leave me.</span> <span id="s1333">Not only crying, screaming, she didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1334">And also, she was not allowed to take a toy, because we were – you know, we were afraid in case somebody would see somebody with the child and the toy, it would become suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Did you know the ladies who took her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: No, never met them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1338">So they really were strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Completely, to both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Do you remember what they looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Yeah, I think I would recognize if I would see them today, because this is so impact in you subconscious that you see – like I’m sitting now and talking with you, I still have heart-beatings of that period, of that moment, just her leaving me and crying.</span> <span id="s1342">They were lovely, nice ladies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Were they older, younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: I think they were older than me, because don’t forget, that was about – very young time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: You were like 24 - 25, something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: An they would have been maybe 30 - 40?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Maybe about – yes, you right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: But you see, again, I don’t look at them of any age, I look at them just as people who have tried to help, if that’s the word.</span> <span id="s1351">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Did they seem kind?</span> <span id="s1353">When you met them, did they seem kind, or did they seem –</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: They had to be, otherwise they could never get the child, otherwise the child would cry or scream all the way, til they would be someplace.</span> <span id="s1355">And another thing which was very difficult, because we were not allowed to know where those children would be taken, because in case we would be caught, and by beating, and of course you would tell anything, no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Was it in the daytime, in – at – in the evening?</span> <span id="s1357">What happen – was it in the morning when Josy was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: It was daytime, after lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: It must have been aw –</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I guess they were waiting, you know, for the child to be fed.</span> <span id="s1361">You know, everything was just like when you think now, it makes so much sense of the actions or whatever they were doing, on such an important time, or unbelievable time in our lives.</span> <span id="s1362">Or undescribable words, I can’t find words of describing such a trauma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: How do you – when did – were you alone afterwards, or did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yeah, that’s why I collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: You collapsed after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: That’s why I chose in the movie I was telling you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: – about that schoolteacher in Poland who was saving children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: And they showed in that documentary, how one of the mothers, and she took away her child, how she collapsed and couldn’t breathe and couldn’t move for a long time.</span> <span id="s1371">Because you – there is – for me anyway, there’s no words I could describe such emotions.</span> <span id="s1372">They’re painful emotions really, unless there’s another word.</span> <span id="s1373">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Did your mother and sisters know that this would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: No, only my mother knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1377">And did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: But sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: – did she come to you or did you – were you able to go to her soon afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No, I waited a few ta – a few days, because I was not able even to move.</span> <span id="s1381">This had such a impact, which is still with me today.</span> <span id="s1382">I still hear the cry.</span> <span id="s1383">And I had no way of helping her.</span> <span id="s1384">It’s not when you have a child and falling and you take the child and you kiss to make good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: That was not what you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1388">You couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1389">When you were able at least to start functioning again, how did your life go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: How you call functioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Functioning means you got up, you had something to eat, you started to invol – you know how did your life pick up after you gave Josy away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: It just didn’t pick up.</span> <span id="s1393">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: It couldn’t pick up, because li – you all lives, it’s not the same life you had before, because all of a sudden you just one, and you don’t have a child to hug, or a child to hug you.</span> <span id="s1395">So this is the hardest thing.</span> <span id="s1396">You really have to try to continue breathing or continue living.</span> <span id="s1397">Thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: When you need another [inaudible] I guess what I want to ask is, what happened to you in the days and the weeks afterwards?</span> <span id="s1399">What – how did your life continue?</span> <span id="s1400">What were the events that took place in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: It continue and started to worry us more.</span> <span id="s1402">Don’t forget, like I told you, my father was already taken away and the whole concept of life is already different thinking.</span> <span id="s1403">What’s gonna happen within a minute?</span> <span id="s1404">We don’t know, because we were like chased, like you chase a dog sometime, and we didn’t know where the drop would be.</span> <span id="s1405">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1406">Because it just seem according to other countries, that in Belgium they were a little different, the Nazis, because they knew that the Belgium people would help us – much help it would be available.</span> <span id="s1407">Although in Belgium we had an organization, the black shirts, who were working with the Nazis and helping the Nazis deport the Jews, because many of those people who have denounced the Jews, whatever it was, in the house, in their place, it was taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1408">And anybody who has denounced the Jews got part of that – whatever they were able to steal and take away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: So there was an incentive?</span> <span id="s1410">There was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Only if you were that kind of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: – of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: But then again, how could you put the two together, when you have so many people of any background, of any religion, who were willing to risk their lives, just to sha – to save one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: It was in 1942 then, what month was it that your father was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: In the month of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And when – what month was it that you gave Josy away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: I think it was October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So, as 1942 go – you know, comes to an end, are you still in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Are you still in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: I was still in the apartment, this was the [indecipherable] the decision of me going into hiding, and my mother going into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: How did you do that, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1423">You stayed within your own homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: And how did you get fed?</span> <span id="s1426">Did other people go and – and bring you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: No, we tried to get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: As much it was possible, and as much we try not to be caught.</span> <span id="s1430">Because this is what the Nazis did, they organized.</span> <span id="s1431">And they had a documentary about two months ago, from France which is called the raffier(ph), which really means the round-up.</span> <span id="s1432">How they have collected and taking the Jews from France, which was the same order as they did it in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: And so you were trying to avoid this raffier(ph) that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: What happened after that, in the winter of 1943, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Well, in 1943 I went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1439">My mother was working in a old age home, and she was able to stay there.</span> <span id="s1440">But being in hiding I – I was hiding in a small farm, which was run by an elderly couple.</span> <span id="s1441">And the brother of – of Constant(ph) lived with them.</span> <span id="s1442">Very kind people.</span> <span id="s1443">Very old, compare to me, but they were very kind.</span> <span id="s1444">Their main purpose of keeping that little farm was just the chickens so they would have eggs.</span> <span id="s1445">And they were exchanging some of the eggs with another farm for something else.</span> <span id="s1446">They would –</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: How did you get to know these people in the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Through the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: The same people who took Josiane, they got other people in contact, and they got other people in contact.</span> <span id="s1451">It was just a big circle –</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Network, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Or whatever, I don’t know, you prob –</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Network.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Network.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Network of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Which of course we didn’t know that word either.</span> <span id="s1458">And it didn’t exist, because without radios and without telephone and with any kind of communication, it just is a miracle, if that’s what you want to call it.</span> <span id="s1459">An unbelievable way of putting that in your mind, what people could do to save or to help other people, in spite of all the evil all around us.</span> <span id="s1460">And all those people have been warned, in case they would find Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1461">But in sp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: So this wasn’t – excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1465">This was an elderly couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Very elderly couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: And how far was their farm from your home in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Not far, was in Vlazenberg(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: It wasn’t far.</span> <span id="s1471">They had special buses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: What do you mean by special buses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: I mean regular buses, but there was a larger bus and not going from one place to the other as often as regular probably, transportation.</span> <span id="s1474">And loneliness –</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Did you get there by bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: No, it was streetcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1478">So you took streetcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1480">And sometime I used to meet my mother, because loneliness, not having my mother, not having my child is like my whole soul went out of me.</span> <span id="s1481">I don’t even have the proper words to express such a despair, because we didn’t know if the next day is gonna be better.</span> <span id="s1482">Sometime people are depressed and have problem, and they know maybe next day or next week things are gonna be better, but we didn’t have that to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Did you – okay.</span> <span id="s1484">[break] Okay, Fanny, when – when you were describing that utter despair of not having your child, of being alone.</span> <span id="s1485">Your husband is gone, your mother is in hiding, your father has been arrested.</span> <span id="s1486">Your sister – your older sister is underground, at least in the church building, working on – in – in activities that you didn’t know about at the time.</span> <span id="s1487">You say that you come from an Orthodox family, did you feel yourself to be very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: It was very, very confusing, with many questions and no answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Did you feel like your faith in God had been shaken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Not only that, you had the feeling of such emptiness and helplessness, you could just cry to God with many questions and of course, no answers.</span> <span id="s1491">You really start feeling, is this being punished because we Jewish?</span> <span id="s1492">But we were good people, it’s not – and it was extremely painful, because you didn’t get an answer, and you just had questions.</span> <span id="s1493">Like my father and the rabbi taken, because in the rabbi’s house, he had – the son has already gone, but he had a daughter-in-law with two small children, and also taken at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: And how to figure all that out, why is it happening, why –</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: We don’t know, we still questioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: And I think much learned people still have the same question today when it comes to religion.</span> <span id="s1498">Everybody else has a defin – different opinion and a different feeling about.</span> <span id="s1499">And many rabbis today don’t know the answer either and have a hard time of answering the people who have been asking the same questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: This elderly couple that you were with, were they people that you could share any of this with, or were you silent with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Completely silent because you can’t convey a pain in you which you can’t express, because nobody would be there.</span> <span id="s1502">Like when a child falls and you just kiss it for better, and then it does get better, but we know that nothing is gonna get better and we didn’t know how much worse it’s gonna get for us.</span> <span id="s1503">In our wildest nightmare we couldn’t even imagine that there’s a place like hell on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Well let’s, unfortunately, go there.</span> <span id="s1505">How long did you stay at this farm, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: From the end of ’42, til winter of ’43, I went and we met, my mother and I.</span> <span id="s1507">The attic was already empty at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Where the resistance people used to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: That – that – the attic where the resistance people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: And the couple who was there permanently and originally, they were sent on an assignment and they were sent on assignments previously.</span> <span id="s1514">But this assignment, they never came back.</span> <span id="s1515">And then, after the war, we have learned that they have been caught, and they were – been killed.</span> <span id="s1516">But that we learned after the war.</span> <span id="s1517">And our – my loneliness was to such extent that when I met my mother, we decided we gonna stay in the attic overnight.</span> <span id="s1518">And I guess this was a bad decision, because either we were followed, or somebody told on us, because that attic has never been touched and nobody ever has been taken out.</span> <span id="s1519">Don’t forget, some of the people were there for few year – for two years at least, and it has never been discovered.</span> <span id="s1520">Anyway, the two of us were discovered, and we were taken by a covered truck to the Germans headquarters in Avenue Louise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: How did – can you walk me through that – those moments?</span> <span id="s1522">You spent one night in this attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: And during that night you were discovered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: And was it in the middle of the night that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s1529">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Were there police, were there soldiers, were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: There were soldiers, and apparently they were making the rounds in that corner, because where we lived was not a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1532">They were not a Jewish couple, but that was not like you would call a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1533">It was a little more out of the city of Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: So how did they know – I mean, if it was an attic –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1536">Somebody must either follow us, or somebody has denounced us, which I think we must have been denounced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: So they – they knew there was an attic door and they were able to come to the attic door and they were able to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: – enter?</span> <span id="s1540">Did they need a key to get in, did they knock it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No, they just knocked and woke up the – woke up the people who lived in the floor below.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: And that’s how they came and knock at our door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: How many soldiers were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Well, there were two who came to the apartment, but there were other people on that truck already, which they have arrested before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Were they uniformed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Yes, they were always wearing uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Were they German or Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: The people who were in the black shirts in Belgium did more other kind of work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1552">But they were part of the German army in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1553">They were called the black shirts.</span> <span id="s1554">They were called the Grell(ph), because he was head of that department.</span> <span id="s1555">And he fled when – after the war, and he was condemned to death, because he has denounced many non-Jewish Belgium people in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1556">And for that was not allowed to come back to Belgium, he was condemned to death, and they were hoping to get him back from Brazil, which they have never been able to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: When they took you, do you remember what the soldiers acted like, what they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: – how they behaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Like worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Were they screaming at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1563">And we were taken to the headquarters on Avenue Louise in Brussels where the headquarters were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: The Gestapo headquarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Yes, in Avenue Louise, that was their headquarters.</span> <span id="s1566">And we were badly beaten up, mainly on the face and the mouth.</span> <span id="s1567">This was their priority when they were beating on people.</span> <span id="s1568">And we stayed overnight because we were both bleeding.</span> <span id="s1569">Don’t forget, my mother wasn’t 50, and – and the next day we were taken, also by the same covered trucks, we were taken to Malines which is called Mechelen in Flemish, and that was a place of some – where all people were gathering.</span> <span id="s1570">And when they had a certain number, they were transporting those people, and we didn’t know to where or what.</span> <span id="s1571">And I think this is why it scared us constantly, is the fear of not knowing.</span> <span id="s1572">Because I think we young people, if we would have even suspect what hell is, we knew it from reading, but we didn’t know the real existence of hell, I think we would all killed ourself, if we would know that there’s such a hell as Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1573">After three days – oh, and then we all got the number which was hanged on our neck, with the number, and on our cattle train there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: So you were put from the truck to a – to a train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: No, from the truck we were taken to Malines.</span> <span id="s1576">We stayed for 10 days there, and apparently they collected enough people to put on the cattle train to be transported to Auschwitz, which we didn’t know Auschwitz, we never heard that name in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Did you know that you – did they say Auschwitz before they put you on the train –</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: – or you did – you didn’t know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: No, we didn't even know where we going, and we didn’t know the meaning of Auschwitz, we never heard that word.</span> <span id="s1581">But on the cattle train, what we discovered is that they had 110 people on the cattle train and I’m sure you saw the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Where were you?</span> <span id="s1583">Were you in one corner, were you up above, were you down below?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: We were about in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Were you in a bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: There were no bunks on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: There were no bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: No, you just had to stand or to lean on one another.</span> <span id="s1589">You couldn’t sit down, you couldn’t lie down.</span> <span id="s1590">And we had two buckets, one with water and one for the latrine.</span> <span id="s1591">I can’t even describe to you that voyage on the cattle train.</span> <span id="s1592">The scream, the prayers in any language, and the cry and screaming.</span> <span id="s1593">The worst thing was the cries of the babies.</span> <span id="s1594">And finally we arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1595">It was pitch black.</span> <span id="s1596">Then they have those big light – flashlight like you see sometime when they open a business, or for the movies when they showing.</span> <span id="s1597">And from 110 people, 40 people came out alive.</span> <span id="s1598">From the 40 people we don’t know how many came to the camp.</span> <span id="s1599">Women with children who came out alive, the soldiers greet us with barking dogs.</span> <span id="s1600">They told to the young women to drop the child.</span> <span id="s1601">And she says, I go where my child goes.</span> <span id="s1602">So he shot – he shot with his own revolver the baby, and first the mother start screaming, and he shot the mother on the way falling down to the baby.</span> <span id="s1603">Now you could understand when I say that this is never going to go out of my soul til my dying days.</span> <span id="s1604">The screaming of the baby before it was dead, and the mother before she died.</span> <span id="s1605">And this was done many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: You all – when they open up the train and you let – you’re let out of the train and that’s your introduction to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1608">And then we had to form li – lines, one for men and one for women.</span> <span id="s1609">And in the line where I was with the women, my mother was with me, then he separated my mother from me, and I knew being together we gonna help or being able to help one another.</span> <span id="s1610">But while the soldier was ma – walking down, I slipped over to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s1611">And I was hit over the head, if I tell you to stay here, then that’s what you stay.</span> <span id="s1612">And that was the last time I saw my wonderful mother alive.</span> <span id="s1613">Then we had to form lines, and from the line I was on, we were taken to a freezing room, and we had all to, in front of soldiers with their dogs, we had to undress completely.</span> <span id="s1614">And I tried to explain to you that we all came from decent home, and we have never undressed in front of strangers.</span> <span id="s1615">Not only because we had to get undressed, but we were checked if we were hiding thing in our private parts.</span> <span id="s1616">After that long wait, we were given uniforms and wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1617">Then we went and we had numbers tattooed on our arm, and we had our head shaved.</span> <span id="s1618">And finally we went to the shower, with screams and crying, hold onto one another.</span> <span id="s1619">And finally, after the shower, we got one blanket for six people and we were put into barracks.</span> <span id="s1620">The barracks consisted of shelves covered with straw, and one blanket for six people.</span> <span id="s1621">Besides crying and hugging one another, and still not realizing the hell we were on, and then we fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1622">And the net – and the next day we were called to line up, and we lined up, and our group went to work into a ammunition factory, where the air was impossible to breathe because of the chemicals.</span> <span id="s1623">We were cleaning and the fume was bad.</span> <span id="s1624">We worked there for 12 hours, then we marched back to our barrack where we got soup which was like water, and a slice of bread which didn’t even taste like bread.</span> <span id="s1625">And again, we were counted, and at that time, before we were allowed to go to the barracks, we learned where our loved ones went and then we saw the crematorium, and the smoke out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Who told you?</span> <span id="s1627">Was it – was it other inmates who told you?</span> <span id="s1628">Was it the camp guards who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: No, we had just above us somebody who was in charge of us to make sure we behave, and they told us.</span> <span id="s1630">And then we saw the fumes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: So these were other inmates, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1633">But they – they are the ones who were dividing the soup, and they are the ones who divided the bread we got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Was there anyone on that train that you knew besides your mother, who was in that cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Oh yeah, many people.</span> <span id="s1636">And Steven got me a list of names of people who got to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1637">The people who went right away to the gas chambers, their names are not on the list.</span> <span id="s1638">Only the people who came into Auschwitz, their names is on the list.</span> <span id="s1639">And of course, my mother’s name is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Were you completely then, without any acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Without anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: But the six of us became like family, because we had nobody, really nobody.</span> <span id="s1644">Nobody has anybody in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1645">It’s a word which I can describe – I can’t find word.</span> <span id="s1646">The only person who was able to describe Auschwitz is Primo Levi.</span> <span id="s1647">I don’t know if you ever read any of his books.</span> <span id="s1648">He was an engineer from Italy.</span> <span id="s1649">He was already an engineer when he was caught and deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1650">He’s the only person who was able to describe Auschwitz, really, really how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Do you remember the date you entered Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: In 40 – the end of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: That’s the date you entered Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: So you wer – managed to – you managed to not be caught for – until 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: No, not really, because every month –</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: – regardless how cold it was – this is – was the – the – the biggest [indecipherable] of the Germans, always lining up.</span> <span id="s1659">Because there were five women working in the ammunition factory who stood – we had little bombs with holes, and we had to clean those hole, because the next department were putting in small, small balls in the holes, so it explodes when they needed it.</span> <span id="s1660">So they sabotaged and they stole those.</span> <span id="s1661">And you know where they hid it?</span> <span id="s1662">They hid it in their mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: And then one crematorium did explode.</span> <span id="s1665">And it was only for overnight, but at least there were a few people less to be gassed at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1666">But all those five women were caught, and they were hanged.</span> <span id="s1667">And the whole camp had to stay for 24 hours, til those five women died hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: And you had to stand and see this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Everybody had to stand and watch those people die.</span> <span id="s1670">It’s interesting that not too long ago, on channel 26, they were showing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: This is the educational channel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: – and one woman who has survived was telling the same thing I was telling you, what has happened to those five women.</span> <span id="s1673">So this was recorded and people talk about it.</span> <span id="s1674">I was sitting in front the TV and I couldn’t believe that other people are hearing the things we went through, because don’t forget, I was still very young.</span> <span id="s1675">And in between I already had the medical experimentation.</span> <span id="s1676">Because while we were checked if we had lice, Mengele was his visit always, and he picked one or two or how many he want at each time.</span> <span id="s1677">And one of his visits, I was picked.</span> <span id="s1678">And I was taken, tied to a bed, things were taken from me, which I still don’t know what parts were taken.</span> <span id="s1679">Another thing, which I didn’t mention before, a month after we were in Auschwitz, none of the women had their periods any more, because, can you imagine thousands of women being there and having their periods monthly?</span> <span id="s1680">None of us had their periods any more.</span> <span id="s1681">But of course, having had the medical experimentation, it was such a tremendous impact on each and every one.</span> <span id="s1682">There’s one book here on the fifth floor, which 20 women who have survived medical experimentation in Ravensbrück have written a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: When this was done, Fanny, and you were taken and you say you were tied to a bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Were you given any kind of narcotic medication?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: You – of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s1689">They did that to thousands of women.</span> <span id="s1690">And another thing I have learned, that the cher – Germans made experimentation in Auschwitz on babies.</span> <span id="s1691">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1692">You see, here at the museum, a little over a year ago, they had the seminar.</span> <span id="s1693">Physicians or people who study medication from different countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s1694">There were 12 people, and I think they stayed here about 10 days.</span> <span id="s1695">The interesting thing is, I couldn’t understand til afterwards why I was chosen as a speaker to those people.</span> <span id="s1696">Only because all those people have studied German medicine for the past 200 years, and what they were doing on us, they started to do that 200 years ago.</span> <span id="s1697">Sterilization, abortion.</span> <span id="s1698">What you call when men are being sterilized, there’s a man in my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: A vasectomy.</span> <span id="s1700">A vasectomy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: No, there’s another word.</span> <span id="s1702">It’s gonna come afterward.</span> <span id="s1703">There’s three things that the Germans did.</span> <span id="s1704">Hundreds of years ago, if a family in Germany had a child and they felt that that child is not perfect, they used to have an institution where they gave their child away.</span> <span id="s1705">When that child, or adult for that matter, died, the family just got a notice, your so and so passed away, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1706">Nobody has ever questioned it, because everybody had to be perfect in Germany, and if the – they were not, they were taken to those institutions.</span> <span id="s1707">And that’s why, when they had the seminar here, they came to the museum, because of the background they have already learned, what the Germans did, hundreds – sterilization.</span> <span id="s1708">Couldn’t think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: So, sto –</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: So this has already started 200 years ago, which they tried to do on us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: How could you stand the pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: And they have books about that, and I took a book out because I wanted to show, when they had the seminar.</span> <span id="s1713">But they were ahead of me, because they are the ones who taught me what has happened 200 years ago.</span> <span id="s1714">So this now is just – like they have one book which is called “The Nazi Doctors.”</span> <span id="s1715">People want to know, why was it possible, for educated people?</span> <span id="s1716">It’s not like today a bunch of hoodlums want your money and they kill you just for the money.</span> <span id="s1717">This was organized by excellent physicians, nurses, educated people.</span> <span id="s1718">How could they have done the horrors they did?</span> <span id="s1719">I tell you another thing what happened Auschwitz and what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s1720">They had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe.</span> <span id="s1721">What they have decided and what they have done, there were women, were children and men.</span> <span id="s1722">They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that they’re gonna be taken to work.</span> <span id="s1723">Meanwhile, they have given milk to the children of the women who they took the fathers away.</span> <span id="s1724">A few days later they took the women and the children.</span> <span id="s1725">That was in August of 1944.</span> <span id="s1726">And they gassed the women the following two days.</span> <span id="s1727">In order not to fa – have a – a disturbing, they gave the babies the milk.</span> <span id="s1728">Can you imagine how vicious that is, and being done by educated doctors who were supposed to help people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Fanny, how could you stand the pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: You cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Did you pass out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Of course, we all did.</span> <span id="s1733">How could you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: I can’t imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: I can’t even describe it, even now.</span> <span id="s1736">My whole body is against and hurting.</span> <span id="s1737">How do you describe things like that for people who have never seen horrors?</span> <span id="s1738">We have never seen anybody being killed except through that period of time, and except seeing those babies being shot coming off the train.</span> <span id="s1739">How could any normal, if there’s a way of calling us normal, to live that the rest of your life?</span> <span id="s1740">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1741">That’s why we have – I have nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Still today when a train is passing, I just broke out in a sweat, because it still beats more.</span> <span id="s1744">That’s why I say to you, and to everybody who listens, how could anybody remain sane, if that’s the word I could use, after seeing such horrors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: How did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: We don’t.</span> <span id="s1747">We don’t.</span> <span id="s1748">We don’t.</span> <span id="s1749">And I would never recover.</span> <span id="s1750">And another thing which I say when I talk to people, it took me 50 years to be able to just to talk, because I still feel I’m less than another person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Is that what they gave you, that feeling that you were less –</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Absolutely, still today.</span> <span id="s1753">I couldn’t talk about I had medical experimentation, because that would make me even less than I am already.</span> <span id="s1754">And this was the power of the Germans, besides the selections.</span> <span id="s1755">And you – nobody ever knew who’s gonna be the next one, for any reason they have to put the person in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1756">There’s another book here, the author of the book passed away a couple years ago.</span> <span id="s1757">There’s only two people, two young men from Czechoslovakia who escaped Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1758">They describe Auschwitz, how the selections was, and they passed – the main reason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two only ones who ever escape alive, is because they wanted to go to Czechoslovakia, where they come from, to go to different organizations, because Eichmann was getting everything from the Jewish community in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1759">Trucks, tools, just name it, because he was fooling the Jewish people, telling them whatever you give us, then we would not have the discrimination or the deportation of the Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1760">But it didn’t happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it was continuing.</span> <span id="s1761">It’s – it’s really an amazing book if you could sit through and just read it.</span> <span id="s1762">You have to have a lot of strength, or whatever you have in you.</span> <span id="s1763">Because I was asked by one of the physicians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far I was in reading the book.</span> <span id="s1764">And I said so far I’m on the second page, and I wasn’t able to turn for the third.</span> <span id="s1765">But I have learned from them, which they have studied and they would, you know, like see how this is continuing with the German people.</span> <span id="s1766">And I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s still continuing today, of the experimentation they had.</span> <span id="s1767">They were number one a few hundred years ago, did you ever hear in history when you went to school?</span> <span id="s1768">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Fanny, I know it’s – I know that this is probably one of the most painful sections, but I would like, if you can, to describe what you can about the room, about whether you were alone in it, whether there were other women next to you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: When they made the experimentation?</span> <span id="s1771">No, there was one at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: One person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: One person at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And were there nurses with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Yes, there were two women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: So, German nurses were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: And a German doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Was it Mengele, was it another doctor, or you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: No, Mengele only supplied –</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: – the people.</span> <span id="s1784">Mengele had s – his eyes were like evil.</span> <span id="s1785">There’s only one picture, I think the only picture they have at the museum of Mengele.</span> <span id="s1786">There was no picture, he didn’t want to have pictures taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: And so was it a small room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Very small.</span> <span id="s1789">I don’t know if you remember, a few years ago, Elie Wiesel and Oprah went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Did you say – see that documentary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: I heard of it, yeah I heard of it, that was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Well, there’s a documentary, and they show you the snow and they show the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: They also show – and I didn’t know that til I saw that documentary, that they have made experimentation on men.</span> <span id="s1796">And I didn't know that til I saw that documentary.</span> <span id="s1797">It – it’s – it – and also you see shelves with little jars of whatever they took from people, or whatever they put into people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Do you know how long you were in that place?</span> <span id="s1799">A: You don’t, because you think it’s gonna be the end your life.</span> <span id="s1800">You think this is it.</span> <span id="s1801">I thought that this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: This is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: And I understand what the other women describing in the book.</span> <span id="s1804">Was the same.</span> <span id="s1805">We didn’t know what was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Did you – did you have a moment that say, you pass out and then at some point you come to consciousness again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: You never lose consciousness, because you’re too scared.</span> <span id="s1808">You think at – that’s – I thought, I don’t know others, that this is gonna be my last moment and I have to hang onto it to see my last moment going out of me.</span> <span id="s1809">You see, this is why it’s so difficult for me to stand up and to speak, because everybody had different experiences.</span> <span id="s1810">But here at the museum, of having so many survivor volunteers, I’m the only one who had the medical experimentation.</span> <span id="s1811">And this is why maybe it took me so many years to be talking about.</span> <span id="s1812">And like I told you, took me 50 years after I came back from Auschwitz from – liberated from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1813">I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1814">Don’t forget we didn’t have our period a month after we got to Auschwitz, and with the experimentation it took me 50 years to be able to talk about that period.</span> <span id="s1815">But you know while they did those experimentation, it was like little by little your life gets less, and you think you there already.</span> <span id="s1816">Then you feel another pain, and it’s not there yet, you still have to go lower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: So you feel you’re still alive because you still can feel pain.</span> <span id="s1818">Not that you can feel anything else, but the pain tells you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Well, another thing which was difficult for me to talk about, especially here, where you have single people, who fortunately were able to start a life again and have a family.</span> <span id="s1820">And I couldn’t have children any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Did you have – after you were released, after you were again free – I’m jumping ahead, but I’ll come back to the other topics, did you have any kind of medical help after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Oh yes, I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium, and when we came to America in ’49, I were twice in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: And were the doctors then able to find out what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: They only knew what was happened, and they only find out when we came to America in ’49, why I could not conceive.</span> <span id="s1825">So you – so you see, it – it’s not like a redeeming way of life.</span> <span id="s1826">Like people were fortunate to start the life again, married and having families.</span> <span id="s1827">That’s why I don’t think it was proper for me to talk here.</span> <span id="s1828">Cause I don’t know if people could put the two and two together.</span> <span id="s1829">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1830">I can’t.</span> <span id="s1831">So how could somebody else just make peace with oneself?</span> <span id="s1832">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1833">You just can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: And yet, you had a child, you were reu – reu – reunited with, and you raised her and she raised a child, or more than one.</span> <span id="s1835">And as Steve said, now it’s down to the fourth generation, and – and despite that, despite – despite it, you were able to raise her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: To make a human being out of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1839">You’re absolutely right.</span> <span id="s1840">You’re absolutely – not only because she’s a human being, but she’s a wonderful human being.</span> <span id="s1841">And another thing which has been found out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors either went into education, or went into medicine.</span> <span id="s1842">And I tell you why I’m mentioning that to you.</span> <span id="s1843">I think it’s very important, because now here in America, you hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another.</span> <span id="s1844">Either students, or just in the street the gangs.</span> <span id="s1845">So when they arrest a young person, 14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel because they didn’t have a very good upbringing, that’s what made them violent.</span> <span id="s1846">What about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a couple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never been able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents didn’t come back, or any family come back to claim them.</span> <span id="s1847">But all those children who have been in hiding, they definitely didn’t have a good upbringing.</span> <span id="s1848">And then in spite of that they all in education, or in medicine.</span> <span id="s1849">Like my daughter, who is in education, and my granddaughter is a medical si – psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: An amazing achievement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: But most children of survivors, even born after the war, went into education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Fanny, it’s hard to ask, you know, that sort of simple question of what happened then, what happened then?</span> <span id="s1853">I mean, you – here we are, you’re in this room, you’re being tortured, you’re being dehumanized through this medical experimentation, and you feel like it’s your last moment, but it’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Did you – did at some point they finish and then send you back to the barracks?</span> <span id="s1856">Did they let you heal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Oh yes, and then there was another session.</span> <span id="s1858">There never was one session.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: It was more than one session?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: More than one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1863">And the only thing they had in thy – that room is like shelves with jars of different parts, and you see that if you even watch Oprah and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Were those jars there when you were ha – when they were performing experiments on you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Yes, uh-huh, because there was already things from people before me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Do you have any recollection of the doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: I think if I would see him today I would recognize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Did they talk to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Did they shout at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: No.</span> <span id="s1872">They shout at us not to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: They shouted at you not to move.</span> <span id="s1874">Were there people holding you down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: They didn’t have to, because we were tied down.</span> <span id="s1876">You couldn’t move, even if you would – wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: When you went back – when – di – were you brought back to the barracks, or did you have to walk back?</span> <span id="s1878">Could you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: We had to walk back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: And did the other – other inmates in those barracks have an idea of what had been going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Some did, some did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Do you have any idea of how long this went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: I don’t know, because we had no concept of time.</span> <span id="s1884">It seems like endless, like I think I tried to explain to you, til it’s going to be the end.</span> <span id="s1885">That’s why you hold onto it, because you want to see your own end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Was there a time when they eventually stopped, or was this – once you were chosen, until liberation came, you were part of this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: That was quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Was it the same people all the time who were doing this, or different people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Well, the nurses were different, and I think the doctors were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Was this your lowest moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1892">I think so.</span> <span id="s1893">One redeeming thing we did have, is in 1944, which was very bad in Auschwitz, more beatings for no reason.</span> <span id="s1894">We think it was for no reason, and we were still working in the factories and we had to lined up, which was the common thing to do.</span> <span id="s1895">And we had Eichmann and Hess warning us that if we not making more than our quota, we gonna go to the gas chambers, which were right there.</span> <span id="s1896">And we were already working more than any human resistance could do, because of the fume and everything.</span> <span id="s1897">You see, our eyes have changed already because of this – the odor, and the fumes, which was really bad, because we had to wash them in some kind of a product.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Fanny, were you given any time to recover, or after you were brought to the barracks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: There’s not such thing as recovery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: So you had to go to work after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Mm-hm, like nothing has happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: God.</span> <span id="s1903">I usually don’t run out of – I don’t run out of words, but I’ve run out of words, because it just – there are no words.</span> <span id="s1904">There are no words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: I couldn’t find words, and I want to say a lot more, and I don’t have the words.</span> <span id="s1906">That’s why I think I told you before I started, I thought I know English, but apparently I don’t.</span> <span id="s1907">There’s so many things which are just impossible to find words.</span> <span id="s1908">There isn’t any words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: There isn’t any words for such a cruelty or unhuman cruelty.</span> <span id="s1911">There isn’t any words.</span> <span id="s1912">That’s why I didn’t go into the writing class.</span> <span id="s1913">Because there is no words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: What goes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: And anyway, Auschwitz is not describable.</span> <span id="s1916">There was one famous person that he tried to describe Auschwitz, and he said, there’s not enough paper, and not enough ink in the world.</span> <span id="s1917">But I don’t know if I told you before, Primo Levi was a scientist.</span> <span id="s1918">After the war when he was liberated, he went back to Italy where he was from.</span> <span id="s1919">He got his position back, which was very high position.</span> <span id="s1920">He got married, he had a son, and he committed suicide, because he could not accept the outside world.</span> <span id="s1921">According to many statistic, there’s about 42 people who have survived Auschwitz and killed themself.</span> <span id="s1922">I mean prominent people.</span> <span id="s1923">When I say prominent, is people who got positions back after the war.</span> <span id="s1924">They were recognized as people and they could not accept the outside world, after having seen what has been done to people.</span> <span id="s1925">And I don’t think that any of us, if it wouldn’t be for the seminar, happened here in the Holocaust museum, I did not know that the Germans did medical experimentation on babies.</span> <span id="s1926">But they knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Fanny, did – did that thought ever cross your mind, tha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Oh, many times, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s1931">Because I could not accept cruelty for no reason to ba – to be done to another human being.</span> <span id="s1932">Not what I have seen in my – in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1933">Not what my eyes have seen.</span> <span id="s1934">I’m even surprised that I’m as normal as I am today.</span> <span id="s1935">Or just functioning to a certain extent, which is not really functioning, because the pain and agony doesn’t go out, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: When you were returned to Josy and returned to your husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: – did you feel alone with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Yeah, because I – I – you could not have the talk, like I have with you today.</span> <span id="s1940">And – and don’t forget, this is many years ago.</span> <span id="s1941">I could not express what I’m expressing today.</span> <span id="s1942">That’s why I said to you, took me 50 years after Auschwitz to be able to – and I think I’m very lucky, thanks to Steven, who knew, little by little – don’t forget, has been nine years that we were sitting weekly together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Did you, at some point, tell Josy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1945">Never.</span> <span id="s1946">I really wonder today – my daughter went to the different classes in order to be able to give the guided tours.</span> <span id="s1947">And she shows everything, of emotion.</span> <span id="s1948">And I always wonder, does she tell anybody, this is what my mother went through?</span> <span id="s1949">And they don’t show you the experimentation, they only show you the beatings and the works, you know, done in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1950">And I was wondering, and I never had enough guts to ask her if she tells the people, this is what my mother lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Do – would you feel that if she did that, she would be in some ways –</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: When she gives the talks, she doesn’t want me to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Does she tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: She said she would be crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: When you – when you, after the war, had Josy back, did you feel like you were distant from her, or were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1959">I think I told you when you heard me talking, when I came back, I didn’t have a place, and I stayed with my sister because she got her place back.</span> <span id="s1960">And we had two beds to sleep, but Josiane very often came to the bed where I slept, and she used to tie her nightgown with mine, to make sure I wouldn’t go away.</span> <span id="s1961">Don’t forget, she was only a little over five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: She was a baby still, yeah.</span> <span id="s1963">That’s not really what I’m – what I’m asking about is not what – is not what she got.</span> <span id="s1964">Because clearly, if she had not felt secure in you, she would have grown up differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1967">But I’m asking more of what did you feel?</span> <span id="s1968">If you’ve gone through such experiences, and you come back and you are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Well, I wanted to hold her all the time.</span> <span id="s1970">That’s all I wanted to do, just go to bed and hold her all the time, so she wouldn’t go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: With a double nightgown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: She’d do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1974">When did your life change in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1975">A: From the minute we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: I meant aft – we’re going through the experiments, but at some point the war does start to turn against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: We have not witnessed that, because we were on the dead march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Can you tell me about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: And the reason being called the dead march, because it was heavy snow and diseases were terrible.</span> <span id="s1980">Hunger was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Before we get there Josy – I mean, excuse me, Fanny, what I want to ask about is, do you remember if the work in the ammunitions factory ever became less and less, and was there a time – when did you go on the death mar – what changed within the camp that all of a sudden –</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: It didn’t change, we all went out.</span> <span id="s1983">Auschwitz was evacuated the 17th of January, and the 27 of January, the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1984">That’s why they evacuated the whole camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: My a – my question is this, if you were evacuated on January 17th, was it on January 16th you were still working in the ammunitions factory –</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: – as if it were a normal day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Normal day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: So you have no idea –</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Til we came back from our work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: And then we all had to lined up and march.</span> <span id="s1997">We –</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Out of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1999">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: And we marched – well, our group, we marched from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück, and there’s a friend of mine in the museum who made me a map.</span> <span id="s2001">If I see [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: That’s a long way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: That’s a long way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Of course it is.</span> <span id="s2006">And you can’t imagine that you were able, after Auschwitz to ca – I d – I don’t know what was, and that’s why so – that’s why it’s called the dead march, because either people died of disease, people couldn’t walk any more, or they were shot.</span> <span id="s2007">Because in the snow, as you were walking you saw drops of blood, people who had been shot because they couldn’t – one was holding up another, til the other couldn’t be held up any more, and dropped.</span> <span id="s2008">So that’s how you knew how many have died.</span> <span id="s2009">And many have been liberated way before our group was liberated.</span> <span id="s2010">And we were really – really found out accidentally, because this was already the last battle by the river Elba.</span> <span id="s2011">And I didn’t know the distance of anything, think I told you, somebody was nice enough who works at the museum, has made me a map.</span> <span id="s2012">I want to know what happened to me through the different times.</span> <span id="s2013">And he made me the map, the map – many people have been liberated by the British, mostly by the Americans.</span> <span id="s2014">I had the cousin who survived, was liberated by the Americans, and died two days later, because the food she was given, she couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s2015">But we were – we just gave up, the six of us.</span> <span id="s2016">And you know when you see sometime those black bags where you put garbage in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: That’s how the – the six of us looked.</span> <span id="s2019">You would never even look if somebody is dead.</span> <span id="s2020">The reason we were discovered by the Russians –</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: In Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: No, we were already by the Elba, which is in the other end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: This was two months later.</span> <span id="s2025">The reason why we were discovered, it was the last battle near the Elba, between the Russians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s2026">And of course, the Russians won at that time.</span> <span id="s2027">They were looking for Germans or Nazis who were hiding, and many did, because we have witnessed the Russians killing them.</span> <span id="s2028">Because looking for Germans, they found us.</span> <span id="s2029">And they took us in a makeshift hospital and they cleaned us up, because we all had the typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: You were six women, or two – or how many were left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: The six of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: The same six who were in the barracks?</span> <span id="s2033">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2034">We had frozen toes, we had no fingernails, and you see our eyes, it was only a li – a white, because of the fume of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: From the – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: And we all had the typhus.</span> <span id="s2037">Not clean at all, we really were in a very bad shape.</span> <span id="s2038">And they were very kind.</span> <span id="s2039">They gave us – first they clean us up.</span> <span id="s2040">They give us what they had, it was only milk.</span> <span id="s2041">And because they didn’t have food, that saved our lives, because people who have survived, either with the Americans or the British, got the rich, canned food.</span> <span id="s2042">Like I said, I had the cousin who survived and got those canned foods.</span> <span id="s2043">And she survived with her brother, and she couldn’t take the food, and she just died.</span> <span id="s2044">And we were lucky because that’s the only thing they had, they probably s-stole some cows and that’s how they have milk to help us.</span> <span id="s2045">And we stayed there for about 10 days.</span> <span id="s2046">The Red Cross found us.</span> <span id="s2047">We got recommendations from the Russian doctor to tell us what we should do when we go back to make sure we go to the doctor, which we did.</span> <span id="s2048">And on the way back from the people from the Red Cross, I went with a friend of mine from the six who didn’t have anybody to go.</span> <span id="s2049">The four others had family and friends which they went, but they didn’t – although they were my age, maybe a couple years older, they didn’t live long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: So, we don’t know the reactions.</span> <span id="s2052">And then once I came back to Belgium, I really had a lot of medical problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about what they were?</span> <span id="s2054">A: Well, I – don’t forget, we didn’t have our period the day we – toom – two months after being in Auschwitz, and I think with experimentation, we don’t know what was put in the body, we don’t know what was taken out from the body.</span> <span id="s2055">We know blood was taken out because that was supposed to be sent to the soldiers in Russia who were on the front.</span> <span id="s2056">[technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2058">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: I’m just try – I’m still trying to save her of many of the pains I went through, that’s why I don’t appreciate for her being when I talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: Were we rolling?</span> <span id="s2061">Okay.</span> <span id="s2062">Another thing I wanted to go back to, like I had said, Primo Levi found his solution cause he couldn’t connect to that other world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: He committed – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: He could not accept the other world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: World.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: He could not – and he wrote many books – he could not exp – tolerate with himself that somebody else is able to do an organizing Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2068">He couldn’t accept that, that another human being could do that.</span> <span id="s2069">And that’s why he commit – he committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: And was – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: And not only because he committed suicide, but don’t forget, he was one of the very few who has been accepted in society of – for what he was before.</span> <span id="s2072">It’s not like all of a sudden he was somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: He was accepted in society, he was accepted in his job.</span> <span id="s2075">He got married, never been married before.</span> <span id="s2076">Got a son.</span> <span id="s2077">And just could not accept the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s2078">He was on the step and he like, hanged himself.</span> <span id="s2079">And there’s 42 other people, with names and everything, they – they just could not accept the humiliation they lived through and the effect this had on their lives, and society outside.</span> <span id="s2080">Look how many people would not be able to sit down and have a conversation for me to tell their life.</span> <span id="s2081">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s2083">It’s very hard, it’s very hard for anybody to talk about a time when they’re humiliated, to talk about what is that humiliation, to describe it to anybody, for different reasons.</span> <span id="s2084">To a stranger because they’re a stranger.</span> <span id="s2085">To a loved one because, as you said before, you want to protect them.</span> <span id="s2086">To yourself.</span> <span id="s2087">It is very hard to do that and it takes – it takes a great deal of courage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2089">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2090">And it took me a long time, as you know.</span> <span id="s2091">And even my daughter told me yesterday, Mother, if you in such agony, why do you accept doing that?</span> <span id="s2092">And she knows, or I hope she does, the toll it takes from me.</span> <span id="s2093">It’s not like you clean yourself, it’s not, you never are clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: But you never were dirty.</span> <span id="s2095">You never were.</span> <span id="s2096">It was not you who was dirty.</span> <span id="s2097">It was those who did those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: But I have yet to hear anybody saying that they sorry what has happened.</span> <span id="s2099">My son-in-law Freddie, spoke to a group of people here from different countries of Europe, who have graduated and they got like a trip from Germany, from France, those were all graduated students who got like a scholarship, and they were already in higher studies.</span> <span id="s2100">A very small group.</span> <span id="s2101">There was one young woman from Germany, the only one from Germany, came to Freddie and says, I beg you forgiveness, and crying.</span> <span id="s2102">And I think this is what he needed to hear, because he never found his parents again, and because he works with Steven, he found out how his parents were killed in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: So no one ever said to you, I’m so sorry for what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s2105">Si – I’m still waiting.</span> <span id="s2106">I don’t think –</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: How do you – how do you – how do you live a life –</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: – without being bitter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: It’s not bitter, it’s painful.</span> <span id="s2111">It’s very painful.</span> <span id="s2112">I think – like I have been asked once for students if I hate those people.</span> <span id="s2113">And the on – only answer I could give, because if I would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself.</span> <span id="s2114">That’s what I answer the Catholic youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2116">Well, it is a religious answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Because if I would be a hateful person – the only person who said he would never forgive them and hates them was Wiesenthal when he wrote his book.</span> <span id="s2118">He said he would never forgive them.</span> <span id="s2119">Now, I’m not a hateful person, and like I said to the youngsters, if I would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself, because I could not live with hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: But it is pain.</span> <span id="s2121">But you live with pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Tremendous, constantly.</span> <span id="s2123">It’s not like one minute on one person and another minute on another person, which I cannot, like, get it out of the system, you say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2125">Well, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: I can’t, I wish I could.</span> <span id="s2127">I wish I could, because my days wouldn’t be as painful.</span> <span id="s2128">And it’s hard to convey that to another person who has not a patient of wanting to understand a survivor, because I – I don’t think there’s too many people who understand, really, a survivor.</span> <span id="s2129">I remember quite a number years ago, they had five psychiatrists sitting on the stage here in the Rubinstein room, all psychiatrists, medical psychiatrists and of course they were talking, the majority, survivors.</span> <span id="s2130">They knew how we feel.</span> <span id="s2131">They knew without interviewing anybody like you and I are talking now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Tha – they never did that.</span> <span id="s2134">So how could they know?</span> <span id="s2135">Nobody has asked me, or somebody else just personally, how you feel about it?</span> <span id="s2136">What makes you tick today?</span> <span id="s2137">They have never had that ability.</span> <span id="s2138">And I think this is a big pain we live with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: That’s very lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: It is.</span> <span id="s2141">It really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: I’m so sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: Well, thanks to listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: [indecipherable] I’m glad I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: I’m glad, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: Stid is go – Steven is gonna be glad I did.</span> <span id="s2148">Well, he really – really made me what I am today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: I’m glad.</span> <span id="s2150">I’m glad that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: It’s a wonderful relationship, it really is, because it’s so unexpected and it’s so wonderful that we have been able to get – cause don’t forget, not because our background is different.</span> <span id="s2152">I think I have learned to get along with many people, I hope so, because if – if I haven’t learned it now, I never will.</span> <span id="s2153">And I appreciate relationships, I appreciate people.</span> <span id="s2154">And I think that’s really what makes me tick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: It sounds like it.</span> <span id="s2156">You know, I – I’m just – I’m sad to hear that you think of yourself as less than, because of what you went through, rather than more than.</span> <span id="s2157">Because not everybody would be able to not hate.</span> <span id="s2158">Not everybody would be able to still feel, still –</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: You mean, have emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: I really, really do.</span> <span id="s2164">And another thing I think which is in my favor, is appreciate people and needing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2166">Yes, and to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So many people don’t say it.</span> <span id="s2169">They don’t say that they appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: – even though they may feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: I definitely do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: And I express it, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: As you know me inside out by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Well, do you think, Fanny, I mean we – we – when we talk about – when we talk about your story, which is connected to, but something else beside what we’ve been talking about right now, are there parts that we should still cover?</span> <span id="s2178">We’ve – you know, we’re – you were in – you were on the death march, you’re liberated, you’re brought back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s2179">How did you meet Jack again?</span> <span id="s2180">How did – how did that happen?</span> <span id="s2181">What happened to your younger sister?</span> <span id="s2182">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: My younger sister was in a convent during the war, and she wore the o – th-the habit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2185">So all three sisters survived?</span> <span id="s2186">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2187">But you know what’s interesting, my older sister – I was the middle one, and my younger sister – my younger sister was at least eight years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s2188">Six or seven at least.</span> <span id="s2189">Both of them died of cancer.</span> <span id="s2190">My older sister died of cancer, my young sister Rose died of cancer.</span> <span id="s2191">Both of them have never been in a camp.</span> <span id="s2192">They were sheltered.</span> <span id="s2193">Both were in that shelter all the time.</span> <span id="s2194">My younger sister was in that convent with that habit and it – did what all the good nuns do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: I’m the only one.</span> <span id="s2197">I look different.</span> <span id="s2198">A different personality completely, always was.</span> <span id="s2199">The two of them were very pretty and tall.</span> <span id="s2200">My older sister was tall and slim and dark hair.</span> <span id="s2201">And I must be like the misfit in the whole business.</span> <span id="s2202">And my younger sister was nice and tall and extremely educated and extremely smart.</span> <span id="s2203">And she died of cancer, the same cancer my older sister had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: I’m the short one, the fat one, the ugly one –</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: I wouldn’t say those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: – and I’m the only one alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Well, first of all, I would not say those other things, but yes you are the only one alive.</span> <span id="s2209">And how long has it been since you lost the two of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Oh, my younger sister died, I think must be about 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s2211">Oh, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Do you feel alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Very much, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: And is that a legacy from the war, or is that from some other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2216">I think it must be a combination.</span> <span id="s2217">My husband is dead for 22 ow – two years.</span> <span id="s2218">I have had many proposals, but I guess I wanted something else from companionship, and probably the other person, like me, wanted me for what I have.</span> <span id="s2219">But it’s not what I was hoping to get, and I didn’t – I just wouldn’t settle for second best.</span> <span id="s2220">But you know, it all depends what you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Yeah, it does, it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Or what you’re willing to sacrifice or to offer.</span> <span id="s2223">I was not ready to be a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s2226">I just – and the two of them were very educated, very intelligent, but it – it just was not – like I told you, I was not ready to be a wife.</span> <span id="s2227">So now you know me from inside out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Well, I’ve gotten – I’ve had the honor to get to know a little bit about you, and I appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: I think you know a lot, because I have never uncovered myself to the extent I did with you.</span> <span id="s2230">And I think you have a wonderful quality of bringing that out from people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Thank you Fanny, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Because I was much more uncomfortable when I came then when I’m now, maybe because I trust you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: – and that’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: So you’re doing a very special, good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: Well, thank you for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Because if people can trust you, that’s the main way that you could bring out of us what you really want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Well, this is – it is – you see, the purpose is not to – the purpose is not to expose somebody in a way that is invading their privacy.</span> <span id="s2240">The purpose is to share what was the reality, and what it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: The emotions in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: What does it do to the human spirit, what does it do to the human being?</span> <span id="s2243">And you’ve shared that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Look what you’re learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: I mean it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: A lot.</span> <span id="s2248">An awful lot.</span> <span id="s2249">And – and it’s – it is – because there’s such a cost, and I appreciate that you, knowing that cost, have nevertheless agreed to do this.</span> <span id="s2250">It is a gift you’re giving and it is a gift you’re giving not just to me right now in this room, but a gift you’re going to be giving to all the people who will be watching this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Well, especially here in the museum, I’m the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: They don’t have another survivor who had been married.</span> <span id="s2254">They don’t have another survivor who has a child.</span> <span id="s2255">And I’m so proud that my daughter and son-in-law have joined it.</span> <span id="s2256">Steve would tell you.</span> <span id="s2257">And I’ll tell you why, because when I started to come here and feel comfortable in our little corner – I have nothing to do with the rest of people in the museum, forgive me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: I’m very close to Michelin(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: I could see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: She’s about my daughter’s age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: But it’s wonderful, our relationship.</span> <span id="s2264">You have no idea how much I appreciate that.</span> <span id="s2265">She could call me any time, and there’s always something that we have to offer one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: As far as we – oh, priceless, you could say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2270">And I was with Steven, how could we have any relationship?</span> <span id="s2271">I had – are we still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Yeah, we’re still on.</span> <span id="s2273">If you want to turn off, we can turn off.</span> <span id="s2274">We’re still rolling, though, we’re still rolling.</span> <span id="s2275">Because you know, when we’re doing that, because some of what you say relates to what you were telling me about.</span> <span id="s2276">And if you want it turned off we can do so, because I think we’re over the most – you know, the formal part of our relationship, but we’re also talking about how it comes th –</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Life.</span> <span id="s2279">How it is that you build trust again.</span> <span id="s2280">This is one of the things you know s – I’m happy I’m in my seat rather than in yours, because I don’t know if I could answer the questions.</span> <span id="s2281">I don’t know if I could articulate.</span> <span id="s2282">But I think that one of the challenges, if I can even start to imagine myself in having gone through what you’ve gone through, in this kind of betrayal of human spirits, the betrayal of human beings by other human beings, is how do you learn to trust others again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: That’s very difficult, that’s why I don’t trust just everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: In spite of me needing people, as you could tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: And wanting to be with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Yeah, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s2289">You know, it’s not a distrustful nature, it’s experience, it’s what life showed you.</span> <span id="s2290">It’s what you’ve gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: But then again, look how many wonderful, wonderful – you know, when you just think in your mind –</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: – complete, complete strangers have nothing to benefit by it, except risking their lives.</span> <span id="s2294">And they were not all religious people.</span> <span id="s2295">The majority started from churches and convents, because we needed that – I mean, they needed that outlet.</span> <span id="s2296">But can you imagine in society today that people would want to risk their life to save somebody else’s child, at such a high cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: Not only for themselves, but the whole convent for that matter, which they were responsible.</span> <span id="s2299">And there’s so many horror books about young people, what they went through in hiding in convents.</span> <span id="s2300">But then again you hear wonderful stories.</span> <span id="s2301">But can you imagine today people taking a child and being responsible for the child, and risking their own life in order to save another human being, for no reason at all?</span> <span id="s2302">No money, no glory.</span> <span id="s2303">You must see that documentary they have here.</span> <span id="s2304">It just makes you – you know, you read something of the book and then when you finish –</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: There’s a wonderful book which is called the “Daughters of Absence.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: Did you ever hear that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: It’s written by Mandy Mandel(ph).</span> <span id="s2311">She’s a painter</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: She’s a daughter of survivors.</span> <span id="s2314">Her father died and he was in a concentration camp, and he has a number.</span> <span id="s2315">She’s quite the famous painter and author.</span> <span id="s2316">Seven women got together from different backgrounds, but all the seven have been worn – born after the war, and it’s called the “Daughters of – of Absence.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: And they had all those seven womens –</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: – on one evening right here at the museum when they wrote the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: And it’s a book which makes you feel good because all the seven have written about their mothers, who were survivors.</span> <span id="s2323">Their opinion of.</span> <span id="s2324">It’s called the daughters of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Absence, got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: And it’s written by Mindy Mandel(ph), and you feel so good when you finish reading that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: How those seven women live in different countries.</span> <span id="s2329">I happen to know two, one is my doctor’s wife.</span> <span id="s2330">Her name – I forgot her first name, Loeffler?</span> <span id="s2331">I don’t know if you ever heard that name.</span> <span id="s2332">But Mindy Mandel(ph) has made quite a reputation for herself as a painter, as a speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Well, you know, here’s another thought that comes to my mind as we’ve been speaking.</span> <span id="s2334">I remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Does anybody have a clean handkerchief?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Or a clean tissue?</span> <span id="s2338">[indecipherable] [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: And so epcet – exceptional about you.</span> <span id="s2340">And I will tell it by way of a little story.</span> <span id="s2341">Thirty years ago I remember, I was a member of Amnesty International, okay.</span> <span id="s2342">And Amnesty International was having campaigns against torture.</span> <span id="s2343">And there were some people that came to their attention.</span> <span id="s2344">And at that time there was the aftermath of the Cambodian genocide.</span> <span id="s2345">And there was a young man they featured in one of their stories, and what he said always struck me, because he was somebody who survived the Cambodian genocide.</span> <span id="s2346">He saw his parents murdered, he saw his – his siblings murdered, and he survived.</span> <span id="s2347">And he said, I survived not only because I ca – I am living and breathing, I survived because I can love again, after having gone through that.</span> <span id="s2348">And that is an achievement, because so many people couldn’t, after they have been exposed to this kind of brutality, this kind of hatred, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2349">And everything I hear from you about your children, about Josy, about your grandchildren, about the people that you ever – it has that spirit of love to it.</span> <span id="s2350">And that’s why I can’t – I can’t imagine that you would be anything other than more than, rather than what you said earlier about feeling inferior.</span> <span id="s2351">If you can love again, that’s a lesson for all of us, you know, because whatever challenges you go throu – and everybody has challenges, just some of us are not in those kinds of challenges.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s2353">The daily life you have challenges, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: We are always challenged on do I trust again –</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: – do I love again?</span> <span id="s2357">Do I put myself out there again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: Do I make myself vulnerable to other people again?</span> <span id="s2360">And it takes extraordinary courage to do it in the face of past experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: And – I mean, I don’t have any other words, those are just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: – what goes through my mind as we’re talking.</span> <span id="s2365">And I am glad that you’re here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: Thanks for having me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2370">You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: Was quite an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Yes, it has been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Thank you.</span></p>
