two days, you both spoke about your experiences during the Holocaust, and you both referred to each other quite a bit, because you spent much of that time together.</span> <span id="s37">So I want to go back to when you first began spending time together.</span> <span id="s38">I -- I suppose it was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Y-You were sort of pushed together by your families.</span> <span id="s41">If you could just say a little bit about -- about how you understood that.</span> <span id="s42">D-Did your parents say you must always be together, or was it because you were both girls, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">S: No, it was my -- my f -- my parents didn’t say anything to me.</span> <span id="s44">They -- as Rachel told you, my father was -- told the family that if my brother loves Rachel, so I’ll love her too.</span> <span id="s45">And she has to be in our family.</span> <span id="s46">So that’s it, no more conversations, we’re done.</span> <span id="s47">It was like a point of [indecipherable] yeah, that’s it.</span> <span id="s48">And then we were pushed together to sleep together.</span> <span id="s49">So sh -- I found her like a -- like a -- know, she protects me.</span> <span id="s50">Like I was a child and she was already a young lady, like she was 20, I was 15.</span> <span id="s51">It was a difference then.</span> <span id="s52">And she was protecting me in many cases.</span> <span id="s53">So I liked it.</span> <span id="s54">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Rachel, the -- mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">S: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">R: And lately we were protecting each other, I would think.</span> <span id="s58">And we were happy that we were together, because first of all it was easier to go through, and secondly we were very attached to each other, and very li -- loved each other.</span> <span id="s59">She was small, I was caring, afraid for her life, only not to be separated from me.</span> <span id="s60">And as you see, we went through the whole war together.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Things were so confusing in those times that you ended up living with your boyfriend’s family.</span> <span id="s62">I mean, that wouldn’t have happened if there hadn’t been a war.</span> <span id="s63">What was that like for you to be all of a sudden thrust into his family, you weren't married yet --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">R: In the beginning was very scary, because I still, in spite of my age, I was childish.</span> <span id="s65">And then we were very busy, afraid what would happen, what would be happening tomorrow, what happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s66">And I remember sitting in the window watching how he’s coming from where, being afraid because I knew that he has some weapons under his coat.</span> <span id="s67">Was he caught or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">S: What are -- what are you talking about, the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">S: Or the -- after?</span> <span id="s71">And you asked her about the get --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: I asked about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">S: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">R: And you know, she was studying ghetto, as -- she’s told you that she belongs to a club.</span> <span id="s76">I also belong to the club, but I was busy working outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s77">And it was a pleasure to meet in the evening again and talking about [indecipherable] or talking about the situation in ghetto and what will happen and what should we do, should we fight in the ghetto, should we go out?</span> <span id="s78">And Luta, today is she there, and there will be an action, and she runs away to the city, to Veronica.</span> <span id="s79">And the parents was scary over our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">S: Was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">R: And how to go through day after day with food, and with -- we were busy with all kinds of thoughts.</span> <span id="s82">And that was really very hard to be in love and be surrounded by fa -- with a lot of people, and you don’t have your privacy --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">S: Private time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">R: Yeah, but still, I think I was happy in that time that I have him, and have the family, and came into the [indecipherable] I saw that it’s a noble pri -- family.</span> <span id="s85">And you know, every day was scary, what’s the next day will bring you.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you and Josef plan to get married?</span> <span id="s87">Did you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">R: Of course we did.</span> <span id="s89">We were waiting until the war will be ended and we were thinking how it would work out, how it will be, how it -- how nice it will be.</span> <span id="s90">And even the people who lived with us in the same room, like engineer Konitsky and his daughter, she said, oy Rachel, I want to live long enough to see you when you’ll be fa -- boss of your -- when you’ll be free.</span> <span id="s91">Yeah, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">S: My family was good to her.</span> <span id="s93">My mother told me, she is my daughter, not you.</span> <span id="s94">Cause I never listened to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">R: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s96">S: But it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">R: Her mother la -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s98">S: My family loved her, she -- she was really very devoted to our family, very lovely, very good.</span> <span id="s99">And I think she felt that we love her too.</span> <span id="s100">The parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">R: And her father was a teacher of my older sister Luba.</span> <span id="s102">In school, in gymnasium, and in technical.</span> <span id="s103">Do you know that Luba was the last [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s104">S: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s105">Yeah.</span> <span id="s106">She was one girl, you know, among -- among the boys in technical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Your family really adopted Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">S: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">And I think -- I think she felt like -- like a daughter in our family, not like a adopted child, but a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: So, were you conscious of -- of -- of your parents -- well, I guess your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: -- gave you this order, really, don’t run away from Rachel.</span> <span id="s113">And was that something that you kept in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">S: Yeah, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s115">Yes, ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">R: We were very much devoted, through all the years, and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">S: My father was for me like I -- I don’t know, in some [indecipherable] feel like such a devotion, such a -- he was -- I know that people were talking about him very highly, that he was a very honest and very noble person, and I felt also like that.</span> <span id="s118">Then, after years, I thought -- I felt a little bit different.</span> <span id="s119">I -- I am accusing him -- I cannot say accusing him, it’s too strong, but I think that he destroyed the family.</span> <span id="s120">He didn’t allow my mother to emigrate, and he didn’t allow my mother to -- to run from the Germans the first day.</span> <span id="s121">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">R: No, don’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">S: Yeah, it’s true.</span> <span id="s124">You have to look -- the truth has eyes.</span> <span id="s125">That’s it.</span> <span id="s126">It’s too much responsibility, he took over a big responsibility to say no, I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s127">Well, what do you mean you don’t want it?</span> <span id="s128">You are responsible for your wife and children.</span> <span id="s129">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">R: In the ghetto she used to teach me physics and chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">S: He teach you.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">R: He.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">S: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">R: And I remember him telling, Rachel, whatever you do, whatever profession you choose, remember one thing, the physics and chemistry you have to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">S: Mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">R: -- mathematics and chemistry you have to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">S: And phi -- and physics, yeah.</span> <span id="s138">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">R: I said, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">S: Is a matter of all knowledge is mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">R: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">S: He believed it, and I believe it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: I want to take you forward to the time in the cemetery where it’s the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s144">At this point your father and your brother have already been taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">R: And my father and my brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Also.</span> <span id="s148">Okay.</span> <span id="s149">And you briefly find your mothers, but then you’re separated again.</span> <span id="s150">A-At that moment, when you go to the right, are you physically next to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">S: To each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Are you standing next to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">S: Of course.</span> <span id="s155">When we went through the gate -- I don’t remember, you went the first?</span> <span id="s156">Because I remember my mom, my mom was behind me.</span> <span id="s157">So probably you were the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">R: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">S: -- like I said, I was the second [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: I mean, did you -- it seems like such a chaotic scene, did you -- did you hold onto each other, or you were just able to stay physically close, so that you would get in the same wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">S: Yeah, we were -- of course we were watching not to be separated, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">R: We were scared.</span> <span id="s163">We were not -- we didn’t know where we are going, what will happen.</span> <span id="s164">We saw the tragedy of a lot of people, that children were left over, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">S: I didn’t touch this point.</span> <span id="s166">I didn’t touch because a loss o -- a lot of young mothers left their chil -- small children behind, not to go to the left with them.</span> <span id="s167">Okay, I didn't touch it, it’s too -- it’s difficult to take.</span> <span id="s168">One thing is if a grown-up, it’s not a grown-up, but it’s not a small child that is leaving the parents, another thing is when the parents are leaving, the mother is leaving th -- her children.</span> <span id="s169">Cause that’s life.</span> <span id="s170">That what people did.</span> <span id="s171">Not all.</span> <span id="s172">Her sister [indecipherable] went together with her son.</span> <span id="s173">Her other sister went together with her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">R: They’re willing to live --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">S: It’s so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">R: It’s very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">S: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">R: Very, very strong.</span> <span id="s179">If your mind is still open.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you both always have that, or -- or were there times that when one was maybe losing the will to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">S: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">R: I never lose the will --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">S: Lost.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">R: I hope that my bro -- boyfriend will survive, as I did.</span> <span id="s188">And in the last moment when we were already free, we find out that he perished, and her other family perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">S: My mother will not survive, so I knew it.</span> <span id="s190">I knew at once.</span> <span id="s191">She told me in the ghetto, and you knew -- you knew probably that she had [indecipherable] I don’t know how it’s in --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">R: Yeah, but even when people had it, not everybody could kill them --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">S: No, no, I -- I think that she was a brave woman, because even with such difficult times, so -- a small amount of people committed suicide.</span> <span id="s194">There were some people in -- before the Germans came into Wilna, some families were already -- committed suicide.</span> <span id="s195">They didn’t want to go through it.</span> <span id="s196">Remember?</span> <span id="s197">And -- but after that -- no, everybody wanted to survive for [indecipherable] survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: How do you think having each other kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">R: All the time I thought about is that it’s -- we survive because we have each other.</span> <span id="s200">There were situations when, you know, you were not so strong any more, to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Certainly at the -- the end, when Luta was so sick, you just kept pushing.</span> <span id="s203">She -- she described you in the f-farmhouse after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: That you were very energetic, you were throwing clothes away, and washing and --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">S: Cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: -- I couldn’t help but think, where did you get that energy?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">S: The energy was from the happiness to be free, because she was not deadly sick, thank God.</span> <span id="s209">I was deadly sick.</span> <span id="s210">But I couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">R: This was a terrible time when all the people was already free --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">R: -- and trying to start and trying to establish your life, and she has to be in the hospital, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">S: Dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">R: -- sick --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">S: Absolute dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">R: -- for -- for years, in and out.</span> <span id="s218">It’s very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">S: But I survived.</span> <span id="s220">And I had time I was [indecipherable] to study and to give birth to three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">R: You know, in the -- in the age of 17, when you have tuberculosis, is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s222">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">R: Or you are dying when you’re surviving, you are a normal person.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">R: After awhile.</span> <span id="s226">It’s a very dangerous age for tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">S: For every deadly diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">R: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">S: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So was there ever anything that -- in any moment that Rachel said to you or did, that really became something that you held on to?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">S: I couldn’t understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Was there ever anything that she said to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">S: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: -- do this, don’t do this, always remember this.</span> <span id="s235">Was there anything that she said to you that you sort of kept?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">R: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s237">I want to tell you one thing, that when she was very sick, after the fourth time, her future husband came from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">S: Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">R: -- army, and he was very in love with her.</span> <span id="s240">And he did -- and he didn't stop to coming every day, and several times --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">S: To coming to caring.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">R: -- yeah, caring very much.</span> <span id="s243">And Vera was very much caring with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">S: Veronica.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">R: And Dina [indecipherable] was caring about her.</span> <span id="s246">She was surrounded with lovely people who were very much caring about her, and we -- she had to get well.</span> <span id="s247">As much as -- even the doctors of the hospital loved her and want her to be healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">S: But the -- then, it doesn’t mean I had to be healthy, you know, it doesn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">R: Yeah, but they were trying.</span> <span id="s250">It was such a Dr. Berlootz.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">S: [indecipherable] Dr. Berlootz, what can he do?</span> <span id="s252">What could he do?</span> <span id="s253">Give me [indecipherable]</span></p>

to work, she is like a glass, you have to keep her very carefully whole life.</span> <span id="s263">And you can fell ill because the illness is such that you can get it from her.</span> <span id="s264">So it [indecipherable] loved --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">R: I was sleeping with her in one bed for weeks.</span> <span id="s266">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s267">I never catch anything from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">S: I was holding the bad things for myself.</span> <span id="s269">I didn’t give it not to her and not to my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">R: Not to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">S: Not to the children, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Luta, you were very strong willed.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">S: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: That’s how you described yourself, or -- or it seems that you had a strong will, to me, when I hear some of the stories that you tell.</span> <span id="s276">What made you listen to Rachel?</span> <span id="s277">Because sometimes you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">S: I did all the time.</span> <span id="s279">Now I am not listening to her.</span> <span id="s280">I did.</span> <span id="s281">No, look, she was older as I am, and she was -- I know that she was very friendly to me, she -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">R: The war did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">S: The war did, yeah, and then what -- what -- what she told me was right.</span> <span id="s284">We didn’t discuss such things like political things or something very big and very clever, but day to day things, thought she knew better than I.</span> <span id="s285">What can I -- what can a 15 - 16 - 17 years old teenager know about life?</span> <span id="s286">She used to grab me --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">R: But you were -- you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s288">S: -- to her, and to cover my eyes not to see how -- how women were raped.</span> <span id="s289">She covered my eyes, she didn’t let me see a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: But who covered your eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">R: Nobody.</span> <span id="s292">No [indecipherable] cover your eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: A-And you have kept this connection --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: -- all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Can you just talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">S: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s300">R: No.</span> <span id="s301">It’s hard to explain how it come, but I -- but I felt a friend in her, in spite of the -- th-the -- that I was very devoted to the whole family, I felt a friend, and I like her, and I can’t tell you why.</span> <span id="s302">Even now I can’t know why I like her, but I like her.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">S: No, it’s a -- she’ll -- related like sisters, that is the proper --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">R: But you felt like sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">S: Like a -- like a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">R: And -- and I am -- I like very much her children, they were devoted.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">S: And they like her.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">R: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">S: Yeah, and they --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">R: And my children like her.</span> <span id="s311">Even my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s312">I told you my granddaughter said that we have to make a gathering --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">S: A family gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">R: -- from the family, and Luta with her children will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">S: Ha -- have to come.</span> <span id="s316">They have to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">R: [indecipherable] I said yes, the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">R: That’s it.</span> <span id="s320">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s321">S: I don’t know, I think it’s not so rare, it’s not so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s322">R: It’s not a thing that somebody can tell you, or it’s -- just comes from the heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">S: Yes, it’s very natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">R: Ha -- yeah, it’s hard to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Is there anything else either of you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">R: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: I did ju --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">R: I -- I want her to be healthy and good, and be -- I want her to be all her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">S: I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I did want to ask, because this has been a bit of a theme.</span> <span id="s331">Both of you mentioned that you hadn’t talked in a lot of detail to your children.</span> <span id="s332">A-And I think you Luta said that -- that you hadn't really shared the story with hardly anybody.</span> <span id="s333">What made you decide to -- to do it now?</span> <span id="s334">What were your thoughts about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">S: I think that Rachel told me about it, and she told me, can we come together?</span> <span id="s336">And I thought that -- that no, we are not young already and it comes a time when maybe we have to do it, like obligation, not like a -- a goodwill, but obligation.</span> <span id="s337">Maybe to leave it for my children, if not for the history, is for my children, because my son is pushing me all the time, but he is not pushing me all the time to -- to write about the Holocaust time, but about the family, what -- he doesn’t know the family of course, because they -- he didn’t know his grandparents and so I thought, maybe it’s time, and because she is going, so I’ll go with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">R: So we went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">S: Which will be like, easier for me.</span> <span id="s340">That’s it.</span> <span id="s341">So the time came and I’m here, and describe the -- a part of -- of this -- of -- it’s a part of the life we had, it’s not everything what -- you cannot describe every detail, because the days were full with dangerous details and it’s -- it’s -- it’s amazing that we survived, you know, it -- I don’t know how it was, like -- every step our -- every step, every day, was maybe the last step.</span> <span id="s342">Every time we went to appelle st -- to stay on the -- on the appelle, we had to think what is the last, if [indecipherable] last, they will choose us to the crematorium or not?</span> <span id="s343">So, it was like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">R: As I told you Kathy, that the life of every survivor is an accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">S: Yeah, it’s up to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s346">R: They can be taken to the oven --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">S: They could.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">R: -- as easily as another one.</span> <span id="s349">As I told you, the Yom Kippur action, how close we was --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">R: -- to death.</span> <span id="s352">And there were hundreds of situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">S: Hundreds, thousands, yeah.</span> <span id="s354">So, it’s accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">R: We could catch -- we could catch typhus --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">S: Typhus, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">R: -- very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">S: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">R: We were surrounded, around, around with people that were very --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">S: [indecipherable] one --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">R: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">S: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s363">R: So it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">S: It’s the fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">R: Here we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">S: Yeah, it’s a fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">R: [indecipherable] old age.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">S: If you believe in fate, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">R: And I want to tell you that I was thinking about to come, and we were -- I al -- an interview, and always I was pushing it away.</span> <span id="s370">And now --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">S: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s372">R: -- I have a feeling that it’s out of my shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">R: That I did it, and I left something for the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">S: I didn't think about it, but I did it --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">R: And that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">S: I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s378">I th --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">R: -- I was thinking that --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">S: -- I thought that I’ll not do it.</span> <span id="s381">I don’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s382">Why I have to do it?</span> <span id="s383">Why I have to go through that?</span> <span id="s384">And it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">R: But now we are --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">R: -- okay.</span> <span id="s388">We did it.</span> <span id="s389">Let people know.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">R: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">S: Only we didn’t pay them off.</span> <span id="s393">That what I wanted.</span> <span id="s394">I want to tell you that after the liberation, I was very sick, that why.</span> <span id="s395">But my dream was to belong t -- to a organization, to a terrorist organization.</span> <span id="s396">And to go from home to home to find out the people who did it for us, and to kill them on the spot.</span> <span id="s397">Not a trial, that they didn't trial us.</span> <span id="s398">So, that’s it.</span> <span id="s399">But I was sick, and my -- my husband quiet me down after that.</span> <span id="s400">Sometimes I’m thinking that what we should do because thousands of them are having a good life after that.</span> <span id="s401">And saying that it’s -- it wasn’t a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s402">Do you know how painful it is?</span> <span id="s403">If you survived all the things, horrible things, and lost your whole family, and all people are oh, and say Jews are imagining something like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">R: They’re making it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">S: -- they’re making it up, and th -- the -- because they wanted to take money from Germany.</span> <span id="s406">And Germany is such a poor country, they would give it for nothing, the money for -- to the Jews.</span> <span id="s407">Germany knows exactly what -- what it was, what they did to us.</span> <span id="s408">It’s a -- how many people were sentenced?</span> <span id="s409">Were sentenced for life, or sentenced to death?</span> <span id="s410">You can count it on the finger.</span> <span id="s411">And the pictures we have, you know, in the museum, how the Germans are holding the pistol, why they made the pictures of that?</span> <span id="s412">It means you like it?</span> <span id="s413">What kind of person are you if you like to kill others?</span> <span id="s414">Kill people what you don’t know, you have no idea whom you are killing, why you are killing?</span> <span id="s415">I understand that soldiers are fighting.</span> <span id="s416">They are fighting.</span> <span id="s417">Two countries are fighting and if you don’t kill them, they will kill you, yeah.</span> <span id="s418">It’s not good, very bad, but that’s it.</span> <span id="s419">But here, civilian women, children, old -- old -- old people.</span> <span id="s420">Men without -- without weapons, what -- who cannot do any harm to you?</span> <span id="s421">How could you sleep after that?</span> <span id="s422">It means you are not a human being and you have to be killed.</span> <span id="s423">I wouldn’t -- and here the murderers now, I wouldn’t take them to prison and then we are paying for them to -- to keep them in the prison.</span> <span id="s424">They are paying the taxes because they -- they have a good life in the prison.</span> <span id="s425">If you murdered somebody, you have to be murdered, you have to be killed.</span> <span id="s426">There is no other way.</span> <span id="s427">That’s my opinion, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">R: [indecipherable] are worse than the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">S: Yeah, so [indecipherable] of course.</span> <span id="s430">And that what it --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">R: What was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">S: -- makes me sick that I never did anything to pay off for my father or my mother, or for my brother.</span> <span id="s433">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">R: You will never be able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">S: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">R: Otherwise the whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">S: Now I am --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">R: -- world would be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">S: Now I am not -- not able to do it.</span> <span id="s440">I -- I don’t know if I would be able to do it before, but I wanted it.</span> <span id="s441">Now, somebody ask me not long ago, would you be able to kill?</span> <span id="s442">Wa -- what -- if you know?</span> <span id="s443">But no --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">S: -- I wouldn’t be able to kill.</span> <span id="s446">But I hate it.</span> <span id="s447">And that’s it, what I wanted to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">R: But now is another generation, another people --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">S: Yeah, no, not the young people, not -- oh not the innocent, not Germans is Germans, no.</span> <span id="s450">Only the people, if I knew exactly, that they were the murderers.</span> <span id="s451">That they m --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">R: But you will never be able to find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">S: No, now I-I don’t th-think about -- talk about now.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">R: And even before.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">S: Before we could, before we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">R: How long -- how long did it take to find Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">S: Oh, because nobody looked for him so much.</span> <span id="s458">He was only -- he was even a -- he didn't change the name even.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">R: Do you remember that it was a trial?</span> <span id="s460">We had to go to the trial --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">S: Actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">R: -- from Mora.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">S: -- we -- to Mora -- from Mora.</span> <span id="s464">Mora was the hangman of the Wilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s465">Of the ghetto in Wilna.</span> <span id="s466">But then, after the liquidation of the Wilna ghetto, he went to Poland, and he was a hangman of the Poles.</span> <span id="s467">So the Poles wanted him very much, but he was caught by the Russians, and he had the trial in Wilna.</span> <span id="s468">And then the -- it was not the death penalty in Wilna, in -- in Russia, so they -- they sentenced him for life, and he was in Siberia, yeah.</span> <span id="s469">Then Stalin died and Khrushchev came to power.</span> <span id="s470">I don’t know why he decided, probably ha -- asked for some prisoners of war, Soviet prisoners of war from Austria, he was from Austria.</span> <span id="s471">So he -- he was talking to them and they asked, give us our prisoners [indecipherable] yeah, and he gave it to Mora.</span> <span id="s472">And here -- they promised that they will sentence him also, that his -- it will be a trial in -- in -- in Vienna, or in his place where he was born.</span> <span id="s473">So you know, there are still witnesses alive.</span> <span id="s474">They came from Israel, and it was a trial.</span> <span id="s475">And he was sitting and his sons were sitting and laughing at the witnesses.</span> <span id="s476">One wa -- it was a horrible trial.</span> <span id="s477">It was a trial over the witnesses, not over him.</span> <span id="s478">And he was free.</span> <span id="s479">Then they decided he ne -- in a [indecipherable] that they will have -- find other witnesses that came to Wilna and we had to be the witnesses.</span> <span id="s480">Oh, but then he took a -- a document from the doctor that he is very sick, and the trial never -- he died.</span> <span id="s481">He was even the mayor in the city, he was -- he lived on -- in.</span> <span id="s482">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">S: Mora.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: His first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">S: I don’t know, fr -- Hans, or fr -- I don’t know, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">R: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s488">S: He was such a horrible man.</span> <span id="s489">If you -- he find you on his way, he will shit --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">R: Shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">S: -- he will shot you -- he will shoot you without regret.</span> <span id="s492">Anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">R: It was the horror of the ghetto if he would standing --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">S: And the Poles wanted him [indecipherable] and the Poles -- the Polish people had the death penalty.</span> <span id="s495">They would hung him, one, two, three.</span> <span id="s496">That what they did to every such a murderer they found.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">R: You know, and he growed up three sons, very educated, very strong, and this came an old Jew who even can’t talk right, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s499">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s500">R: -- and he is a witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">S: They were whispering, they were laughing, and it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">R: But that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">S: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">R: They destroyed the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">S: Yeah, the best they destroyed.</span> <span id="s506">The culture, the Jewish culture of east Europe didn’t -- didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s507">They destroyed.</span> <span id="s508">Of course some people, as we survived, and we produced other people, yeah.</span> <span id="s509">But the culture, gone.</span> <span id="s510">Everything is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">R: And the best people who can

id="s516">So, anyway, you will not change the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">R: You read not so long the book about Indians.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">S: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">R: You see what’s doing?</span> <span id="s521">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">S: What will go -- Yugoslavia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">R: So, what are you looking for?</span> <span id="s524">Yugoslavia --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">S: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s527">But you can’t compare to the Jewish tragedy, because there were tragedies a lot, very big and horrible tragedies.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">S: You don’t have to compare.</span> <span id="s529">Let it go.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s531">But this is a tragedy that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">S: Nothing have to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s533">R: -- nobody can, or could escape.</span> <span id="s534">Escape only --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">S: Was enough deaths in Yugoslavia also.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">R: -- only escape the people who were hiding and they didn’t find them.</span> <span id="s537">Who were not shot because the last time they have a rule not to shot, which people have to die from the sicknesses.</span> <span id="s538">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s539">No other way to survive.</span> <span id="s540">No richness, no education, nothing helped to survive a person.</span> <span id="s541">And it’s --</span></p> <p><span
