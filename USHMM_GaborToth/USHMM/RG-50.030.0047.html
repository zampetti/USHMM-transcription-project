there, the same, given in, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: So in the beginning, when we were in ghetto, we have to go.</span> <span id="s115">We were organized.</span> <span id="s116">Young people -- everybody has to go in the morning under the guard to do work.</span> <span id="s117">So I was working with my older brother.</span> <span id="s118">We have to -- they took us to a special place.</span> <span id="s119">We were loading coals in the wagons forward and back, under heavy guard, from morning until late evening.</span> <span id="s120">And nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s121">Only you have to work in there.</span> <span id="s122">If you have something with you -- a piece of bread, anything -- you could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">01:09:29 And we work very hard.</span> <span id="s124">Then -- this was like in 1941.</span> <span id="s125">Then in 1942, they start to take so- called Aktion-- take people from the ghetto and make smaller ghetto.</span> <span id="s126">So they surround, for example, one part of ghetto.</span> <span id="s127">And this part people couldn't live there.</span> <span id="s128">They have to go to the wagon, to the train, and they was taking them out.</span> <span id="s129">Nobody knows where they were sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">There's only --

people.</span> <span id="s139">They wanted to have a list of young people.</span> <span id="s140">So this was going to 1942.</span> <span id="s141">And then in the beginning of 1942, they said, "Two thousand."</span> <span id="s142">And they came.</span> <span id="s143">They have at least -- they came to our home, and they wanted to take me.</span> <span id="s144">But my younger brother, he was a little physical stronger, he said, "No, I will go."</span> <span id="s145">And they took him to the concentration labor-like camp in Lvov.</span> <span id="s146">And this was the young boy who they later hanged.</span> <span id="s147">And they took him there.</span> <span id="s148">He, he voluntary -- he was going because he wanted to save my life.</span> <span id="s149">And I was still working

know how I find in my pocket pliers.</span> <span id="s325">I have this small pliers.</span> <span id="s326">And I start to break the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s327">I was working a long time, and I cut my hands, was bleeding.</span> <span id="s328">And I broke the wires.</span> <span id="s329">When I was in bunker, I had a loaf of round bread.</span> <span id="s330">And I saved them.</span> <span id="s331">They was taking us, I took the bread.</span> <span id="s332">Here I had little belt.</span> <span id="s333">And when I broke the wire, I said, "Push me through the window.</span> <span id="s334">I will jump."</span> <span id="s335">And the people start to push me and my head forward.</span> <span id="s336">Was tight, but when I was looking down, I was on the running, you know, the wheels train.</span> <span id="s337">And then I saw the tracks and the small stones, like gravels.</span> <span id="s338">Everything.</span> <span id="s339">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s340">I will not go with my head, because I will -- right to the wheels."</span> <span id="s341">It was like instant.</span> <span id="s342">One second, I wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s343">Another second -- like instant -- I said, "Put me back!</span> <span id="s344">Put me back!"</span> <span id="s345">They, they pull me back, and I said, "I will go with my legs forward."</span> <span id="s346">And they pushed me with my legs, and I was hanging on the left hand.</span> <span id="s347">I was holding the window outside.</span> <span id="s348">I was hanging, and the train was in good speed.</span> <span id="s349">When the train was taking a curve, I jumped forward and I was sliding.</span> <span id="s350">And suddenly I felt severe pain in my chest, and I was unconscious maybe a few minutes.</span> <span id="s351">I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s352">Then when I came to my normal condition, I saw in my breast there was a hole like a fist.</span> <span id="s353">And this hurt my chest, because I stopped on a small post with wires.</span> <span id="s354">There were some wires.</span> <span id="s355">And I came out, and the train was far away, and I was running up the train.</span> <span id="s356">The train -- there was snow, and I was looking where would I find my brother.</span> <span id="s357">No, but I find two other boys who jumped.</span> <span id="s358">One has broken here bone, clavicula (ph) bone, broken.</span> <span id="s359">One was moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">01:23:13 Another, his face scratched, but nothing special.</span> <span id="s361">So I helped.</span> <span id="s362">I took the, the belt.</span> <span id="s363">I put like here [showing that he tied the arm to the man’s side], to, to keep the hands not moving.</span> <span id="s364">And I said, "We have to run away."</span> <span id="s365">So we are going under the hill just like small way.</span> <span id="s366">There was snow.</span> <span id="s367">And we were going to the place that was called Lipowice.</span> <span id="s368">Was after Przemysl maybe seven kilometers, maybe more.</span> <span id="s369">And I went there, and I told them, "I have here a man."</span> <span id="s370">And normal, in wintertime of skiing, and I was coming to him to buy tea or coffee or some cookies.</span> <span id="s371">And I said, "I will go to him.</span> <span id="s372">Maybe he will give us shelter for one night.</span> <span id="s373">But then he will think in the morning what he have to do."</span> <span id="s374">And I went to him, and I knocked on the window.</span> <span id="s375">He opened, and I told him who I am.</span> <span id="s376">He was a nice man.</span> <span id="s377">He was scared, very, because he knows what happens.</span> <span id="s378">"Nobody has seen you?"</span> <span id="s379">I said, "No, no."</span> <span id="s380">And he gives us the shelter.</span> <span id="s381">We were sitting on the bench all night.</span> <span id="s382">And he give some to drink, you know, coffee or anything.</span> <span id="s383">People drink only water, because we have very high temperature, very.</span> <span id="s384">Then in the morning we said goodbye.</span> <span id="s385">And we said to each other, "Everybody's going in different way.</span> <span id="s386">They will not catch us together.</span> <span id="s387">Only separate way."</span> <span id="s388">As a matter of fact, after war I met them.</span> <span id="s389">They survive.</span> <span id="s390">So I went to my friend, who was working in hospital.</span> <span id="s391">And I went to him.</span> <span id="s392">I was holding my loaf, bread loaf, under my arm, and I was looking like a working man who's going to work.</span> <span id="s393">And when I came to him, he was scared.</span> <span id="s394">I told him what's happened, and he said, "Ok, I will try to do the best for you."</span> <span id="s395">And he was keeping me in a small cottage, which was his mother's cottage, but she was not in this time at home.</span> <span id="s396">So he said, "Stay here."</span> <span id="s397">He locked me inside.</span> <span id="s398">And I was there all day, and I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s399">And I was..."Maybe I can trust him, maybe no.</span> <span id="s400">Maybe he can go to Gestapo or something, and this will be the end."</span> <span id="s401">But on the evening, he came.</span> <span id="s402">Was about eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s403">He said, "Joe, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s404">I was going around.</span> <span id="s405">I cannot find place for you.</span> <span id="s406">I cannot keep you, because my wife she is scared.</span> <span id="s407">We cannot risk our lives.</span> <span id="s408">So what you want to do?</span> <span id="s409">Tell me.</span> <span id="s410">I will bring you in any place."</span> <span id="s411">He worked in hospital, and he had those carriage with two horses.</span> <span id="s412">Always he could travel, because he can ride this.</span> <span id="s413">So there was -- on the other side of the Przemysl there was a bridge.</span> <span id="s414">So to go to the town where I was living before, we have to cross the bridge.</span> <span id="s415">But on the bridge, there was always watchmen, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">01:26:10 They were watching who was crossing; they were looking inside you're not smuggling something.</span> <span id="s417">So he said, "I will risk my life and your life.</span> <span id="s418">But you have to lie down under my feet.</span> <span id="s419">I will cover you with a blanket.</span> <span id="s420">I will keep my feet on your face.</span> <span id="s421">And I have the pass, so I will try to go.</span> <span id="s422">But don't move.</span> <span id="s423">We will see.</span> <span id="s424">Maybe we'll be lucky."</span> <span id="s425">And really, we went there.</span> <span id="s426">They stopped him.</span> <span id="s427">But they know him, and he's showed them the pass.</span> <span id="s428">They was looking inside, but they didn't look too much.</span> <span id="s429">He was holding the feet on my back.</span> <span id="s430">And we passed.</span> <span id="s431">So they came downtown, close to my street that I was living.</span> <span id="s432">He said, "Joe, good luck.</span> <span id="s433">That's it.</span> <span id="s434">And do what you want."</span> <span id="s435">I said thank you, and he left.</span> <span id="s436">So I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s437">I went back to the place where we were living before.</span> <span id="s438">And I went to cellar.</span> <span id="s439">There was not basement, only cellar -- open cellars.</span> <span id="s440">And I was sitting there, and, and I saw this is not realistic because the people who maybe who lives there know who was living there, they can come back to cellar.</span> <span id="s441">They will see me.</span> <span id="s442">There was open space.</span> <span id="s443">And there's -- in fact there were rats and mice and dirt.</span> <span id="s444">So I said, "Maybe Stefania, maybe she will let me stay for one night."</span> <span id="s445">And I went upstairs, and I was knocking at her door.</span> <span id="s446">And she -- first she asked me, I told her quietly, "It's me."</span> <span id="s447">And she opened the door, and she saw me.</span> <span id="s448">Now, I was really in very bad condition.</span> <span id="s449">And she was very mercy to me with her really soft heart.</span> <span id="s450">She was most caring.</span> <span id="s451">She helped me to wash and this -- and she gave me her bed to sleep.</span> <span id="s452">And her sister, she was wondering what's going on.</span> <span id="s453">Because she saw me first, little sister.</span> <span id="s454">And she explained her how this, anyway.</span> <span id="s455">And the morning, she put me under the bed; and on the front of me, she put a sack with potatoes.</span> <span id="s456">She had a sack of potatoes there.</span> <span id="s457">So I was behind the sack of the potatoes, and she covered me blanket.</span> <span id="s458">She said, "Don't make noise, because the people are coming -- friends and this -- and they cannot see you."</span> <span id="s459">So this was for a few days.</span> <span id="s460">Then she went to my brother.</span> <span id="s461">He worked in, in a farm which was under supervision of military, belonged to the military, and they -- all brothers was going through the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">01:28:27 So my brother was working there with his fiancée.</span> <span id="s463">And when was the Aktion in the ghetto, they hold the people there because they know they will go back to ghetto, and they will take them.</span> <span id="s464">The, the -- no, the SS will take them.</span> <span id="s465">But they wanted to save them, because they needed them for work.</span> <span id="s466">So they told them stay this night and one day more here.</span> <span id="s467">They were sleeping there.</span> <span id="s468">So my wife, she came.</span> <span id="s469">She told him what's happened, and she told him that I survive.</span> <span id="s470">I came, and I'm at her home.</span> <span id="s471">He was very happy.</span> <span id="s472">And he was crying, also, because we lost the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s473">And then his wife, and they was taking them back to ghetto under guard -- I don't know how -- she run away.</span> <span id="s474">And she came to us to home...to...to my wife's, where I was hiding temporary.</span> <span id="s475">No, she said, no, she will not go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s476">She doesn't like to go.</span> <span id="s477">I didn't like to either go to ghetto, but my brother, he went back to ghetto with the group.</span> <span id="s478">And then he came there.</span> <span id="s479">He start to contact with us.</span> <span id="s480">And then he told us in the ghetto now is quiet, temporarily is quiet.</span> <span id="s481">"Nothing there, nothing.</span> <span id="s482">No Aktion.</span> <span id="s483">So you maybe you'll come back."</span> <span id="s484">After a few days, we went back to ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: What was the ghetto like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: This was no -- there were a few streets they surrounded with fences.</span> <span id="s487">And there was watch, like police.</span> <span id="s488">Police watch-- watching men, Polish, and there was German.</span> <span id="s489">Was the stationary because when it was Aktion, it came special group--SS or special military group who was taking the Aktion then or doing this.</span> <span id="s490">But when this other, they left to the domestic people to take care about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s491">That the people cannot get out, that cannot go in.</span> <span id="s492">But my wife’s little sister.</span> <span id="s493">She was going, playing and she was the messenger.</span> <span id="s494">She was bringing some message.</span> <span id="s495">We wanted something.</span> <span id="s496">We asked her.</span> <span id="s497">She would prepare in, in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Always I was under the fence sneaking through the town and I was coming and I took her to pick up something.</span> <span id="s499">No.</span> <span id="s500">In the meantime, my brother, he got typhus and his friend got typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">01:31:26 That was terrible thing, but we need something to -- there was no medicine.</span> <span id="s502">Nothing but something to, to keep them strong, to fight the temperature.</span> <span id="s503">So my wife, she prepared a sugar or milk or some cheese, butter -- something.</span> <span id="s504">And I smuggled this back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s505">Some drugs like painkiller drugs, you know, against high fever.</span> <span id="s506">This was, she could get without a, a prescription.</span> <span id="s507">So, like aspirin, you know -- such things like that.</span> <span id="s508">So kids, they survive, thanks God.</span> <span id="s509">But one time -- I have to tell this story.</span> <span id="s510">I was going from ghetto, and, and my watch was 8:30.</span> <span id="s511">But the, the curfew was until 9:00.</span> <span id="s512">After 9:00, they can catch anybody on the, on the street.</span> <span id="s513">They can kill without asking if you have no permission to go on the pavement.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">And I had always dressed similar to the dress like the young Hitlerjugend,they were wear.</span> <span id="s515">Those high shoes, short tight black pants, and nice coat and a nice hat with a, with a -- with the, with a -- like a, no, like a shaving thing, you know?</span> <span id="s516">Like a feather, yes.</span> <span id="s517">And I was going always dressed in this.</span> <span id="s518">But this time I had an attaché case, because I was going to my way to pick up some food and my watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">01:32:58 And I changed my dress from my old dress to this dress.</span> <span id="s520">I forget to put this -- I’ll show you this false document.</span> <span id="s521">And I'm going... There was a bridge from the ghetto, which was going to the town, but the, the bridge was going from street to the factory which there was fixing broken cars, trains and everything.</span> <span id="s522">So -- but on the side was entrance to ghetto, but this was blocked by barbed wires.</span> <span id="s523">And was like a road that you cannot go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s524">But always I was going through the holes, and I was going to the bridge down to the town.</span> <span id="s525">And when I was going downstairs to the town already, suddenly a flashlight went to my face.</span> <span id="s526">"Oh," I said.</span> <span id="s527">"That's it!"</span> <span id="s528">And in German language, somebody said, "Hände hoch!</span> <span id="s529">"I put my “Hände hoch,” and the attaché case fell down.</span> <span id="s530">So he came close.</span> <span id="s531">And I said, "No, this is German police.</span> <span id="s532">That's it!</span> <span id="s533">They will finish me."</span> <span id="s534">But I said why.</span> <span id="s535">And then came this Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s536">He was speaking German.</span> <span id="s537">He asked me, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s538">Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s539">I said, "No, I will not tell him that I am come from ghetto."</span> <span id="s540">I said, "I am going from the factory.</span> <span id="s541">I worked for my father."</span> <span id="s542">I said, "Dinner -- lunch.</span> <span id="s543">And I -- dinner -- and I am going back from factory 5 Hitler Youth (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s544">6 “Hands up!”</span> <span id="s545">(German).</span></p> <p><span id="s546">home."</span> <span id="s547">"Give me your documents."</span> <span id="s548">And I am looking in pocket, and I don't have my -- they called the ID card was Kennkartein German, ID card.</span> <span id="s549">I was looking.</span> <span id="s550">I said, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s551">I don't have in this dress.</span> <span id="s552">But if you like to come with me to the factory, there everybody knows me and, and they will tell you who I am."</span> <span id="s553">And I told, "I will go with you back."</span> <span id="s554">Then we will be close to the entrance to the block, entrance to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s555">I will give him a blow, and I will jump to ghetto.</span> <span id="s556">But he was smart.</span> <span id="s557">He said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s558">No way!</span> <span id="s559">No way!"</span> <span id="s560">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s561">He said, "Maybe you are a spy."</span> <span id="s562">I said, "What kind of spy?</span> <span id="s563">You are a Polish man, and I am a Polish man.</span> <span id="s564">And I am a spy for whom?</span> <span id="s565">I am spying for Germany?"</span> <span id="s566">He was working for Germany.</span> <span id="s567">"I'm not spying for Germany."</span> <span id="s568">He said, “Don't touch me.”</span> <span id="s569">He start to swear to me: "You such -- out.</span> <span id="s570">And you, we're going to Gestapo."</span></p> <p><span id="s571">01:33:29 And I know if he will go with me, and this is -- he said, "You know, it is 9:30."</span> <span id="s572">And I show him my watch, was 8:30.</span> <span id="s573">He said, "Throw your watch under the running train.</span> <span id="s574">This is 9:30."</span> <span id="s575">My watch was not working.</span> <span id="s576">And I was late.</span> <span id="s577">After curfew, curfew.</span> <span id="s578">So he said, "We are going to Gestapo."</span> <span id="s579">And like this, and I know if he will go on the street at night with this -- with me, the German, you know, police, they are going also patrols.</span> <span id="s580">And they will see him holding.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">They will take me from him, and they will kill me on the spot.</span> <span id="s582">So I, I know the psychology of the Polish people.</span> <span id="s583">I start to talk him: "Hey, you are a tall guy and I am a little short man.</span> <span id="s584">And you are holding me under gun.</span> <span id="s585">What you think, that I will kill you or I will run away?</span> <span id="s586">You're supposed to be ashamed!</span> <span id="s587">You're a coward."</span> <span id="s588">Like this.</span> <span id="s589">And he said to me, "You don't --" I said, "You're a coward."</span> <span id="s590">So he put his gun here, the rifle.</span> <span id="s591">He walked with me like this, and we start to talk Polish.</span> <span id="s592">I talk to him Polish.</span> <span id="s593">So, really, there was going a German patrol, but they look on us and they didn't touch.</span> <span id="s594">Because he was a policeman, and I was talking to him Polish.</span> <span id="s595">He was talking to me Polish.</span> <span id="s596">They didn't understand what we were talking about.</span> <span id="s597">So they thought maybe I'm also a, a secret police.</span> <span id="s598">So I am going with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">01:36:44 So one thing passed away behind me, and then we are going, there was a street up.</span> <span id="s600">And I see from far away, like maybe two hundred yards, a small light.</span> <span id="s601">And there stand a watchman as the Gestapo watchman.</span> <span id="s602">That's the Gestapo office.</span> <span id="s603">I said, "This is the end!"</span> <span id="s604">And I talked to him.</span> <span id="s605">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s606">He is taking me there.</span> <span id="s607">I said, "Listen, if I am a partisan, you know, they are watching you.</span> <span id="s608">Your whole family will be killed, and you will be killed.</span> <span id="s609">They will put in fire your house.</span> <span id="s610">You will not survive."</span> <span id="s611">I said, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s612">They will kill me, but you will -- " He said, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s613">Now this is wartime, and this is my duty."</span> <span id="s614">And sudden, I don't know, came to my mind something.</span> <span id="s615">And I hit him with my right hand.</span> <span id="s616">He was taller than me.</span> <span id="s617">I hit him once right, and then upper cut his left.</span> <span id="s618">He fell down like a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s619">I felt I have such power because this was death -- life or death.</span> <span id="s620">And I was so angry.</span> <span id="s621">I was said to him, "You dirty pig!</span> <span id="s622">You will get what you deserve!</span> <span id="s623">I could kill you right now," I said, "but I will not do this.</span> <span id="s624">I will not make my hands dirty."</span> <span id="s625">And I turn around and I was going on the hill 7 ID card (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s626">the street down.</span> <span id="s627">I was not running.</span> <span id="s628">And then, in the last minute, I start to run away.</span> <span id="s629">And I came to my wife at night.</span> <span id="s630">I was out after 10:00, and she was, "What's happen?"</span> <span id="s631">And I told her the story.</span> <span id="s632">And I was all night staying there.</span> <span id="s633">And next morning, I told her, "Go look on the street.</span> <span id="s634">Watch what's happen."</span> <span id="s635">She went.</span> <span id="s636">She came, said, "Nothing.</span> <span id="s637">No nothing, and nobody."</span> <span id="s638">I don't know.</span> <span id="s639">You know, quiet.</span> <span id="s640">And in the evening, I was going back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s641">And when I was jumping through the bridge, I heard shooting -- [Imitating shooting sound].</span> <span id="s642">And I went myself, and then I saw, look what's happen.</span> <span id="s643">There are another like SS man or maybe not SS man, but he was a secret police.</span> <span id="s644">There was lying a woman he took from the train.</span> <span id="s645">A woman, he was taking off her shoes.</span> <span id="s646">She was still alive, and he was taking off her shoes.</span> <span id="s647">He killed her because he felt she was a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s648">They found her.</span> <span id="s649">Anyway, I went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s650">And I came to there, and I was there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">01:39:00 Then her sister always was with her and counting, and I came back.</span> <span id="s652">I talked to my wife was yet to find a place to hide, because in this place we cannot stay.</span> <span id="s653">I said, "I have to come with my brother, with his fiancée, and my friend and his daughter.</span> <span id="s654">Would be about five to seven people."</span> <span id="s655">And so we organized.</span> <span id="s656">She's under -- "The beginning," she said, "it will be very hard."</span> <span id="s657">So I said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s658">We have to do this."</span> <span id="s659">So she was looking, and she find on the hill is like a side street on the border of the town.</span> <span id="s660">The name of Tatarska (ph) Street.</span> <span id="s661">And this was like a nice small cottage.</span> <span id="s662">And I came with her once there before she made the arrangement.</span> <span id="s663">And I said, "This is perfect for this purpose."</span> <span id="s664">So she make the whole thing legal.</span> <span id="s665">She says she make -- she get the papers.</span> <span id="s666">And when she moved there, I came there with my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">And first we were looking around; and I think, "We have to make a bunker."</span> <span id="s668">So under her bed, I cut a piece of floor.</span> <span id="s669">We start to digging hole.</span> <span id="s670">We were digging, and she was taking in the evening in a sack this ground.</span> <span id="s671">And there was some trees, and between them she was putting the, the, you know, the soil, so nobody would see the soil.</span> <span id="s672">And we make such in that two could stay there.</span> <span id="s673">The attic was too open.</span> <span id="s674">And there was like a ladder from the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">There was a hole between attic.</span> <span id="s676">So I was thinking, "Later."</span> <span id="s677">But for first thing, I said, "Instead of sit in the open attic, maybe we will be there."</span> <span id="s678">But then came the father of, the father of the girl, and, and came another, my friend.</span> <span id="s679">So was a little more people.</span> <span id="s680">And I..</span> <span id="s681">.</span> <span id="s682">I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s683">I said, "Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the hole."</span> <span id="s684">So we are, we are sitting in the open attic.</span> <span id="s685">And then I told to my wife, "Look, maybe we will find an old wood, something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood.”</span></p> <p><span id="s686">01:41:26 This would be nothing new.</span> <span id="s687">And I said, "We will make a false wall, do something."</span> <span id="s688">Was very difficult.</span> <span id="s689">She was running around many places, and then she find somebody.</span> <span id="s690">And they brought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire.</span> <span id="s691">So they left this.</span> <span id="s692">And she brought this little by little inside.</span> <span id="s693">The neighbors was asking, "What?"</span> <span id="s694">She said, "No, for I like to cut this and cut for wintertime."</span> <span id="s695">So was not for -- not I wanted.</span> <span id="s696">Then when she brought the -- we measured everything.</span> <span id="s697">We cut it by little and we make numbers that everything will fit.</span> <span id="s698">Then we have to nail this.</span> <span id="s699">There will be noise.</span> <span id="s700">So I advised my wife make washing, laundry -- everything.</span> <span id="s701">And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you will put them in attic, you will hang them and they will dry.</span> <span id="s702">The, the, you know, the washed laundry.</span> <span id="s703">So that.</span> <span id="s704">So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the ropes, we know they, they were fast.</span> <span id="s705">Then we put a little also outside, and if you put everything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like is dirt and, and from the spiders.</span> <span id="s706">The -- took from our place they put another place.</span> <span id="s707">Was look exactly like old thing.</span> <span id="s708">And this the, the attic was shut in maybe like two yards.</span> <span id="s709">I make sure of it.</span> <span id="s710">And I make, make the roof was going on an angle, so I make a small door, so that I can every time open, watch and close right away if somebody will come.</span> <span id="s711">And I was this what I have my curved spine.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">And that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if somebody not come.</span> <span id="s713">And it's hard to know.</span> <span id="s714">We were there.</span> <span id="s715">It was very fine.</span> <span id="s716">And then the people that come, little by little, from ghetto-- then my brother and his wife, they came, the last ones.</span> <span id="s717">But so other people, they came little by little.</span> <span id="s718">There was story how they were coming.</span> <span id="s719">But my wife, I think she thought about it.</span> <span id="s720">So anyway, we were all 13 there.</span> <span id="s721">.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">01:43:47 Now we have to organize food and organize the regime control that we do not do something which can be dangerous to our life.</span> <span id="s723">So I make like the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s724">Every two hours somebody sitting watching.</span> <span id="s725">They will be not snoring at night.</span> <span id="s726">So we have a stick with a rabbit, this was from a rabbit like with the tail.</span> <span id="s727">And I told them if somebody was snoring, you go to your nose to wake up.</span> <span id="s728">But don't make noise.</span> <span id="s729">Because you have to be, perhaps somebody will wake you up and try to sleep on the stomach.</span> <span id="s730">Everybody on the stomach, not on the back because you will snore.</span> <span id="s731">That was dangerous, number one.</span> <span id="s732">Number two, no smoking.</span> <span id="s733">The people, they want to smoke.</span> <span id="s734">They were smoking anything.</span> <span id="s735">I said, "No smoking, because the, the smoke will go to the place within the, the wall, or they can see at night light through, or can be a fire.</span> <span id="s736">We don't need this.”</span> <span id="s737">So there was really a fight to convince the people that this is tragedy.</span> <span id="s738">This is not for us.</span> <span id="s739">Then one, the woman who came with her two children, she got typhus there.</span> <span id="s740">And she, she was infected in ghetto, but after a few days, after a week, the typhus develop.</span> <span id="s741">And she had high fever, temperature.</span> <span id="s742">She was talking.</span> <span id="s743">So I was the one who was taking care of her.</span> <span id="s744">I said nobody could come close to her.</span> <span id="s745">So it was really tough, because there was not too much space, but she was -- I was watching her.</span> <span id="s746">I shave her hair, and I said to my wife, "Do anything what you wanted to get something."</span> <span id="s747">Because after experience with my brother in ghetto, to keep her going.</span> <span id="s748">And she was trying to buy for her sugar and something, and aspirin and this and this.</span> <span id="s749">And anyway, I, I make also a prescription for heart, you know, some medicine to keep, make the heart going.</span> <span id="s750">And she went to pharmacy.</span> <span id="s751">And I said, "Maybe, we ok.</span> <span id="s752">Maybe, no."</span> <span id="s753">And she made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">01:46:22.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s756">She got started.</span> <span id="s757">It was another story, but a lot -- she made it, she got it, she came.</span> <span id="s758">Anyway, the children were prepared if she, God forbidding, passed away, that we in the hole will make a, we will make a hole, a grave.</span> <span id="s759">We will put her temporary there.</span> <span id="s760">Because we had to be prepared for everything, I told them.</span> <span id="s761">But anyway, she survived, was Ok.</span> <span id="s762">Then I convinced the people stop smoking, and about snoring.</span> <span id="s763">Then was problem with, with food, because this woman she wanted special, special food all the time.</span> <span id="s764">But something was very difficult to get.</span> <span id="s765">This was not so easy.</span> <span id="s766">Was tough time.</span> <span id="s767">But we were sitting.</span> <span id="s768">Was many, many stories, like my wife told you.</span> <span id="s769">They came, they gave her two hours to move out.</span> <span id="s770">We asked her to run away, to save her life and her sister.</span> <span id="s771">"No," she said no.</span> <span id="s772">And she was staying, and she survived.</span> <span id="s773">Then came the German.</span> <span id="s774">They came, they have two nurses -- there were two nurse and their two boyfriends.</span> <span id="s775">And they was almost everyday sleeping there.</span> <span id="s776">So we were above them.</span> <span id="s777">And sometimes there was little noise, because they can hear.</span> <span id="s778">And I was feeling that this is very dangerous.</span> <span id="s779">They are there.</span> <span id="s780">And one time, like my wife told, they came.</span> <span id="s781">They was holding my wife, and one nurse also was with them and one was running.</span> <span id="s782">There was like not stairs, only there was like no…</span></p> <p><span id="s783">01:47:50</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Ladder.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Ladder.</span> <span id="s786">And...and no -- you can hear the noise if somebody stepping on the -- so I was hearing something.</span> <span id="s787">And I closed the door.</span> <span id="s788">And suddenly came one of the nurse.</span> <span id="s789">She was looking around, going around looking, not quiet.</span> <span id="s790">Was the last moment.</span> <span id="s791">And she went down, and she told them no.</span> <span id="s792">So my wife, she saw what's going on.</span> <span id="s793">Then she bought chicken, and she was holding the chicken in, in the hole, and the chicken was making noise.</span> <span id="s794">Something to, you know, to mask the noise.</span> <span id="s795">And this was what we're doing to, to try to, you know, to camouflage everything.</span> <span id="s796">Then about food.</span> <span id="s797">Her little sister, she was coming bringing something bread.</span> <span id="s798">I have always there a few loaves of bread, which changing I make some mess, like a nest; and there was exchanging every time fresh and they all using what we were eating.</span> <span id="s799">And to not make suspicious the, the neighbor, so she says, “She is bringing bread and she is selling bread.”</span> <span id="s800">And always was going in this way, that they couldn't count how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">What was hiding.</span> <span id="s802">And she never was talking to people.</span> <span id="s803">She could play with little children, and never -- she never said a word about us.</span> <span id="s804">And one time, they came.</span> <span id="s805">My wife, she didn't come to work.</span> <span id="s806">And there was another, she has to work.</span> <span id="s807">So she was -- a few days she didn't come because she was feeling sick.</span> <span id="s808">She didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s809">And I see through the window -- because always we were watching to see if someone could see a policeman is coming -- a Polish policeman and a German policeman is coming.</span> <span id="s810">So I told her, "Go with us to the, to the" I said, "to the bunker.</span> <span id="s811">Hide.</span> <span id="s812">And they will only your little sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">01:49:53.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">She will tell them that you went to buy some food, you know, in the village, something."</span> <span id="s815">And they knocked on the door, and she opened.</span> <span id="s816">They came.</span> <span id="s817">"Where's your sister?</span> <span id="s818">Who are you, your sister?</span> <span id="s819">Where's your sister?"</span> <span id="s820">Said, "She went to the village to...to buy some food."</span> <span id="s821">The policeman, he turned and slapped her in the face.</span> <span id="s822">She fell down.</span> <span id="s823">And he said, "Why are you lying?</span> <span id="s824">Your neighbor, they told us that she was just now out here in the yard."</span> <span id="s825">And she start stutter "Why I, I have to lie?</span> <span id="s826">She went -- she has to go through the yard.</span> <span id="s827">So she was in the yard, and she went to, to the village.</span> <span id="s828">How she can go to, to the village.</span> <span id="s829">She has to go through the yard, so maybe they saw her."</span> <span id="s830">She talk to them.</span> <span id="s831">I, I don't know.</span> <span id="s832">She told she told them that she's going to, to buy food, and they look and they start to look around.</span> <span id="s833">She didn't have nothing there.</span> <span id="s834">A piece of bread and a little soup.</span> <span id="s835">Nothing.</span> <span id="s836">He said, "That's all you have?"</span> <span id="s837">"Yes."</span> <span id="s838">"You're alone at home?"</span> <span id="s839">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s840">"You sleep alone?"</span> <span id="s841">"Yes."</span> <span id="s842">"You're not afraid?"</span> <span id="s843">She said, "Why I have to be afraid?"</span> <span id="s844">"That's what you are eating?"</span> <span id="s845">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s846">They left her, and she didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s847">And they left her, and, and my wife was hiding, and she came out.</span> <span id="s848">That was one episode.</span> <span id="s849">There was many, many episodes during the time.</span> <span id="s850">There was almost two years.</span> <span id="s851">Every day, each hour was something that our life was threatened with gun.</span> <span id="s852">At the end, when our -- one thing was good.</span> <span id="s853">They have a radio, the German.</span> <span id="s854">And they was listening to the news, and I was listening to the news.</span> <span id="s855">And we can, they are listening to us we can thinking how they are going back.</span> <span id="s856">They're running away.</span> <span id="s857">And I said to my wife, "Soon or later, very soon, you will have your Russian.</span> <span id="s858">Because they give them hell, and they ran."</span> <span id="s859">And all my -- almost I find the day when they will come.</span> <span id="s860">And I remember the last day when we heard there was fighting.</span> <span id="s861">And we can hear the noise of the different noise of different bullet, different rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">01:52:16 The Russians have different rifles, and the German have different rifles.</span> <span id="s863">We heard the difference in the noise.</span> <span id="s864">So I said to my wife, "Probably they will come, but they are fighting."</span> <span id="s865">We cannot go down, and we have to stay in the attic.</span> <span id="s866">But the bullets and ding, ding, ding, you know, was hitting.</span> <span id="s867">I said to my all people there, "Listen, we have to lie down.</span> <span id="s868">Keep something between your teeth.</span> <span id="s869">If somebody -- they will hit somebody, you cannot scream.</span> <span id="s870">If somebody will be dead, he will be dead.</span> <span id="s871">This is our last chance.</span> <span id="s872">But if they find us, if somebody will scream, she will be killed and her sister will be killed.</span> <span id="s873">And we will be killed.</span> <span id="s874">Because everybody now look for each other.</span> <span id="s875">So you have to be prepared that something will happen no worse, nothing."</span> <span id="s876">And we are lying down and listening, and she went down with her sister.</span> <span id="s877">She went down, and with the neighbors was waiting.</span> <span id="s878">And anyway, we under-- we can hear the bullet.</span> <span id="s879">Some start to be more close, and some start to go away.</span> <span id="s880">And I said, "I think probably the Russian are coming.</span> <span id="s881">Because listen to the Russian sound of the bullets, the noise.</span> <span id="s882">But we will see."</span> <span id="s883">Then early in the morning, by six or seven o'clock in the morning, I look through the small thing.</span> <span id="s884">They are going about six German soldiers with rifles, the helmets.</span> <span id="s885">All came back going on the street up.</span> <span id="s886">I said, "My God, still, still there are Germans here."</span> <span id="s887">And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a few soldiers, Russian soldiers and to them, “Hands up!”</span> <span id="s888">And they fell down, and they were begging.</span> <span id="s889">I said, "Thanks God, we are free!"</span> <span id="s890">And that's it.</span> <span id="s891">Next day, this what happened -- or the same day.</span> <span id="s892">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s893">Came two Russian, White Russian.</span> <span id="s894">One was the lieutenant and one was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s895">And they came.</span> <span id="s896">She was in the window singing, and this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">01:54:37 And they came, and first they asked, "Is Germans here?"</span> <span id="s898">She said, "No, there are no Germans here."</span> <span id="s899">"Can we come?"</span> <span id="s900">And said, "Ok."</span> <span id="s901">They came inside.</span> <span id="s902">And my wife, she closed the windows; and they start to talk this and this and not so.</span> <span id="s903">My wife asked them always, "How far are Germans?</span> <span id="s904">Maybe they can come back."</span> <span id="s905">They was suspicious.</span> <span id="s906">"What?</span> <span id="s907">," they asking.</span> <span id="s908">"What?"</span> <span id="s909">"Because," she said, "there was one time that he went back, the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s910">So this is what I'm asking."</span> <span id="s911">He said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s912">They are chasing them.</span> <span id="s913">They are running away.</span> <span id="s914">They are loosing their pants, pants."</span> <span id="s915">And they said, "They are running away.</span> <span id="s916">They will never come back here."</span> <span id="s917">And we heard.</span> <span id="s918">We were standing behind the doors, but we heard this.</span> <span id="s919">And we came and sat.</span> <span id="s920">But look, we couldn't talk, because we didn't talk, only were whispering for almost two years.</span> <span id="s921">We couldn't walk, because there was not walking up and down, just not exercise.</span> <span id="s922">We were pale, you know, and terrible.</span> <span id="s923">And they picked up their rifles.</span> <span id="s924">"Who there?"</span> <span id="s925">They thought maybe partisans.</span> <span id="s926">So she told them.</span> <span id="s927">And one of them was a Jewish lieutenant and his family was from Ukraine killed by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">And he -- and his sergeant, he was a regular Russian.</span> <span id="s929">He said, "My, my goal is to chase the German and give them back what they did to my family, to my family."</span> <span id="s930">He was crying.</span> <span id="s931">He was kissing us, hugging.</span> <span id="s932">He said to my wife, "You are really hero!</span> <span id="s933">You are really hero!</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Without weapons, without nothing, you could fight so many as in the little girl, the sister."</span> <span id="s935">They took pictures, and said, "What you need?</span> <span id="s936">We will give you what you need."</span> <span id="s937">He said, "We have the German hospital here, there, there.</span> <span id="s938">The whole thing there.</span> <span id="s939">Loaded with everything.</span> <span id="s940">What you -- dresses, shoes maybe.</span> <span id="s941">And we will bring you meat."</span> <span id="s942">And we said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s943">Not now.</span> <span id="s944">We would like to have freedom."</span> <span id="s945">And how we did it, because we were afraid about neighbors still.</span> <span id="s946">So we told them that -- it was night, we will go, the men, with them back to hospital.</span> <span id="s947">And next day, they will bring us, we will come back like guerrillas who are coming to, you know, with the army.</span> <span id="s948">And we will look for my wife.</span> <span id="s949">I will ask the neighbors about her.</span> <span id="s950">We will come like guests.</span> <span id="s951">We came.</span> <span id="s952">We survived; we will hug her, we will kiss her.</span> <span id="s953">So they will not suspect that it was us she was hiding people.</span> <span id="s954">They said, "That's a good idea."</span> <span id="s955">And we went, and the women and children were still with my wife there.</span> <span id="s956">Next day, in the morning, we came with them.</span> <span id="s957">There was a wagon with horses and everything was there.</span> <span id="s958">We had rifles with us.</span> <span id="s959">And I came, and I am looking; and I asked one neighbor.</span> <span id="s960">I know them, because when I saw them, I said, "Hey, do you know if still around a..</span> <span id="s961">.</span> <span id="s962">a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Her name is Podgórska, Stefania Podgórska.</span> <span id="s964">She's my friend, my, my neighbor.</span> <span id="s965">I have to seek her."</span> <span id="s966">She said, "Why, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s967">She is a good girl.</span> <span
