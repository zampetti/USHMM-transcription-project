that’s the German expression - and in Polish it’s called about the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">I had one sister and two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Older than you?</span> <span id="s32">Younger?</span> <span id="s33">Can you tell me something about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Well, we were four children, and my sister was the oldest, and I had one older brother, and then myself and the younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Erna.</span> <span id="s37">That’s my sister’s name.</span> <span id="s38">And Bruno, my older brother’s name.</span> <span id="s39">And Erwin, the youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: General store.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What did they sell?</span> <span id="s43">What do you mean by a general store?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A They sold about everything!</span> <span id="s45">Everything one can think of.</span> <span id="s46">Like, this was in the cities at the time, that small stores could exist.</span> <span id="s47">They were not so dependent on the department stores, although there were, already, some department stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Was this quite a small store?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Mid-sized.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did they have employees?</span> <span id="s51">Besides the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: German, but my mother could speak Polish, and my father understood - he couldn’t speak, but he understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What about Yiddish?</span> <span id="s56">Was there Yiddish spoken?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Would you say that your family was secular or religious in its orientation?</span> <span id="s59">Maybe you could describe the way Judaism was practiced in your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, it was practiced as much as the parents could, but, for financial reasons, they were not able to close the store on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s61">It would have been impossible, because Shabbos was the day when the people bought because during the week they just didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s62">This was a mining town - Gelsenkirchen - and the major part of the population were miners.</span> <span id="s63">But we kept all the Jewish holidays, and we went to shul, and we lit up the candles on Shabbos evening, on Friday, and my father went to synagogue on Shabbos morning.</span> <span id="s64">So I would say that you can call it secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: I don’t think we need to give it a name.</span> <span id="s66">Did they keep a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was this by-and-large true of the other Jews that you were growing up with?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I would say most of the Jewish people in Germany were secular Jews, I would say the majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So your family was more observant than most?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s72">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Would you describe the size of the Jewish community in your community as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Pretty good sized.</span> <span id="s75">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Did you live surrounded by many other Jews then?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: We, personally, were not surrounded.</span> <span id="s78">But there was a beautiful synagogue in Gelsenkirchen, and the Orthodox people had another synagogue, and then the secular Jewish people.</span> <span id="s79">So there were three synagogues in Gelsenkirchen.</span> <span id="s80">It wasn’t such a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes I did, but I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Would you explain?</span> <span id="s84">What was the education like?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It was boring to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: How many years of Jewish education did you have, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Four or five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: I’d like you to try to remember events - if there were events that you felt were leading up to what was to come in Germany - what events you were aware of in your community, either locally or on a national or international level from the mid-1930's through 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: As conditions got worse and worse, we could not go any place any more.</span> <span id="s90">We were practically - which was not before - like in a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Where could you not go within the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Within the town you couldn’t go to any theater, you couldn’t go to any sports, and this was all forbidden for Jews.</span> <span id="s93">My younger brother and myself, we had a wholesale in candy.</span> <span id="s94">And not only did we lose most of our customers, but the few customers which remained - through the hate propaganda - came in the evening when it was dark and picked up some merchandise.</span> <span id="s95">And once I drove out to deliver merchandise, and my delivery truck was thrown over.</span> <span id="s96">Life became quite unbearable.</span> <span id="s97">I was a young fellow then, and I said, “I’m not going, under these conditions, to stay in Germany.”</span> <span id="s98">And so I snuck over the frontier and into Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: When was this, can you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: In 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Were you by yourself when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s103">I wasn’t married, and I had enough of all of what was going on - the slogans, the persecutions.</span> <span id="s104">And so it was just impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did you have gentile friends at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Quite a few, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q And how did they respond to what was going on?</span> <span id="s108">Did your relationships with them change?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: It changed profoundly.</span> <span id="s110">It changed completely.</span> <span id="s111">Some of them, they were not anti-Semitic, they were not Nazis, but they were afraid!</span> <span id="s112">They were threatened!</span> <span id="s113">They were threatened if they would continue, that harm would be done to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And was harm actually done to gentile people who you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No.</span> <span id="s116">I can’t remember, but the threat, by itself, already did.</span> <span id="s117">As I stated before, we lost almost all our customers.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Were people not allowed, by law, to do business with you?</span> <span id="s119">Or was it a formal restriction?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: It was not a law, yet, at the time, but the pressure from the Nazis was that strong that they didn’t dare!</span> <span id="s121">I already left Germany in 1937.</span> <span id="s122">It was bad enough then.</span> <span id="s123">Later on it went worse!</span> <span id="s124">This was two years before outbreak of the Second World War - when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Do you remember specific anti-Semitic incidents?</span> <span id="s126">You’ve told me a few.</span> <span id="s127">Were there others that you remember happening around you before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, I had not been in my house at the time, but my youngest brother, he was beaten half to death, at the so-called Kristall Night - in France a German attache was killed, and in reprisal, my brother was beaten half to death in the night.</span> <span id="s129">So this was one of the worst incidents.</span> <span id="s130">But this was only told to me.</span> <span id="s131">I had not been in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Is there anything more that you would like to say about that part of your life before you left?</span> <span id="s133">You’re welcome to go back to it, if you like, at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I would say this: the German Jewish people, until the rise of the Third Reich, had been quite in good living conditions.</span> <span id="s135">Always there was anti-Semitism in Germany.</span> <span id="s136">Probably not quite as much as in Poland and Russia, but there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s137">But the German Jews, they had a very good life.</span> <span id="s138">They were in good positions as doctors, lawyers, and business people.</span> <span id="s139">And they thought that it would pass by - that it would normalize.</span> <span id="s140">But I remember when I went to school, they always said that Germany did not lose the First World War, it was just so that the Jews and the people which were left behind - it’s their fault.</span> <span id="s141">The Germany army was not defeated!</span> <span id="s142">And in school then they just loved to talk about fighting and wars and this was the highest thing there is!</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: It sounds like you remember as a schoolboy, anti-Semitism quite early, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes, I remember anti-Semitism, but it was not at the point that it was just intolerable.</span> <span id="s145">It was not as widespread.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Can you describe the process from the very beginning?</span> <span id="s147">The early anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s148">And what was added to that, and what was added after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, I hadn’t been, then, in Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s150">I only know what happened later on - that special laws were instituted.</span> <span id="s151">And later on, even the complete annihilation of the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s152">This came later on.</span> <span id="s153">They added always more restriction to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: My question was more about earlier.</span> <span id="s155">When you were a young boy, as you were getting older, how were you aware of anti-Semitism getting worse while you were still living in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: It was not.</span> <span id="s157">It was always the same practically, my younger years.</span> <span id="s158">Not that I could say it was mounting all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So when the incidents started happening where you were not allowed to go to the theater, and to go to other places in your city, and people were afraid to do business with you, did this happen quite suddenly?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No, not suddenly.</span> <span id="s161">It came with the coming to power of the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: To your knowledge, what happened to your family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: They were all killed.</span> <span id="s164">They were all deported.</span> <span id="s165">I’m the only survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: How did you find out what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I’d been told by the neighbors.</span> <span id="s168">My father and my mother, and my sister with her children - they were deported to Riga.</span> <span id="s169">And they were told that they were “relocated.”</span> <span id="s170">They were not told anything of the kind - those people, they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s171">They said the were working in a work camp, but not that they were destined to dying in the ovens!</span> <span id="s172">But they were just told, “We have to make room.”</span> <span id="s173">They put them in the cattle wagons and sent them to Riga!</span> <span id="s174">And my older brother, he was with me in Grenoble later on, and he was arrested there, and I never heard from him anything.</span> <span id="s175">And my younger brother, he was in Buchenwald, in concentration camp, and he survived, and I talked to him after the war, but he was in such a bad shape, that right after the liberation, a year or two later, he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Where was he then?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: He was then in Germany.</span> <span id="s178">He was back in Germany.</span> <span id="s179">So all the sufferings he went through, he couldn’t survive, even though he was not old then.</span> <span id="s180">Let me see, he was born in 1911, and he was about 40 years old when he came back from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did you see him again after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you keep in touch with your family after you had left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes, I wrote letters from wherever I was until later on - nothing more.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did you receive letters from them also?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes, up to the year, I think, 1942, but I’m not sure whether it was ‘42 or ‘41.</span> <span id="s187">So many years have gone by.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Will you tell me now about when you left Germany - what happened to you?</span> <span id="s189">How you decided where to go.</span> <span id="s190">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, I went first to Belgium.</span> <span id="s192">And Belgium was a small country.</span> <span id="s193">they didn’t give any permission to stay, they didn’t give any papers to be able to work, or anything.</span> <span id="s194">There was a Commission, and I was called before that Commission, at that time, and I was asked, “Why did you leave Germany?”</span> <span id="s195">And I told them under what conditions we lived.</span> <span id="s196">And one member - the people which decided whether one could get permission to stay or not - one of those members stood up and said, “I have been in Germany, and I have seen the Jews are still doing business.</span> <span id="s197">They’re doing good business, and you pretend that you had to leave Germany, that you couldn’t stand it any more.”</span> <span id="s198">So they didn’t give me any permission to stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s199">So what was I supposed to do?</span> <span id="s200">I went over the frontier clandestinely to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: How long were you in Belgium, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh, about half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Were you single and by yourself at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And how were you supporting yourself for that half a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: It was very difficult - extremely difficult!</span> <span id="s207">There were Jewish committees supported by the Joint Distribution Committee and we received meal tickets with which we could go to small Jewish restaurants.</span> <span id="s208">There were quite a few there.</span> <span id="s209">And it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s210">Now, the problem was, we were not really “poor” people.</span> <span id="s211">I could have taken some money with me, but I didn’t dare, because it was a law that if anybody was caught, that was punishable quite severely.</span> <span id="s212">So I really didn’t have any money or anything.</span> <span id="s213">It was just terrible!</span> <span id="s214">Hoping always, among the refugee circles, that Hitler would disappear!</span> <span id="s215">All kinds of rumors came out.</span> <span id="s216">But in France it was just terrible at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: When you say “we,” were there a lot of people in your situation in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Oh, yeah!</span> <span id="s219">Quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Can you describe what a typical day would have been for you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: A typical day?</span> <span id="s222">(Laughs) A typical day was to survive until the next day, to have something to eat, and the worst part is, at that time, I could eat.</span> <span id="s223">I wish I could today.</span> <span id="s224">(Laughter) And have a roof over the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Where did you stay at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: In flop-holes, rundown, and hotels.</span> <span id="s227">And the worst part is, in Belgium, these particular hotels were under surveillance and they came and looked at the papers, and we didn’t have any papers, so I have been several times arrested because I didn’t have valid papers.</span> <span id="s228">And then was the question, “Where do you want to go from Belgium?</span> <span id="s229">Do you want to go back to Germany, or do you want to go to another country?”</span> <span id="s230">And invariably the answer was, “No, we go to France when we go out.”</span> <span id="s231">And so we were brought to the French borderline and then came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Then you would go back into Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Into Belgium, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And you sneaked back?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s236">But later on I had enough of Belgium, and went into France and stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Which cities were you in in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Brasschaat, Antwerp - mostly Brasschaat.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Is there more that you would like to say about your life at that period in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s241">I would say we were not treated very well in Belgium, but in a way it’s understandable.</span> <span id="s242">It was, it is, a small country, and maybe they couldn’t afford to have that many, because we were hundreds of thousands - I don’t know how many Jewish refugees there were at the time in Belgium.</span> <span id="s243">So, that’s all I have to say.</span> <span id="s244">In France it was easier, because the country is much, much larger.</span> <span id="s245">But, too, like in any big city, you know where one goes - one goes to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: So is that what you did?</span> <span id="s247">Would you describe what you did when you left Belgium?</span> <span id="s248">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s250">And we get permission to stay for three days, and then we had to stand in line for hours in order to sometimes got one day, and the other time was clandestinely.</span> <span id="s251">It’s terrible!</span> <span id="s252">They had particular people - police - which was constantly asking.</span> <span id="s253">And they knew the difference between a refugee and a Frenchman at the time.</span> <span id="s254">So, it was a miserable life, until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And what happened in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: In 1939 in the newspapers and everywhere there was an announcement that all foreigners had to go to the Stadium of Colombes, which is near Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So until that time, how long would you say you were in France until that period in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I would say about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And how were you surviving then?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: The same as in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: With help, that means, from the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Mostly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Do you remember any details of that - places where you received help, or people that you met at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">There was, near Place Daumesnil, there was a big Jewish center.</span> <span id="s266">And there were thousands, literally thousands of refugees there.</span> <span id="s267">I don't remember the street, but near Place Daumesnil.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: What do you remember was the spirit or the mood of the refugees at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh, pretty low, their mood.</span> <span id="s270">The thing is, everybody was uprooted, and everybody was hoping that it wouldn’t last, that they could go back to their occupation, to their country.</span> <span id="s271">It wasn’t fun!</span> <span id="s272">It was, I would say, a vagabond life.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: How did you carry your belongings?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s275">(Laughs) What was there to carry?</span> <span id="s276">We had one suit - I don’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did you manage to find work at all, in the years that you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s279">You couldn’t work without having a “permis de travail.”</span> <span id="s280">Do you speak a little French?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: No.</span> <span id="s282">I understood, though.</span> <span id="s283">So then in 1939, why don’t you go from there.</span> <span id="s284">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: In 1939, from Stadium de Colombes, we were there a week about.</span> <span id="s286">And then we were by train shipped to Villerbon.</span> <span id="s287">This is near Blois.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Could I go back to what your experience was in the stadium?</span> <span id="s289">Were there hundreds of you?</span> <span id="s290">Thousands?</span> <span id="s291">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I would say thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And what were the conditions of the stadium?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: The condition was like almost everything in France, nothing was organized.</span> <span id="s295">There was an open stadium, and they put some straw in on the floor, and no blankets, no nothing.</span> <span id="s296">And the only “nuriteur” - nourishment - was pate.</span> <span id="s297">And I ate so much, that’s why I can’t stand pate up to today any more.</span> <span id="s298">Pate!</span> <span id="s299">And this was the only, only thing we had to eat in the Stadium of Colombes, so it was just a beautiful thing that we finally were shipped out to the camp in Villerbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So you were shipped then to Villerbon.</span> <span id="s301">Were there many of you shipped there?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s303">Not only Villerbon; there were all kinds of little camps around Blois, not only Villerbon.</span> <span id="s304">I don’t recall the names of the other camps, but one camp wouldn’t be able to have all these people which were shipped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: How would you describe the camp that you were in in Villerbon?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: There were some barracks, and we were not mistreated - absolutely.</span> <span id="s307">There was a French lieutenant.</span> <span id="s308">He was a commandant.</span> <span id="s309">The only thing was, the food was absolutely lousy, what they gave.</span> <span id="s310">Now the people which did have money, and some of the Jewish people at the time, they had quite a bit, and they were able to buy in the stores.</span> <span id="s311">There was no shortage then!</span> <span id="s312">Because the Nazis had not defeated France yet, so the stores nearby the camp were quite well-stocked.</span> <span id="s313">But the people which did not have money, they were suffering malnutrition.</span> <span id="s314">And we didn’t do anything - just linger around.</span> <span id="s315">We didn’t have to work or anything.</span> <span id="s316">That was all.</span> <span id="s317">And there we were in the camp, and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s318">Everybody was talking about the drole de guerre.</span> <span id="s319">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Yes, but I don’t know if the tape-recorder does.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Drole de guerre was the “funny war” - that nothing happened.</span> <span id="s322">And the French were in the Maginot Line, and the Germans were in the Siegfried Line, and we made fun of it until the fun wasn’t there anymore, when the Germans decided to attack in earnest, when they felt it was the right time.</span> <span id="s323">Then France was overrun, I think, in about six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And this was while you were in the camp?</span> <span id="s325">At Villerbon?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s327">But, when I was in the camp, I heard the cannons coming closer and closer everyday, and I took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Oh, so you left the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s330">I escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did your camp have a name?</span> <span id="s332">What was the camp called?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Was it built specifically for this purpose, to house refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s336">They built some shacks, and then later on the refugees built other houses themselves, to be better conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Were there any restrictions on you in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: The restrictions were that you had to have permission to leave, but it was not enforced, really.</span> <span id="s339">If somebody wanted to go to the grocery store, he didn’t even have to ask to get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Is there anything more that you’d like to say about that period in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I don’t think so, because not much happened except the daily rumors and gossips and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s342">And waiting.</span> <span id="s343">Hoping that the French would defeat the Germans and we would go back to Germany as we used to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And then how did you decide to leave the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well, when I heard the cannons coming closer and closer, and the news came that the French were running, so I thought I’d better run with them!</span> <span id="s346">Before being caught!</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How did you manage to escape?</span> <span id="s348">What did you have to do to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Just cross a little river.</span> <span id="s350">The guards didn’t look that close.</span> <span id="s351">Of course, there were guards.</span> <span id="s352">But there was a chance to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: So where did you go?</span> <span id="s354">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, from one village to the other.</span> <span id="s356">Sometimes caught a ride from a Frenchman by hitchhiking.</span> <span id="s357">And sleeping in the farmers’ houses, in the barnyards, and so on, until I came to Montpelier.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How long were you traveling, would you say, until you came to Montpelier?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Maybe a week: Every town or city in France had a small representative of a Jewish committee where the refugees were helped.</span> <span id="s360">Usually for one or two days they were supported from that place.</span> <span id="s361">And in Montpelier I met my future wife - at the Jewish committee there.</span> <span id="s362">She was a refugee.</span> <span id="s363">She was born in Poland, and she was a refugee from Belgium.</span> <span id="s364">She is a dentist, graduated from the University of Brussels, and she practiced in Belgium and when the Germans came, she went with the refugees to France, and we met at this committee in Montpelier.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Levy.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Susan.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So she was practicing dentistry then?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: In Belgium, yes.</span> <span id="s371">She worked for a Belgian dentist, but she has her diploma from the University of Brussels, from the dental school.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What happened when you arrived in Montpelier then?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: In Montpelier we liked each other.</span> <span id="s374">That’s what happened, and we went together to Beziers.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Would you say that up until this time, would you say you were being hidden at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span> <span id="s377">There was no reason to hide by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Just being offered places to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s380">And so from Blois we went to Montpelier in order to escape the advancing Germans.</span> <span id="s381">Germany and Italy were Allies during the war, and when France was defeated, Germany occupied the northern part of France and Italy the southern part, and so because we felt more secure to be among the Italian occupation forces, that’s why we went to Montpelier.</span> <span id="s382">It was occupied by the Italians then.</span> <span id="s383">This was the reason.</span> <span id="s384">From there we went to Beziers.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Was Beziers a city or a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: A city near Montpelier - a city of about 150,000 inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: And what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: You couldn’t do anything but just living there - somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: How did you manage to live there?</span> <span id="s390">Did people take care of you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Again there were small Jewish committees like Montpelier was.</span> <span id="s392">We had a small apartment there, and we got married on the 18th of January, 1941, in Beziers.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How long would you say you had know each other at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Not very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: What was your wedding like?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: That’s a terrific question.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Will you tell me about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s399">Well, we didn’t have anybody - just the two of us and the old couple where we had the apartment.</span> <span id="s400">They were our witnesses.</span> <span id="s401">We didn’t have absolutely nothing, nothing to eat for a wedding, so for pity, the French butcher sold us one steak.</span> <span id="s402">And this was the wedding dinner and nothing else.</span> <span id="s403">There was no celebration, no nothing.</span> <span id="s404">This was the wedding day.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Who married you?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: The City Hall.</span> <span id="s407">Legally married in City Hall in Beziers the 18th of January, 1941 - that’s all documented.</span> <span id="s408">But there wasn’t even by then a Jewish synagogue or anything, not as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you stay in Beziers?</span> <span id="s410">For how long would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: We stayed in Beziers to October, 1942.</span> <span id="s412">And our son was born in October, 1942.</span> <span id="s413">When he was just out of the clinic, about a week old, the alliance between Germany and Italy broke down, and the Germans occupied the entire country.</span> <span id="s414">With a week-old baby, we decided to get away from the Germans, to get into the mountains.</span> <span id="s415">That’s when we went to Grenoble.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: So keep telling me what happened, if you will.</span> <span id="s417">How did you travel to Grenoble?</span> <span id="s418">Was it a long distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A; No.</span> <span id="s420">By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Were there others also on the train who were escaping to the mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Were there mostly Jews, would you say, escaping at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">Nobody wanted to stay where the Germans were.</span> <span id="s426">Now in Beziers, many times the French authorities got the order from the Vichy government.</span> <span id="s427">In the Vichy government there were collaborators of the Germans, and they were told to assemble so-and-so-many Jewish people and send them - they said - to “work camps.”</span> <span id="s428">They didn’t tell the truth what it was about.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Were they sending them out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s431">They sent them to Poland - to the extermination camps, but nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s432">And we escaped it.</span> <span id="s433">We were not caught.</span> <span id="s434">At the time there was an exclusion that the pregnant women - the couples and the children - would not be deported.</span> <span id="s435">So that’s the way we escaped one time.</span> <span id="s436">And there was another time I just happened to know one of the policemen which were to arrest the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s437">I happened to know him a little bit.</span> <span id="s438">He said, “Don’t sleep this night.</span> <span id="s439">Don’t sleep in your house.”</span> <span id="s440">This was the second time.</span> <span id="s441">So we escaped twice in Beziers of deportation.</span> <span id="s442">Then when the Germans advanced, and a few days before they arrived you know already by the news and by everything that they would occupy Montpelier and Beziers - and so we went to Grenoble to be a little away.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And what happened to you when you arrived in Grenoble?</span> <span id="s444">How did you survive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Like anyplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Were there also Jewish committees there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, everywhere.</span> <span id="s448">They were set up in every larger town.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: How long did you stay in Grenoble?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I don’t recall exactly.</span> <span id="s451">We stayed in Grenoble, and then the Germans occupied Grenoble, because they occupied the entire country.</span> <span id="s452">When my brother, who was also in Grenoble at the time, was arrested and deported, we went to the Vercors.</span> <span id="s453">This is a mountain range nearby Grenoble.</span> <span id="s454">There we met a Catholic priest, Father Borelli is his name, and there was a convent, and there were the nuns - Catholic nuns - and my wife and the kid, they went to Catholic church in order to say we are not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So at this point you were really in hiding then.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: We were hiding from Grenoble.</span> <span id="s457">The place is Notre Dame de L’Osier it’s called.</span> <span id="s458">That’s where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Was this a small...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Very small.</span> <span id="s461">Just a few inhabitants.</span> <span id="s462">But there was this convent, and there was Father Borelli, and he did quite terrific work for all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Were you actually staying in the convent, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, not in the convent.</span> <span id="s465">In the farmer’s house, but Father Borelli knew his people.</span> <span id="s466">He knew the people - we didn’t have to ear that they would be collaborators of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So did he find the farmer’s house for you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s469">And from Notre Dame de L’Osier - we were staying there and my wife, one day she had a premonition or something.</span> <span id="s470">She said, “It‘s too dangerous.</span> <span id="s471">We have to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s472">So we talked to Father Borelli, and he sent us to another little village, but I don’t recall the name anymore, of the other farmer’s house.</span> <span id="s473">And so we changed villages all the time, because we were just near the Vercors where those many people have been massacred at Oradour sur Glane in reprisals of the Germans, because the resistance movement blew up bridges and killed people in the convoys.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And this was near where you were staying then?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh yes, absolutely close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So French Resistance members were massacred there?</span> <span id="s477">Is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: At Oradour sur Glane, yes.</span> <span id="s479">The entire population of the village - completely wiped out!</span> <span id="s480">Just in reprisals for the great Resistance movement they had done to the Germans.</span> <span id="s481">I still absolutely don’t know how we ever escaped, that today we are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did you live out the war in hiding then?</span> <span id="s483">From then on?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s485">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: All in that area?</span> <span id="s487">In villages in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: All in that area.</span> <span id="s489">We had a big map.</span> <span id="s490">And through the British Broadcasting Company, they told us what was going on - the radio.</span> <span id="s491">Almost every day we crossed off another city in Russia that was liberated from the Germans when the Germans had to go back in wartime.</span> <span id="s492">It was just a celebration every day, but still, I don’t know how we ever escaped.</span> <span id="s493">And once when we were in the farmhouse, the French gendarmes came with about ten guys with the shotguns (laughs), and I asked, “What’s going on?”</span> <span id="s494">They said, “Here you...” - we had false papers then, under a French name.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Do you remember what the name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Curtin.</span> <span id="s497">Because my first name is Kurt, we made it Curtin.</span> <span id="s498">Born in Alsace.</span> <span id="s499">Now the French authorities, they inquired in Alsace whether there is a Curtin by this name.</span> <span id="s500">There wasn’t.</span> <span id="s501">So they came, those gendarmes, to arrest us.</span> <span id="s502">The but captain of the gendarmerie was a Resistance fighter, and when he asked us, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s503">, we told him, and he said, “Let them go.”</span> <span id="s504">They took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Where was this?</span> <span id="s506">Do you remember where this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, I don’t recall the name of the village where this was.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: This is in one of those five houses that Father Borelli helped you to find?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s510">But this Resistance fighter later on was caught by the Nazis and he was killed by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Do you by chance remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: This all happened about forty years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: You have a wonderful memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, not the way I really would like to - the names and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Well, his acts will be remembered on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s517">And so it went and finally there came the liberation.</span> <span id="s518">The worst part of this, we have not been in death camps or anything, but we lived under the terrible threat, day after day, from one day to the other, and we heard that as the news came through, that many of our friends, and my wife’s brother, and my brother, were arrested and deported.</span> <span id="s519">And so that is a rough thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: How did you hear about their arrests?</span> <span id="s521">Were you with them when they were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, we were not there.</span> <span id="s523">When I visited my brother, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s524">The people where he lived, they told me that he was arrested.</span> <span id="s525">and I am not even sure whether the people where he lived, if they did not denounce him to the Germans.</span> <span id="s526">And my wife’s brother, he was also in a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s527">He was arrested there and we got the news from the people, too, that he was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Can you remember more details about what life was like for you in hiding?</span> <span id="s529">Where did you sleep at night?</span> <span id="s530">Did you have enough to eat?</span> <span id="s531">Did you worry about noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: We were worried all the time.</span> <span id="s533">there was not a minute.</span> <span id="s534">But we had, to eat, because the farmers there had something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: The farmers really helped you in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well, mostly Father Borelli.</span> <span id="s537">He helped.</span> <span id="s538">Because, as you know, these people, they are so Catholic there, what the priest says, that mostly goes, if he says, “You have to do this.”</span> <span id="s539">We had rather very good experiences with the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s540">They really helped us.</span> <span id="s541">But many people say that, of course, there were traitors among the French.</span> <span id="s542">Quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: In the Resistance you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Not in the Resistance, no.</span> <span id="s545">But others, yah.</span> <span id="s546">We don’t talk very often about the experiences, my wife and myself, but when we talk about it, then we still ask ourselves, how come that we are alive?</span> <span id="s547">How did we escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Do you have some opinion about that?</span> <span id="s549">Have you come up with an answer for yourself about why you escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No.</span> <span id="s551">If I would be a religious man, I would say God has protected us.</span> <span id="s552">But since I am not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s553">(Laughs) So I will be very frank about it.</span> <span id="s554">I consider myself as a good Jew, but not as a really believer.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Will you describe where you were when you were liberated, and how you received that news, and what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: The news came already that France was invaded in Normandy, but the battle wasn’t finished yet.</span> <span id="s557">We got news through the radio every day what was going on.</span> <span id="s558">Finally all the cities in France had been liberated, and the day of the liberation, I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s559">This was a jubilation.</span> <span id="s560">Ahhh!</span> <span id="s561">One cannot imagine what was going on in this small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: The date is known.</span> <span id="s564">I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: So this was the day of the liberation of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yes, but entire France was not liberated!</span> <span id="s567">We were in the southern part of France.</span> <span id="s568">paris, for instance, has been liberated a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What happened when you heard of the liberation on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Oh, people kissed complete strangers they had never seen.</span> <span id="s571">It was just a jubilation.</span> <span id="s572">the feeling is impossible for somebody who hasn’t lived through that, that finally we were liberated at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: How old was your son at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, he was born in 192; the liberation was in 1945 - three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So, you were really in hiding for the first three years of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">a: Claude.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q What happened to you after the liberation then?</span> <span id="s580">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: After the liberation, I went back to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And what did you find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I found that I couldn’t get a work permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you intend to stay in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: We intended to stay in France and in Paris, because we liked Paris and was kind of familiar with the city after we had been there some years, but without a work permit, we just couldn’t make a living.</span> <span id="s586">So then I decided, well, I don’t like the Nazis, I don’t like the Germans, but maybe I could eventually take over my business again which I’d left in Germany, and we went back home.</span> <span id="s587">Oh!</span> <span id="s588">In 1945, right after the war, our daughter was born, but she was born in Paris after the liberation.</span> <span id="s589">With both kids we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s590">I tried to have the business going again, but when I saw how the Germans were, that in reality they had not changed a bit.</span> <span id="s591">We were hoping it would have improved!</span> <span id="s592">But then we had a chance to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s593">And here we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: You spent, what, about five years then in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: When you say the Germans were not really changed, how do you mean?</span> <span id="s599">Did you feel anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No, not anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s601">But most of the people just didn’t feel that they had done anything wrong - by their saying that they were forced into it.</span> <span id="s602">Nobody was an anti-Semite, nobody was a Nazi then.</span> <span id="s603">they were just forced into this.</span> <span id="s604">And so then we came to this country, and were naturalized citizens in 1957 here.</span> <span id="s605">I was fortunate enough to find a job with the electric company, and so I stayed with them for over twenty years until I had to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Ten years ago, at the age of 65.</span> <span id="s608">Now I’m 75.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Is there more that you would like to say about your whole history of the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yeah, I would like to say this: Never again something will happen.</span> <span id="s611">I hope the Jewish people have learned from this, that if we would have had during the Holocaust a State of Israel then, I don’t think - I don’t say it categorically that it could never happen - but not that many people would have been murdered.</span> <span id="s612">And that’s why it is so dear to my heart, the State of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did you ever consider living in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, not me personally, but I wouldn’t mind at all if my daughter would like.</span> <span id="s615">I would like to encourage her, and there are three big guys that are six-feet-and-some tall, and I think the State of Israel could use them.</span> <span id="s616">There are four beautiful granddaughters., She said in a couple of years she would like to go, maybe to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So maybe you’ll get to see it and to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Is there more that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A No, could you think of something?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Not right this moment I can’t other than to thank you very much for this chance to get to know something about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I forgot to mention why we were in Beziers.</span> <span id="s623">I have been in a French camp near Beziers, in the village of Agde.</span> <span id="s624">I don’t recall exactly how long I have been in this camp.</span> <span id="s625">We were not mistreated by the French authorities, only again the same thing, it was the French themselves, they didn’t have anything to eat, and the conditions in the camp concerning nourishment were just awful.</span> <span id="s626">The Germans confiscated everything and sent it to Germany.</span> <span id="s627">So as the French suffered and the people in the camps - they suffered even more under this.</span> <span id="s628">Otherwise it is not very nice to be in a camp.</span> <span id="s629">You sleep practically under awful conditions, but no mistreatment.</span> <span id="s630">And there again there was one loophole.</span> <span id="s631">We were told people which wanted to work in the agriculture, from the people in the camp, they could be released.</span> <span id="s632">We had French friends, and they had a small piece of land.</span> <span id="s633">He wrote out a certificate that I would work for him.</span> <span id="s634">So I got out of the camp in Agde, and we could live together in Beziers.</span></p></body></html>
