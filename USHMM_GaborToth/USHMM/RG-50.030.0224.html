<span id="s358">When he comes back I am gonna have another.</span> <span id="s359">And then he gonna come in in the house and he say, "Toby, where is the other baby?"</span> <span id="s360">What I'm gonna tell him?</span> <span id="s361">I was...I was crying, but I didn't know he will never come back again.</span> <span id="s362">(Crying) Then in...in February I heard after...after the liberation he was killed with 35,000 people.</span> <span id="s363">But I didn't know.</span> <span id="s364">A lot of people get letters.</span> <span id="s365">You know, they was missing.</span> <span id="s366">a lot of people get letters, you know, he's there.</span> <span id="s367">But I didn't get anything, but I never believed he's not alive.</span> <span id="s368">So I waited every day I should get something.</span> <span id="s369">But it never came.</span> <span id="s370">And then it...we came already to 1944.</span> <span id="s371">It was holidays.</span> <span id="s372">It was...and then in April...it was on a Friday, we cooked a Saturday you know, the meal...everybody.</span> <span id="s373">And my child was very sick.</span> <span id="s374">He had fevers.</span> <span id="s375">He had very high fever.</span> <span id="s376">And soldiers came in the house and they said, "10 minutes I give you.</span> <span id="s377">Pack everything.</span> <span id="s378">You have to go to the synagogue."</span> <span id="s379">So I begged the soldiers that look, my child is so sick.</span> <span id="s380">Please leave me here.</span> <span id="s381">We knew already they're going to take us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s382">So he took...he hit me, and he called me some names.</span> <span id="s383">He said you couldn't stay here.</span> <span id="s384">You have to go.</span> <span id="s385">He doesn't care the baby is sick.</span> <span id="s386">So I didn't have nothing what to do, so I took some stuff and we packed everything in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s387">The meal was on the stove.</span> <span id="s388">We went away.</span> <span id="s389">Over Saturday, we was there in the shul and Sunday they....or Saturday, they took us with a..</span> <span id="s390">.</span> <span id="s391">we didn't have cars...horse and carriages.</span> <span id="s392">And every family, they packed, and they took us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s393">So we came in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s394">It was in a room maybe 30, 50, 20 people, but Thank God, we had the family.</span> <span id="s395">We had my grandmother, my aunt, my children.</span> <span id="s396">We weren't with strangers.</span> <span id="s397">But we didn't...we sat in the floor.</span> <span id="s398">Food we didn't have.</span> <span id="s399">We couldn't take any food.</span> <span id="s400">And I had, you know, then my child and my aunt had nine children.</span> <span id="s401">My grandmother was old already, and we had to sit on the floor, to sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s402">It was about 4 weeks like that.</span> <span id="s403">I went out everyday to old people.</span> <span id="s404">I washed them.</span> <span id="s405">I cut them the nails.</span> <span id="s406">I cut them the hair.</span> <span id="s407">I cleaned them up.</span> <span id="s408">And, you know, they begged me...please, we couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s409">We didn't have what to do, so I went every single day.</span> <span id="s410">And I did it.</span> <span id="s411">When I was a young girl...I forget to tell you...in home every week, it wasn't too many rich people by us, so I went every week to take...like to beg for other people, not for me...where we had for ourselves enough.</span> <span id="s412">But we was on the first categories, like we weren't so poor.</span> <span id="s413">So everybody came and said, "Toby, you could go to take...they're not going to take it, take it for yourself, but other people, they need it and the children are...you know, they are embarrassed to go to beg.</span> <span id="s414">So I went every single week, you know, in the house.</span> <span id="s415">They didn't have no money.</span> <span id="s416">They give a little potatoes, a little beans, a little flour, you know, until some...one house to houses, we made something and we...they gave this to the poor, you know, that they should have for the...and there was a lot of sick people.</span> <span id="s417">Every night there was a young children, I used to go to be I used to be compression.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Compress.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Compress, you know, for sick, typhus people.</span> <span id="s420">I didn't care I'm gonna get sick or not.</span> <span id="s421">I never slept in my house.</span> <span id="s422">There was a lot of old people.</span> <span id="s423">Everybody came.</span> <span id="s424">My mother was a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s425">They said, "Give me Toby for the night."</span> <span id="s426">They were afraid to sleep by theirself.</span> <span id="s427">Every single night...I don't know, my mother, she let me go from one house to...whoever wanted, she...she wanted to please the people and I went.</span> <span id="s428">It wasn't such a clean houses, but I..</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">I still went and I didn't complain.</span> <span id="s431">I did a lot for people.</span> <span id="s432">I wanted to help, and I did it and I very happy I could do it.</span> <span id="s433">And I'm gonna go back from the Auschwitz, you know, from the...from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s434">So my child was then 3 and a half years old.</span> <span id="s435">He used to play with my brother the the chess.</span> <span id="s436">A..</span> <span id="s437">.</span> <span id="s438">a chess...you know, he was so smart, he was...you couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s439">And my brother was there.</span> <span id="s440">Then we had friends.</span> <span id="s441">They came.</span> <span id="s442">One friend I had, he asked me, "Toby, what did you do with your jewelry?"</span> <span id="s443">I had a lot of jewelry.</span> <span id="s444">So I said, "Before we came to the ghetto, I hide this.</span> <span id="s445">I make a package.</span> <span id="s446">I had my mother's jewelry and my jewelry and I..</span> <span id="s447">.</span> <span id="s448">I put away...not I knew where it is, that nobody can find it.</span> <span id="s449">So he said, "Toby, you have a child.</span> <span id="s450">Go back.</span> <span id="s451">I go with you.</span> <span id="s452">Take your jewelry.</span> <span id="s453">For a ring, for a earring, you could buy a bread.</span> <span id="s454">You could buy milk.</span> <span id="s455">You...you'll be able to survive."</span> <span id="s456">So we went out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s457">When they catch us, they would...uh...shoot us.</span> <span id="s458">But we went away four people.</span> <span id="s459">I took my jewelry, and I was very happy I brought it to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s460">Then we hear the people, before they go to the trains, they take away everything.</span> <span id="s461">So I said, "What I'm gonna give them the gold, my jewelry?"</span> <span id="s462">So there was a girl.</span> <span id="s463">She was a friend with my brother.</span> <span id="s464">She was very rich.</span> <span id="s465">Her father has a big store.</span> <span id="s466">And this house near them was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s467">So the girl told my brother, "You have...I know you have the jewelry."</span> <span id="s468">He told her, you know, I have my jewelry here.</span> <span id="s469">She said, "GIve it to me."</span> <span id="s470">They have a hiding place in the basement and she hides her things and she's gonna hide our things and when we come back, we gonna have it.</span> <span id="s471">So she begged my brother.</span> <span id="s472">He said, "Booda, please come see where I put it.</span> <span id="s473">Nobody knows whose gonna come back.</span> <span id="s474">So my brother thought, you know, maybe nobody's gonna take it, they're gonna think he took it.</span> <span id="s475">So he didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s476">So I met her in Auschwitz, that girl, and I begged her.</span> <span id="s477">I said, "Please, tell me where did you put the jewelry."</span> <span id="s478">She said, "I'm not gonna tell you."</span> <span id="s479">And she never survived.</span> <span id="s480">We came back, me and my brother.</span> <span id="s481">We went through the whole cellar.</span> <span id="s482">We couldn't find it.</span> <span id="s483">And we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s484">So when I came home...so then in one day...and 4 weeks after they took us to the trains.</span> <span id="s485">So they packed us, about 120 people, old people, young people, no water.</span> <span id="s486">They gave us a little water.</span> <span id="s487">We went about 4.</span> <span id="s488">3 days...3, 4 days...5 days, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s489">I had my child.</span> <span id="s490">Old, old people.</span> <span id="s491">We didn't have a toilet.</span> <span id="s492">It was in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s493">People were dying.</span> <span id="s494">People were screaming.</span> <span id="s495">It was smelling.</span> <span id="s496">You could die.</span> <span id="s497">You know, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s498">We begged a little waters from the SS.</span> <span id="s499">Nobody was hearing us.</span> <span id="s500">Nothing.</span> <span id="s501">So we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s502">We came down from this...we were so happy they opened the...the cars.</span> <span id="s503">We came down.</span> <span id="s504">They start to hit us.</span> <span id="s505">Go there, Go there, Go there, Go there.</span> <span id="s506">Everybody wanted to be with their families we should lose each each.</span> <span id="s507">We should be together.</span> <span id="s508">So I..</span> <span id="s509">.</span> <span id="s510">I had my child.</span> <span id="s511">I was young.</span> <span id="s512">I was really beautiful.</span> <span id="s513">And a man then went this side to me.</span> <span id="s514">He said, "Give away the child for a older lady."</span> <span id="s515">So I asked him why.</span> <span id="s516">I told my brother, "Booda, Go and ask why should I give away the baby."</span> <span id="s517">He...he start to look.</span> <span id="s518">He disappeared.</span> <span id="s519">You thought he went into the earth.</span> <span id="s520">You didn't see him.</span> <span id="s521">Then a second...uh...guy came.</span> <span id="s522">And he said, "Give away the baby."</span> <span id="s523">And it was almost by Mengele.</span> <span id="s524">It wasn't too far there.</span> <span id="s525">My...I used to live with my mother, so I give the baby to my...to my mother.</span> <span id="s526">And I hear right now (crying) how he cried, "Mommy, I want to go with you.</span> <span id="s527">I want to stay with Mommy."</span> <span id="s528">So I was by Mengele, and he told he I should go this side.</span> <span id="s529">My mother with my child the other side.</span> <span id="s530">When I heard him, and I hear him today.</span> <span id="s531">I hear him every single day, "Mommy, I want to go with you.</span> <span id="s532">I don't want to stay with Bobby."</span> <span id="s533">(Crying) I wanted to ran after them.</span> <span id="s534">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s535">I never saw them.</span> <span id="s536">(Crying) Then they came with the people, with the young people.</span> <span id="s537">I had there cousins.</span> <span id="s538">I was crying.</span> <span id="s539">I wanted to go with my child.</span> <span id="s540">So they said, "Why're you crying.</span> <span id="s541">Some day, you're gonna be with him."</span> <span id="s542">They told us we gonna to work, and all the people with children and they go...you know, they're going to mind the children, and we're gonna come every Sunday to see them.</span> <span id="s543">(Crying) But that Sunday never came.</span> <span id="s544">And, you know, that...then we went to...to the C lagers.</span> <span id="s545">I was there 3 months.</span> <span id="s546">And we waited to see the children.</span> <span id="s547">We waited to see the children.</span> <span id="s548">They gave us the food.</span> <span id="s549">They gave us a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s550">I didn't want to eat it.</span> <span id="s551">I said, "With this little bread, I am not going to be satisfied."</span> <span id="s552">So every single day I put my bread and I kept it.</span> <span id="s553">In the night the people took it away from me.</span> <span id="s554">I had there a cousin, and I tell she wouldn't survive.</span> <span id="s555">And she saw I am not going to eat.</span> <span id="s556">I used to cry, and she said, "You know, Toby, I would like we should be together.</span> <span id="s557">You get the bread.</span> <span id="s558">You eat it.</span> <span id="s559">I get mine.</span> <span id="s560">We gonna...we're gonna share.</span> <span id="s561">She saw that I am gonna die.</span> <span id="s562">So every...so...first of all I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s563">Then I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s564">Then every day, the SS came and they asked, "Who is sick?</span> <span id="s565">Who is pregnant?</span> <span id="s566">They should...uh...present to them.</span> <span id="s567">They gonna take us revere.</span> <span id="s568">They're gonna give us better food.</span> <span id="s569">You know, so I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s570">I said, "I'm gonna say I'm pregnant."</span> <span id="s571">I wasn't, but I wanted to go to see my baby.</span> <span id="s572">I didn't know how I could go out from the C lager.</span> <span id="s573">So my brother, "Toby, you're not gonna go.</span> <span id="s574">You're not gonna leave me.</span> <span id="s575">I don't know who lives.</span> <span id="s576">I want you with me."</span> <span id="s577">So I wanted another day.</span> <span id="s578">But I am gonna go to see my child.</span> <span id="s579">And I was 3 months in C lager.</span> <span id="s580">The next lager was B.</span> <span id="s581">There was a family camp with the Czech...Czechoslovakia people...families, husbands, wife and children.</span> <span id="s582">So they said, "You see, our children live.</span> <span id="s583">You have here next lagers, you know, families, so all the people with the children are in a different lager, so we're gonna see them.</span> <span id="s584">Three months after we were there and one night we hear screams and was crying and they never let us out from the...from the...when it was a transport came in.</span> <span id="s585">We were outside.</span> <span id="s586">They told us to go in...in the barracks.</span> <span id="s587">When the people came...when they selected the people to go to the crematorium, they didn't want we should see.</span> <span id="s588">We saw the fires.</span> <span id="s589">You know, we saw the flames until the sky.</span> <span id="s590">We smelled the...the...the meat...what they burned in the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s591">We weren't too far from there.</span> <span id="s592">So we didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s593">So they said, the people die...old people die.</span> <span id="s594">You know, we don't...we don't want to make graves.</span> <span id="s595">We burned the people but...uh...people, you know, alive.</span> <span id="s596">.</span> <span id="s597">children, they're not gonna do that.</span> <span id="s598">So one day I..</span> <span id="s599">.</span> <span id="s600">I met a friend.</span> <span id="s601">I was too...I was very...I was crying.</span> <span id="s602">I wanted my baby.</span> <span id="s603">I was missing him very much.</span> <span id="s604">I wanted my mother.</span> <span id="s605">So she said, "Toby, I heard..." You know, she had seven children.</span> <span id="s606">"Don't cry.</span> <span id="s607">They give them white bread.</span> <span id="s608">They gave them milk.</span> <span id="s609">They gave them chicken soup.</span> <span id="s610">They give them chicken.</span> <span id="s611">They are wonderful the children."</span> <span id="s612">So she had seven children there.</span> <span id="s613">She's...so I said, "Maybe, you know."</span> <span id="s614">We wanted they should live.</span> <span id="s615">We didn't think they don't live anymore.</span> <span id="s616">For 6 months we didn't know what to think.</span> <span id="s617">We saw.</span> <span id="s618">We heard.</span> <span id="s619">We knew everything, but we didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s620">We didn't want to take it in our heads.</span> <span id="s621">You know, people for what?</span> <span id="s622">What did they do the children?</span> <span id="s623">What do the older people?</span> <span id="s624">Why they should kill people they didn't do any...any harm?</span> <span id="s625">So after the 3 months when I was in the...the C lager.</span> <span id="s626">So the next day when they took out the Czech...the Czech people, the families.</span> <span id="s627">They took them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s628">Nobody...one was alive.</span> <span id="s629">So they took us to the baths in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s630">They selected us you know, and we went there to work.</span> <span id="s631">And 2 or 3 months we didn't do a thing.</span> <span id="s632">We went...when we went to the crematorium, so we said...we looked in the back and said, "What...what you think we're gonna come back that way?</span> <span id="s633">Or we gonna stay there?"</span> <span id="s634">When we came in in the back, the first time when we came, the first time when we came to the crematorium...so when we went in there to the...to the baths what they said we have to be clean.</span> <span id="s635">We shouldn't make very...the lagers and then we saw the band there.</span> <span id="s636">It was playing Albeit Macht Frei.</span> <span id="s637">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s638">It was clean you know.</span> <span id="s639">So we went in there.</span> <span id="s640">It was soldiers.</span> <span id="s641">So they told...they told us we should take off our clothes.</span> <span id="s642">So how could you take off clothes when men are there?</span> <span id="s643">So we went...you know, we...we didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s644">So they start to hit us.</span> <span id="s645">And we didn't have any choice, and we did it.</span> <span id="s646">So the first time when I went in the crematorium I didn't see and I didn't know what's going on, but when we came back I saw already they had them...the knobs.</span> <span id="s647">One was for gas.</span> <span id="s648">One was for water.</span> <span id="s649">It was the same room.</span> <span id="s650">(Crying) Excuse me It was the same room, you know, where they kill the people, and we were in there 2 days.</span> <span id="s651">So for us they gave the water.</span> <span id="s652">And we came back.</span> <span id="s653">We came to the same lager and then they selected us to go to work.</span> <span id="s654">A lot of people went to, you know to the dresses...not to dresses...to all things we were fixing there.</span> <span id="s655">People went commando.</span> <span id="s656">People went trade...to make grey...you know, like...uh...to hide people, you know, bunkers...built, you know, and it was cold in the winter.</span> <span id="s657">We didn't...we didn't have any clothes and we didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s658">They gave us shoes like from...uh...wood.</span> <span id="s659">You couldn't bend the feet.</span> <span id="s660">It was just a hole and you just...and you know when you put in the feet, the skin went up in them.</span> <span id="s661">The blood was running, but who cared.</span> <span id="s662">A lot of people they didn't...we didn't think we gonna survive.</span> <span id="s663">I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s664">I wanted to see my baby.</span> <span id="s665">I wanted to see my husband.</span> <span id="s666">And I tried.</span> <span id="s667">One day it was.</span> <span id="s668">We had friends, you know.</span> <span id="s669">We was religious.</span> <span id="s670">Not all of us, but a few girls was fasting.</span> <span id="s671">We didn't eat on that day.</span> <span id="s672">But one girl found a..</span> <span id="s673">.</span> <span id="s674">a handkerchief, and she washed this.</span> <span id="s675">And she...she went, you know, there was the electric...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: The fence there.</span> <span id="s678">After this was like this, another fence, you know, just a wire.</span> <span id="s679">You're not allowed to go the other side.</span> <span id="s680">So this wire she put on the top, you know, the handkerchief, it should dry.</span> <span id="s681">And I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s682">A wind came and the handkerchief flew off.</span> <span id="s683">She went to pick up the handkerchief and she was black like she was electrics...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Electrocuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Electrocuted.</span> <span id="s686">In...in the spot there.</span> <span id="s687">A lot...a lot of times I wanted to do that.</span> <span id="s688">I said what I have to, you know, but I thought maybe...I..</span> <span id="s689">.</span> <span id="s690">I didn't want nobody should have my husband.</span> <span id="s691">I said I am not going to give nobody, you know, he should take away my husband.</span> <span id="s692">I want to survive and I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s693">So we went every 4 weeks when we were in the, you know, by work to take baths.</span> <span id="s694">And...and you know they put us in.</span> <span id="s695">We didn't have clothes enough.</span> <span id="s696">And Hungarians, the last day they didn't have material enough.</span> <span id="s697">So they made papers and I don't know with paper...with some things, they made materials.</span> <span id="s698">And they put the materials in the machines to the dis...disinfect them.</span> <span id="s699">You know, they shouldn't be lice or something, and the clothes didn't come out.</span> <span id="s700">So a lot of people had clothes.</span> <span id="s701">And they came to me.</span> <span id="s702">I didn't have...I came home naked like my mother had me when I was born.</span> <span id="s703">I was 2 weeks without.</span> <span id="s704">I went out in a blanket.</span> <span id="s705">I took a blanket, you know.</span> <span id="s706">From where I got a dress after, I don't remember, but I got one.</span> <span id="s707">Maybe it was in the.</span> <span id="s708">I don't know who gave me and I had.</span> <span id="s709">Then people didn't have what to wear.</span> <span id="s710">They came also who doesn't have dresses, we're gonna give you new dresses.</span> <span id="s711">They took them out, and they never came back.</span> <span id="s712">They took them to the crematorium, but they didn't have room for them.</span> <span id="s713">Every 4 weeks they make selections.</span> <span id="s714">Mengele came in, and we had to strip all our clothes.</span> <span id="s715">We were naked.</span> <span id="s716">We had to pick up one hand and...uh...to...went through.</span> <span id="s717">.</span> <span id="s718">uh...Mengele to see.</span> <span id="s719">When you had anything on your body, a little pimple, you went in the left side and a lot of people went to the ride side.</span> <span id="s720">But they separated sisters.</span> <span id="s721">They separated cousins, a mother from a child.</span> <span id="s722">It was terrible when they separated the people.</span> <span id="s723">One would...you know, one was running to the mother.</span> <span id="s724">One was running to the sister.</span> <span id="s725">There was a lots of confusion there, but they didn't want, you know.</span> <span id="s726">Even they knew they go...they didn't know they go to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s727">They thought gonna take us to another place.</span> <span id="s728">And when they took away the people, they never came back.</span> <span id="s729">One day was there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s730">It was in a winter day.</span> <span id="s731">So one person was missing.</span> <span id="s732">So every half hour we went to c'est l'appell.</span> <span id="s733">Usually we made twice a day c'est l'appell, the morning and in the evening.</span> <span id="s734">And one day we saw SS.</span> <span id="s735">They came like they were crazy.</span> <span id="s736">A person was missing.</span> <span id="s737">We were 32,000 peoples in one...uh...and see was 32 barracks, a thousand people to barrack.</span> <span id="s738">You know, to a..</span> <span id="s739">.</span> <span id="s740">And every half hour they took us for c'est l'appell.</span> <span id="s741">And they went like they were crazy.</span> <span id="s742">They came and who wasn't, you know...somebody was moving or something and one day, they kneeled us.</span> <span id="s743">We had to go on the floors and they put stones under our feet and we had to keep two big heavy stones and we didn't have a move with a eye.</span> <span id="s744">When you moved, they killed you on the spot.</span> <span id="s745">They were...they were crazy.</span> <span id="s746">It was about 3 days.</span> <span id="s747">And...and what happened a girl was sick or what.</span> <span id="s748">She fall asleep for 3 days and 3 nights.</span> <span id="s749">There was some benches outside.</span> <span id="s750">She was outside sleeping nobody would know.</span> <span id="s751">And this girl was missing.</span> <span id="s752">And that's why they made this...this there.</span> <span id="s753">And one time the, you know, they count us again and everybody was there.</span> <span id="s754">It was, you know...then they said, "Who was missing?</span> <span id="s755">Who was missing?"</span> <span id="s756">And they found the girl.</span> <span id="s757">So they gave her a, you know a whole bread and a salami.</span> <span id="s758">We were so jealous you know.</span> <span id="s759">Why she get a bread and we get a little bit of bread.</span> <span id="s760">A whole salami there.</span> <span id="s761">They told her, "Eat how much you want."</span> <span id="s762">After she was finished to eat, they hang her.</span> <span id="s763">The called us all out to see how somebody runs away what happens to them.</span> <span id="s764">(Sigh) And it was 6 months after I..</span> <span id="s765">.</span> <span id="s766">we were there in Auschwitz so the mother from the seven children...So we were there in the crematorium...there in the bath.</span> <span id="s767">So there was a man.</span> <span id="s768">He was cleaning there.</span> <span id="s769">So he told me, "Toby, I go ask the man.</span> <span id="s770">You know, mothers, grandmothers to children came to take baths too."</span> <span id="s771">So I said, "You're naked.</span> <span id="s772">How could you go talk to a man."</span> <span id="s773">I was embarrassed to go.</span> <span id="s774">She said, "I have to find out.</span> <span id="s775">I want to know what's done with my children."</span> <span id="s776">So she went.</span> <span id="s777">I went to.</span> <span id="s778">I had a child.</span> <span id="s779">(Crying) So we asked him, "Tell me, when is older people come here with children to take baths."</span> <span id="s780">So they start to laugh, the men.</span> <span id="s781">They said, "You Hungarians!</span> <span id="s782">Dopes!</span> <span id="s783">You think Hitler is gonna give food for the children and after the war, you're gonna have big children.</span> <span id="s784">(Crying) The children not there the first day they came with your parent.</span> <span id="s785">So we was very upset.</span> <span id="s786">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s787">It couldn't be.</span> <span id="s788">Not with 1944.</span> <span id="s789">It's not l940.</span> <span id="s790">1940 maybe they did it, but we don't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s791">I said.</span> <span id="s792">"Don't you see the fire.</span> <span id="s793">Don't you smell the...the smell.</span> <span id="s794">What you think is there.</span> <span id="s795">This is your children.</span> <span id="s796">This is your parents.</span> <span id="s797">(Crying) So then we knew already what happened to them.</span> <span id="s798">(Crying and drinking water).</span> <span id="s799">Then we were there until January 18.</span> <span id="s800">In Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s801">I was 9 months there.</span> <span id="s802">January 18th, we get up.</span> <span id="s803">We were, you know.</span> <span id="s804">.</span> <span id="s805">terrible how we slept....14 people in one bed.</span> <span id="s806">It was like...uh...the...three layers...</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Three layers.</span> <span id="s809">But when I came I always was on top.</span> <span id="s810">I was afraid to be in the middle.</span> <span id="s811">I was afraid to be well...the people...it wasn't too strong.</span> <span id="s812">It was from wood made.</span> <span id="s813">And one night they...they used to break, and the people they was killed.</span> <span id="s814">They were...the hands broken, feets broken, you know.</span> <span id="s815">So I always...when I came, the first I was up.</span> <span id="s816">I didn't want to be in the bottom, they should kill me or hit me or what.</span> <span id="s817">(Sigh) So January 18, they asked us we should go.</span> <span id="s818">We should take a blanket.</span> <span id="s819">They give us a whole bread, and a can with meat.</span> <span id="s820">This came from America.</span> <span id="s821">And they said we gonna evacuate.</span> <span id="s822">So we start to walk.</span> <span id="s823">It was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s824">I mean the whole Auschwitz ran out there.</span> <span id="s825">The Russians they came near.</span> <span id="s826">They didn't want they should capture us.</span> <span id="s827">So they took us further in away from them.</span> <span id="s828">So I always...I wasn't...uh...I couldn't say I was sick you know.</span> <span id="s829">I always was from the first to the fifth row.</span> <span id="s830">Cause when you walk you are in the back, you could never hold with the people.</span> <span id="s831">But in the front how much you walk the other people has to walk.</span> <span id="s832">So I..</span> <span id="s833">.</span> <span id="s834">I was between first and the fifth always, you know.</span> <span id="s835">We were walking in a few...we were walking a few days but every...I don't know how many hours you walked, they gave us a little rest.</span> <span id="s836">We should sit.</span> <span id="s837">We should rest.</span> <span id="s838">So we rest a little, and then…And when they say, you had to be up.</span> <span id="s839">If you are not, you were shot.</span> <span id="s840">They shot people like you couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s841">You know not everybody could get up.</span> <span id="s842">So we went a few days.</span> <span id="s843">We came in the night...they gave...you know, we came to a place.</span> <span id="s844">It was a very, very big place.</span> <span id="s845">It was in the winter, January.</span> <span id="s846">The snow was very high there.</span> <span id="s847">They don't clean snow like in America.</span> <span id="s848">Snow was snow after a snow after a snow.</span> <span id="s849">So they said we're gonna rest.</span> <span id="s850">We're gonna sleep.</span> <span id="s851">So they put us outside in the snow.</span> <span id="s852">We sat in the snow and we just sank.</span> <span id="s853">We sank.</span> <span id="s854">You know, the snow was soft and we didn't have the blankets.</span> <span id="s855">We threw away already.</span> <span id="s856">We couldn't carry it.</span> <span id="s857">But the bread we kept.</span> <span id="s858">The piece of meat we kept.</span> <span id="s859">You know, we should have.</span> <span id="s860">But the blanket we didn't have.</span> <span id="s861">And we was outside sleeping.</span> <span id="s862">I mean we made a circle and we went so tight each other we should feel the warmth, you know, we shouldn't... So we fall asleep.</span> <span id="s863">You're gonna be surprised.</span> <span id="s864">The SS went away and they left us the shepherds.</span> <span id="s865">Big shepherds.</span> <span id="s866">They was our, you know, our guards.</span> <span id="s867">And when you were moving, they killed you in the top...in the neck.</span> <span id="s868">You know, when somebody was...wanted to go someplace...I mean, don't not to run away...you couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s869">The shepherds would kill you.</span> <span id="s870">So the more...I don't know how we slept, but we slept.</span> <span id="s871">And in the morning, you know, who waked up...here was a piece of ice, here was a piece of ice.</span> <span id="s872">More of half people, they didn't survive.</span> <span id="s873">The heart was... They couldn't...they couldn't survive from the cold.</span> <span id="s874">So we walked about 5, 7 days and a lot of people was missing.</span> <span id="s875">We didn't take off our shoes the whole time.</span> <span id="s876">When we take off the shoes, they took it away from you.</span> <span id="s877">(Sigh) And then we thought we not gonna... We went to Ausch...Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s878">So they gave us a train.</span> <span id="s879">But a open train.</span> <span id="s880">It wasn't closed...half...like a..</span> <span id="s881">.</span> <span id="s882">you know the...for the...uh... It was open train.</span> <span id="s883">But the snow was full.</span> <span id="s884">You know until the...so they go with a 120 girls in a..</span> <span id="s885">.</span> <span id="s886">in a..</span> <span id="s887">.</span> <span id="s888">uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Car or taxi.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: In a carriage.</span> <span id="s891">So we went in there and we threw out the snow we should have room.</span> <span id="s892">We couldn't sit.</span> <span id="s893">We were standing like, you know, we couldn't move.</span> <span id="s894">120 people.</span> <span id="s895">We went for a few days.</span> <span id="s896">Eat....we didn't get too much.</span> <span id="s897">And they had soldiers.</span> <span id="s898">For every car, was 4 soldiers with the bayonets and nobody should run away.</span> <span id="s899">So we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s900">But there they didn't have room for us.</span> <span id="s901">There was...uh...uh...camp what people worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: So there was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s906">So we came and, you know, it was January and it was beautiful, fresh snow.</span> <span id="s907">And you know...and we came in there in the camp and they said we should sit out that until they gonna have room where we...they should put us.</span> <span id="s908">So we were so thirsty.</span> <span id="s909">It wasn't 10 minutes you didn't think it was winter.</span> <span id="s910">We...the snow and the earth together...we took it like sugar...the back piece of cake and it was cleaned up.</span> <span id="s911">No more snow.</span> <span id="s912">Was summer.</span> <span id="s913">We were there about 5, 6 days outside.</span> <span id="s914">No food.</span> <span id="s915">Cause you didn't have food.</span> <span id="s916">Cause we weren't counted, you know.</span> <span id="s917">We weren't in the count for the food there.</span> <span id="s918">We didn't work there.</span> <span id="s919">We didn't have where to...to stay.</span> <span id="s920">After the 5th or 6th day, they said now they're gonna take us to a barrack.</span> <span id="s921">So they...they made a tent.</span> <span id="s922">You know what's a tent.</span> <span id="s923">They made a..</span> <span id="s924">.</span> <span id="s925">just put in a tent in the floor there...with the snow...with the water, with the...whatever.</span> <span id="s926">So was no beds, nothing there.</span> <span id="s927">The people was sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s928">There were there about 500 people maybe.</span> <span id="s929">And when it came to me, with my cousin and I always want to...was with my cousin, so it's no more room to go in.</span> <span id="s930">So we were so happy.</span> <span id="s931">So we said, "Oh, the people have already..." We didn't know how it's inside.</span> <span id="s932">We were better off outside than they inside.</span> <span id="s933">So they said you have to wait until you gonna have room.</span> <span id="s934">So we went back and we were another few days outside.</span> <span id="s935">And then we came.</span> <span id="s936">They have already room.</span> <span id="s937">So it was another tent, but there was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s938">He fixes, you know, he was working there.</span> <span id="s939">And they had little carts.</span> <span id="s940">They were so...the carts was like

thing and we said, "You go with your friend, and we took her and another two Jewish people."</span> <span id="s950">We shouldn't be in with them.</span> <span id="s951">They was so rough to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: We need to break now.</span> <span id="s953">They're going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: We're

id="s962">But food they didn't give us.</span> <span id="s963">They didn't have.</span> <span id="s964">Toilets we didn't have.</span> <span id="s965">And we were five like sisters.</span> <span id="s966">Five girls, my cousin and another three girls.</span> <span id="s967">So one girl went out every time when the...the people came with the food.</span> <span id="s968">She took a..</span>

<span id="s1591">They said maybe your daughter could sleep with you until her husband comes, then they're gonna give her a different room.</span> <span id="s1592">So they put in a cot, and they had
