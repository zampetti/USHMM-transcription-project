id="s12">JL: I will be happy to give you the necessary information.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">MN: Tell me a little bit about yourself and your family background.</span> <span id="s14">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JL: I was born in Moedling.</span> <span id="s16">That’s about six miles from Vienna.</span> <span id="s17">That was our summer home.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">MN: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JL: That’s Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s20">Moedling.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MN: Um.</span> <span id="s22">Hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">JL: And, as soon as I was born, they moved back to Vienna...after a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">MN: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">JL: I was born in 1920, April...to be exact, April 17, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">JL: My family had been in the clothing business for fifteen generations back, and we owned two apartment houses and three stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">MN: In other words, you were a fairly prominent family.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">JL: A very prominent family.</span> <span id="s30">And, my Dad was also Director in Jewish Affairs in Vienna, and also, he had to do a lot with the Chevra Kaddisha.</span> <span id="s31">He made sure that Jews would be...would go on a</span></p> <p><span id="s32">MN: The Chevra Kaddisha.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JL: Yes, and he spent a lot of money for those.</span> <span id="s34">It was one of his hobbies.</span> <span id="s35">And, also, in his neighborhood, he was very...very well recognized for his philanthropic givings to the community, because we did not live in a Jewish district at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">MN: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">JL: The Jews in Vienna lived in the second district.</span> <span id="s38">And we lived in the tenth district, which was mostly...99% now Christian.</span> <span id="s39">Plus others...nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">MN: But, you said that your father was very deeply involved in Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s41">What was your connection with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JL: Well, I had to go to Temple every Friday night and, I had to go...when I was three years old, I went to the Hebrew kindergarten in Vienna, and I spoke Hebrew fairly well in my younger years.</span> <span id="s43">Of course, when I was 13, I became Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">MN: This is the ceremony that took place...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JL: ...took place all over.</span> <span id="s46">My Dad also was Vice-President in a Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MN: So, the family was very involved in Jewish activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">JL: We were very involved.</span> <span id="s49">Right.</span> <span id="s50">I had to go to Temple every Friday night and I had to go to the Temple every Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s51">Even so we had to keep our business open because Saturday was the main business day.</span> <span id="s52">And, it was a necessity for survival in our store.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">MN: Do you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">JL: I have one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">MN: And, are you older or younger, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JL: No, my sister is three years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s57">As a matter of fact, she was just here this week.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">MN: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">JL: From New York, visiting us for a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MN: As you look back on your growing up, how do you feel your experiences were as, say, compared to other children in the neighborhood, because you did not live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">JL: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s62">Well, I had two Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s63">Most of the others, mostly asked me all questions.</span> <span id="s64">Austria is famous for being very anti-Semitic over the years.</span> <span id="s65">We felt anti-Semitism even when there weren’t...I became ten years old.</span> <span id="s66">.</span> <span id="s67">when I was ten years old, a decision had been made if I am eligible to go to the Real Schule gymnasium.</span> <span id="s68">Is it familiar?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">MN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JL: Or to the regular trade school to become a carpenter, or whatever.</span> <span id="s71">And, I was always an A-1 student, so I took the test for high education, and, at the first take, I flunked out completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MN: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">JL: Nothing.</span> <span id="s74">My mother was a very good friend of the Director from high education, and she said, “That’s impossible.”</span> <span id="s75">So, I took the test over again in the Fall, and I passed 100%.</span> <span id="s76">This test.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">JL: At this time, only two Jewish students could go to class at one time a semester.</span> <span id="s79">That’s all there was to it.</span> <span id="s80">Only two.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MN: Only two.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">JL: Only two could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">MN: Out of a class of how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JL: Out of 35.</span> <span id="s85">And this was the limit.</span> <span id="s86">And, if you didn’t...you know...you just were pushed aside.</span> <span id="s87">And, even in school you could feel the anti-Semitism all the time along.</span> <span id="s88">The teachers were very mean.</span> <span id="s89">The teachers were very nasty.</span> <span id="s90">And, I found out, as soon as Hitler came in, in 1938, they all were...they belonged to the S.S. ...and they all belonged to the Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s91">In fact, I’ll never forget, as long as I live, and I was just about 12 years old, we had a chemical experience in class, and we used some sulfur, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">MN: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">JL: ...And the professor and one of the students said, “Huh, look at those Jews.</span> <span id="s94">They stink up the whole class.”</span></p> <p><span id="s95">MN: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JL: The teacher did not say, “Boo.”</span> <span id="s97">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">MN: And that was long before the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JL: That was...this was in 1932, long before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s100">And, the following year, my friend in class, the other Jewish student, the teacher asked him a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s101">He got so upset, that he threw the book...the notebook at him...at the teacher, who was a converted Jew.</span> <span id="s102">You know.</span> <span id="s103">And, that was the end of him.</span> <span id="s104">I was the only Jew in the whole class.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MN: You were the only one at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JL: You had to study.</span> <span id="s107">And, you had to study like an idiot.</span> <span id="s108">They always give you the final test, when you were Jewish, the last day, so they could see how good or how bad you were, and you really had... And it was tough.</span> <span id="s109">But, I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">MN: So, you really grew up in an atmosphere of...</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JL: ...In an atmosphere you could feel it all.</span> <span id="s112">No matter when it is.</span> <span id="s113">But, there again, when I was 14 years old, I left the Real Schule Gymnasium, and because my Dad was the Vice-President, in the clothing industry, and he wanted me to take over his business one day, I had to learn design, tailoring, quality control to run his business one day.</span> <span id="s114">Because he was a master tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">JL: They called him that.</span> <span id="s117">He was a master designer.</span> <span id="s118">We had a very successful business operation, and he wanted me to take over.</span> <span id="s119">He wanted me to be a man one day.</span> <span id="s120">Anyhow, so I had to go to the school of design, tailoring and business in Vienna for two years.</span> <span id="s121">After two years, I got my degree as an apprentice, and then I finished my apprenticeship, and, this was in 1936.</span> <span id="s122">Then, I had to go to somebody else to learn, for one year, to get my master tailoring - whatever you call it - O&gt;K&gt;</span></p> <p><span id="s123">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">JL: Then, in the meantime, at night, I went to the Matura School, which is gymnasium at night, because I want to get the Matura just the same, my graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">So, in 1938, just before I was able to get my degree, Hitler came on March 13, 1938, and that is the last I was able to go to school, because no Jew was allowed to go to school after this.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">MN: After that, after March.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JL: After March.</span> <span id="s128">Right.</span> <span id="s129">He kicked us out immediately.</span> <span id="s130">Immediately, the following day, when you walked in the street, they spat on you, because people I know for many years, they just...you know...they didn’t care who you were.</span> <span id="s131">They just pushed you around.</span> <span id="s132">And, we went...even people we used to go to the grocery store with there for so many years...with these people.</span> <span id="s133">Now they all liked us very much before Hitler came, but they were afraid to deal with Jews...with Jews because they were afraid they were going to lose their business.</span> <span id="s134">They were going to now get blackmailed.</span> <span id="s135">So, they sold us bread and milk being we had to go in the back door, you know, sneak in, before we got our food rations, finally.</span> <span id="s136">My Dad went to the barber every single day, for thirty years the same barber.</span> <span id="s137">Next day, when Hitler came, he went to get his shave, he said to him, “He doesn’t shave Jews.”</span> <span id="s138">I remember this, and, after two days, when Hitler marched in to our store came one of those business managers, and he took over our store.</span> <span id="s139">He said to my Dad, he says “As of today you get the same salary what you paid your highest paid employee.”</span> <span id="s140">So, the following day, I came to the store early in the morning, as I usually did, and he said, and the business manager said, “You come in the store one more time, and I will blow your head off.”</span> <span id="s141">And he put the gun on me.</span> <span id="s142">I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s143">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">MN: Did they allow your father to continue though?</span> <span id="s145">He continued to work, but you were no longer allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">JL: No.</span> <span id="s147">My mother couldn’t go in the store either and she worked constantly in the store, because my Dad did all the buying.</span> <span id="s148">Um, hum.</span> <span id="s149">Well, anyhow, things got pretty bad in Vienna, so one day I decided I shall go to the American Embassy and apply for visa, because we had some distant relatives in New York - Lampels, which emigrated many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s150">And, I wrote to...and I took the phone book from New York, and I wrote to fifteen Lampels, and one answered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">MN: And he was a relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JL: And, he was a distant relative, second cousin of some kind, and he said he would not be able to help at the present time because in 1929 depression, he lost all his money.</span> <span id="s153">But his cousin, Mr. Straus, is also a fifth cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s154">He is an attorney in New York and he made over 8 million dollars in the Depression and he will be able to help you and the family to get out eventually.</span> <span id="s155">O.K. Anyhow, things in Vienna got worse by the day.</span> <span id="s156">They picked me up at 2 o’clock in the morning to do some work for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MN: “They,” who is “they?”</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JL: The Nazis.</span> <span id="s159">Yeah, they came and picked me up at 2 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s160">They picked up my Dad and another time they picked my Dad up and myself to the police station, about 4 o’clock in the morning and they only wanted to sign that my Dad should give them the house and the business - write it over to them.</span> <span id="s161">Dad just refused to do it.</span> <span id="s162">They always threatened...the police always threatened they were going to beat the heck out of him.</span> <span id="s163">it was fortunate that they didn’t touch him.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">MN: These were the Austrian police?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JL: They were the Austrian police.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MN: Working in cooperation with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JL: You see, my Dad did so many things for those people, so they didn’t want to hurt him too much...too badly.</span> <span id="s168">They tried...but, with the S.S. over there, the Brown Shirts, I guess they had to follow through their orders.</span> <span id="s169">Anyhow, in August, it got so bad that my Dad got a phone call from one of the Nazis, I don’t know...from his friendly Nazis...that I have to leave within half an hour, or else they are going to pick me up to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">MN: Now, this was August, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">JL: This was August...no August 1938.</span> <span id="s172">And they also...my cousin, who was an attorney then in Vienna.</span> <span id="s173">His name was Dr. Hahn, and he was 38 years old then.</span> <span id="s174">He was a very close friend of my family and my Dad called him up and told him about it, and we both packed and left immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MN: You and your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JL: Ya.</span> <span id="s177">We left immediately, and we caught the late train to Germany.</span> <span id="s178">Of course, we had Austrian passports, which were not good at this particular time, but they were valid - put it this way.</span> <span id="s179">So, the following day, we arrived in Germany, and we tried to cross the border into Germany, but before we did so, my cousin, being an attorney, went to the judge in Frankfurt, Germany, to see if we could get German passports, because if you had German passports, you could cross into France or Switzerland very easily.</span> <span id="s180">Um, hum.</span> <span id="s181">Well, he told him, he said he wouldn’t give any passports to lousy jews, but he says, “Go to Gestapo headquarters and tell them that they should advise you how you can cross the border.”</span></p> <p><span id="s182">MN: To Gestapo headquarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">JL: Well, what have you got to lose?</span> <span id="s184">So, we went to Gestapo headquarters, and the guy told us, “We give you half an hour.</span> <span id="s185">Get our or get shot.”</span></p> <p><span id="s186">MN: Why were you trying to go through Germany, rather than go directly to France or Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">JL: Well, we tried to, but, you know, Austria has not border.</span> <span id="s188">Only borders on Switzerland.</span> <span id="s189">We were told it is better to go into France or Switzerland easily, you know.</span> <span id="s190">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s191">It was easier to cross over there because all the Austrian border was closed altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">MN: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JL: There was no way you could get in there.</span> <span id="s194">Well, anyhow, the guy told us he is going to shoot us in half and then we don’t get out, but at the same time, he told us another agent, so and so, to see him, and he told us to take a train from Germany into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s195">The train goes back to Germany again, and there is a certain station, the train slows down.</span> <span id="s196">Not a station exactly, it was a junction, but they have to crisscross over somehow.</span> <span id="s197">I can’t remember the name any more, and when the train is going to stop over there, more or less, you just jump off.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">MN: In Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">JL: Yah, in Switzerland, and just pray to God that the guy is a German, not a Swiss, so he is going to let you board the next train.</span> <span id="s200">But, what he forgot to tell us, we had both valises we had our underwear and all our possessions in that one big valise.</span> <span id="s201">He forgot to tell us that the valise gets locked in.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">MN: Oh, you can’t get your baggage!</span></p> <p><span id="s203">JL: We couldn’t get our baggage.</span> <span id="s204">So, we came to the c rossing and Swiss was over there.</span> <span id="s205">he felt sorry, I guess, for my cousin and myself, and he let us go in the train which went to Zurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">JL: But now we had absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">MN: No passport, no...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">JL: No, we had our passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MN: No clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">JL: No clothes.</span> <span id="s212">Nothing.</span> <span id="s213">We just had what we carried ourselves.</span> <span id="s214">It is a good thing it was summer.</span> <span id="s215">So, we finally got into Zurich.</span> <span id="s216">It was great.</span> <span id="s217">We looked at the phone book, looked for the address of the Jewish Federation in Zurich, and we just were about to enter - to pick up the door handle of the Jewish Federation, when we got picked up by the Swiss police - my cousin and myself.</span> <span id="s218">he says, “Where are your papers.”</span> <span id="s219">I showed him my passport.</span> <span id="s220">And...well...we didn’t have a visa, so they send us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">MN: To Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JL: Yah.</span> <span id="s223">See.</span> <span id="s224">So, when we got to Germany, so the Germans...you know...they stamped us “Refused Entry.”</span> <span id="s225">So a German goes ahead and whips out our passport.</span> <span id="s226">O.K.?</span> <span id="s227">So, anyhow, we get into Switzerland somehow...somehow we managed to get back into Switzerland again.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">MN: How was that...How did you manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">JL: Well, you know we were so close to the border.</span> <span id="s230">We crossed the border again.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MN: You crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">JL: And, of course, we got arrested.</span> <span id="s233">And, the police picked us up, and, we were put in ... for 24 hours, in ... (how do you call this?)</span> <span id="s234">confinement.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">MN: Confinement.</span> <span id="s236">Solitary confinement?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">JL: Solitary confinement, yes.</span> <span id="s238">And interrogated, and then I ripped the passport up.</span> <span id="s239">I destroyed the passport and was not supposed to do it.</span> <span id="s240">And, they are going to treat us as spies, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s241">O.K.</span> <span id="s242">After 24 hours, they let us...they put us in another jail with other prisoners for one other week, and, what are you going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">MN: Were these political prisoners like yourselves, or were they, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">JL: No, they were all different prisoners.</span> <span id="s245">Some were refugees, some were not, I have no idea, but most of them were murderers, gangsters, all kinds of criminals.</span> <span id="s246">I was only 18 years old.</span> <span id="s247">Anyhow, after about 3 days, someone of the Jewish community heard that my cousin and I are in prison.</span> <span id="s248">So, this guy owned a stocking factory in Zurich, very well-to-do man, and he says, “Well, he could help me to stay in Switzerland if I become Yeshiva butcher.”</span></p> <p><span id="s249">MN: In other words, if you go to...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JL: ...a Yeshiva in Zurich...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">MN: In other words, a religious school in Zurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">JL: ...they would pick me up.</span> <span id="s253">My cousin said, “No way.</span> <span id="s254">We came here together.</span> <span id="s255">He is responsible for me.</span> <span id="s256">This is what he promised my parents, and I am going to stay here.”</span> <span id="s257">So, after 8 days in the Swiss prison system, the Swiss dropped us off at the French border, at the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s258">O.K. Well, my cousin spoke French fairly fluently.</span> <span id="s259">I also studied French.</span> <span id="s260">I had a tutor in Vienna, I studied French in the Vienna school, in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s261">So, anyhow, we managed to go into France about 8 kilometers.</span> <span id="s262">Mind you, we had no...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">MN: You had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">JL: We had nothing.</span> <span id="s265">And, we evaded on police.</span> <span id="s266">But the second police, we just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s267">We didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s268">That was the whole problem.</span> <span id="s269">Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s270">They finally picked us up.</span> <span id="s271">And, the French said, “Um, um.”</span> <span id="s272">They sent us back to Switzerland again.</span> <span id="s273">So we spent another night in one of the prisons.</span> <span id="s274">And, then they told us, “Now, look, if you come back one more time, we are going to put you in the Tzuchthouse,” which means in English, in the crazyhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">MN: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">JL: So, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s277">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s278">Anyhow, the following day they dropped us off somewhere else in the Maginot Line, in a different area, in a different spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">MN: I didn’t realize that the Maginot Line came all the way down to the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s280">We only knew of...</span></p> <p><span id="s281">JL: See, they dropped us...the Swiss took us somewhere... We went by motorcycle, after that point, I forget how many miles, and by train...maybe I should have mentioned to you that they took us to the French border by motorcycle and by train before we got there.</span> <span id="s282">Anyhow, they dropped us off a second time behind the Maginot Line, somewhere, so we managed to enter about 10-15 kilometers again, and we got picked up again.</span> <span id="s283">Anyhow, after we got arrested, the French took us to jail in Mulhouse...Mulhouse, France, and we were there will all different types of prisoners - murderers, gangsters.</span> <span id="s284">And, they had a trial.</span> <span id="s285">We were vagabonds, because we entered France illegally, without any money.</span> <span id="s286">O.K. And, so we get a sentence of four weeks.</span> <span id="s287">After two weeks, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">MN: Where were you sentenced for four weeks?</span> <span id="s289">To jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">JL: In Mulhouse, France.</span> <span id="s291">Yeah, to jail, because we were illegal immigrants, illegal.</span> <span id="s292">We entered France illegally, and we had no money.</span> <span id="s293">So, we were a bunch of vagabonds.</span> <span id="s294">So, being transferred to a different prison, the mayor of Mulhouse happened to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s295">My cousin and I didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s296">When he saw us, he felt sorry for us when he saw us passing by, in chains...you know...there was machine guns all over us...and guns and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">MN: Chains?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">JL: Oh, yes, we were chained to everybody else, you know.</span> <span id="s299">And, he felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s300">After our jail term was over, after four weeks, somehow he sent us to Besancon, that is about...I don’t know exactly how many miles it was from the border, and there he recommended us to a Jewish family, who somehow took care of us.</span> <span id="s301">The name was Ulman...the Ulman family...and they were in the watch manufacturing business.</span> <span id="s302">Just about 12 miles from the Swiss border, but way inland, you know.</span> <span id="s303">And, Mrs. Ulman happened to be a cousin to Leon Blum, the Premier of France at this particular time, and they were a very, very wealthy family and they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s304">They put us up in a cold-water flat.</span> <span id="s305">A big apartment building, which, if you don’t where you were you would get absolutely lost.</span> <span id="s306">You know, it was like a..</span> <span id="s307">.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">MN: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">JL: And they supplied us with three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s310">But, we didn’t have a penny in our pocket.</span> <span id="s311">My parents didn’t know for six months if I was alive or dead.</span> <span id="s312">There was no communication whatsoever.</span> <span id="s313">After the end...Finally I got a job in one of the stores as a..</span> <span id="s314">.</span> <span id="s315">to arrange the window arrangements in a clothing store, and also to do some tailoring and some design work.</span> <span id="s316">We got special permission, but, every week we were living in France, the police...the French police came to our house and said they are going to send us back to Germany.</span> <span id="s317">We are here illegal, and we have to call our friend, the Ulmans, even at one o’clock in the morning, and the police prefect gave us always an extension.</span> <span id="s318">We had a special booklet which called...the French called it “recipe book” which had about a hundred pages, and each time they gave us another week permission to stay in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">MN: And they wrote it in that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">JL: They wrote it in that book.</span> <span id="s321">We got an extension all the time and we...they always threatened to send us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MN: Those were the only papers you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">JL: They were the only papers we had.</span> <span id="s324">And our passports, which was damaged by the Germans.</span> <span id="s325">Well, anyhow, in the meantime, things got very bad in Austria and Germany, especially in September, when in the Fall, they shot the German ambassador.</span> <span id="s326">Remember?</span> <span id="s327">When they had the Kristallnacht in Vienna.</span> <span id="s328">And, I understand my parents were, you know, got frightened.</span> <span id="s329">They were in bad shape.</span> <span id="s330">I understand my Dad had a nervous breakdown which he was never sick in his life.</span> <span id="s331">And, I spoke to the Ulmans.</span> <span id="s332">I had to go help them.</span> <span id="s333">And Mrs. Ulman got a visa for my parents to come to France, and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">MN: Now, this was November of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">JL: 1939.</span> <span id="s336">It was ‘39 now.</span> <span id="s337">I was almost a year in France.</span> <span id="s338">O.K. And, my parents were able to leave Austria.</span> <span id="s339">In the meantime, they shipped all their belongings to France, which were confiscated by the...somewhere...they...the stuff never arrived.</span> <span id="s340">In the meantime, my parents left Austria sometimes in November 1939 via Italy.</span> <span id="s341">They had to climb the mountains, but they finally somehow got to France and we were reunited.</span> <span id="s342">O.K. Sometimes in 1939, things got bad in France, because there was the threat of war, you know with France and Germany, and all male inhabitants that were of German, Austrian or not-French origin were interned.</span> <span id="s343">So, I was...my Dad and I were sent to an internment camp in Lengers in France.</span> <span id="s344">This camp was a miserable place.</span> <span id="s345">It was a converted barn...for horse...horse barn...
