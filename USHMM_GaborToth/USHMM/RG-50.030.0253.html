Uh, give me your name and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: All right.</span> <span id="s13">I'm Curtis R. Whiteway.</span> <span id="s14">And I was born in Newburyport, Mass[achusetts], in 1925.</span> <span id="s15">November 3rd.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me a little bit about yourself, and your advent into the Army.</span> <span id="s17">And, uh, then we can talk about your career in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: All right.</span> <span id="s19">In 19...the December 1943, I was drafted, uh, into the, uh, Army.</span> <span id="s20">And then, uh, uh, we're at Fort Devens, Mass[achusetts].</span> <span id="s21">And then, uh, couple of days later, taken to Fort Knox, Kentucky, for, uh, my major training in the armored forces.</span> <span id="s22">I continued on then, uh, after graduating there.</span> <span id="s23">Instead of going into the armored, uh, division, they took a group of us, uh, that were apparently high in the records of, uh, achievement; and they sent us to South Carolina, to the Rangers, where we received 19 weeks of very intensive training.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Then you went overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Then we went, uh, to, uh, Camp Maxey, Texas, and joined the 99th Division.</span> <span id="s26">Uh, there we were supposed to train a lot of the troops, and so on.</span> <span id="s27">And we went immediately over to England (clearing throat) by way of Boston.</span> <span id="s28">So from England, well, we trained for awhile.</span> <span id="s29">Invasion training.</span> <span id="s30">And then, uh, very shortly, why, we land...we went across the channel in LSTs and landed at Le Havre.And we had a little bit of skirmishes there; but, uh, we moved inland, uh, into Belgium.</span> <span id="s31">And then we relieved the 9th Infantry Division on line, in uh...in around the area of Liège [Flem: Luik], Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And then, what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: All right.</span> <span id="s34">Uh...uh, of course, we were totally green.</span> <span id="s35">We had a lot of experience, uh, there in, uh, training, but, uh, totally green to combat.</span> <span id="s36">And, uh, about a month and a half later, uh, on December 16th at dawn, the Germans attacked us with, uh, uh, over 10 to l of their prime German SS troopers, Panzer Grenadiers, the, uh, German, uh, paratroopers, and so on.</span> <span id="s37">And just simply overwhelmed us on what we now call "Hell's Corner."</span> <span id="s38">And, uh, like, uh, my company, uh, of--as I understand now--of approximately 216 men, there were only 29 of us survived.</span> <span id="s39">And then, uh, we, uh, managed to hold the line.</span> <span id="s40">We wiped out the 3rd Panzer Division--uh, with...with great help of our artillery, of course.</span> <span id="s41">And, uh, then, uh, within 1 Located near Ayer, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">2 This would have been well after June 6, 1944, since Le Havre was held by German forces until September 12, 1944 when it was captured by the British 1st Corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">3 This could not have been the 3rd Panzer Division, which served on the Eastern Front.</span> <span id="s44">Probably about another month or so, why, we began getting replacements and were again ready for combat and pushing into Germany through the Siegfried Line.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Tell us what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: All right.</span> <span id="s47">We pushed, uh, into Germany, uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back, or...or just wiping them out.</span> <span id="s48">Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually happened.</span> <span id="s49">But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, Cologne [Ger: Köln]; and, uh, then switched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a bridge now know as the Remagen Bridge.</span> <span id="s50">We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in Cologne, and pulled south.</span> <span id="s51">And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there.</span> <span id="s52">And we went over the bridge that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epelloläi (ph)] on the other side--uh, which is a mountain there--and held it and until other troops could get up there.</span> <span id="s53">And we pushed inland, and made what is known as a bridgehead.</span> <span id="s54">It was in this bridgehead that we first came upon our first concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: All right.</span> <span id="s57">The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s58">Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything.</span> <span id="s59">Uh, the first few camps, uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to fight and destroy the German army.</span> <span id="s60">So we would part, and go around these huge camps, and re-engage on the other side.</span> <span id="s61">In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">And here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men would normally be detailed to go into the camps, unchain the people who were chained and so on, and release the prisoners.</span> <span id="s63">Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say, continue engaging the German troops.</span> <span id="s64">As we went by the gates, we would see, uh, handfuls, or, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come outside the gates [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on trucks and tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">And they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles.</span> <span id="s66">And if they got a chance, they'd come over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands.</span> <span id="s67">And this threw us off guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Because now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright.</span> <span id="s69">And we just kept on going.</span> <span id="s70">The only ones to see any of the horrors in the camps, not... For us, not realizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: The Germans had already left the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the camps--the he is referring here to the 9th Panzer Division, which served in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and suffered heavy losses there.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">4 English name for the Westwall, a fortified line along the western border of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">guards--until we were approaching one of the gates.</span> <span id="s75">And they would withdraw out the back, uh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching.</span> <span id="s76">And what I..</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">we've learned is that they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the back gates, and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into Germany or into Austria.</span> <span id="s79">And they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that.</span> <span id="s80">Uh, we hadn't learned that at this point, uh, there.</span> <span id="s81">And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit the Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that.</span> <span id="s82">(Clearing throat) They usually beat them to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them.</span> <span id="s83">But they...we also learned that they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were going to need that to fight us.</span> <span id="s84">So we continued on fighting, continued past the camps--except for our handfuls of men that would go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: There many camps like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: There were many camps like this.</span> <span id="s87">And we continued pushing north into Germany, until we came to a city called Giessen [Giessen is due east of Remagen].</span> <span id="s88">And in Giessen--or in that area--uh, my group was selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the river [this would have been the Lahne River], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the bridges, and quietly take them off.</span> <span id="s89">And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the bridges.</span> <span id="s90">At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on trucks and tanks quickly; and were inside the city before the Germans knew it.Now, I was ordered to take my men and go down one of the main streets.</span> <span id="s91">We fought from building to building, house to house.</span> <span id="s92">But in this area was very different from many of the other areas in, uh...in Europe--and in particular, in Germany.</span> <span id="s93">Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I have ever smelled.</span> <span id="s94">And there's no way to really describe it.</span> <span id="s95">Uh, except to bring out the, uh, important points that, by now, in northern Germany like this we're all very experienced combat troops.</span> <span id="s96">We had seen all kinds of human misery.</span> <span id="s97">We were used to the odor of death, of, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s98">But this odor was, uh, very distinct, and very strong.</span> <span id="s99">We had to find heavy cloth in the buildings that we were fighting in, from the German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot.</span> <span id="s100">Because this...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: How large was this city?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Uh, the city was quite large.</span> <span id="s103">Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of Malden, Mass[achusetts].</span> <span id="s104">Of, uh, say around a 100,000.</span> <span id="s105">Somewhere on that idea.</span> <span id="s106">And, uh, as we pushed down on this particular area, why, the odor got worse.</span> <span id="s107">And we finally came to a big stone wall, and a huge ancient wooden gate.</span> <span id="s108">Upon top were barbed wire, machine gun nests.</span> <span id="s109">There was no soldiers there, at this point.</span> <span id="s110">Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached 5 Giessen was captured March 28, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">6 Giessen had a population of 31,601 at the end of the war; by the 1980s its population had grown to 76,374.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">the camps that the guards in the camps would not engage us.</span> <span id="s113">They would run instead.</span> <span id="s114">Unlike the Wehrmacht or the regular infantry.</span> <span id="s115">So, when we came to the gate, we knew we had some kind of a prison there.</span> <span id="s116">And we put TNT against the gate, and we blew it in.</span> <span id="s117">Ran inside, dispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death['s]- Head--from experience, the Death['s] -Head SS troopersuh, that normally ran these camps.</span> <span id="s118">And this camp was called Hadamar.Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an extermination camp, not a concentration camp.Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there for long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and terrorizing them, like in other camps that we would go into.</span> <span id="s119">As we burst into the camp and spread out, I saw in front of me a row of barracks.</span> <span id="s120">Wooden, one-story barracks.</span> <span id="s121">In front of the barracks, at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days "slaves," for lack of any other word.</span> <span id="s122">Now we call them survivors.</span> <span id="s123">And they were standing there totally shocked at, of course, the explosion of the gate being blown in, these strange men in strange uniforms running in.</span> <span id="s124">And they didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s125">Uh, I since learned, of course, that the Germans kept all the information, news, away from them.</span> <span id="s126">So that...thus not ever giving them any hope of surviving.</span> <span id="s127">I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I immediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the buildings.</span> <span id="s128">And I ordered my men to start going through the buildings and start cleaning them out--in other words, engaging the German soldier, the SS troopers.</span> <span id="s129">Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me.</span> <span id="s130">And he asked me...he says, "You'd better come with me."</span> <span id="s131">And he had a voice...his tone of voice was very serious.</span> <span id="s132">I followed him across the yard to a building; and as I, uh, observed, the building--to my best memory now--was a masonry building.</span> <span id="s133">The windows were all sealed up.</span> <span id="s134">Outside, as I can remember now, was, I believe, eight automobiles, all up on blocks.</span> <span id="s135">In other words, they were in permanent position.</span> <span id="s136">The wheels had been taken off.</span> <span id="s137">The exhaust were piped in through the wall of that building.</span> <span id="s138">And I..</span> <span id="s139">.</span> <span id="s140">We couldn't really understand what this was.</span> <span id="s141">We went inside the door; and there's a couple of my other men there, standing there waiting for me.</span> <span id="s142">In the room....there was nobody in there, other than my own men.</span> <span id="s143">But there was human excretion, vomit, urine, blood all over the room.</span> <span id="s144">At this point we're looking around, somebody had asked me what was going on.</span> <span id="s145">And I really had no idea.</span> <span id="s146">I did not understand.</span> <span id="s147">None of us did.</span> <span id="s148">One of the men went over to the far wall, uh, as I remember to my left.</span> <span id="s149">And there were shower heads and faucets all over the wall.</span> <span id="s150">He turned them on.</span> <span id="s151">He called out to me; and he says, "What the Hell's going on here?"</span> <span id="s152">And I looked over questionly.</span> <span id="s153">And he said, "There's no water."</span> <span id="s154">And I just shook my head.</span> <span id="s155">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">7 Ger: SS Totenkopfverbände.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">8 According to US military records, the 99th Infantry Division was in the immediate vicinity north of Hadamar on March 27, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">9 Also: "Facility E." A killing center utilized by the Euthanasia program from January 1941 until liberation in 1945.</span> <span id="s159">Served as a replacement for the Grafeneck euthanasia center, which closed in December 1940.</span> <span id="s160">According to Arolsen, the exterminations carried out here were of the mentally ill and patients with TB and took place mainly from 1944-1945.</span> <span id="s161">According to camp records, more than 10,000 people were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">And just about this point....</span> <span id="s163">And, of course, you can imagine what the odor was like in this room.</span> <span id="s164">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s165">Uh, at that point, another man in a doorway motioned for us to come out into the back room.</span> <span id="s166">As we entered the back room, the room was filled with benches and...and, uh, uh, tables.</span> <span id="s167">And on the tables, there was thousands of gold wedding rings.</span> <span id="s168">And there were diamond rings--uh, engagement rings, or whatever you want to call them in Europe.</span> <span id="s169">Uh, there was piles of human teeth with gold filling.</span> <span id="s170">These were all being separated.</span> <span id="s171">And then it was obvious that somebody was in there counting them, and separating them.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">We still just began to understand; but really didn't under....understand what was happening in this camp, at that point.</span> <span id="s173">Uh, we went outside into the, uh, yard again.</span> <span id="s174">Only this is on the back side of the building, more or less.</span> <span id="s175">And here in front of me, I could see huge piles of human hair.</span> <span id="s176">I could see...as the Germans did everything very neatly, there were piles of boots, shoes, suitcases, eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s177">And I stood there looking at the eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s178">And I couldn't imagine how many thousands of people those eyeglasses represented, just sitting there in a huge pile.</span> <span id="s179">To my left was hay wagons--four-wheel hay wagons and two-wheel push carts, which were common in Europe.</span> <span id="s180">Only, these wagons all contained nude bodies.</span> <span id="s181">They were separated; but there was men, women, children, and even babies.</span> <span id="s182">All nude, all dead, all piled as high as they basically could pile them on these wagons.</span> <span id="s183">And I remember going over and looking at...fairly close.</span> <span id="s184">Especially at some of the children--which...which was appalling to us.</span> <span id="s185">They apparently had been just taken out of the building we just left, and been gassed.</span> <span id="s186">Uh, we...at that point, one...another man came to me.</span> <span id="s187">And here again he said, "You'd better come with us."</span> <span id="s188">And we followed them into another building behind.</span> <span id="s189">In the room, as we entered, here was bodies thrown at random on the floor.</span> <span id="s190">On the far wall....</span> <span id="s191">And, of course, you can imagine the odor was absolutely terrible in this place.</span> <span id="s192">Uh, on the, uh, far wall was a battery of ovens.</span> <span id="s193">Big ovens.</span> <span id="s194">Uh, I never did count the ovens, but they were on fire.</span> <span id="s195">Some of the doors were open.</span> <span id="s196">There were bodies in the ovens, still burning.</span> <span id="s197">Uh, we were so shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">And now we were beginning to understand that there was...this was some kind of an execution camp.</span> <span id="s199">Or as we now call, extermination camp.</span> <span id="s200">Uh, we left the...that room, and went out into the, uh, yard again.</span> <span id="s201">And still my men were scattering all over the place, uh...of course, looking for the German soldier; but now finding more and more, uh, things in the camp.</span> <span id="s202">I turned my attention back to the original group of the "slaves," as we called them then.</span> <span id="s203">And as I walked across the yard, I called out to them.</span> <span id="s204">And I noticed...for...for one thing, of course, the condition of these people.</span> <span id="s205">As I can remember, they were all men.</span> <span id="s206">And now I assume that they were like a burial detail to handle all the bodies.</span> <span id="s207">Uh, but they were in a horrible condition, uh, of starvation, of disease.</span> <span id="s208">The bodies...there was no flesh in their bodies.</span> <span id="s209">They were just skin...actual skin and bones.</span> <span id="s210">Their body odor was terrible.</span> <span id="s211">Uh, there...and no hair, or literally no hair, on their bodies.</span> <span id="s212">Their eyes sunken way back in their heads.</span> <span id="s213">And as I approached them, I also saw the yellow star of David, uh, on their clothing.</span> <span id="s214">And coming from Boston and all the ethnic, uh, areas, that I understood that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s215">I called out to them as I approached them.</span> <span id="s216">I says, "Does anybody speak English?"</span> <span id="s217">And finally, one man spoke up, uh, very much like a zombie; but he answered me, "Yes," in English.</span> <span id="s218">So I addressed him, uh, personally.</span> <span id="s219">And I came over to him; and I looked at him, and I said, "We are American soldiers.</span> <span id="s220">It's all over.</span> <span id="s221">Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"</span> <span id="s222">And he stood there frozen in place.</span> <span id="s223">He wasn't looking at me.</span> <span id="s224">He was looking over my shoulder; and he was apparently looking at my men, who were still...some of them running through the buildings, uh, there.</span> <span id="s225">And then first thing...he wouldn't change his expression on his face, but tears started coming down his face.</span> <span id="s226">And then he started to cry.</span> <span id="s227">And he started to sob.</span> <span id="s228">And then he started to sob his heart out; and he fell to the ground on his knees.</span> <span id="s229">And he just cried his heart out.</span> <span id="s230">And I stood there, standing there watching him, and waiting.</span> <span id="s231">And after awhile, he regained his composure.</span> <span id="s232">And then he stopped crying.</span> <span id="s233">And then he spoke in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s234">Which I had heard many times in the Boston area, and I recognized what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">And then he told them that we were American soldiers.</span> <span id="s236">Now, at this point, there were other Americans coming.And I could see over in the background, in other gates or other areas of the camp, other Americans would come in.</span> <span id="s237">They began going through the hospital--because this was a camp under the K-4 program,uh, where they were exterminating or cleansing their own nation, originally, and then went through many other peoples, uh, before they....</span></p> <p><span id="s238">And then they finally were exterminating the Jewish people, at this period of time that we were there.</span> <span id="s239">And we then were ordered out of the camp to help re-engage the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s240">And we left the other Americans in the camp.</span> <span id="s241">They saw many other things that I or my group did not see.</span> <span id="s242">And then we...we continued fighting for that region.</span> <span id="s243">Uh, we pushed....</span> <span id="s244">The best....</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: They were killing right up to the moment...?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: To the moment that we arrived there.</span> <span id="s247">Uh, which was something very, very hard to understand.</span> <span id="s248">Uh, but, as I mentioned, that, uh, in the camps we learned that they were taking prisoners out the back gates to continue that time of killing what they called "prime prisoners."</span> <span id="s249">And it took us a while longer before we would learn that fact, and then begin to outmaneuver them.</span> <span id="s250">(Clearing throat) And we continued pushing through northern Germany, to Kassel [approximately 60 miles northwest of Giessen].</span> <span id="s251">And, uh...I believe that was about the deepest penetration; uh, when we were ordered to hold up.</span> <span id="s252">And then, uh, this was getting into an area that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreementthat would be Russian territory.</span> <span id="s253">So that now, other troops would come in and take our place and hold this line.</span> <span id="s254">We were pulled out; and we would turn and head south--toward Nuremberg [Ger: Nürnberg], Frankfurt[-am- Main], Würzburg, and that region.</span> <span id="s255">Going down through that area, we came to quite a number of other camps.</span> <span id="s256">Uh, there is no understanding in my mind, or...as to the difference in the camps.</span> <span id="s257">At that time of...of uh, the war, uh, there were slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s258">Many of them.</span> <span id="s259">Uh, there were, uh, of course, concentration camps--which I really wasn't realizing at that point-- uh, that we were going into.</span> <span id="s260">Uh, sometimes, I would only just penetrate.</span> <span id="s261">Uh, we came to a camp called Ohrdruf,as best as I can determine to this day.</span> <span id="s262">And now I'm starting to 10 This was probably the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was in Limburg-an-der-Lahn to the south of Hadamar on March 27, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">11 The actual designation for the Euthanasia program was "Operation T4."</span> <span id="s264">12 An Allied Summit Conference took place in Yalta from February 4 to 11, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">13 Subcamp of Buchenwald; located in the province of Thuringia.</span> <span id="s266">Established November 1944 and apparently liberated by American troops on April 4, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">remember more...just recently starting to remember more and more about this; putting together other facts from my own division, where we were at that time.</span> <span id="s268">But, as I can determine now, it was Ohrdruf.And it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s269">We came right to the middle, apparently, of the camp itself--of the outside.</span> <span id="s270">There was nothing there in front of us but barbed wire.</span> <span id="s271">Behind the barbed wire, we could see into the camp.</span> <span id="s272">And there were bodies laying all over the place.</span> <span id="s273">There were some small buildings and so on.</span> <span id="s274">The odor, again, was terrible here.</span> <span id="s275">Uh, I radioed in to the captain, uh, that we had come to the barbed wire and some kind of a camp.</span> <span id="s276">He ordered all of us to turn left, and go around the camp in that direction.</span> <span id="s277">Apparently, one of the other companies was on our other flank would go the other direction.</span> <span id="s278">As we walked along the barbed wire and we kept looking in.</span> <span id="s279">Of course, we were in a very depressed mood, uh, looking at...at all these bodies laying there.</span> <span id="s280">We could see some were still alive, were still moving, even if they were only twitching, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">And we passed a gate.</span> <span id="s282">Whether it was the main gate, I don't know.</span> <span id="s283">But we passed a gate.</span> <span id="s284">And at that point, now other...all the rest of the company was, uh, was progressing the same way.</span> <span id="s285">Some [of] them--uh, American soldiers of our own, uh, outfit, and probably of our own company--were already inside the camp.</span> <span id="s286">Only a few.</span> <span id="s287">And, I believe, two men came over toward us and started waving us anxiously to come in to help them.</span> <span id="s288">So I radioed to Captain Pat,or the company command, and told them that we, uh, uh, were requested [to] uh, help, uh, there.</span> <span id="s289">He gave us permission to move into the camp.</span> <span id="s290">So as far as I know that only my squad turned and went into the uh...to the camp itself.</span> <span id="s291">As we were walking in, as I say, there was bodies laying literally all over the place.</span> <span id="s292">And as I can remember, here again on my left as I was coming in, there was some buildings.</span> <span id="s293">And there was a gallows.</span> <span id="s294">And I can't distinguish in my mind at this point whether there was just one or more.</span> <span id="s295">And I believe there was more gallows.</span> <span id="s296">But there was no rope.</span> <span id="s297">It was...it was wire that they were using for a noose.</span> <span id="s298">Uh, during the short stay in there, one of the survivors--and there weren't very many as far as I know--had explained to me what the Germans were doing.</span> <span id="s299">There were pile...piles of bodies all around the gallows.</span> <span id="s300">And they were taking the prisoners, and making...forcing them to stand under the gallows.</span> <span id="s301">They would tighten the noose around and then they would adjust it up on top.</span> <span id="s302">So they would pull them up and stretch them, so only their toes would just barely touch the ground.</span> <span id="s303">And they left them that way.</span> <span id="s304">And as I can understand, as I remember the prisoner telling me--or the survivor--that it took something like about 15 minutes for them to die that way.</span> <span id="s305">And, of course, this was very disgusting to us, at that point.</span> <span id="s306">We were also looking... trying to look at other things that we were seeing in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">The...we were starting to wander among the bodies, to see if we could help some of them.</span> <span id="s308">And each one that I came to, I knew just by looking at them that they were beyond help.</span> <span id="s309">Uh, even...even...we didn't have any medics in our company.</span> <span id="s310">They had all been shot in the head by the snipers.</span> <span id="s311">And what little medicine we had....</span> <span id="s312">Well, [there] was no medicine.</span> <span id="s313">All we had was bandages, by that time there.</span> <span id="s314">Uh, I came to...now as I remember, uh, a nude woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">14 It is by no means certain, but US military records indicate that the 99th Infantry Division could have been in this vicinity between April 17 and April 21, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">15 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Captain William Patterson of Miami, Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">And it was apparent she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s318">And I was standing there looking... And this is something terrible to me, in my mind.</span> <span id="s319">She had a rope tied around her legs.</span> <span id="s320">But it wasn't in a position where apparently the prisoners or somebody had tied ropes on her ankles and dragged the body out.</span> <span id="s321">And it confused me.</span> <span id="s322">Why would the rope be tied around her legs?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">And I was standing there pondering that, uh, fact, when one of the survivors in that camp quietly came over beside me.</span> <span id="s324">And he began talking very softly.</span> <span id="s325">And he told me; he says she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s326">And as the baby was being born, the SS troopers took her clothing off--or ripped her clothing off, I think, is the way he put it--and then tied a rope tightly around her legs.</span> <span id="s327">And then left her and the baby to die that way; because, naturally, the baby couldn't be born.</span> <span id="s328">And, of course, that upset me very, very much.</span> <span id="s329">In fact, I've had some...some rather terrible nightmares over it.</span> <span id="s330">And I remember then getting orders to leave the camp, while others....</span> <span id="s331">There were now more apparently of the...the supporting troops were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">And they were coming in the camp, and they were spreading out with some medics.</span> <span id="s333">I can remember seeing some medics with their Red Cross armbands on.</span> <span id="s334">And we left; and we rejoined our company.</span> <span id="s335">And we began, again, in the combat.</span> <span id="s336">And we pushed south again.</span> <span id="s337">There were other camps that we came to.</span> <span id="s338">Other men went in and so-called "liberated" the camps and the prisoners.</span> <span id="s339">Uh, released them, or whatever.</span> <span id="s340">I can remember seeing just tidbits of different camps like that.</span> <span id="s341">And we kept on going.</span> <span id="s342">And now the German Army was disintegrating, so that they would disappear and pull back as much as 50 miles in... And, uh, then set up lines.</span> <span id="s343">We would come out of the woods.</span> <span id="s344">We'd come out of the buildings, and come onto the, uh, roads, and walk the roads until the points we'd re-engage the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">And we'd spread out and re-engage them again.</span> <span id="s346">Uh, in doing this, we came, uh, into the area of, as I now know as, Bavaria.</span> <span id="s347">And we were going up a mountain.</span> <span id="s348">And up at the top, all of a sudden...my two scouts were always up in front of me.</span> <span id="s349">And I was always the third man.</span> <span id="s350">Uh, the rest of the men were behind me.</span> <span id="s351">Uh, the two scouts signaled, and they hit the ground.</span> <span id="s352">I, uh, signaled for all the men to hit the ground, and...uh, for cover.</span> <span id="s353">And then I crawled up to where the two scouts were.</span> <span id="s354">And they pointed up ahead; and I could see some men up through the woods--quite a distance from us--that were running from tree to tree.</span> <span id="s355">They were very skittish.</span> <span id="s356">And observing them, uh, I assumed that they were of no danger, that they were not German soldiers.</span> <span id="s357">Because they had no helmets and they had no rifles.</span> <span id="s358">Uh, they... First, I thought they were women; because they had a long robe on them that went all the way to the ankles.</span> <span id="s359">Now, I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were allowed out of that camp that we were going to come to.</span> <span id="s360">Uh, and they were on perhaps burial detail.</span> <span id="s361">Uh, but the idea of the long gown or dress on them was that they were hobbled, so they could not run.</span> <span id="s362">The bottom [of] the uniform or dress was very close at the ankle.</span> <span id="s363">But what they were doing there was they were hiding behind the tree.</span> <span id="s364">There was quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s365">And they'd look around, just like rabbits; they were so scared.</span> <span id="s366">Then, one by one, they would get up, pull up the skirts above their waist.</span> <span id="s367">And we kinda snickered, because here they were...we realized they were men.</span> <span id="s368">They were totally nude.</span> <span id="s369">The only thing they had for clothing on was this, uh, dress.</span> <span id="s370">And they would hold it above their waist; and they'd run and then dive behind another tree and drop their skirt.</span> <span id="s371">And as I say, it was kind of humorous, at that point.</span> <span id="s372">But they [were] working their way to close to us.</span> <span id="s373">So I signaled for the men to skirmish and get ready for a gun fight, just in case.</span> <span id="s374">And we were all camouflaged, and, uh, so on.</span> <span id="s375">Then these men worked their way fairly close to us.</span> <span id="s376">And all of a sudden, I stood up and I challenged them.</span> <span id="s377">I almost scared the living daylights out of them.</span> <span id="s378">They didn't know we were there.</span> <span id="s379">They dived in behind the trees.</span> <span id="s380">And when they did, some of them started to cry, started to beg.</span> <span id="s381">Uh, one man finally came out.</span> <span id="s382">And I kept telling him in broken German, uh, "We are American solders."</span> <span id="s383">And, uh, tried to get them to understand that, uh, we were not, uh, going to harm them.</span> <span id="s384">And one man, in particular, came crawling out on his elbows and his knees--almost like a caterpillar.</span> <span id="s385">And he crawled quite fast.</span> <span id="s386">And he [was] working his way toward me; and then he turned around and put his hands up in the form of a prayer, and kept begging me in some foreign language, apparently not to kill him.</span> <span id="s387">And I tried to console him and uh...here again, tell him that we are Americans.</span> <span id="s388">He finally, suddenly, under... comprehended what I was trying to say.</span> <span id="s389">And he look...looked up, and said something in a foreign language.</span> <span id="s390">But... "American?"</span> <span id="s391">And I shook my head yes.</span> <span id="s392">He went like a machine gun across the floor, came over to...uh, in front of me.</span> <span id="s393">Now, he was breaking down.</span> <span id="s394">And he was shivering all over his body; and he started kissing the ground and started kissing my shoes, or my boots.</span> <span id="s395">And uh, then he wrapped his arms violently around my legs.</span> <span id="s396">And he was crying his heart out.</span> <span id="s397">And then he turned around; and he spoke in a foreign language to the others to come, and that it was safe.</span> <span id="s398">Here again, these prisoners were just like the ones back at Hadamar--in a terrible, terrible shape.</span> <span id="s399">So I asked them in German, uh...uh, "Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?"</span> <span id="s400">--"Where is the German soldier?"</span> <span id="s401">And they pointed down.</span> <span id="s402">We... (Clearing throat) I'll skip the rest of that part of the story, uh, to get to the better points.</span> <span id="s403">Uh, we took them... I detailed one man to stay back behind, uh, and take them with us.</span> <span id="s404">And we, uh ...forward...made uh...uh, and went forward down the side of the mountain, then.</span> <span id="s405">Halfway down the hill, we could hear a strange, crackling noise.</span> <span id="s406">And now we're getting the same odor that we had smelled at Hadamar.</span> <span id="s407">Terrible odor.</span> <span id="s408">Only now, there was no cloth for us to hold over our faces.</span> <span id="s409">We suddenly came to a, uh...a big field in the middle of the forest, and right to the very edge.</span> <span id="s410">And I was standing there; and there was prisoners in front of me.</span> <span id="s411">And there was three groups.</span> <span id="s412">One group was coming up with hay wagons with bodies on them.</span> <span id="s413">As I remember, most all of them had clothing on.</span> <span id="s414">Uh, this is a very important point.</span> <span id="s415">Because I learned from President [Chaim] Herzog, uh, when I asked him, that "Why were some nude and some others not?"</span> <span id="s416">And he pointed out that, uh, the nude ones were usually Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Because they believed in their religion that the worst thing that could happen to them was to go to God in the nude.</span> <span id="s418">These prisoners, most of them were clothed, at that point.</span> <span id="s419">Or, the bodies on the wagons.</span> <span id="s420">And the prisoners were pushing the wagons up by hand.</span> <span id="s421">There was another group at that point coming in from the forest carrying six-foot logs.</span> <span id="s422">The first group, in front of me, was taking the logs and laying them on the ground, side by side.</span> <span id="s423">Then they were taking, uh, the bodies, and laying them across; and another row of bodies...uh, of logs, a row of bodies.</span> <span id="s424">And building them up, uh, approximately as high as they could reach; but approximately seven, eight feet high.</span> <span id="s425">And we're standing there, all of us shocked.</span> <span id="s426">My own men and these prisoners.</span> <span id="s427">They didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s428">And I took a very close look at some of the pyres of all these prisoners and all these dead bodies uh...uh, there.</span> <span id="s429">Many of the pyres were on fire.</span> <span id="s430">And there were other pyres all over the field that were in all different stages of construction.</span> <span id="s431">And I was so shocked that I didn't talk to any of these prisoners.</span> <span id="s432">I just signaled one man [to] go round them up and bring them all to me.</span> <span id="s433">And then I just simply asked them, "Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?"</span> <span id="s434">And they pointed down.</span> <span id="s435">So we headed down.</span> <span id="s436">We took the...those prisoners along with the others.</span> <span id="s437">Uh, the others I had detailed to go back behind the lines with a, uh...I had a medic coming up to get them.</span> <span id="s438">Now, as we came down to the bottom into the valley, I suddenly come to a road that was going across me.</span> <span id="s439">Off to the left was some city.</span> <span id="s440">And most of my battalion was now throwing out artillery and throwing the mortar shells in.</span> <span id="s441">They were attacking the city.</span> <span id="s442">So I turned my attention to my right.</span> <span id="s443">And here was a huge camp.</span> <span id="s444">This was apparently the main road coming out of the city right straight into the main, uh, gate of the camp.</span> <span id="s445">There was two rows of barbed wire--electrified, as I can remember.</span> <span id="s446">And in fact, I'm sure; because we blew the transformer.</span> <span id="s447">There were towers--guard towers--on the outside.</span> <span id="s448">I signaled; I sent some up in the guard towers, and they disarmed the, uh, machine guns.</span> <span id="s449">Uh, a couple more men went over to the transformer.</span> <span id="s450">We blew the transformer.</span> <span id="s451">Then we blew the gate in.</span> <span id="s452">And we ran in, dispersed as usual; and I ran off to the left.</span> <span id="s453">I got...landed on my knees so I could watch my men, to make sure that they were doing things right and covering each other.</span> <span id="s454">And in front of me... This camp was called--as I now know it--Dachau 3B.</span> <span id="s455">Uh, this...in front of me was a series of barracks.</span> <span id="s456">At the point that I landed on my knees, I could see behind some of the barracks; and there was a group of people.</span> <span id="s457">I believe that they were all male, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s458">They were all hanging; but they [were] hanging in grotesque positions.</span> <span id="s459">They weren't hanging by the neck.</span> <span id="s460">I pointed to Hopperand another man: "Go over there and cut them down."</span> <span id="s461">So they left, uh, and I detailed a couple more men to cover them.</span> <span id="s462">And at that point, I, uh, made a run for the barracks in front of me, that was on a long, uh, ways to me.</span> <span id="s463">And the door was in the small part... end of the barracks.</span> <span id="s464">And in combat, you don't walk through a door.</span> <span id="s465">We dived through the door.</span> <span id="s466">Goggleyedived over the top of me; and we come up all ready to engage somebody.</span> <span id="s467">Uh, as we got in, I was shocked; because there was nobody to fight.</span> <span id="s468">Instead, here was a whole series--all along my left side, all the way down--of bunks.</span> <span id="s469">Uh...I believe, but I'm not exactly sure...I believe there were three tiers.</span> <span id="s470">The prisoners were in the bunks--as many as they could get in them, all laying across the bunks.</span> <span id="s471">And we went into a, uh...a thing of trying to tell them that we were American soldiers.</span> <span id="s472">"Does anybody speak English?"</span> <span id="s473">And finally, one little, uh, Frenchman in the first row of bunk...uh, first bunk, uh, he asked me--in French, at first--if I was an American soldier.</span> <span id="s474">And he began to comprehend.</span> <span id="s475">And I told him....</span> <span id="s476">And I couldn't understand why they wouldn't get out of the bunk...uh, or the beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">And, uh, so I told Goggleye, "Go over there and find out what the heck's the matter with them."</span> <span id="s478">And he told me...he said, "They're chained at the ankle."</span> <span id="s479">So we come over and took a look at them; and they had a heavy logging chain and some kind of an iron clamp on their 16 It is clear from documentation on the movements of the 99th Division and from supplementary information provided by Mr. Whiteway that "Dachau 3B" must have been a sub-camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s480">Research performed by Dr. Robert Kesting in the U. S. military records located at the National Archives in Suitland, Maryland, appear to indicate that the term "3B" was used to refer to the Mühldorf sub-camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s481">This identification is consistent with U. S. military records, which indicate that Mühldorf was in the zone assigned to the 99th Infantry Division and affiliated units (i.e., 14th Cavalry Group/Armored and the 86th Infantry Division).</span></p> <p><span id="s482">17 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Otis Hopper of Hartselle, Alabama.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">18 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Ray Goggleye.</span> <span id="s484">Died in 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">ankles, every one of them.</span> <span id="s486">So I told, uh, the men, "Find the locks."</span> <span id="s487">And on the end of the locks... Not "find the locks," but "find the key."</span> <span id="s488">There was a big iron lock on each, uh, bunk.</span> <span id="s489">And he couldn't find the key; so I told him, "Okay, shoot the locks off."</span> <span id="s490">And, of course, we had to be careful where the bullet was going.</span> <span id="s491">But they shot...had to shoot the locks all the way down the barracks, through every series of, uh, bunks.</span> <span id="s492">And then all... instantly, all the prisoners were pulling the chains out quickly.</span> <span id="s493">And then they come over, and started hugging and kissing us and all that.</span> <span id="s494">We proceeded through the length of the barracks and went out the other door, and went into the second barracks.</span> <span id="s495">In the second barracks was exactly the same as the first barracks.</span> <span id="s496">But now, the prisoners from the first barracks were following me and my men.</span> <span id="s497">We burst in the door.</span> <span id="s498">This time, we walked in the door.</span> <span id="s499">The only thing that was different about this barracks was the condition of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s500">That they were on the verge of death.</span> <span id="s501">Here they were all chained.</span> <span id="s502">It was obvious that all food and water was shut off from [them].</span> <span id="s503">And they were so weak.</span> <span id="s504">And the odor was terrible in this barrack.</span> <span id="s505">But they were so weak that they could not push themselves on their elbow.</span> <span id="s506">They were laying there and putting one hand out; and they....</span> <span id="s507">Instantly, everybody in the barracks were looking at me.</span> <span id="s508">And they were begging in all kinds of foreign languages, apparently, for food and water.</span> <span id="s509">And everyone of us had different reactions.</span> <span id="s510">Now some of the guys were bumping up against me, coming in and being shocked.</span> <span id="s511">And I remember Goggleye was down on his knees; and being an Indian, uh, and a Catholic, he was giving the sign of the cross and he was saying some prayers.</span> <span id="s512">Somebody behind me was swearing, and he was, uh, promising revenge.</span> <span id="s513">Uh, a couple of the newer men turned around and went back out of the barracks; and they were vomiting.</span> <span id="s514">And every one of us, as I say, had a different reaction.</span> <span id="s515">And I got the strangest feeling that I wanted to understand, somehow, what a German guard would feel like in this barracks.</span> <span id="s516">So while everybody's standing there, uh... reacting, I slung my rifle over my shoulder and I stood up like a guard would do.</span> <span id="s517">And I marched all the way down the length of the building, and turned around and came back, as a German soldier would.</span> <span id="s518">And alls I saw was a whole handful of...hundreds of hands, literally, following me all the way up the barracks and all the way back, begging.</span> <span id="s519">And they wouldn't stop begging.</span> <span id="s520">As I got back to the end again, the little Frenchman--who was now my self-appointed interpreter....</span> <span id="s521">He could speak five languages, as I remember.</span> <span id="s522">And he recognized somebody in the second bunk.</span> <span id="s523">And he ran over to him; and he turned around.</span> <span id="s524">He was pointing to me, apparently tell him that we were American soldiers and that it was all over.</span> <span id="s525">But his friend wouldn't put his hand down.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">He still had his hand out.</span> <span id="s527">So I saw the Frenchman put, uh, his hand down like this.</span> <span id="s528">And the hand come up again.</span> <span id="s529">And he wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s530">And he didn't even recognize his own buddy, his friend.</span> <span id="s531">And it was a very, very emotional thing to...to see.</span> <span id="s532">And about at that point, we heard an awful ruckus outside.</span> <span id="s533">So we burst out both, uh, doorways of the barracks.</span> <span id="s534">And now, in the yard that was totally empty before, was hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s535">A sea of humanity of the prisoners from this huge camp that was beyond us.</span> <span id="s536">And I remember seeing men and women now here.</span> <span id="s537">And, uh, they...

Riggs--Army Service No.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">42130776, SSN 069-01-0218--from Reno, Nevada.</span> <span id="s540">Died in 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Your colleagues?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: These were my own men of my squad.</span> <span id="s543">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s544">I should point there...there was approximately eight of us, at that point.</span> <span id="s545">And that's all I had left, uh, because of the, uh, casualties.</span> <span id="s546">And Bob Riggs, uh, was bringing 20 German women guards out of this building, and marching them across the yard toward...to bring them to me.</span> <span id="s547">And, of course, the German women were... were military woman in uniform--very huge, powerful women.</span> <span id="s548">Well-fed; which appalled me at the time, because of the comparison of all these prisoners being so horribly starved.</span> <span id="s549">Uh, it infuriated me to see these women so well fed at that point.</span> <span id="s550">And they marched in a military, uh, rank of two toward me.</span> <span id="s551">And all these prisoners were trying to get to them and kill them.</span> <span id="s552">I don't believe they could really hurt them.</span> <span id="s553">Maybe they could.</span> <span id="s554">But there was no....</span> <span id="s555">Here again, there was no flesh in their bodies, no muscles or anything like that.</span> <span id="s556">Uh, we ran out between them.</span> <span id="s557">And we held our rifles horizontal, and we tried to hold this massive crowd back.</span> <span id="s558">At that point, uh, Whitey Hall--another squad leader--was going by the main gate.</span> <span id="s559">And he saw we were in trouble; and he brought his men in--approximately eight or nine men--and he...they ran over and stood beside us, and tried to hold this crowd back.</span> <span id="s560">And I called out to...here again, Applegate--which was a very tall man--uh, and I told him...I says, "You take these women out of here, and get them out of the camp.</span> <span id="s561">Get them out of sight, so I can get control of the crowd."</span> <span id="s562">So he doubletimed the women out of the camp.</span> <span id="s563">Later, he come back and told me that he had marked them for war crimes.</span> <span id="s564">We were beginning to understand there was something very wrong in this camp.</span> <span id="s565">So in the meantime, once he got them out of sight, uh, then I started talking to the crowd.</span> <span id="s566">And I started telling them, "There's not going to be any killing.</span> <span id="s567">It's all over.</span> <span id="s568">You're free.</span> <span id="s569">Do you understand this?"</span> <span id="s570">And the crowd, of course, the...they were so infuriated at seeing these women that, uh...the...there was electricity in the air.</span> <span id="s571">The hatred, the bitterness was there.</span> <span id="s572">And it was very obvious.</span> <span id="s573">And so I kept telling them that I'm not going to permit any killing, and, uh, that "You're now free."</span> <span id="s574">But they couldn't understand this.</span> <span id="s575">And all of a sudden, in the crowd, uh, there was a lot of people talking very excitedly to certain people, which it turned out to be, uh, people who could speak English.</span> <span id="s576">And so they would interpret these stories.</span> <span id="s577">And they began--I remember this very distinctly--one of the first stories.</span> <span id="s578">There was a Jewish woman right out in front of me.</span> <span id="s579">And you couldn't tell very, uh, well a difference of a woman from a man in those camps.</span> <span id="s580">They were so badly starved that a woman's breast is totally dissolved by her body.</span> <span id="s581">So there was no hourglass shape, or anything else.</span> <span id="s582">They had basically the same clothing as the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s583">Their hair was shaved off their heads.</span> <span id="s584">Usually, I could identify by the tone of the voice whether they were male or female.</span> <span id="s585">And this woman spoke out; and--in English--and she started telling me.</span> <span id="s586">Uh, uh, she tried to describe what the German women--these German women-- were doing to these prisoners daily.</span> <span id="s587">That they would take a group of perhaps 20 to 30 prisoners, and march them in two ranks to a specific part of the camp where the slit trenches--the toilets--were.</span> <span id="s588">And now as I mentioned, there's no flesh on their bodies, so they could not physically resist anything.</span> <span id="s589">One German woman, 20 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Staff Sargeant Alfred Hall of Winchester, Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">as she described, would get down on her knees in front of a slit trench.</span> <span id="s591">She would reach up and grab two prisoners by the back of the head, force them down on their knees, force them to bend over.</span> <span id="s592">And then push their faces in human excretion, and hold them there until they smothered to death.</span> <span id="s593">All the time laughing.</span> <span id="s594">As well as the other German women, who were surrounding the prisoners.</span> <span id="s595">It was, uh...as she described it, was a daily game for them.</span> <span id="s596">In the meantime, all the prisoners in the two ranks had to stand there and watch.</span> <span id="s597">But also they had to understand that each and every one of them, this was going to be done to them before they were done.</span> <span id="s598">And they did this daily.</span> <span id="s599">Another person in the crowd called out.</span> <span id="s600">And they...uh, he was yelling something about the dogs, the dogs.</span> <span id="s601">And then he began talking about how the Germans--guards--some of them would be going with packs of dogs.</span> <span id="s602">And at any time, they would suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that prisoner and tear him apart viciously.</span> <span id="s603">And as I have described to the kids in school today, as bad as it was, at least that person...it was over for that particular person.</span> <span id="s604">But for...the psychological thing that happened, and what the Germans were doing, was that they were putting the fear into all the others.</span> <span id="s605">So they had to think from then on that, "When is it going to be my turn?"</span> <span id="s606">The Germans, uh, we...we're learning that they could not simply just kill somebody; but they had to humiliate and they had to terrorize, all at the same time.</span> <span id="s607">There were many other stories.</span> <span id="s608">Another person in the crowd began calling out; and telling me, (clearing throat) here again, about the dogs.</span> <span id="s609">That in the winter, that the German guards would select a prisoner--man or woman.</span> <span id="s610">They were given--him or her--a shower, a hot shower.</span> <span id="s611">And immediately take them out of the shower nude into the yard, in the snow storm; and command them to sit there, surrounded, uh, by killer dogs who were, uh, placed...commanded to be on guard.</span> <span id="s612">And this prisoner... Now the guards would go back into the barracks and watch.</span> <span id="s613">And this prisoner had a choice of sitting there in the snow storm and freezing to death, or move and have the dogs attack them.</span> <span id="s614">And they went on telling me story after story.</span> <span id="s615">And finally, I put my hands up.</span> <span id="s616">And I told them, I said, "I've heard enough.</span> <span id="s617">I don't want to hear anymore.</span> <span id="s618">It's all over."</span> <span id="s619">At that point, as I can remember, a little Frenchman in the crowd began to sing quietly, very hoarsely, the..."La Marseillaise"--the French national anthem.</span> <span id="s620">As he began singing, then some others--spotted all through the crowd--began to sing along side of them.</span> <span id="s621">Apparently, they were French.</span> <span id="s622">Then, Bob Riggs came for me.</span> <span id="s623">He said, "You'd better come with me."</span> <span id="s624">So the rest....</span> <span id="s625">These men....</span> <span id="s626">Americans were still standing there, now that we had laid our weapons down.</span> <span id="s627">Uh, but at that point, the survivors--as we now call them--began singing other songs that...that I didn't recognize.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">We...Bob took me over to the barracks of the women guards.</span> <span id="s629">As we entered the room, the first room was a..</span> <span id="s630">.</span> <span id="s631">what we in the army call a "day room."</span> <span id="s632">This is where, normally in the army, you would write letters, read, and relax.</span> <span id="s633">I was so shocked when I walked into this room that I pretended I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s634">And I turned my attention; and off to my right was a doorway and a hallway.</span> <span id="s635">And I quietly... And now there were some of my men, a couple of my men coming in; there was a few survivors coming in.</span> <span id="s636">Nobody at this point was talking.</span> <span id="s637">And I went down the hallway, and I looked into the bedrooms.</span> <span id="s638">And each one of the bedrooms was neat, just like a normal army, uh, room.</span> <span id="s639">Orderly.</span> <span id="s640">All the uniforms were hung up on the left.</span> <span id="s641">The bunk was made in a, uh...uh, military, uh, fashion.</span> <span id="s642">Everything neat, and in its place.</span> <span id="s643">Nothing was wrong.</span> <span id="s644">And this puzzled me.</span> <span id="s645">And I turned around, and I walked back out of the...away from the bedrooms, and back into this room again.</span> <span id="s646">And in the room was tables all over the place.</span> <span id="s647">On the tables were lamps.</span> <span id="s648">Some of them had several lamps.</span> <span id="s649">The lamps themselves were made of human bones.</span> <span id="s650">The lamp shades were made of human skin with tattoos.</span> <span id="s651">I recognized that immediately.</span> <span id="s652">I walked over and was starting to look at different ones, and tried to comprehend what all these things I was seeing.</span> <span id="s653">The little French in...uh, uh, my interpreter now, the little Frenchman came over beside me.</span> <span id="s654">"Monsieur, do you understand what that is?"</span> <span id="s655">At this point, his face was covered with tears.</span> <span id="s656">And I said, "What...it looks like human skin with tattoos."</span> <span id="s657">He says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s658">He says they would find a prisoner with the tattoos, and hold him or her down out here in the yard in front of us.</span> <span id="s659">And then they, uh, would actually skin them alive, these women.</span> <span id="s660">He made a point that it was these German women.</span> <span id="s661">They would actually skin them alive, somehow; and then hand the skin to the prisoners, who had to somehow cure and make these lamp shades.</span> <span id="s662">On the walls all around the room were picture frames, all different sizes, with human skin and tattoos.</span> <span id="s663">On the shelves... Well, off to my right, a row of shelves along here, there were male sex organs had been cut off.</span> <span id="s664">All different sizes.</span> <span id="s665">I believe it was Bob Riggs, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s666">One of my men was down [at] the end, right by the hall door.</span> <span id="s667">And he just motioned to me, uh, with his head.</span> <span id="s668">As I say, here [we] was not talking.</span> <span id="s669">And I walked down to him; and he nodded toward this object that was in front of me.</span> <span id="s670">And I..</span> <span id="s671">.</span> <span id="s672">I can remember just thinking, "A hairy blob.</span> <span id="s673">What is it?"</span> <span id="s674">Because I was only 19 years old at this time.</span> <span id="s675">(Clearing throat) Uh, "Monsieur..." The little Frenchman had come up beside me again.</span> <span id="s676">He said, "You know what that is?"</span> <span id="s677">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s678">And Bob didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s679">He said, "That's a woman's crotch.</span> <span id="s680">They held her down, and cut that out of her.</span> <span id="s681">And preserved it, and put it right there."</span> <span id="s682">And I was pretty well disgusted.</span> <span id="s683">There were sexual organs--breasts and everything else.</span> <span id="s684">Male and female sexual organs, all over the room, all preserved.</span> <span id="s685">There were human heads.</span> <span id="s686">There were bones of different kinds, and... And by this time, my mind was becoming boggled with the things that we were finding in this room.</span> <span id="s687">And I left... At that point somewhere, Little Cheeco--one of my men, uh, an Indian--came for me.</span> <span id="s688">And he says, "You'd better come with me, again."</span> <span id="s689">And I followed him out of that room, leaving the other survivors and...and some of my men there.</span> <span id="s690">We walked out across the yard.</span> <span id="s691">At this point, the survivors were all still singing, uh, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">And we were approaching a small building that I took to be like a Red Cross building.</span> <span id="s693">A small first-aid building is what it looked like.</span> <span id="s694">Much like here, when they go swimming in the summer.</span> <span id="s695">I came up by the door--and by this time, I apparently been kind of getting used to the horrors that we were finding.</span> <span id="s696">And I called out to Big Chief--a six-foot seven Indian, uh, a huge man--was standing right in the doorway, with his back to me.</span> <span id="s697">And I called out to him, "Chief, what have you got?"</span> <span id="s698">And he just turned around slowly, and he looked me with the most God-awful look of shock on his face.</span> <span id="s699">And he couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s700">His lips were quivering.</span> <span id="s701">He was trying to say something, but he couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s702">So I saw an expression on his face; he decided what to do, and he took a giant step to one side, out of my way.</span> <span id="s703">And I entered the door, and I looked.</span> <span id="s704">Inside the room--as I say a small room--the Germans had erected some kind of a board upright, much like a sheet of plywood.</span> <span id="s705">And here, they had taken a prisoner and they had stripped him; and they had nailed him with spikes--common spikes with the heads on them--through his elbows and through his wrist that I saw.</span> <span id="s706">Nailed him like this, spread-eagled on that board.</span> <span id="s707">And I could see where they had taken apparently a scalpel, and they had cut his throat on the side here...his vocal cords somewhere.</span> <span id="s708">So he couldn't scream.</span> <span id="s709">So, in other words, apparently they...they did not give him any anesthesia.</span> <span id="s710">He was looking at me and he was shaking his head; and he was begging with his little eyes, pleading with me.</span> <span id="s711">They had begun... They had already taken and cut open, uh, his chest, and taken his rib cage off.</span> <span id="s712">And I remember on the left side of, uh...of him[, his rib cage] was hanging on nails.</span> <span id="s713">They had taken some of, uh, his intestines, and hung them on the right on nails.</span> <span id="s714">And I could see his lungs--bluish and foamy-like looking--uh, pulsating inside of him.</span> <span id="s715">In other words, they... they were dissecting him alive.</span> <span id="s716">Experimenting on him.</span> <span id="s717">And I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s718">You know, some of the other men behind me coming in now were getting shocked like that.</span> <span id="s719">And I remember Goggleye saying, "What in the Hell are we going to do?"</span> <span id="s720">I said, "Get outside the building here."</span> <span id="s721">Because we...our radios--uh, the 536, we call it--uh, would not work inside the building like they do today.</span> <span id="s722">I said, "Get outside the building here.</span> <span id="s723">Call the company.</span> <span id="s724">Tell them what we've found."</span> <span id="s725">Which he had already been reporting, uh...everything.</span> <span id="s726">"And give them the name, the identification of this building in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Tell them, for God's sake, somewhere, get a hold of a doctor.</span> <span id="s728">A surgeon, in particular; to try to help this man."</span> <span id="s729">Then I ordered everybody to get out of that room, so that perhaps we could save him and not give him any disease.</span> <span id="s730">Because we were all filthy.</span> <span id="s731">And so I sealed the room...the room off that way.</span> <span id="s732">And then I went back to the, uh...the uh...group of the survivors.</span> <span id="s733">And this [was] a sea of humanity, of survivors, out there singing.</span> <span id="s734">And I began talking a little bit with them again, and telling them that it's all over.</span> <span id="s735">And it's about at this point that they began to understand that they were liberated.</span> <span id="s736">Because now they turned and started looking at each other; and there was tears coming down their faces, but there were smiles.</span> <span id="s737">They began to hug and kiss each other.</span> <span id="s738">And you kno...of course, European men, especially, will kiss each other.</span> <span id="s739">They began to take and hug each other...uh, and cry.</span> <span id="s740">And they started, a lot of them, locking their arms together; and they began singing.</span> <span id="s741">And it was very, very emotional thing to see.</span> <span id="s742">And as I say, it was the beginning of them really understanding that they were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: The SS men had already left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: The SS were already...at least deeper into the camp; and were on their way out, uh, with, uh, "prime prisoners," out the other side.</span> <span id="s745">This is the first time that I can remember that we realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s746">That some of the other prisoners had, uh, told us that the SS-- apparently through all the excitement and everything else--now one of us has asked them where is the...what...what happened to the SS there.</span> <span id="s747">And they told us, "They're going out the other side."</span> <span id="s748">So I..</span> <span id="s749">.</span> <span id="s750">I remember radioing the company, and telling them that this column is going out the other side.</span> <span id="s751">The...we had orders then to leave that camp and rejoin the company, and fight for the city.</span> <span id="s752">So I called all the men together.</span> <span id="s753">We formed a line down the road, and we started marching forward out the main gate into the city.</span> <span id="s754">All the survivors were following us.</span> <span id="s755">As we reached the city....</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Let's stop at this point and, uh, then we'll continue later.</span> <span id="s757">We've got to change the film.</span> <span id="s758">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s760">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: So you started out of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: All right.</span> <span id="s763">Now, you must understand that an awful lot of these things that I have been describing is very, very difficult to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Did you ever find out what happened to the man who was, uh, spiked against the board?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No.</span> <span id="s766">No, uh, that I did not.</span> <span id="s767">Uh, I have often wondered about that; and people have asked me about that man.</span> <span id="s768">Uh, we had to leave him in that condition.</span> <span id="s769">And (clearing throat) so we turned; and we started, side-by-side, walking down this main street with thousands of the survivors.</span> <span id="s770">And I don't... And I'm not exaggerating.</span> <span id="s771">This camp must have been huge.</span> <span id="s772">And they were all walking behind us, very quietly.</span> <span id="s773">And, of course, I turned around a couple of times; and I told them, "You people go back.</span> <span id="s774">Because we're going to start shooting now, and I don't want you people hurt."</span> <span id="s775">But they stayed right with us.</span> <span id="s776">And it was almost like a parade.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">And shortly, we came to the first houses on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s778">And suddenly, a woman--a German woman--come running out the right hand side, uh, toward me.</span> <span id="s779">And she, apparently, knew that I was the commanding, uh, man in this group.</span> <span id="s780">She reached me and grabbed me by the shirt, and locked her hands into my shirt.</span> <span id="s781">And she began begging me.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">And she said, "I was teacher in America, in Cleveland, Ohio, uh, before the war."</span> <span id="s783">And then she looked around.</span> <span id="s784">She was scared.</span> <span id="s785">And she started telling me that she didn't know anything of what was going on in that camp.</span> <span id="s786">"I didn't know!</span> <span id="s787">I didn't know!"</span> <span id="s788">And I became rather infuriated at that point.</span> <span id="s789">And I turned around.</span> <span id="s790">Now all the...most of the European people are smaller than we are, except for the German people.</span> <span id="s791">And I turned around; and here's a sea of humanity.</span> <span id="s792">And I could see over the top of their heads.</span> <span id="s793">And I could see the camp, uh, which wasn't very far from us.</span> <span id="s794">I could see the gates.</span> <span id="s795">I could see the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s796">I could see the towers.</span> <span id="s797">And I could actually see the...the hanging ropes, where we cut all these people down.</span> <span id="s798">And incidently, in those ropes...Hopper had come to me, uh, earlier, and he brought me over there after they cut them down.</span> <span id="s799">And these people--most of them that had clothing on--they tied their wrists behind them, and then they hung them by the wrist backwards.</span> <span id="s800">There was two people, two men, that were nude.</span> <span id="s801">They tied their wrists behind them and...with piano wire; and then they took a hook of some kind, and they ran it through their privates.</span> <span id="s802">And they hung them upside down and left them that way.</span> <span id="s803">Which is an appalling thing to do to somebody.</span> <span id="s804">Anyway, this woman came to me.</span> <span id="s805">And she [was] telling...trying to tell me that she didn't know.</span> <span id="s806">The odor of this whole area was terrible.</span> <span id="s807">And then I turned back to her, after looking back at the camp and even seeing the ropes from this distance; and I slapped her hard across the face.</span> <span id="s808">I was infur...I was furious.</span> <span id="s809">And I called her a..</span> <span id="s810">.</span> <span id="s811">a damn liar.</span> <span id="s812">And she fell to the ground, let go of my shirt.</span> <span id="s813">And she was crying.</span> <span id="s814">And we all walked around her and kept on going.</span> <span id="s815">All of a sudden...and I ordered my men then... Now, [when] we got to the buildings, I said, "Some of you guys start going through these...this building over here.</span> <span id="s816">Some of you guys start going through there."</span> <span id="s817">All of a sudden, the...the survivors themselves began running like mad.</span> <span id="s818">And I said, "Whoa!"</span> <span id="s819">I started yelling at them, "Whoa!</span> <span id="s820">Wait a minute!</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Come back here!"</span> <span id="s822">I says, "You can't go in there.</span> <span id="s823">There's going to be shooting.</span> <span id="s824">And they're going to go there."</span> <span id="s825">And I says, uh...and I realized now, looking at this massive crowd that there's no way 16 of us are gonna, uh, control this mob--especially if they get excited.</span> <span id="s826">So I told them, "Okay.</span> <span id="s827">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s828">You help find the...the German soldier."</span> <span id="s829">"But," I says, "He's my prisoner.</span> <span id="s830">You bring him back here, and you put him right there on the ground.</span> <span id="s831">I'll stay right here."</span> <span id="s832">So I stood in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s833">My men and the survivors started going through all the buildings, all the closets, and everything else.</span> <span id="s834">They found...actually found armed, uh, Wehrmacht soldiers, uh, and dragged them down the street.</span> <span id="s835">They were spitting at them.</span> <span id="s836">They were kicking at them, and all this; but they, uh, abided by my rule, and they brought them and threw them on the ground beside me.</span> <span id="s837">When I..</span> <span id="s838">.</span> <span id="s839">I noticed that they would start getting excited and start talking like mad, then I would tell them, "Okay.</span> <span id="s840">Go find me some more, uh, German soldiers."</span> <span id="s841">And they'd take off and they'd start scattering, running again.</span> <span id="s842">When they did that, then I ordered one of my men to take these prisoners; and take them back behind and turn them over as prisoners.</span> <span id="s843">I didn't want a massacre here.</span> <span id="s844">We finally came to the edge of the city, after going through.</span> <span id="s845">There wasn't much of a fight in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">The...most of everybody had deserted.</span> <span id="s847">And then Captain...uh, the Colonel of our battalion ordered us into the woods instead.</span> <span id="s848">Uh, which was normal procedure; because we knew once the German army found out that we had taken the city, that they would actually blow up their own city with artillery.</span> <span id="s849">So I turned around to the survivors.</span> <span id="s850">And I told them...I said, "Now, I want all of you to go back.</span> <span id="s851">We're going in the forest.</span> <span id="s852">All of you go back to the camp, where you're gonna be safe.</span> <span id="s853">Because now the Germans are going to shell the city, and blow...destroy it.</span> <span id="s854">And I don't want you people hurt."</span> <span id="s855">They abided; and they turned around.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Uh, many of them throwing kisses to us, and that kind of thing (clearing throat) there.</span> <span id="s857">The... We went into the woods and dug in for the night.</span> <span id="s858">And then I started to walk from hole to hole.</span> <span id="s859">Little foxholes, two men usually in each hole.</span> <span id="s860">And I was checking for the positions, to make sure they were digging in the right position for defense and all that.</span> <span id="s861">As I came to each hole--and I'm standing up in the dead of night, and I'm looking down at the men--and I believe that every single man was crying.</span> <span id="s862">And they'd look up at me; and generally, the gist of it was that most of them looked up at me and said...asked me, "Why?"</span> <span id="s863">Of course, I understood what they were asking me.</span> <span id="s864">Why did the Germans do that to those people?</span> <span id="s865">And I had no answer for them.</span> <span id="s866">The next morning, or sometime during the night, we moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">And we began engaging the German Army and chasing them through the woods.</span> <span id="s868">And, uh, we came to a huge valley.</span> <span id="s869">The entire battalion came to the valley.</span> <span id="s870">And the Germans were across the valley... and with ack-ack batteries.</span> <span id="s871">And they were firing...now firing at us.</span> <span id="s872">So that Colonel Hook decided that the only way to take them was to order us to, uh, spread out as far as we could, and stand up and walk across the entire valley.</span> <span id="s873">And which we did.</span> <span id="s874">As we got...uh, I had one of the points.</span> <span id="s875">In other words, the foremost troops in the group.</span> <span id="s876">And as we come to the edge of the, uh, hills and started to go up the hills, the Germans that were up there on the artillery guns began to desert their guns and run.</span> <span id="s877">We climbed up and began [to] overrun the guns themselves.</span> <span id="s878">And at this point, I noticed two of my new men, that, uh, just came into combat for the first time, had three German SS prisoners.</span> <span id="s879">The SS wore different uniforms entirely than the Wehrmacht did.</span> <span id="s880">And I noticed...at that point, I ran...began to run over to where they were.</span> <span id="s881">And I fired a shot at one of them.</span> <span id="s882">One of the SS troopers had his hands down like this.</span> <span id="s883">And I fired a shot at his feet; and I yelled for him to "Hands hoch!"</span> <span id="s884">-- [to] put his hands high.</span> <span id="s885">And my two men began to call out, "Well, we got the situation well in hand."</span> <span id="s886">And I told them they were crazy; that they were almost dead men.</span> <span id="s887">And I pointed out that the one SS trooper with his hands down low was reaching down to touch the buckle on his belt.</span> <span id="s888">It was a big brass buckle, with a Swastika and so on on it.</span> <span id="s889">Touch a button, the heavy brass buckle dropped down.</span> <span id="s890">Instantly, three little tiny barrels of 22 shots drop down and would fire directly into your belly.</span> <span id="s891">And we....</span> <span id="s892">Thus, we called them "belly guns."</span> <span id="s893">And so all this time that I was chastising my men and teaching them this, I was watching the eyes--or the faces--of these SS troopers.</span> <span id="s894">They had the Death['s]-Head SS insignia on them.</span> <span id="s895">So then I knew by the expression on their face, that one...which one could speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">And I addressed him immediately.</span> <span id="s897">And I said, "Were you men in this camp behind us?"</span> <span id="s898">And the SS trooper looked at me, and he realized I knew he spoke English.</span> <span id="s899">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s900">And then I searched for a question.</span> <span id="s901">And I knew it was ridiculous for me to ask him why they put people behind the prison...behind barbed wire, why they tortured them and murdered them and all this; because of the attitude of the German nation at that time.</span> <span id="s902">So I finally decided; and asked him, "Well, why didn't you, at least, take care of the...treat the diseases in the camp?"</span> <span id="s903">And he look at me, and he stood erect.</span> <span id="s904">And he said, "Why should we?</span> <span id="s905">They were all going to die anyway."</span> <span id="s906">And I had everything I could do to control my temper, and not kill the three of them right then and there.</span> <span id="s907">So I reached out, and I grabbed the, uh...the, uh...the Death['s]-Head insignia off all three of them.</span> <span id="s908">I took the belly gun off the one; and I took another belt buckle off the...off a second one.</span> <span id="s909">And (clearing throat) with our morals....</span> <span id="s910">And people have asked me many times since then, "At the scene, or leaving the camp... When you left the camp, why didn't you go into the city and shoot every German that you found?"</span> <span id="s911">And the only answer I have is that because the Germans--or the German SS troopers, in particular--became animals in those days didn't mean that I could lower myself to those standards.</span> <span id="s912">And that was a very, very important part, or fact[or], in those days: that we had to have something to stand by and believe in.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Uh, did you interrogate these, uh, three SS men, uh, any further, or did they go off...?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: No.</span> <span id="s915">Uh, we just uh searched them thoroughly and, uh, made sure that they didn't have any weapons, or any--like the SS normal...very often did--have, uh, TNT inside their shirts.</span> <span id="s916">And they...at times, they would actually blow themselves up--and you with them--as you searched them.</span> <span id="s917">But we, uh...we searched them thoroughly.</span> <span id="s918">And then, uh, I detailed one man to take them back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our company headquarters.</span> <span id="s919">And...and thus back to a prison camp.</span> <span id="s920">But they were marked as war crimes, as were the German women guards at the camp, uh, there.</span> <span id="s921">Uh, now, we really didn't understand what would happen to them from that point on.</span> <span id="s922">Except that they would...we hoped, would draw more attention than the other prisoners would, uh, that we would turn back to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: At that point, did you run into other camps, or other...?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s925">Then we continued on that particular day, as I remember.</span> <span id="s926">And now we had learned, uh... In fact, we had overrun the column that had gone out the back side of that camp.</span> <span id="s927">I believe--and...and I'm assuming--uh, uh, but through certain other facts, that in this particular column was Dov Shelanski (ph), who eventually became the Prime Minister of Israel.Uh, I do understand, uh, that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were killing the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our line.</span> <span id="s928">Now, we had cut through and cut them off and...uh ...the men, as I can remember at this particular column, they uh... the men were coming down out of the woods and seeing and hearing the Germans shooting the prisoners.</span> <span id="s929">And perhaps...and they were bayoneting them, and whatever.</span> <span id="s930">I believe they shot everyone of those guards.</span> <span id="s931">They didn't give them a chance to surrender.</span> <span id="s932">But then they relieved these prisoners that were coming out of the camp.</span> <span id="s933">Now, we moved on; and we were coming to another camp not very far away, called Moosburg.</span> <span id="s934">The quick, uh, history of Moosburg that it was designed as a Stalag [NB: Prisoner of War camp] for the airmen.And they were normally treated rather quite well during the war, until this period of time.</span> <span id="s935">The camp was designed for 3,000 prisoners.</span> <span id="s936">Now, as we overran the camp, [it] held over 30,000 prisoners in it.</span> <span id="s937">Instead of having just airmen, prisoners from the Allies--that would be the Canadians, English, and the Americans--they now held a lot of Jews that had been taken away from the master camp at Dachau and Dachau, uh, No. 2 were in Moosburg.</span> <span id="s938">There were many of our own men [NB: from the US 394th Infantry Regiment], that were captured during the Battle of the Bulge, uh, were brought down on forced march.</span> <span id="s939">And they knew they didn't have a chance, apparently, to go by and go into Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s940">So they detoured them into Moosburg.</span> <span id="s941">At this point, we had....because of Dachau 3B, we knew that what the Germans were doing...that they were taking prisoners out the back gate.</span> <span id="s942">So our battalion that night made a "pincer movement"--as the Germans called it--attacked heavily, and one point broke through the German line.</span> <span id="s943">We came in during the night, behind the camp of Moosburg.</span> <span id="s944">In front, the armored uh...uh, battalion that was attached to us came in at the main gate.</span> <span id="s945">I understand that they had a bit of fight to begin with; and then they broke in and blew their way in the gate, and came in the front gate.</span> <span id="s946">Uh, then...uh, I and my men were given, shall we say, a little bit of a reprieve and told to come in the back gate.</span> <span id="s947">And we started finding some of our own buddies, that had been captured during the Bulge, in there.</span> <span id="s948">Uh, which was an incredible thing; because at this stage of the war and everything else, whether on purpose or design....</span> <span id="s949">Uh, but all these men were horribly starved.</span> <span id="s950">These were American soldiers, Jews...as I say, there were other Europeans there.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">They were many... The... And we noticed distinctly that the British, Canadians, American airmen that were there were in much better physical condition.</span> <span id="s952">They were much better treated, whether by...by design or...or events, uh, there.</span> <span id="s953">The American soldier from the 99th Division, the 106th and the 28th Division that were brought in, in these columns were in horrible condition.</span> <span id="s954">And, uh, of course, as I say, we got a chance to talk with some of them.</span> <span id="s955">And I remember so distinctly some of the men talking to me excitedly.</span> <span id="s956">And they said, "Do you remember when we were back in Camp Maxey, Texas, and two orders were--when we were declared hot...." In other words, the outfit was fit for combat, and we were now going 21 There has been no Prime Minister of Israel by this name since 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">22 According to US military records, this would have happened around April 29 or April 30, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">23 Officially designated by the Nazis as Stalag VIIA.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">to go to Europe in combat.</span> <span id="s960">Two orders came down from the higher command.</span> <span id="s961">Number one, that all men with tattoos would have their tattoos removed at their cost.</span> <span id="s962">No reason given for that.</span> <span id="s963">Now we had gone through Dachau, we knew why.</span> <span id="s964">But obviously, the American Army knew long time before what was happening to prisoners.</span> <span id="s965">Number two, all men in the line companies--now, roughly speaking, half the infantry, uh, divisions are behind the lines as intelligence, as supply, artillery, and all this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s966">But the linemen were the men who were going to actually do the fighting, were in the line companies, [and] all had to be circumcised.</span> <span id="s967">And I understand the 106th Division, which was formed about the same time we were, was treated the same way.</span> <span id="s968">Now, these men were describing in Moosburg what happened. "</span> <span id="s969">...that you remember back there, when we were circumcised?"</span> <span id="s970">"Yes, I remember."</span> <span id="s971">Now, when they were captured during the Battle of the Bulge and the Germans began examining them, they found these men circumcised--at the same period of time that the Germans are hunting all over Europe for the Jew, the only men in Europe at that time that were circumcised.</span> <span id="s972">And here they had black men.</span> <span id="s973">They had Indians.</span> <span id="s974">They had Mexicans.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">And they had all the different religious men were circumcised.</span> <span id="s976">And I would assume that they were probably dumbfounded.</span> <span id="s977">But they separated them from the other Americans.</span> <span id="s978">The Black men, almost immediately as soon as they captured them, they took them aside.</span> <span id="s979">And we're finding out now they piano wired their wrists behind them; and then they began to bayonet them, sticking the bayonets up under their throat here, through their privates, and through other parts of their bodies first, before they finally ran them through and killed them.</span> <span id="s980">And they left them.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: These were soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: These were American soldiers.</span> <span id="s983">Black men.</span> <span id="s984">Uh, I have now been asking an awful lot of the ex-POWs the same question.</span> <span id="s985">"Have you, while you were an American soldier...prisoner of the Germans, did you--on the force marches, the death marches, or in the prison camps--ever see any American Black soldiers?"</span> <span id="s986">And every one of them, at this point now--and I'm getting an awful lot of letters in--every one of them answered me, "No."</span> <span id="s987">They've never seen a Black prisoner back in Germany.</span> <span id="s988">In the columns, as they were captured and taken back to behind the lines during the Bulge, the SS troopers who--most of them could speak English-- began ordering the prisoners to expose their dog tags.</span> <span id="s989">So the American took the dog tags out, [and] hung them out.</span> <span id="s990">Immediately, the Germans started...uh, the SS trooper started going down, uh, the prisoners, looking at their dog tags.</span> <span id="s991">Your name is on it.</span> <span id="s992">There is a letter designat...on the top, designating your blood type; and on the bottom, there is a letter designating your religion.</span> <span id="s993">Every man with a letter H--"Hebrew"--was immediately pushed aside, and their heads were blown off right there.</span> <span id="s994">They were also looking for the man of German descent.</span> <span id="s995">Apparently, the Germans resented that they didn't go to Germany and join the German Army.</span> <span id="s996">But immediately in the columns, as I understand now from these men, they realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s997">They began--the Indians, the Mexicans, the men of dark skin--began swapping dog tags with the Jew.</span> <span id="s998">Other men, uh, Catholics and Protestant, began passing up their Bibles to the Jews.</span> <span id="s999">And thus, they could...many of them bluffed their way through.</span> <span id="s1000">Uh, very close friend of mine--George Golman, from Dallas, Texas--uh, still had... Last year, when he called me from Dallas, and he told me: he says, "Whitey," he says, "you know, I still have that Bible that saved my life."</span> <span id="s1001">He said, "When the SS trooper came for me, he started to reach out for the dogtag.</span> <span id="s1002">And I started telling him that I was a Catholic."</span> <span id="s1003">And he says, "I can recite anything in the book.</span> <span id="s1004">You open the page, and I'll recite it to you."</span> <span id="s1005">And he bluffed his way; uh, and the SS trooper moved on.</span> <span id="s1006">And thus this...these tactics saved a lot...a lot of these men's lives.</span> <span id="s1007">It was an incredible facts that are coming out now, of what happened to those men.</span> <span id="s1008">Now, I find with, uh, a lot of these men are telling me that as they...those who survived the marches--where they were brutalized, beaten, some shot, uh, a great many of them horribly starved.</span> <span id="s1009">They picked up many of the diseases en route; and, of course, especially dysentery.</span> <span id="s1010">Many of them probably died of dysentery.</span> <span id="s1011">But those who survived to get to the different camps--such as Hammelburg.</span> <span id="s1012">Uh, it's a key camp.</span> <span id="s1013">As the survivors got into the camp, they were detailed so many men to a barracks in the prison camp.</span> <span id="s1014">And this is a Stalag, now--for POWs.</span> <span id="s1015">Not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1016">And these men then were...went into the barracks and were assigned a bunk.</span> <span id="s1017">Immediately, in came a group of German soldiers to each barrack; and commanded that the "Jew boys" step forward, is the way the termed it.</span> <span id="s1018">The prisoners in there began yelling out, calling out to the men: "Don't do it!</span> <span id="s1019">Don't do it!"</span> <span id="s1020">Unfortunately, some of the Jews stepped forward.</span> <span id="s1021">These are American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1022">And they were immediately taken out.</span> <span id="s1023">Now, others did not step forward and, uh, declare themselves.</span> <span id="s1024">The men who declared themselves as Jews were immediately taken out of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1025">They were never seen again.</span> <span id="s1026">Over and over again, the other prisoners keep telling me this.</span> <span id="s1027">Now, along came a letter from another man--uh, McCracken, his name is-- and he was in the regimental, uh, medics.</span> <span id="s1028">And he said he was among the men who liberated that camp of Hammelburg.</span> <span id="s1029">He began exploring, after the excitement was all over; and he went into one particular building, and down into the basement.</span> <span id="s1030">And here he found a room, as he declares, as a execution room.</span> <span id="s1031">One whole wall covered with lead and bullet marks.</span> <span id="s1032">At the base of the, uh, wall is a trench, to carry the blood, and a drainhole.</span> <span id="s1033">We're trying to investigate much deeper into these facts, uh, as we go along now.</span> <span id="s1034">But all these little facts are starting to come out, and put a much better picture of what was happening.</span> <span id="s1035">But it was, uh, very strange to find an execution chamber in a Stalag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: So, uh, from your, uh... After you left Dachau and went to the next camp, uh...which was... A: Moosburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Yah.</span> <span id="s1038">The Moosburg camp.</span> <span id="s1039">What happened after that?</span> <span id="s1040">Did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1042">We then moved on out of the camp, leaving the prisoners behind.</span> <span id="s1043">Uh, and then we were heading toward a city called Landshut, not very far from there.</span> <span id="s1044">And, uh, here there was another camp.</span> <span id="s1045">Uh, it was in our minds not significant.</span> <span id="s1046">It wasn't a horror camp--at least, as much as I know about it.</span> <span id="s1047">Uh, this camp at Landshut, uh, contained, uh, I believe, almost all English and Canadian, uh, troops.</span> <span id="s1048">Uh, they had already been liberated at this point, as we were marching through; and a lot of the prisoners were coming out of the camps.</span> <span id="s1049">And they, of course, waving to you as...as normal, and uh, even saluting us, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1050">And it was, uh, a stage of glory, should we say, and happiness at this point.</span> <span id="s1051">And we continued on by the camp itself, and we began... Now, this was on the border of Austria.</span> <span id="s1052">And we that night, uh, took over some farm houses.</span> <span id="s1053">And then, uh, Captain Pat called me, uh, to his headquarters--that farm house he was in--and he told me... Now, he assigned me that I was gonna, uh, take a patrol into Austria.</span> <span id="s1054">And this patrol, he says, "I'm gonna ask you to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1055">Uh, and your men."</span> <span id="s1056">Uh, he gave me the details.</span> <span id="s1057">As best as I can remember now, uh, that I'm being assigned three tanks with rubber tracks.</span> <span id="s1058">I'm to take my men on the top of those tanks, to protect them.</span> <span id="s1059">We're to hit the German lines, uh, during the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1060">I believe that was about, probably, two o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1061">And break through; not fight unless we had to, but keep on going.</span> <span id="s1062">Just fight our way through, and go behind the German lines.</span> <span id="s1063">Keep on going down this particular road for approximately 30, 35 miles.</span> <span id="s1064">And down in there somewhere was a bridge that I was to try to take and stop the Germans from blowing up.</span> <span id="s1065">That was my basic mission.</span> <span id="s1066">Thus, we did this.</span> <span id="s1067">And as I believe to this day, uh, that, uh, a famous cartoonist--now I can't think of his name...uh, Bill Mauldin--uh, was standing in the background, in the kitchen at the time.</span> <span id="s1068">And he came up; and he asked me...he asked Captain Pat if he could go on that patrol.</span> <span id="s1069">And Captain told him, he says, "Well, that's not my decision."</span> <span id="s1070">He says, "You'll have to ask Sargeant Whiteway."</span> <span id="s1071">And I looked at him, and I said, "Well, you understand, this is apparently a suicide patrol.</span> <span id="s1072">That we're not going to get any help for some time.</span> <span id="s1073">I cannot protect you.</span> <span id="s1074">You are a civilian, technically; and you can't carry any weapons, according to the Geneva Conference [Convention].</span> <span id="s1075">And I cannot protect you.</span> <span id="s1076">I don't have enough men."</span> <span id="s1077">He said, "I agree."</span> <span id="s1078">He says, "I want to go with you."</span> <span id="s1079">So he rode on one of the tanks.</span> <span id="s1080">But I..</span> <span id="s1081">.</span> <span id="s1082">I think I put him on the third tank.</span> <span id="s1083">And uh...so we broke through the lines.</span> <span id="s1084">We had a..</span> <span id="s1085">.</span> <span id="s1086">we had a few gun fights, and...but we kept on going.</span> <span id="s1087">And uh...or reboarded the tanks after we, uh, initially, uh, cleared the way.</span> <span id="s1088">And then we rode all night, and through ...'til just about dawn.</span> <span id="s1089">As I can remember, it was daylight when we came within sight of the bridge.</span> <span id="s1090">And as we...then got off the tanks and we spread my men out to protect my tanks, and then we started to move up.</span> <span id="s1091">And we got pretty close to the bridge; and the Germans there blew the bridge up in our faces.</span> <span id="s1092">So now the mission was blown.</span> <span id="s1093">Uh, the only thing I could do, there was a clearing--an opening, a little small field.</span> <span id="s1094">And I told the tanks, I says, "Okay, pull in here.</span> <span id="s1095">We'll make a big circle around you and dig in.</span> <span id="s1096">And you guys dig the tanks in the middle of that."</span> <span id="s1097">Which we did.</span> <span id="s1098">Now, the Germans were coming in from all directions; and they totally surrounded us.</span> <span id="s1099">And we could see them put a blockade up, uh, on the road, so we couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s1100">And we were sweat...began to sweat.</span> <span id="s1101">We stayed there for countless hours.</span> <span id="s1102">And everybody's asking me, "What the heck are they doing?"</span> <span id="s1103">I said, "The only thing I can think of..." And, of course, at times I was communicating with the tankers, who radioed back our condition.</span> <span id="s1104">Uh, that the Germans were waiting to bring in "Tiger" tanks to blow our tanks up.</span> <span id="s1105">And we had no defense against them.</span> <span id="s1106">But we waited and waited; and finally, we could hear way down the valley an American jeep.</span> <span id="s1107">They have a very distinct sound.</span> <span id="s1108">And he was winding his way down.</span> <span id="s1109">And so we kept looking there, and finally we could see him.</span> <span id="s1110">And we started yelling to him to go back, go back.</span> <span id="s1111">He approached the, uh...the blockade.</span> <span id="s1112">The Germans opened up the blockade and let him in.</span> <span id="s1113">We couldn't understand what the heck was happening.</span> <span id="s1114">And then the two guys in the jeep drove right up to us through the German lines; and they yelled out, "It's all over!</span> <span id="s1115">Forget about it.</span> <span id="s1116">It's the end of the war!"</span> <span id="s1117">24 In the European theatre, the war ended May 9, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: While you were in Cherbourg, did you also run into some prisoners of war there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Ok.</span> <span id="s1120">Yah.</span> <span id="s1121">After the war, and on our...so-called "on our way home," uh, for discharge.</span> <span id="s1122">And we took over; and we were assigned occupation, temporarily, uh, in the city of Cherbourg, France.</span> <span id="s1123">And we had 200,000 German prisoners there.</span> <span id="s1124">And at times, uh, we would go up, uh, between--when we were off-duty, and so on--uh, on patrol, we would go up and we'd watch the Germans playing European football.</span> <span id="s1125">As today, we call it soccer.</span> <span id="s1126">And they were very good at it.</span> <span id="s1127">But, of course, they had nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s1128">So uh, they'd be out there playing; and then they come over talking to us, uh...uh, at the end of their games, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">And, uh, they could...uh, some of them could speak English.</span> <span id="s1130">Some could speak some English, and visa versa.</span> <span id="s1131">We was already learned a certain amount of German.</span> <span id="s1132">So we could communicate quite easily.</span> <span id="s1133">And I..</span> <span id="s1134">.</span> <span id="s1135">there was a colonel, a German officer, standing there.</span> <span id="s1136">And I questioned him.</span> <span id="s1137">I said, "You know, I'm very puzzled about one thing."</span> <span id="s1138">I said, "Everywhere I've gone in Europe here, during the war and after the war, that I can find no young men.</span> <span id="s1139">In France, in Belgium, over in Denmark, there's no young men.</span> <span id="s1140">What happened to them?"</span> <span id="s1141">And the colonel stood erect.</span> <span id="s1142">And he said, "Well, we officers--or we Germans--occupying these countries had a problem.</span> <span id="s1143">That we knew that there would be one group that would most resent what we were going to do to the civilians.</span> <span id="s1144">That was the young men.</span> <span id="s1145">So as we overran the towns, the villages, the neighborhoods and the cities, we immediately rounded up all the people.</span> <span id="s1146">And we separated all the young men from 16...or 15 or 16 to 25, stand over there against a stone wall.</span> <span id="s1147">We set up firing squads, and we immediately shot everyone of them, in every living country we went into.</span> <span id="s1148">Voilà!</span> <span id="s1149">No problem."</span> <span id="s1150">(Clearing throat)</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Shocking!</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Very shocking.</span> <span id="s1153">Uh... But then I began to understand the German mind.</span> <span id="s1154">Of course, there were many other things that came out of this.</span> <span id="s1155">Of their attitudes of the German occupation of these countries, and so on; and their intimidation and their firing squads, and why, are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: In all your experience that you've already described to us, what were your feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">What...what would you like to say about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1159">Of course, uh, after, uh...at the very end of the war there, we did overrun--right somewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the Mauthausens.</span> <span id="s1160">There was 42, as I understand now.</span> <span id="s1161">And we saw some awful horrors there.</span> <span id="s1162">And even, uh, cannibalism in the camp.</span> <span id="s1163">But these... Like Dachau.</span> <span id="s1164">And we were so shocked.</span> <span id="s1165">And Professor Crawford asked me after the war, he said... Now, he asked me the same question about my emotions, how I felt...thought about it.</span> <span id="s1166">And he asked me another question, "Did you men during the war--after you left the camp, or after the war, or even at home--talk about these terrible camps and these horrors that you saw?"</span> <span id="s1167">And I suddenly realized, number one, that all this time I had been assuming that as we radioed--like, for instance, in Dachau--that we radioed back constantly all the things that we were finding to the company; to be reported, we assumed, on the, uh, daily reports of the military, that here they, uh...all the reports itself would be turned in.</span> <span id="s1168">But I also assumed that due to us communicating with the men behind us, that all of a sudden everybody in the battalion would be coming into the camp and taking a look at all these horrors that we saw.</span> <span id="s1169">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1170">Nobody came.</span> <span id="s1171">And we were ordered out, to go help the battalion fight for the camp.</span> <span id="s1172">I found out since that somebody in the division has deleted every single word of every camp all over Germany that we had entered.</span> <span id="s1173">Every single word had been disappeared.</span> <span id="s1174">Nobody seemed to care.</span> <span id="s1175">Of the human misery, or anything else there.</span> <span id="s1176">And this shocked me.</span> <span id="s1177">But at the end of the war--without even knowing about this, but just assuming that everybody else around me and the company had gone in--it was so distasteful to remember this that we tried to shut it off.</span> <span id="s1178">We did not ever talk amongst each other about one single word about any of these things that happened in the camps.</span> <span id="s1179">From the shock, from all the human misery, uh, in France, Belgium....the misery among ourselves, the misery about all the Germans that we shot and left wounded on the ground, crying and begging...uh, to the German civilians who were bombed and fire-bombed.</span> <span id="s1180">It was total misery all the time we were over there.</span> <span id="s1181">So, by the end of the war, we became very, very bitter men.</span> <span id="s1182">And it took us a long time to come out of this bitterness.</span> <span id="s1183">Of the human misery.</span> <span id="s1184">Not so much, uh, because of the war and what the Germans did, but the...all the misery that we had seen, of everybody.</span> <span id="s1185">Uh, those are terrible, terrible memories.</span> <span id="s1186">And for 40 years, approximately, I buried all those memories in my mind.</span> <span id="s1187">When I came back home, I remember trying to tell some of the adventures, some of the things that happened to me.</span> <span id="s1188">And everybody--my friends, my family--the minute you'd start talking about the war at all, they'd say, "Forget it.</span> <span id="s1189">It's all over.</span> <span id="s1190">We don't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1191">We don't care."</span> <span id="s1192">And this... And I actually was even humiliated.</span> <span id="s1193">"Oh.</span> <span id="s1194">You were in the big one!"</span> <span id="s1195">And things like that.</span> <span id="s1196">And becoming embarrassed or humiliated like that, that you'd bottle the things up even deeper.</span> <span id="s1197">So finally when Professor Crawford approached me the first time, and I began to remember some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">When I first started to testify and talk about it, even for the first few years, I could only remember just so much.</span> <span id="s1199">And it was all kind of jumbled, and locations were jumbled in my mind.</span> <span id="s1200">After a while, all of a sudden, things started to straighten out.</span> <span id="s1201">But I have not had a nightmare since.</span> <span id="s1202">And that's a very big point, uh, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to, uh...to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Uh, there is so very many stories of human misery and so on.</span> <span id="s1205">But pertaining to the camps...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: You've been very, very helpful in this...in this very unpleasant recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: It is...very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1208">I hope that people can understand, uh, what it was like.</span> <span id="s1209">Hmm.</span> <span id="s1210">Q: Thank you very much for coming and talking to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">PHOTOGRAPHS Curtis Whiteway in uniform at Camp Craw, South Carolina, where he received training as an Army Ranger.</span> <span id="s1213">He was 18 years old at the time the photo was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Surrender of Lt.
