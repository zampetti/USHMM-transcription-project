Bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Born in New York City, August 4th, 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family background.</span> <span id="s18">Where did your family come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My parents came -- My biological parents came from Romania, which I understand is now Austria.</span> <span id="s20">And then my father remarried.</span> <span id="s21">My other mother came from Russia, Minsk in Russia.</span> <span id="s22">Both came over about – all three of them came over about the same time, 1914, 1913, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span> <span id="s26">Do you have any?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I have one brother, who is 84 years old, in Florida; I have a half sister who lives in New York; and then I had a stepbrother who passed away about seven, eight years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Let's talk right now a little bit about your childhood.</span> <span id="s29">When you said "New York City," whereabouts in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And what kind of schooling did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I went through high school, and that's as far as I went.</span> <span id="s33">Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn and James Monroe High School in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s34">Those were the two high schools I went to.</span> <span id="s35">My parents kept moving around because my father was a grocer, kept selling one store, moving to another borough, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: How would you describe your family?</span> <span id="s37">Was it a very close family?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Not close, but a loving family.</span> <span id="s39">My father -- my mother passed away when I was five years old and my father remarried two years later.</span> <span id="s40">So there were two years that I was sort of kicked around from relative to relative.</span> <span id="s41">And some of them didn't want me because I wasn't a very nice child, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, I was a little wild, a little cantankerous.</span> <span id="s44">As a matter of fact, my mother always used to say, "Don't worry, you'll have children."</span> <span id="s45">I had a son who was just as wild as I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: My mother -- my second mother was a Hebrew school teacher.</span> <span id="s48">And the truth is, I got so much of religion that as soon as I graduated -- rather, had my bar mitzvah -- I quit the synagogue.</span> <span id="s49">And that was it.</span> <span id="s50">That was the end of my Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did you have any other feelings about being Jewish at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I didn't like being Jewish.</span> <span id="s53">I really didn't.</span> <span id="s54">Only because I had so much of it.</span> <span id="s55">And I went to a Hebrew school where the old people used to look at young kids as Americana failed.</span> <span id="s56">I don't know if you understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s57">Wild animals.</span> <span id="s58">Because we want through the halls of the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s59">And I just couldn't wait to get out of there.</span> <span id="s60">So my Hebrew education was very, very nil until I got into the service.</span> <span id="s61">There, I found out that it was pleasant.</span> <span id="s62">We discussed history with the chaplains and I began to find my religion -- not that I was ever religious, but I began to find out a little bit about Judaism at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: When you say you went to Hebrew school, was that an after-school Hebrew school and you went to regular elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: After-school Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What languages did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: My parents spoke Yiddish, and of course I never knew I could talk Yiddish until I got into the service in Germany.</span> <span id="s67">And that's where I began to speak half German, half Yiddish.</span> <span id="s68">That consists of my Yiddish today.</span> <span id="s69">And it was only because my parents used to speak Yiddish in the house all the time that I sort of picked it up without realizing I could talk Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you have friends that were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Some.</span> <span id="s72">Not too many.</span> <span id="s73">I lived in Jewish neighborhoods most of the time, but I did have some.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Not really, because living in a Jewish neighborhood, I thought the whole world was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s77">Well, let's move on now.</span> <span id="s78">Did you have any other interests, any hobbies, any sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Well, in school I was on track, baseball, the usual things.</span> <span id="s80">Nothing outstanding.</span> <span id="s81">I was never a real good athlete, so to speak, but I enjoyed athletics.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Were you close to your siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span> <span id="s84">My brother, who's six years older than I, lived his own life.</span> <span id="s85">He was always single.</span> <span id="s86">He just got married maybe 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s87">He was always with the social bit.</span> <span id="s88">And we were never a close family.</span> <span id="s89">It was only after I got married that I began to have a family and a close family, my wife's family, my own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Now, you've graduated from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I went to work carrying the bags of a jewelry salesman.</span> <span id="s94">And it was quite an experience, and I did that for about a year or two.</span> <span id="s95">And then I went to work for a jewelry company.</span> <span id="s96">And for the beginning of my life before the service, that's about all I did, working for jewelry companies, because that's where my experience lie.</span> <span id="s97">And then I went into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: We're talking now probably around 1937, I guess, when you graduated from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What was your knowledge of Hitler at that point, or what was your knowledge of what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Very little or nothing at all.</span> <span id="s102">I only realized -- that's very interesting.</span> <span id="s103">I only realized what could be going on in Europe when I was in the service.</span> <span id="s104">And I remember sitting in a Jeep and reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper that they found out – I think it was in Poland, that they realized that Jews were being tortured.</span> <span id="s105">And they began to explain to us as to how the torture was going to be.</span> <span id="s106">And I read it.</span> <span id="s107">And I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s108">And I put the paper away and I went about my business.</span> <span id="s109">It never had any effect on me whatever, at all, until of course I went into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s110">And then I became Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So you were not aware of restrictions in Europe on the Jews in the mid '30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Some.</span> <span id="s113">I mean, I can't say I was completely ignorant of what was going on.</span> <span id="s114">I knew that the Jews were having trouble.</span> <span id="s115">As a matter of fact, we had relatives in Europe, my father did.</span> <span id="s116">I'm close to them today, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s117">And my father was trying to help them come over and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s118">But I don't know the details because I really didn't care at that time.</span> <span id="s119">I was too young.</span> <span id="s120">And I was worried about myself.</span> <span id="s121">I was worried about my well-being, so to speak, and finding a job.</span> <span id="s122">Those days, it was important to find a job and support yourself and move out of the house, which is what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: How old were you when you moved out?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Just before -- not long before I got married.</span> <span id="s125">I got married at 24.</span> <span id="s126">I must have moved out at 21, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s128">So now you had been working.</span> <span id="s129">And you said you moved out of the house.</span> <span id="s130">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Then the draft came along.</span> <span id="s132">I just want to get my facts straight.</span> <span id="s133">The draft came along, and I figured that's the greatest way out.</span> <span id="s134">That's the best thing for me.</span> <span id="s135">I didn't join because I was Jewish or because I looked to save the world.</span> <span id="s136">I joined to change my life.</span> <span id="s137">And this is the truth.</span> <span id="s138">I was rejected six times because I had a hernia.</span> <span id="s139">And each time I'd go down there in the hopes that they would let me get in.</span> <span id="s140">Finally they wouldn't let me get in, so I went for an operation, a hernia operation.</span> <span id="s141">It cost me $250, which I saved up.</span> <span id="s142">And was it the sixth time I went down there?</span> <span id="s143">I was rejected because of my eyesight.</span> <span id="s144">I was put on limited service.</span> <span id="s145">But the seventh time I got in.</span> <span id="s146">And as a matter of fact, I remember that first night in the service.</span> <span id="s147">I had already met my wife.</span> <span id="s148">I was going with her and so on.</span> <span id="s149">My first night in the service, they put me in a barracks with maybe 100 other guys, and I was on the top bunk.</span> <span id="s150">And there I was, lying on the bunk.</span> <span id="s151">And I'm looking at the ceiling, which was like a foot or two away.</span> <span id="s152">And I'm saying, "What am I doing here?</span> <span id="s153">Who needs this?</span> <span id="s154">And I volunteered for this?"</span> <span id="s155">And that was my introduction into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What month and what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: 1943.</span> <span id="s158">I got out in '45.</span> <span id="s159">Two and a half years I was in.</span> <span id="s160">I'm trying to think of the month.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What time of year?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I guess spring.</span> <span id="s163">Yeah, it must have been spring.</span> <span id="s164">Early spring or summer, something like that.</span> <span id="s165">If I had my discharge in front of me, I could tell.</span> <span id="s166">But I don't really remember the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And did you have any specific feelings about Hitler or what was happening at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s169">I just heard about it but very vaguely from -- I read newspapers.</span> <span id="s170">I'm an avid reader in that context.</span> <span id="s171">And it didn't affect me one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So where did you first go when you were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I went to Camp Upton, New York or New Jersey, I forget where.</span> <span id="s174">And we stayed there -- I was in the states for less than six months.</span> <span id="s175">From there, we went to Plattsburgh, New York, where I got married.</span> <span id="s176">And then we came down to Elkins, West Virginia.</span> <span id="s177">And then we went right to the port of embarkation in a period of about six months.</span> <span id="s178">And I went overseas to a place called Conington, England.</span> <span id="s179">Spent a nice time there.</span> <span id="s180">Never worrying about what the war was going to be like or anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Let's back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s182">Why did you try to keep volunteering?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I was a patriotic American.</span> <span id="s184">That's the only reason.</span> <span id="s185">Not because -- I had heard things, but it didn't affect me that much.</span> <span id="s186">I felt that it was my job.</span> <span id="s187">I had heard about Hitler; I can't say that I didn't.</span> <span id="s188">But it didn't affect me that much only because I didn't pay too much attention to any of that.</span> <span id="s189">And I was in there because I wanted to change my life, for one thing.</span> <span id="s190">And for another thing, I wanted to get into the service.</span> <span id="s191">I wanted something different.</span> <span id="s192">I wanted some adventure, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s195">And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being Yiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any more.</span> <span id="s196">So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I could possibly be.</span> <span id="s197">And I got along with most everybody.</span> <span id="s198">I never suffered any real discrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they took Fridays off and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s199">And they were discriminated against, not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Had you talked in detail with your parents about what was happening -- this is before you were drafted -- about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Never.</span> <span id="s202">This is solely my own doing.</span> <span id="s203">The only one I talked to really about it was my girlfriend, who is my wife now.</span> <span id="s204">And my parents just wouldn't -- didn't understand.</span> <span id="s205">They were European people.</span> <span id="s206">My mother, who is my second mother, was just as good to me as my original mother, who I barely remembered.</span> <span id="s207">And we had no rapport with each other.</span> <span id="s208">I couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s209">My father was busy in the grocery store.</span> <span id="s210">My second mother was there helping him.</span> <span id="s211">And I never saw my father, really.</span> <span id="s212">He'd go into the store before I got up, come back from the store after I was in bed.</span> <span id="s213">As a matter of fact, I remember one time I walked into the house and I looked into their bedroom as I passed.</span> <span id="s214">It was a railroad flat.</span> <span id="s215">And I looked into the bedroom and there was my father in bed.</span> <span id="s216">I had never seen my father in bed.</span> <span id="s217">And I looked in.</span> <span id="s218">I says, "Hi, Pop.</span> <span id="s219">How are you?"</span> <span id="s220">He says, "Not so good."</span> <span id="s221">I says, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s222">And I sat down.</span> <span id="s223">And it was like almost the first time I ever sat down with him.</span> <span id="s224">I says, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s225">He says, "I hurt my back and I can't move."</span> <span id="s226">And then I said to him, "Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in bed sick."</span> <span id="s227">I says, "I've never seen you that way before."</span> <span id="s228">He says, "Herbert," he says, "I can't afford to be sick."</span> <span id="s229">What I'm trying to bring out is, that was my upbringing, the work ethic and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s230">But close to my parents, I never was.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Let's jump ahead a little bit.</span> <span id="s232">You were drafted and you're now in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: England, a place Conington.</span> <span id="s234">We spent about three months there.</span> <span id="s235">Very, very pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s236">And then we moved down to Southampton, which was a staging area for the invasion of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What unit were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: 628th Light Equipment Engineers.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Of?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about 100 men.</span> <span id="s241">And we worked the shovels and the road graders and the bulldozers, and so on, clearing roads and so on.</span> <span id="s242">We were doing that in England as well.</span> <span id="s243">And we were moved from the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army.</span> <span id="s244">And then we were transferred as we went down to the Third Army.</span> <span id="s245">And then in Europe, I think we wound up with the Seventh Army.</span> <span id="s246">I'm not quite sure of these details.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And now you're in Southampton?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Southampton, waiting for the invasion.</span> <span id="s249">We were in Southampton I guess it must have been about a month until the invasion.</span> <span id="s250">And we went over about D-plus 10, 12, something like that.</span> <span id="s251">D-Day plus 10.</span> <span id="s252">I wasn't part of the initial invasion.</span> <span id="s253">But it was a little harrowing.</span> <span id="s254">And we got stuck on a sand bar.</span> <span id="s255">And finally they got us off and they were bombing us and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s256">From there, we landed on Utah Beach.</span> <span id="s257">I didn't even remember the beach until I sort of looked it up for my company.</span> <span id="s258">Utah Beach.</span> <span id="s259">And then from there, we sort of went inland through the hedgerows and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: At this point, did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews or did you know anything about camps in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s262">We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were under fire here and there, bombardments and so on.</span> <span id="s263">And I didn't have time to worry about anybody else but myself, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: What was it like for you to see dead bodies at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Oh, that's when we went into Germany.</span> <span id="s266">We had gone into Germany through Aachen.</span> <span id="s267">I remember that.</span> <span id="s268">And somebody said to us, "Hey, fellows, you better get up to this camp.</span> <span id="s269">There are a lot of dead bodies up there."</span> <span id="s270">A civilian told us.</span> <span id="s271">And we went there.</span> <span id="s272">And those are the pictures that I show you of what we actually saw.</span> <span id="s273">They never even had a chance to pick up the bodies.</span> <span id="s274">The bodies didn't even smell yet because they were so new.</span> <span id="s275">The Germans had left voluntarily because they were afraid of who was coming.</span> <span id="s276">And they took off.</span> <span id="s277">And we got there about an hour after they had shot a lot of the people.</span> <span id="s278">And we saw ovens -- I saw them myself -- with bodies piled in front of the ovens.</span> <span id="s279">The ovens seemed to be too small for the bodies.</span> <span id="s280">But then there was a ravine with a bunch of bodies in that they had spread lime on.</span> <span id="s281">And then it began to dawn on me what I was looking at.</span> <span id="s282">And then I became a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: We'll talk about Ohrdruf in a moment.</span> <span id="s284">Let's go back a little bit to France.</span> <span id="s285">Anything else -- any other combat experiences or any fighting that you went through in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Well, we were bombarded.</span> <span id="s287">And during the Bulge, the Germans were really shooting.</span> <span id="s288">We weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engineer outfit.</span> <span id="s289">And we had to move back into France until the invasion was over, the German invasion was over.</span> <span id="s290">And then as they cleared it up, we began to move in.</span> <span id="s291">And when we first got into Germany, it was -- really, there were snipers firing at us and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s292">But I was never in any real hand-to-hand or person-to-person combat per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you see any dead bodies at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Oh, all along.</span> <span id="s295">In France we always saw dead bodies.</span> <span id="s296">I'm talking about dead bodies of Germans.</span> <span id="s297">And all the way through, we had seen dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: How did you feel about seeing a dead body?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: At first, I was appalled.</span> <span id="s300">And after that, strangely enough, you get used to seeing bodies.</span> <span id="s301">You don't pay any attention to them.</span> <span id="s302">And if there's an odor, you walk over to the other side, but you leave the bodies there.</span> <span id="s303">We were just -- it's a matter of survival, really, being in the service under those conditions.</span> <span id="s304">And you're worried about yourself.</span> <span id="s305">That is, until I got to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Was your unit made up of other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: We had some.</span> <span id="s308">We had a few Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you stick together with them or did you mix with everybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s311">I had two basic friends who were Jewish -- three.</span> <span id="s312">One was the lieutenant.</span> <span id="s313">The other was -- the other two were buddies of mine.</span> <span id="s314">And we sort of -- the three of us stuck out together.</span> <span id="s315">The lieutenant, he was sort of in another category.</span> <span id="s316">And we went places together.</span> <span id="s317">We did things together and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Did you ever talk among yourselves about what was happening to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span> <span id="s320">And that surprises me.</span> <span id="s321">I'm so dedicated now to that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s322">I wasn't before.</span> <span id="s323">I really wasn't.</span> <span id="s324">And it's been since the site of the holocaust, since being in the concentration camp, that I really became Jewish.</span> <span id="s325">As a matter of fact, my son didn't want to be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become bar mitzvahed and so on.</span> <span id="s326">These two girls that I brought with me are fairly religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s328">Now you've crossed over the border into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, I think the first town I remember was Aachen.</span> <span id="s330">And then we moved past Aachen and we were told about the concentration camp which I just told you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Who told you about the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: A German.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: A German person or a German townsperson?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">See, I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish.</span> <span id="s336">And I was amazed to find out that I could talk German.</span> <span id="s337">As a matter of fact, I became the interpreter between the Germans and my outfit because the boy, "Hey, Bitter, he talks German."</span> <span id="s338">I was really talking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s339">That's where we found out, and that's where we went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s340">There were a few of us.</span> <span id="s341">I don't remember who they were.</span> <span id="s342">I know that my two buddies were among them but I don't remember who else.</span> <span id="s343">And then we saw the bodies --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s345">Let's back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s346">All right.</span> <span id="s347">This German townsperson tells you that there is a camp.</span> <span id="s348">And so what was the next thing that you did?</span> <span id="s349">Did you report this to your superior?</span> <span id="s350">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s352">We just -- a bunch of us went to where we -- he said there was a lot of dead bodies there.</span> <span id="s353">We didn't know whether they were Germans or Jewish or Americans or anything, so we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: How could you leave your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, we were all spread out.</span> <span id="s356">We were in various vehicles and so on.</span> <span id="s357">And remember, I was in an outfit with 100 men and we were attached to various divisions.</span> <span id="s358">So it was no problem.</span> <span id="s359">They just told us where it was, and we drove up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What was your rank at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Corporal.</span> <span id="s362">And we drove up there.</span> <span id="s363">And there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: "We" being who?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: The two buddies that I had, Jewish boys, Elliot Bass and Abe Corn.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Why did you want to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Only to see what was there.</span> <span id="s368">We were told there were bodies.</span> <span id="s369">And we had to find out what they were, whether they were Americans, whether they were Germans, whether they were -- we didn't know anything about, really, the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s370">We did not expect a concentration camp per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: What was the name or what were you told that the name of this location was?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: He just told us where it was.</span> <span id="s373">He didn't give us any name or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: How did he describe the location?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: He says, "There's a camp with bodies 3 miles away up this road."</span> <span id="s376">He says, "Why don't you go up there and look at it."</span> <span id="s377">See, the Germans were terribly afraid of us.</span> <span id="s378">They didn't want to be tortured.</span> <span id="s379">They thought that maybe we would come in and torture them.</span> <span id="s380">And of course, we weren't looking to cause any havoc.</span> <span id="s381">So we wanted to see what the bodies were that were up in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What date was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I don't remember the date.</span> <span id="s384">It was right after we went into Germany, after the -- better still, it was the day before Eisenhower, Bradley, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Patton?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: -- Patton were there.</span> <span id="s387">Of course, they came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So this must have been April 11th because they came on April 12th, 1945.</span> <span id="s389">Did you know the name of the place before you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I found out later.</span> <span id="s391">And that's one of the things that bugged me because we didn't know where we were, just that we were past Aachen and that there was this camp.</span> <span id="s392">And the pictures will show you exactly what we saw as we went through the fences.</span> <span id="s393">There was no resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s395">You are three young soldiers in a Jeep?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And you are driving up this road.</span> <span id="s398">What's the first sight that you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: We saw this fence, which was a barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s400">And as we drove in, we saw bodies lying all over the area.</span> <span id="s401">And we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s402">We didn't even know they were Jewish or anything like that.</span> <span id="s403">We just saw the bodies.</span> <span id="s404">And then we went in.</span> <span id="s405">And there were a number of people who were alive.</span> <span id="s406">A number of people.</span> <span id="s407">And they began to yell in Yiddish to us.</span> <span id="s408">And I understood Yiddish.</span> <span id="s409">And I began to talk to them and they began to tell us what went on, what camp it was.</span> <span id="s410">And this was all new to us.</span> <span id="s411">We had never experienced anything like this.</span> <span id="s412">And there was one Polish boy in that camp who spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s413">And surprisingly enough, he had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s414">And he held onto that bicycle.</span> <span id="s415">And he was the one that showed us around from place to place, showed us where they slept, showed us where the bodies were.</span> <span id="s416">And we were just absolutely appalled.</span> <span id="s417">That was a real revelation.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You had a camera with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">I always carried a camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And you so you took pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s423">It was after an hour or two of being there that we took the pictures because this Polish boy wanted food or whatever he wanted.</span> <span id="s424">And he took us around to the camp.</span> <span id="s425">And we wanted to see what it was.</span> <span id="s426">I had my camera with me all the time.</span> <span id="s427">And he took us into a -- these long cottages where they slept.</span> <span id="s428">Unlike what I've seen in the movies, these were like stalls for cattle, really.</span> <span id="s429">And there was a wooden bar in between the stalls.</span> <span id="s430">And they were packed with hay.</span> <span id="s431">And that's where they slept.</span> <span id="s432">They slept one right next to another.</span> <span id="s433">You could barely move in the stalls.</span> <span id="s434">And we went up and down.</span> <span id="s435">And then we saw the bodies in the – outside the ovens.</span> <span id="s436">I didn't see a crematorium there.</span> <span id="s437">I didn't know whether they were gassed or -- we didn't think of asking these questions.</span> <span id="s438">And then he took us to this pit where there must have been 500 bodies, something like that, covered with lime.</span> <span id="s439">And what they were going to do with these bodies is throw them into the pit because they couldn't burn all of them.</span> <span id="s440">They were going to throw these bodies into the pit, but they didn't have time.</span> <span id="s441">There was no time because the Americans were there.</span> <span id="s442">And they didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s443">All the Germans knew was that the Americans are coming, let's get out of here.</span> <span id="s444">And there wasn't a German in that camp as we walked in.</span> <span id="s445">But we see the Jews firsthand.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: What was your feeling when you first heard Yiddish words from these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I'm just trying to think.</span> <span id="s448">It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to various -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the Yiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak.</span> <span id="s449">For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with us, we used him as a KP.</span> <span id="s450">And he said to me one day -- we gave him a room when we came into this town.</span> <span id="s451">And he said to me, "Do you do you speak Yiddish?</span> <span id="s452">All right.</span> <span id="s453">Komm zu mine Zimmer."</span> <span id="s454">He said, "Come to my room."</span> <span id="s455">He wanted to show me something because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s456">And I says, "Okay.</span> <span id="s457">I says, "But was is dat Zimmer?"</span> <span id="s458">I had never heard of the word "Zimmer."</span> <span id="s459">He says "It's Zimmer," and he showed us.</span> <span id="s460">And he took me up to the room that he was staying in.</span> <span id="s461">And I says, "You mean a room?"</span> <span id="s462">And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic expressions that pick up the language.</span> <span id="s463">I never knew that a room was a Zimmer.</span> <span id="s464">And so that's the kind of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s465">I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How did you feel when they spoke Yiddish and you realized that these prisoners were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: It didn't quite hit me immediately or anything like that, but I began to feel it.</span> <span id="s468">And it was only when I met these girls that I began to realize what had -- the bodies, of course, you can't misinterpret.</span> <span id="s469">But I began to understand what was going on in this place, what was going on in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What was the condition of the bodies?</span> <span id="s471">Had they looked like they had endured starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: We didn't look that closely.</span> <span id="s473">They were dead, and they weren't dead very long.</span> <span id="s474">We assumed that they had been shot.</span> <span id="s475">They may have been shot just before we came there.</span> <span id="s476">But they couldn't get rid of all of them.</span> <span id="s477">And that was not a big camp.</span> <span id="s478">It was a small camp.</span> <span id="s479">But there wasn't enough time to get rid of all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: When did you know the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s482">I think it may have been while I was there somebody may have mentioned it or something like that.</span> <span id="s483">I'm not quite sure where I learned the name.</span> <span id="s484">But I never heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find out whether there was a camp like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: And the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s487">O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So you learned the name of it, you said, when you were there, that it was Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s491">You have seen these bodies.</span> <span id="s492">You walk around.</span> <span id="s493">Any other impressions that you can talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, we were there just a good part of the day.</span> <span id="s495">Now, it wasn't our job to remove the bodies or do anything else.</span> <span id="s496">We had to contact I think it was the civil government of the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s497">They would come in and take care of the government and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: But you said that there were a lot of other American soldiers already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: From my company.</span> <span id="s500">We were the first company to walk in there.</span> <span id="s501">There must have been -- in my company, there must have been 25, 40 guys.</span> <span id="s502">And of course, the word spread after that that there was this camp.</span> <span id="s503">And that's where Eisenhower must have found out about it and so on.</span> <span id="s504">But they came the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I saw them.</span> <span id="s507">I was there.</span> <span id="s508">In other words, we went back.</span> <span id="s509">We didn't stay far from them because we were bivouacking, actually.</span> <span id="s510">And we went back.</span> <span id="s511">And we didn't know they were coming.</span> <span id="s512">And all of a sudden the gates open up and an entourage comes in, maybe 100 or 200 people.</span> <span id="s513">I don't know.</span> <span id="s514">And of course the bodies had remained there overnight.</span> <span id="s515">There was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s516">And they came in and they were looking around and the cameras and all that sort of jazz.</span> <span id="s517">And they went through the place.</span> <span id="s518">And somebody was explaining to them what had happened and so on.</span> <span id="s519">In other words, the hierarchy of the military had come in, and they learned about what happened and they were showing it to the general.</span> <span id="s520">And I believe that was the first camp, maybe the only one, that the three generals were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So you actually saw General Eisenhower?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: General Eisenhower, General Bradley.</span> <span id="s523">I'm not quite sure about Patton.</span> <span id="s524">He was there, but I didn't quite see him.</span> <span id="s525">He was sort of walking on his own, more or less.</span> <span id="s526">But Eisenhower and Bradley were together.</span> <span id="s527">Wherever they went, they were together with a bunch of colonels and military muck-mucks or whatever they call them.</span> <span id="s528">And they were explaining to the general what had happened there.</span> <span id="s529">They had heard it from one of the boys.</span> <span id="s530">So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was, what it was, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: I'm sure you're aware of the famous quote from General Eisenhower that he wrote to Churchill -- and I'd just like to maybe read it a little bit and see what your reaction is to it -- that he sent in a letter to Churchill after he had been at Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s532">"The things I saw beggar description.</span> <span id="s533">The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology were overpowering.</span> <span id="s534">I made the visit deliberately in order to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda."</span> <span id="s535">When he said he saw evidence of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: I don't know about beastiology, but I know cruelty, starvation.</span> <span id="s537">That's something I had never mentioned, the fact that they were emaciated people.</span> <span id="s538">These people were skin and bones.</span> <span id="s539">And we tried to help them, but we didn't have food with us.</span> <span id="s540">We had some K-rations and so on.</span> <span id="s541">We did the best we could.</span> <span id="s542">And that's why we decided to come back the next day, to see if we could be of any -- we didn't know that the generals were coming.</span> <span id="s543">And we brought back some food and so on and so forth, but it didn't amount to anything.</span> <span id="s544">And we were just appalled by what we had seen.</span> <span id="s545">And really, I can't honestly say that it sunk in at that particular time.</span> <span id="s546">The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would have felt the same way more or less at that time.</span> <span id="s547">And we went through.</span> <span id="s548">We were interested in seeing.</span> <span id="s549">We couldn't believe that something like this existed, that people could be so cruel as to shoot them, starve them, hang them, which is in those pictures.</span> <span id="s550">We just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s551">And if anybody tells you he realized what it was -- maybe Eisenhower did, but we didn't until it began to sink in.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What did you say and what did the Jewish prisoners say to you?</span> <span id="s553">What kind of thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: They were all anxious to tell me their stories.</span> <span id="s555">Strangely enough, Jewish people love to relate their problems and what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s556">And those that could -- a lot of them were too weak to even talk.</span> <span id="s557">You know, they told us about where they came from, what had happened to them, and so on.</span> <span id="s558">But there were so many stories that one story ran into another.</span> <span id="s559">There were so many terrible stories.</span> <span id="s560">And they're all most willing to talk And as a matter of fact, what I really found out more than anything else were the girls.</span> <span id="s561">I don't want to get too far ahead.</span> <span id="s562">I really found out what really happened.</span> <span id="s563">They were explicit and they were able to explain.</span> <span id="s564">But as far as I was concerned, we heard so many stories at the same time, all terrible stories.</span> <span id="s565">And it's like somebody pricking your finger here, here, here, here, and you couldn't know where it hurts only because there are so many different spots that it hurts.</span> <span id="s566">And we had heard so many terrible stories that there were too many to affect us, so to speak.</span> <span id="s567">I don't know if you can understand that.</span> <span id="s568">But after a while, we began to understand what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Did your other -- the other soldiers that you were with speak Yiddish, the two others?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: No.</span> <span id="s571">I was the only one that spoke Yiddish, so to speak.</span> <span id="s572">And therefore, I was able to relate to some of these people better than some of the others.</span> <span id="s573">Of course, a lot of them just didn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did you touch any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s576">I held their hand.</span> <span id="s577">I spoke to them.</span> <span id="s578">I sat with them.</span> <span id="s579">We were there for hours.</span> <span id="s580">And then strangely enough, here are people who are dying, who -- we picked ourselves up and we left.</span> <span id="s581">It's a terrible thing not to realize the degradation that went on and the cruelty that went on.</span> <span id="s582">After all, we were in a war.</span> <span id="s583">And yet we were able to pick ourselves up and leave.</span> <span id="s584">I don't know if I could do that today, leave back to the bivouac area knowing that we were going to come back the next day with whatever we could.</span> <span id="s585">And it wasn't very much.</span> <span id="s586">But then the military government moved in right after we left, and I guess they took care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: How did you know that you were the first Americans to come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: There was nobody else there.</span> <span id="s589">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s590">There was absolutely nobody else there.</span> <span id="s591">We walked in through the gates, opened up the gates.</span> <span id="s592">They weren't locked.</span> <span id="s593">Rather, the gates -- the barbed wire gates.</span> <span id="s594">We opened them and walked right in.</span> <span id="s595">We could see the scenes of the dead from outside the gates.</span> <span id="s596">And we just went in.</span> <span id="s597">And there was absolutely nobody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Were you frightened when you first saw the piles of dead bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No.</span> <span id="s600">We had seen dead bodies all along.</span> <span id="s601">And we came in and we were just curious to know what it was that we were looking at.</span> <span id="s602">We really didn't know what we were seeing, at the beginning.</span> <span id="s603">And then we realized.</span> <span id="s604">I may be contradicting myself but the thoughts are coming so quick and so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: This is Tape 1, Side B, of the interview of Herbert Bitter.</span> <span id="s606">Before we continue, I'd like to clarify some facts that we talked about on the previous side.</span> <span id="s607">You had said that you had come over the border into Germany into the town of Aachen.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: That's correct.</span> <span id="s609">And then from Aachen, I just don't remember where we went because I was completely unfamiliar with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the Ohrdruf camp, and you said you were staying in a village and that a man told you there's a camp 3 miles down the road.</span> <span id="s611">Do you remember the name of the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: It might have been Erfurt or Aachen.</span> <span id="s613">I'm not quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Not Aachen.</span> <span id="s615">You mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s617">Erfurt or Ohrdruf.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s619">And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to Ohrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s620">Because it is understood that Eisenhower was there on April 12th, which was the date that President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s621">Do you have anything to say about that, about when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I certainly do.</span> <span id="s623">I believe if I got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the following day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that camp.</span> <span id="s624">That was the very next day because the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before.</span> <span id="s625">And they came and they looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them.</span> <span id="s626">I don't remember who they were.</span> <span id="s627">And then they left.</span> <span id="s628">Now, the next thing I know is that I saw pictures of the fact that Eisenhower was there.</span> <span id="s629">There seemed to be a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s630">And the day that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were supposed to have been there.</span> <span id="s631">Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden.</span> <span id="s632">Now, I had seen the concentration camp on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that Eisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there.</span> <span id="s633">And then they may have come back with photographers and with whoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s635">Before we leave Ohrdruf, I just wanted to ask you again some of your impressions and other sites that you saw.</span> <span id="s636">Did you have a sense of the layout of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: More or less.</span> <span id="s638">As we came in, we saw the bodies.</span> <span id="s639">To the right of the gate -- I'm trying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the barracks where the sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls, like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that separated each bunk.</span> <span id="s640">And that's all they had.</span> <span id="s641">And they were filled with straw.</span> <span id="s642">And then we went from there.</span> <span id="s643">We saw an oven, and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside the oven.</span> <span id="s644">However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies.</span> <span id="s645">And as we went further, we saw this long pit where there must have been hundreds of bodies covered with lime.</span> <span id="s646">And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the pit so they could bury them and bodies above that and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this.</span> <span id="s648">How did you handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when you saw piles of bodies and ovens and lime pits and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through France and the invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies.</span> <span id="s650">This was a terrible, terrible thing.</span> <span id="s651">And then of course we realized that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s652">We felt a little bad.</span> <span id="s653">But you must understand that it doesn't hit you suddenly.</span> <span id="s654">You're looking and you say "That's a terrible thing."</span> <span id="s655">And then you go on and so on.</span> <span id="s656">It's only after visiting there, after being away from there that I began to realize.</span> <span id="s657">And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me what they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true.</span> <span id="s658">This is a holocaust.</span> <span id="s659">And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these sites?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No.</span> <span id="s662">Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all.</span> <span id="s663">Because remember when you're in the service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care of yourself.</span> <span id="s664">And I felt badly.</span> <span id="s665">I can't say that it just passed over me.</span> <span id="s666">We started to talk about it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it was.</span> <span id="s667">That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they can't believe it.</span> <span id="s668">And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to believe.</span> <span id="s669">It's too much to take in at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Always.</span> <span id="s672">Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews, and I spoke to some of them.</span> <span id="s673">As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police.</span> <span id="s674">He served as a KP for us.</span> <span id="s675">And I befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details.</span> <span id="s676">He may not have known about all of these things.</span> <span id="s677">He was just a refugee.</span> <span id="s678">And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and that's why I was able to communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: How old was he and where did you find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: He must have been about 35 years old.</span> <span id="s681">We found him walking along the road.</span> <span id="s682">And he asked if he could be part of our outfit.</span> <span id="s683">He wanted to get to Israel.</span> <span id="s684">And we said, "Well, we're not going to Israel.</span> <span id="s685">We're going in the opposite direction."</span> <span id="s686">He says, "Can I go with you?"</span> <span id="s687">He says, "I have to eat."</span> <span id="s688">So we gave him an American uniform.</span> <span id="s689">We set him up.</span> <span id="s690">Nobody knew who he was.</span> <span id="s691">And I communicated with him on a regular basis only because of the Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And whereabouts did you find him?</span> <span id="s693">What country?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s695">It may have been in France, but I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s696">It's just that he was with us for quite a length of time.</span> <span id="s697">And actually, when we came back to Marseilles to go over to the Philippines for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't go aboard ship with him.</span> <span id="s698">So we had some of the boys put him in a truck, took him down to the shipyards in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s699">They put him on a ship that was going to eventually wind up in Israel.</span> <span id="s700">And I never heard from him after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Meischer (phonetic).</span> <span id="s703">That's as much as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Had you heard of a place called Buchenwald when you were in Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: No.</span> <span id="s706">As a matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem, and they told me it was a satellite of Ohrdruf.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Of Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s709">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: How many days were you at -- in the Ohrdruf area?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: And how many times did you go back to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: We went back the next day and possibly once more.</span> <span id="s714">And then we had to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Did you say that you had brought food back?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s717">We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s718">It was a drop in the bucket.</span> <span id="s719">And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us because they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found.</span> <span id="s720">I didn't do the notifying myself, but somebody did.</span> <span id="s721">And I guess they eventually came.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So just to clarify, you're saying that you were one of the first to come into the camp because there were no other soldiers around?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I think we were the first because there was nobody in that camp when we went in.</span> <span id="s724">We opened the gates -- the barbed wire gates and we walked in.</span> <span id="s725">And this is what we saw.</span> <span id="s726">Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Were there any dead SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No.</span> <span id="s729">Only civilians.</span> <span id="s730">Only people who were either shot or died in some way, and then the few that were just wandering around the camp with no place to go and nothing to do.</span> <span id="s731">They were sort of lost.</span> <span id="s732">They were in a fog.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Did you feel any differently after this experience at Ohrdruf than before?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I felt a kinship and a compassion.</span> <span id="s735">But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the camps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Well, let's move on.</span> <span id="s737">So you then were ordered to leave that general area?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: And where did you then move?</span> <span id="s740">Did you go eastward?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Well, we went toward Cologne because I remember being in Cologne.</span> <span id="s742">And the war was beginning to wind down.</span> <span id="s743">And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory was -- we came across a factory.</span> <span id="s744">And really, I didn't come across the factory.</span> <span id="s745">One of the officers came to the headquarters and said, "Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s746">I said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s747">He says, "Boy, you're going to have a good time."</span> <span id="s748">I says, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s749">He says, "I found a factory full of Jewish broads," and that's exactly the way he put it.</span> <span id="s750">And he says, "They can't talk to anybody."</span> <span id="s751">He said, "I can't talk to them."</span> <span id="s752">He says, "Let me drive you there and I'll pick you up."</span> <span id="s753">I say, "Can I be there that long?"</span> <span id="s754">He says, "I'll pick you up.</span> <span id="s755">I'll come and I'll wait for you."</span> <span id="s756">He says, "But Have a good time."</span> <span id="s757">He was being very facetious.</span> <span id="s758">And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of the four girls standing outside this factory.</span> <span id="s759">And I went up to the, girls knowing that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s760">I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, "What are you doing, girls?"</span> <span id="s761">And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there.</span> <span id="s762">They had never seen an American-Jewish soldier.</span> <span id="s763">They had not seen anybody.</span> <span id="s764">They knew they were liberated because the Germans had left.</span> <span id="s765">And they grabbed me, literally grabbed me, pulled me into the building, and took me to the second floor.</span> <span id="s766">And I heard screaming and yelling of the girls.</span> <span id="s767">And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage.</span> <span id="s768">And there were girls coming from all over the building.</span> <span id="s769">I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200 girls, all disciplined.</span> <span id="s770">All sat down.</span> <span id="s771">There was one girl who took charge, and she explained to them who I was.</span> <span id="s772">And we spoke in sort of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s773">And then she said, "I want you to" -- in Yiddish she said, "I want you to hear the stories of some of these girls.</span> <span id="s774">I want you to know what we went through."</span> <span id="s775">And I says, "All right."</span> <span id="s776">And I sat there for the next two or three hours just listening.</span> <span id="s777">And each girl, she said, "Yanni (phonetic), get up and tell your story.</span> <span id="s778">Myrtle, get up and tell your story."</span> <span id="s779">And one by one, there must have been 20 girls, that had -- and they told how they had been raped and taken advantage of and all of that.</span> <span id="s780">And I began to feel.</span> <span id="s781">I wanted to kill somebody after listening to these girls.</span> <span id="s782">And finally they finished.</span> <span id="s783">They said, "Do you want to hear more?"</span> <span id="s784">I says, "No.</span> <span id="s785">That's enough."</span> <span id="s786">And of course, I had to get back.</span> <span id="s787">And the officer was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s788">So I says, "Maidloch (phonetic), I'll be back tomorrow."</span> <span id="s789">I says, "What can I bring you," I says, "in the way of food?"</span> <span id="s790">She says, "Food, we're all right on."</span> <span id="s791">She says, "But can you bring us a few sidurim," prayer books.</span> <span id="s792">And I says, "Well, we don't have many, but I'll pick up every one I can find."</span> <span id="s793">And I went back and I got about three or four from the boys in the camp.</span> <span id="s794">And I went back the next day with some food, whatever it was, and the girls just couldn't get over me.</span> <span id="s795">I was a hero.</span> <span id="s796">I was the first liberator that they saw.</span> <span id="s797">And I spent a good part of the day with them.</span> <span id="s798">I took my own Jeep.</span> <span id="s799">And we spent some time, and then I left.</span> <span id="s800">And of course, I took a picture with the girls or all the girls.</span> <span id="s801">Here is the Jewish girls liberated from the German factory, slave labor.</span> <span id="s802">And it was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Now, can you tell me again where this factory was?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: It was after Aachen.</span> <span id="s805">And I cannot remember the distance.</span> <span id="s806">I can't remember the factory or what they did in the factory, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s807">But the whole building was full of girls.</span> <span id="s808">Only girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: How much later after Ohrdruf did you come across this factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: And were you heading eastward or westward?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: We were heading eastward.</span> <span id="s813">We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a place called Weida, Germany, which was in the Russian section.</span> <span id="s814">And we spent quite a bit of time there.</span> <span id="s815">And then of course we doubled back to go to Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And you don't know what kind of factory it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: No, I have no idea what they made.</span> <span id="s818">They were so busy telling me about their experiences, not what they were, not -- but they wanted people to know how they suffered.</span> <span id="s819">And believe me, they let me know how they suffered.</span> <span id="s820">And it was then that the whole thing was coming together, that I began to realize what was going on in there.</span> <span id="s821">It's not one incident that sets you apart.</span> <span id="s822">It's all of these incidents together.</span> <span id="s823">And you begin to realize there's a pattern there.</span> <span id="s824">And that's what I began to realize.</span> <span id="s825">As a matter of fact, I myself -- I don't know if I told you, I was sitting in a Jeep in France.</span> <span id="s826">And they had liberated some camps.</span> <span id="s827">I think it was in Poland or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s828">I don't know.</span> <span id="s829">And I read the article in Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s830">And I read about how these people suffered.</span> <span id="s831">And I closed the Stars and Stripes, put them away, and I went about my business like it didn't affect me in any way.</span> <span id="s832">It does affect me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: How long did you stay in that area of the labor factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Two days.</span> <span id="s835">I was there the first day.</span> <span id="s836">I had to go and get on with the outfit.</span> <span id="s837">So I was there the first day.</span> <span id="s838">And then the second day I came back by myself with the sidurim.</span> <span id="s839">And I spent a good part of the day.</span> <span id="s840">I had my own Jeep.</span> <span id="s841">And then I went back to my outfit.</span> <span id="s842">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did you talk about this with the -- Was there a chaplain that you could talk things over with?</span> <span id="s844">And if so, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: No, because we had to move on.</span> <span id="s846">There was nobody I could really talk to because we were an individual outfit.</span> <span id="s847">We were -- we had to be attached to various armies to do the work for them and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s848">So there was nobody I could talk to.</span> <span id="s849">And I knew that behind us was a civil and military governments who were cleaning up and taking care of whatever we saw.</span> <span id="s850">And of course, the Germans didn't know any of this was going on.</span> <span id="s851">None of it.</span> <span id="s852">And they were very, very happy to see the Americans because they didn't want to see the Russians.</span> <span id="s853">So they were very, very happy to see us and welcome us.</span> <span id="s854">And they had white flags outside of all the buildings.</span> <span id="s855">And it was a very, very nice thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Why do you say that your experience at the women's slave labor factory made an</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Because they were individual stories.</span> <span id="s858">"It happened to me," they say.</span> <span id="s859">"This is what happened to me."</span> <span id="s860">And then another one said, "This is what happened to me."</span> <span id="s861">And when you hear so many individual stories, not a group of people talking with one story, there are a group of people talking with many, many stories, that has to affect you even if you're not Jewish.</span> <span id="s862">And it affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Were these women wearing yellow stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: I have to look at the picture.</span> <span id="s865">No, they weren't.</span> <span id="s866">Evidently the war or the Germans were in such retreat that they weren't afraid any more because the Germans had left.</span> <span id="s867">They were frightened, they didn't know what was going to happen to them, and they began to run.</span> <span id="s868">And basically, they weren't wearing stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And then you left this factory.</span> <span id="s870">And then where did your unit go?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: And then we went on to Dresden, as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s872">And we wound up in a place called Weida, W-E-I-D-A: And we were bivouacked in a schoolhouse, and we spent the balance of the war there.</span> <span id="s873">That's right.</span> <span id="s874">Because we had to go from there to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s875">And in Marseilles, we were going to be put aboard ships and go to the Philippines for the invasion of Japan.</span> <span id="s876">And I had enough points to get out and I was very mad and we were very irritated and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s877">But while we were there -- we got aboard the ship, and we're all -- pardon me -- bitching.</span> <span id="s878">And the ship took off.</span> <span id="s879">And this was after Roosevelt had died.</span> <span id="s880">And Truman took over.</span> <span id="s881">And while we were aboard the ship, Truman declared all ships that are headed for foreign ports, military ships, to turn back and go to the nearest American port.</span> <span id="s882">And I was one of the first troops to get home after we hit Newport News, VirginiA: I was one of the first American soldiers that came in.</span> <span id="s883">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s884">The war in Japan had ended, so they felt they didn't need us there any more and they didn't want to any more troops than they needed, so they sent us right back to Newport News.</span> <span id="s885">And I called my family and I told them I'm home.</span> <span id="s886">They never expected me to be home.</span> <span id="s887">Only my mother said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s888">He'll come home."</span> <span id="s889">And I did.</span> <span id="s890">And I called the house and told them I would be home in a few days.</span> <span id="s891">They told us they'd give us leave.</span> <span id="s892">So I said, "I'll be home in about two or three days."</span> <span id="s893">Unfortunately, I got what they call impetigo, which comes from dirt and filth.</span> <span id="s894">So they had to change my uniform and put me in quarantine.</span> <span id="s895">And my family had put up a sign, "Welcome home, Herbie."</span> <span id="s896">And they had to change the sign because I didn't come back until a week later.</span> <span id="s897">And it said, "Well, come home, Herbie."</span> <span id="s898">And that was it basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: When you got home, did you talk about Ohrdruf with family?</span> <span id="s900">Did you talk about the labor factory stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: No, we didn't talk about much of anything.</span> <span id="s902">It came out over a period of time.</span> <span id="s903">I may have mentioned it but never any details.</span> <span id="s904">I didn't want to talk about my time in the service.</span> <span id="s905">I had so many other things that I wanted to do that I wasn't going to start -- actually a new life.</span> <span id="s906">I was already married.</span> <span id="s907">I was married in Plattsburgh while I was in the service, which I didn't mention.</span> <span id="s908">And I was busy looking for a place to live because in those days you couldn't find an apartment at all in New York.</span> <span id="s909">And it was only gradually.</span> <span id="s910">I never spoke about that to my parents, for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s911">Never.</span> <span id="s912">I sort of felt they wouldn't understand.</span> <span id="s913">I may have mentioned one or two things, but I had spoken to my wife.</span> <span id="s914">She would be the only one.</span> <span id="s915">And my children.</span> <span id="s916">My children were the ones that were affected by this more than anybody else through me.</span> <span id="s917">And every time they went to school and they spoke about the holocaust, they insisted on taking the pictures.</span> <span id="s918">That's why I have so few pictures left.</span> <span id="s919">And they were more affected.</span> <span id="s920">That's why my daughter called you because she had heard these stories over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Did you show these photographs that you had?</span> <span id="s922">When you first got home, did you show them to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s924">The only people that saw them was when I went to Israel and we went to Yad Vashem, they asked me -- when we found out that it was part of Buchenwald and so forth, they asked me whether I had pictures.</span> <span id="s925">And they said, "Would you send me pictures?"</span> <span id="s926">And I made copies.</span> <span id="s927">Somebody had a machine that made copies, and I sent them the copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did you show your wife these pictures?</span> <span id="s929">I'm talking about in the 1940s.</span> <span id="s930">I'm not talking about later.</span> <span id="s931">I'm saying when you first came home.</span> <span id="s932">Did you show your wife the photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: She had seen them, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s934">It's just that I don't know the period of time that had elapsed.</span> <span id="s935">I wasn't hesitant to talk about it.</span> <span id="s936">I just didn't want to go into any detail, basically.</span> <span id="s937">So my wife saw all the pictures.</span> <span id="s938">And she speaks Yiddish pretty well so she understood basically what I went through.</span> <span id="s939">And I didn't talk about any gory details because I wasn't interested in my family reliving it with me or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Because I had lived it.</span> <span id="s942">They had seen the pictures.</span> <span id="s943">They knew what I went through over a period of years.</span> <span id="s944">We had always been talking about it.</span> <span id="s945">And I didn't sit them down and tell them -- first of all, they were too young, but it was over a period of years that we talked about it, we discussed it and so on.</span> <span id="s946">So they know everything that I went through.</span> <span id="s947">It's just that we didn't do it in one session or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Did what you go through affect -- you had alluded to this before -- affect your feelings about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I became more Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Because I began to realize what these people had gone through, and I began to see with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s952">And I told you, over a period of time it just sort of built up in me until I really began -- any chance I had to help holocaust victims or whatever it is, we did.</span> <span id="s953">And we're very active.</span> <span id="s954">We have our own chavurah, which is a group of friends that get together that are all Jewish.</span> <span id="s955">And my wife is very active in Hadassah, in all the Jewish organizations in Dallas.</span> <span id="s956">And it's a difficult place to be Jewish, in Dallas, a difficult thing to be Jewish in Dallas, especially when we first moved there.</span> <span id="s957">So she's very active there.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Can you just summarize what happened after the war, professionally what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: After the war, I got myself a job and another job and a third job.</span> <span id="s960">You know, I was sort of trying to find myself.</span> <span id="s961">At the same time, I had a child a year after I came home.</span> <span id="s962">But then I worked for a large jewelry organization, and then I got a job with the PXs in Europe.</span> <span id="s963">And we went to Japan with my family.</span> <span id="s964">We lived in Japan for several years, belonged to the Jewish Community Center in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s965">And we lived in Yokohama, and we spent three years in Japan.</span> <span id="s966">I came back, went to work for a company that was a manufacturer's representative all over the world because I was used to traveling.</span> <span id="s967">I'm just trying to think -- Let's see.</span> <span id="s968">Yeah.</span> <span id="s969">After that, I went into business for myself, made a success of the business, and retired several years ago.</span> <span id="s970">And basically, that's the story of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Do you still think about what you saw, the sites that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Always.</span> <span id="s973">It takes the slightest thing to remind me of what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Such as what kind of things remind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Well, when I hear about the holocaust -- and in Dallas, in the Jewish Community Center, they have a holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s976">Nothing like this.</span> <span id="s977">But I go down there once in a while and look at the pictures.</span> <span id="s978">And a friend of mine -- I have several friends who are refuges who were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s979">And they're constantly talking about it and so on.</span> <span id="s980">And they make various talks throughout the schools in Dallas, trying to have people to be cognizant of what went on and so on, but there are still a lot of skeptics.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Are there any sights that trigger what you saw?</span> <span id="s982">Any sights that you see today that would trigger anything about Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s984">Mostly Europe.</span> <span id="s985">When I see certain areas in Europe, I think of the holocaust.</span> <span id="s986">I think of what I saw.</span> <span id="s987">I'll never forget what I saw.</span> <span id="s988">In fact, what I've told you these are the only basic things that I remember, but so much more happened and so much more that I went through that I can't remember.</span> <span id="s989">And I wish I could.</span> <span id="s990">That's why before I came to see you I wondered what I'm going to say to you.</span> <span id="s991">I didn't realize I knew this much.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: You said you had kept a diary when you were a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: I had a diary.</span> <span id="s994">I had a little desk that the carpenter in the outfit made for me.</span> <span id="s995">And each day I wrote into this diary.</span> <span id="s996">And then for some reason we had to leave quickly, so I locked up the desk because I couldn't carry it with me.</span> <span id="s997">And they were supposed to be picked up by a truck.</span> <span id="s998">I never saw that desk again.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Where did you lose your desk and your diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Probably in -- we left from Weida, Germany, I think.</span> <span id="s1001">And it's with the -- whatever is left of the 628th Light Equipment records.</span> <span id="s1002">It should be within that, and written by me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So you wrote about what you saw in Ohrdruf in this diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: I wrote a lot of what I saw.</span> <span id="s1005">And I don't remember exactly when I stopped writing.</span> <span id="s1006">I just remember the desk was gone.</span> <span id="s1007">I thought I would see it when I got to Marseilles, but I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Was it a release for you to be able to sit down and write about what you saw that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1010">I began to realize what I had saw -- seen, but for some reason or other it did not sink in until days, weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: After the war and you were back here in the United States and word came out about the camps and there were more and more pictures, how did you respond to that when you saw the magnitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: That's when I began to realize.</span> <span id="s1013">That's when I began to understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s1014">And the sights plus what I began to read about it all came together.</span> <span id="s1015">And suddenly I began to realize what this was all about.</span> <span id="s1016">You just can't look at it one time and say, well, this is a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1017">It isn't that simple.</span> <span id="s1018">It's something that has to build up within you.</span> <span id="s1019">And now nobody can tell me it didn't happen or I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s1020">I know I saw it.</span> <span id="s1021">What I went through just trying to find out whether there was such a camp.</span> <span id="s1022">At first I began to say there had to be an Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s1023">I was in there.</span> <span id="s1024">And everybody in Dallas, they told me no.</span> <span id="s1025">The first trip to Israel they said they don't know of such a camp.</span> <span id="s1026">And you know they have all the camps laid out on a map.</span> <span id="s1027">Never saw Ohrdruf until I went into the Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1028">Until they showed me the books.</span> <span id="s1029">And they had the history of the camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: And it's a subcamp of Buchenwald and referred to as S3?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: The first photograph that one sees in the permanent exhibit here at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is a picture of Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s1033">Do you feel that's appropriate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I don't quite understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: When the public comes to the permanent exhibit here at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and they get off the elevator, the very first photograph is of General Eisenhower at Ohrdruf and the scene of the bodies at Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s1036">How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I didn't see the picture, number one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: But the idea that that's the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Oh, yeah, because I knew he was there.</span> <span id="s1040">Nobody could deny it, the fact that Eisenhower was there on the second trip, I believe.</span> <span id="s1041">Nobody could believe that this thing went on and yet people will still look at that picture and say, "It can't be that bad."</span> <span id="s1042">They still do that today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s1045">If my memory improves, maybe I'll come back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Do you think you could have been prepared by anybody else for the sights that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1048">Nobody -- I've told you, I read it in the Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s1049">Not that I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1050">It just didn't sink in.</span> <span id="s1051">And that's what happens -- and I'm talking about Jewish people as well.</span> <span id="s1052">And everybody seems to say, "Well, it's not that bad.</span> <span id="s1053">It can't be that horrible.</span> <span id="s1054">There are a few bodies and there were some mean people there."</span> <span id="s1055">But it existed.</span> <span id="s1056">And it existed on a mass scale because I saw how organized that was.</span> <span id="s1057">And believe me, the Germans know how to organize anything.</span> <span id="s1058">And they organized that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: You said something that was very touching, which was when you went into Ohrdruf and you spoke Yiddish to some of the survivors and you sat down with them and you held their hand.</span> <span id="s1060">Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Well, only because I was curious to know what went on.</span> <span id="s1062">We knew so little.</span> <span id="s1063">There was no history, you know, when I went in there.</span> <span id="s1064">We knew so little.</span> <span id="s1065">So as I spoke to them, I was holding one of them and because he was an individual, not because he was Jewish, not because he was anything.</span> <span id="s1066">But because he was a man who had suffered and who had been hungry and who was emaciated looking.</span> <span id="s1067">And these are men that needed somebody to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1068">It's just that I couldn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s1069">That was the only thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Were you ever concerned about your own health in these camps with diseases and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1072">We didn't think of any.</span> <span id="s1073">We just saw what we saw.</span> <span id="s1074">We saw what was happening to somebody else, not to us.</span> <span id="s1075">And we looked and we saw.</span> <span id="s1076">And it was just -- it was a terrible sight.</span> <span id="s1077">I only wish I could have realized it then, but maybe I wouldn't have slept.</span> <span id="s1078">Maybe I would have been upset.</span> <span id="s1079">Maybe I would have become a nervous wreck.</span> <span id="s1080">So maybe nature has its way of compensating.</span> <span id="s1081">That could be it.</span> <span id="s1082">Of course one more thing.</span> <span id="s1083">When I go to Israel, I see some of my relatives, my father's family.</span> <span id="s1084">And we talk about it.</span> <span id="s1085">And we talk about it, and we talk about what they went through.</span> <span id="s1086">And they had left before the concentration camp business.</span> <span id="s1087">They all went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1088">And they all became very successful doctors and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1089">And we discuss it very rationally.</span> <span id="s1090">They don't prefer to talk too much about it because they're doing well and they don't want to be reminded.</span> <span id="s1091">But they went through quite a bit as well.</span> <span id="s1092">And I remember the first time I went to Israel we took two bags of clothing to bring to them.</span> <span id="s1093">Now they don't need my clothing.</span> <span id="s1094">They're doing very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Any message you want to give to your grandson or any special message to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: The truth is that my grandsons got the message by virtue of the fact that I gave them the pictures to take to school.</span> <span id="s1097">My children, my grandchildren all took these pictures to school.</span> <span id="s1098">And what they did in school and how they reacted, they all know exactly what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s1100">This concludes the interview of Herbert Bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
