August 6, 1992 and we’re speaking with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s5">Dr. Rozenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family, and any family members that she can recall.</span> <span id="s6">So please, could you tell me your father’s name, his date of birth and then anything you can about his childhood and his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Okay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a town called Lukow in Poland.</span> <span id="s8">Anyway this town was in the area of Lublin, I don’t know exactly in which direction or …… Okay, so my father was born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907.</span> <span id="s9">He was born into a pretty religious family.</span> <span id="s10">I think that parts of the family were associated with the Hasidim.</span> <span id="s11">But he did not grow up technically as a Hasidic child.</span> <span id="s12">He was just an ordinary traditionally religious Polish Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s13">His father died when he was very young, well not very young I guess.</span> <span id="s14">Well let me go backwards a little bit.</span> <span id="s15">My father was one of about six or seven children and he was in the middle.</span> <span id="s16">He was not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of the middle children.</span> <span id="s17">His father died when he was a young boy.</span> <span id="s18">I think, if my memory serves me correctly, he was about twelve when his father died, which means his father died just after World War I of asthma.</span> <span id="s19">But I think he was sickly for most of his life.</span> <span id="s20">But my grandmother, that is my father’s mother whose name was --well I should say that my father’s father’s name was Avraham Rozenblit -- and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I’m named Marsha -- Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family.</span> <span id="s21">She owned a, well my mother used to say she owned a general store, but my cousin in Israel who was seventeen when he left Poland and really knew her, said that she basically owned a shoe store.</span> <span id="s22">That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she would take trips to Warsaw or Lublin and see what was in the fancy shoe stores there and then copy them and arranged to have the shoes made.</span> <span id="s23">She didn’t make them herself.</span> <span id="s24">She wasn’t a shoemaker but she would get them made and then sell them, both in the store and also in a kind of…She would send her children out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to the peasants in the villages.</span> <span id="s25">That I learned from my cousin in Israel.</span> <span id="s26">But let me just try to say something about my father’s family background in general before I talk more specifically.</span> <span id="s27">They were a very religious family and pictures of my father show him wearing the sort of traditional cap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of squarish cap.</span> <span id="s28">I can’t tell from the pictures whether he has pais or not.</span> <span id="s29">It’s hard to tell, but maybe he did.</span> <span id="s30">I should say before I go on that my father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we’re talking about, died in 1961 when I was ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things I actually remember him saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my cousin in Israel, that is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to Palestine in 1938 has told me.</span> <span id="s31">So it’s a sort of conglomerate of those things.</span> <span id="s32">So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the Lublin area.</span> <span id="s33">His mother owned this shoe store.</span> <span id="s34">I don’t think she was rich but she was reasonably prosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s35">His oldest, I don’t even know the age order, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe, and the sister, Nehama, was I think the oldest and then there were other brothers.</span> <span id="s36">There was Simcha, there was Haim Yakov, there was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I know how most of them died actually and I’ll get back to that later when we talk about it.</span> <span id="s37">But Haim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s38">He went to Palestine in 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were the rest of the family involved in Zionism, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: You know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s41">My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in Israel has many times told me that you know, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means Marsha, your father wasn’t a Zionist.</span> <span id="s42">But I think that’s not true.</span> <span id="s43">I think that Mutti means by that, that my father didn’t move to Palestine after the war.</span> <span id="s44">And Mutti is still mad at him forty years later for not having done that.</span> <span id="s45">I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war.</span> <span id="s46">But, of course, everybody was a Zionist after the war.</span> <span id="s47">So the question is was he an active Zionist before the war.</span> <span id="s48">Judging from the schools he sent his children to I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s49">That is an active Zionist.</span> <span id="s50">I don’t think he was active in the Zionist movement, no.</span> <span id="s51">But he was probably sympathetic to Zionism.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: I was going to ask you about the town.</span> <span id="s53">Have you researched or found out anything about that town, was it a shtetl or….</span> <span id="s54">.</span> <span id="s55">?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What was the nature of this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: It was a small town.</span> <span id="s59">I don’t know how big it was.</span> <span id="s60">It certainly wasn’t a large place.</span> <span id="s61">Lublin was in central Poland so it was central Poland.</span> <span id="s62">I think my image of it as a child was that it was like any small American town with white picket fences and neat little houses on neat little streets.</span> <span id="s63">And I was shocked in 1972 or ’03, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky who teaches Polish-American history at YIBO and who is a member of whatever the staff at the YIBO Institute and Lucin Dovarshitsky at the time was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the Image Before My Eyes volume and I said my father was from Lukow and he said well I’ve got a picture of Lukow, come and see it.</span> <span id="s64">So I went upstairs to his office and I looked at this picture of Lukow and it was not my image.</span> <span id="s65">I mean it was a muddy little street.</span> <span id="s66">This was a picture taken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy town.</span> <span id="s67">So it was a tiny little nothing of a town, I think.</span> <span id="s68">Although my cousin Mutti in Israel who was seventeen when he left Lukow has nice memories of it so it couldn’t have been that horrendous.</span> <span id="s69">I mean maybe this picture doesn’t do it justice.</span> <span id="s70">He has nice memories.</span> <span id="s71">My father left Lukow when he married and lived near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s72">I’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s73">So his adult life was not in Lukow, it was in a Warsaw suburb.</span> <span id="s74">The stories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not negative.</span> <span id="s75">If his family was prosperous, even if they weren’t rich they wouldn’t have suffered much.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Do you know much about his education, where he went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: He went to cheder.</span> <span id="s78">He was born in 1907.</span> <span id="s79">He was born when that part of Poland was part of the Russian Empire.</span> <span id="s80">I know he just went to traditional cheder.</span> <span id="s81">He did not have a formal secular education as far as I know.</span> <span id="s82">I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he must have had some secular education.</span> <span id="s83">All the schooling he ever spoke of was cheder.</span> <span id="s84">On the other hand since he could read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else.</span> <span id="s85">He didn’t have a gymnasium education, that I know.</span> <span id="s86">He didn’t go to university.</span> <span id="s87">But he must have gone to some Polish school as well as cheder because you can’t read Polish easily if you hadn’t.</span> <span id="s88">Speaking it is one thing but knowing it is another.</span> <span id="s89">So I think that he and virtually all his siblings just went to cheder and maybe also some kind of Polish elementary school.</span> <span id="s90">There is one thing that is important and that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a real secular education and he did go to Polish school and gymnasium in their town, or maybe not in their town, it’s hard to say since I was only ten when my father died, he may have just said gymnasium and maybe Meir went off to Lublin to go to gymnasium, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s91">In any case my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless was willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s92">This must have been already, since Meir is younger than my father, this must have been after World War 1.</span> <span id="s93">It must have been in the twenties.</span> <span id="s94">And the town was very mad at her for doing this.</span> <span id="s95">So she was something of a progressive because she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to gymnasium, and of course going to gymnasium meant going to school on Saturday.</span> <span id="s96">And theoretically Jews were exempt from writing.</span> <span id="s97">And in fact, they were.</span> <span id="s98">But obviously it spoke of abandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the larger world.</span> <span id="s99">She was certainly willing to do this and was willing to defy the town to let this happen.</span> <span id="s100">I remember my father telling a story about how there was a library in town, like a secular library.</span> <span id="s101">Now maybe it was a Zionist library, may it was Pol….</span> <span id="s102">.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t know what and a lit of the “frumies”, a lot of the very religious people in town marched against it and they tried to burn it down.</span> <span id="s104">And my grandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied them and insisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s105">Actually Meir had a very different experience from all the rest of them.</span> <span id="s106">Meir not only went to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from gymnasium, and this must have been into the ‘30’s at some point, he went to university to study to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s107">He didn’t go in Poland because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in Poland.</span> <span id="s108">He went first in Italy and then in Paris.</span> <span id="s109">He was presumably deported from Paris to Auschwitz because he was dead too.</span> <span id="s110">So his experience was different from everybody else’s.</span> <span id="s111">One brother went to Palestine where he died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s112">Haim Yakov is the one who went to Palestine and Meir was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Do you have pictures of either of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby.</span> <span id="s115">No, actually as an adult, too.</span> <span id="s116">Come to think of it, yes, there is a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults.</span> <span id="s117">One from Italy and one I’m not sure where from.</span> <span id="s118">He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris.</span> <span id="s119">I think he married in Paris but I don’t think he had children.</span> <span id="s120">And I don’t know what happened to his wife.</span> <span id="s121">I don’t know if she was deported or not deported.</span> <span id="s122">My father never tried to look her up after the war.</span> <span id="s123">And my mother, after my father’s death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir’s wife wasn’t Jewish and that’s why my father hadn’t bothered to look her up after the war because he was in Munich for two and a half years after the war, he could have.</span> <span id="s124">And he knew his brother was in Paris.</span> <span id="s125">And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother’s wife but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s126">That may mean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that.</span> <span id="s127">Anyway Meir’s experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education.</span> <span id="s128">And it’s also true that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious.</span> <span id="s129">As an adult in Poland, I don’t mean in America after the war, that’s something else.</span> <span id="s130">But as an adult in Poland was not as religious as he had been growing up.</span> <span id="s131">He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to Jewish schools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland.</span> <span id="s132">People did that.</span> <span id="s133">But he was not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained religious.</span> <span id="s134">And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren’t.</span> <span id="s135">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s136">That would be a nice question to ask.</span> <span id="s137">My cousin in Israel would know all these answers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was religious and who was not.</span> <span id="s138">Anyway what else can I say about just his family background.</span> <span id="s139">His mother had this store.</span> <span id="s140">I think several of his brothers were involved in running the store or in, as I said, selling to the peasants.</span> <span id="s141">But some of the brothers moved.</span> <span id="s142">He himself moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s143">I think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s144">I’m not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up.</span> <span id="s145">I mean they were all adults by the ‘30’s and they were all married and had children and so forth.</span> <span id="s146">The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean ‘Markusfeld” is very important.</span> <span id="s147">She was a Markusfeld.</span> <span id="s148">Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld.</span> <span id="s149">She must have been a very feisty lady, she sounds like it.</span> <span id="s150">She ran this store, she had her six kids `which she raised by herself, or at least partly.</span> <span id="s151">We have a picture of her.</span> <span id="s152">She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but she was kind of a neat lady, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Do you know when she was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed.</span> <span id="s155">So that would make her born in the 1880’s.</span> <span id="s156">Right and if my father was born in 1907 that’s about right.</span> <span id="s157">So she would have been born in the 1880’s or 1870’s, probably in the 1870’s if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third or fourth child.</span> <span id="s158">And I think my father’s father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the 1870’s.</span> <span id="s159">My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world.</span> <span id="s160">Yiddish was of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s161">But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish.</span> <span id="s162">And certainly my cousin Mutti, the one who moved to Palestine in 1937, ’38, Mutti went to Polish public school in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary school in Lukow, that they were not anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s163">I don’t know if he’s telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be nostalgia.</span> <span id="s164">I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990’s after living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he didn’t use it.</span> <span id="s165">But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently.</span> <span id="s166">He knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s167">Now that’s unusual.</span> <span id="s168">That would indicate also a Zionist whatever.</span> <span id="s169">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s170">My mother says he knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s171">Now what does that mean.</span> <span id="s172">She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s174">Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant he…… Certainly he had a traditional cheder education and he was well versed.</span> <span id="s175">He wasn’t a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s176">It wasn’t rote.</span> <span id="s177">He could look at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said.</span> <span id="s178">He knew Russian.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German.</span> <span id="s180">So he knew his languages.</span> <span id="s181">Okay what else can I say about just childhood.</span> <span id="s182">My father was clearly a very mischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example about how they tormented the Malamed at cheder, how they tormented the teacher at the traditional Jewish school in the cheder.</span> <span id="s183">In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a child he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that I did to our teachers.</span> <span id="s184">And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting tacks on the chair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx.</span> <span id="s185">And the other thing is that his sister Nehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama wanted a date.</span> <span id="s186">World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s187">In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed.</span> <span id="s188">And she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn’t want her to because her mother was still very traditional.</span> <span id="s189">And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the house.</span> <span id="s190">And they did this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have these closets and apparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open the back of the closet.</span> <span id="s191">I don’t remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our family car in the 1950’s with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying.</span> <span id="s192">But, you know, nothing serious.</span> <span id="s193">She didn’t cover her hair, actually.</span> <span id="s194">Pictures we have of her or that I’ve seen of her as an adult, she didn’t cover her hair.</span> <span id="s195">So clearly this was a very mischievous child.</span> <span id="s196">He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind….</span> <span id="s197">.</span> <span id="s198">and survivors, of course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts.</span> <span id="s199">Okay, I think I don’t know very much more about my father’s real childhood, that is when he was a baby.</span> <span id="s200">If I think of anything I’ll come back to it.</span> <span id="s201">My father got married pretty young.</span> <span id="s202">He got married when he was about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply.</span> <span id="s203">So this was also non-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Was it a first cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: You know I think it was a first cousin.</span> <span id="s206">I think it was his first cousin.</span> <span id="s207">I’m not a hundred per cent positive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin.</span> <span id="s208">Her father owned a lumber yard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled W_O_L_O_M_I_N, I’m not a hundred per cent sure but I think so.</span> <span id="s209">It’s in the Warsaw area.</span> <span id="s210">So he moved to Warsaw, or to Wolomin, and he ran his father-in-law’s business or worked with his father-in-law in running the business.</span> <span id="s211">His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella I don’t remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and she then didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s212">She wanted a child, it wasn’t accidental.</span> <span id="s213">They weren’t that religious and she died very shortly after he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So you think she was probably about twenty years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one.</span> <span id="s216">I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the same age or a year younger.</span> <span id="s217">She was very young.</span> <span id="s218">Their son’s name was Avraham.</span> <span id="s219">He was named after my father’s father.</span> <span id="s220">Avraham was born therefore, let’s see in 1943 when he was killed, he was twelve.</span> <span id="s221">So he was born in 1931.</span> <span id="s222">So my father wasn’t twenty-one, he was twenty-four.</span> <span id="s223">Well, whatever.</span> <span id="s224">These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931.</span> <span id="s225">And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally.</span> <span id="s226">And the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella.</span> <span id="s227">In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives.</span> <span id="s228">I just don’t remember which was the first and which was the second.</span> <span id="s229">I think Perella was the second.</span> <span id="s230">I think Mira was the first.</span> <span id="s231">Again I’m really not a hundred percent sure.</span> <span id="s232">Again my cousin in Israel would know the answer.</span> <span id="s233">And they had another child.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: The family talked him into it.</span> <span id="s235">Was this under duress then that he did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do.</span> <span id="s237">The child needs a mother, what better mother than her sister.</span> <span id="s238">She needs a husband, she’s a nice lady, why don’t you just marry her.</span> <span id="s239">You know I think it was that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s240">And he was very depressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid.</span> <span id="s241">I don’t know exactly but he definitely married her.</span> <span id="s242">And it was all right.</span> <span id="s243">Obviously it was sad.</span> <span id="s244">I didn’t know this when I was a child.</span> <span id="s245">When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war.</span> <span id="s246">But for whatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust, he didn’t tell me about the fact that his first wife had died.</span> <span id="s247">He thought that would be too sad for me.</span> <span id="s248">Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s249">And that he could tell me about.</span> <span id="s250">But the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife’s death he didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s251">I found out when I was twenty or something.</span> <span id="s252">A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually.</span> <span id="s253">I said, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s254">And she told me the whole story and I just bawled.</span> <span id="s255">It was very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth.</span> <span id="s256">But anyway he did have a daughter with the second wife.</span> <span id="s257">Her name was Toby.</span> <span id="s258">That’s what my mother called her.</span> <span id="s259">It’s probably Tova, which again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s260">Tova is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form.</span> <span id="s261">She was four years younger than Avraham.</span> <span id="s262">So she would have been born in 1934 or ’35, something like that, or ’33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born.</span> <span id="s263">And my father continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this lumberyard.</span> <span id="s264">He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you know.</span> <span id="s265">There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the “frumie”, the religious school system and so forth.</span> <span id="s266">He sent his children to a school system that was very like American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of Polish.</span> <span id="s267">So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which would indicate a kind of moderate religious position.</span> <span id="s268">So that’s the kind of school he sent his kids to.</span> <span id="s269">As I said he kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s270">I don’t think he was Sabbath observing.</span> <span id="s271">So he was kind of a little traditional, but not….</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And they spoke Yiddish at home, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: You know I don’t know what language.</span> <span id="s274">Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that goes without saying.</span> <span id="s275">What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin?</span> <span id="s276">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s277">I really don’t know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both.</span> <span id="s278">You know if you’re utterly fluent it probably depends on your mood.</span> <span id="s279">Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he dreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s280">I bet they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s281">I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: That would be my guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from school and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an hour you were talking Polish.</span> <span id="s284">But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started talking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak.</span> <span id="s285">After the war in America my father was utterly fluent in English.</span> <span id="s286">He learned English very quickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born.</span> <span id="s287">But with his friends from Lukow who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends who were in America, their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern.</span> <span id="s288">None of them were orthodox and so forth.</span> <span id="s289">The natural language they would speak was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s290">But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother crazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn’t know Polish.</span> <span id="s291">And she would get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they would speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had parents because she was American and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s292">The thing they had on her was that they could speak more languages and so they would speak Polish.</span> <span id="s293">But my guess is that Yiddish would be the language of his home.</span> <span id="s294">I don’t know what kind of home he lived in.</span> <span id="s295">He was certainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family in Lukow.</span> <span id="s296">He still had brothers and I think his sister was there.</span> <span id="s297">His mother certainly was there.</span> <span id="s298">Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews.</span> <span id="s299">All of his brothers and sisters had married.</span> <span id="s300">They all had children.</span> <span id="s301">He was the closest with his sister.</span> <span id="s302">The sibling he talked the very most about was his sister.</span> <span id="s303">They were named for the same person.</span> <span id="s304">Mendel is a Yiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik.</span> <span id="s305">I should tell you my father’s formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik Rosenblit which would translate -- Tzidik is Tzadok.</span> <span id="s306">Just a Jewish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who was called Nechuma, ??</span> <span id="s307">raised eyes that she was called Nechuma.</span> <span id="s308">Nechuma was obviously named for the same person.</span> <span id="s309">She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after whatever relative, Menachem.</span> <span id="s310">So when my father was born they named him after the same relative.</span> <span id="s311">So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was unusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study medicine.</span> <span id="s312">That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of them died in the Holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years.</span> <span id="s313">I don’t know what his wife did.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t know if his wife worked or not.</span> <span id="s315">Probably not given the 1930’s in Poland and middle class family.</span> <span id="s316">I doubt that she worked.</span> <span id="s317">They were definitely middle class.</span> <span id="s318">This is not somebody making -- with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because well maybe this isn’t a good historical -- forget this.</span> <span id="s319">I was going to say I’ve seen the list of property that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparation claim.</span> <span id="s320">It’s the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so forth.</span> <span id="s321">But you know people could lie on those so that’s not necessary a good source.</span> <span id="s322">I think that despite the very terrible situation for Jews in Poland in the 1930’s, you know very high anti-Semitism and very terrible economy and so forth.</span> <span id="s323">That my father did reasonably well.</span> <span id="s324">He certainly didn’t give any thought as far as I know to migrating, although, there was no place to migrate to except for Palestine.</span> <span id="s325">And he wasn’t enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine although his brother Haim Yakov did.</span> <span id="s326">They had relatives in America like probably every Jew in Poland but America was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content to be in Poland.</span> <span id="s327">In terms of his attitude to Poland as a country, actually when he was born, he was born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews hated Russia because they were discriminated against so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national.</span> <span id="s328">I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.</span> <span id="s329">If you asked him, who are you, what are you, he would say I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s330">But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified with the Polish state.</span> <span id="s331">He thought of himself as a Polish subject.</span> <span id="s332">He used that word actually.</span> <span id="s333">He called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for kingdoms.</span> <span id="s334">But that’s how Jews were in Poland.</span> <span id="s335">They were members of the Polish state but they weren’t Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn’t a Pole, he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s336">I suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer place than it was.</span> <span id="s337">As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn’t ask him such nice interesting political questions as what you thought about Poland and how you related to Poland and so on.</span> <span id="s338">What else could I tell you about right before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: This is good.</span> <span id="s340">This is all good and it’s what we need.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: That’s what you need.</span> <span id="s342">So basically before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on September 1, 1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous.</span> <span id="s343">He lived in a town near Warsaw called Wolomin.</span> <span id="s344">He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s345">He had a huge extended family.</span> <span id="s346">He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins.</span> <span id="s347">He had a large and intact and functioning family.</span> <span id="s348">And then the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: What happened, okay.</span> <span id="s351">You know I’m used to telling the story to my six -year old son and of course to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s352">I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don’t have to do that here.</span> <span id="s353">In the first months of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews.</span> <span id="s354">I assume that his business was Aryanized because that’s what the Germans did as soon as they came in.</span> <span id="s355">They Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s356">I assume my father was not compensated for it.</span> <span id="s357">He was a clever man.</span> <span id="s358">He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it was technically Aryanized.</span> <span id="s359">In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to Auschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living on the street or anything like that.</span> <span id="s360">Of course he was starving but he wasn’t……He must have managed to get something out of his business even though he wasn’t compensated for it.</span> <span id="s361">You read about this in the memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so forth.</span> <span id="s362">But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things taken from him.</span> <span id="s363">But then, of course, he was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s364">Now when my father was alive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto.</span> <span id="s365">He didn’t specify which one.</span> <span id="s366">When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and in fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when I would ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s367">Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in terms of….</span> <span id="s368">.</span> <span id="s369">well the fact is he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943.</span> <span id="s370">That’s the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s371">What other ghetto was burning in April ’43 that you could escape from in some way.</span> <span id="s372">But on the other hand, he didn’t live in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s373">He lived in Wolomin which was close to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s374">There could have been a ghetto in Wolomin.</span> <span id="s375">On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people may have been moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s376">But usually people who had to move into a place did very, very badly.</span> <span id="s377">And my father obviously didn’t fare badly.</span> <span id="s378">I think that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s379">He probably did just simply get moved from Wolomin into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s380">Let’s say for the purposes of this record that he was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Have you looked up any of the records about Wolomin if they did transfer them at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, I have never done that.</span> <span id="s383">It’s funny, I’m a historian and not a genealogist and so I’m interested in what happened to the Jews and I’ve never bothered to look up the specifics of my father’s experience in any systematic way.</span> <span id="s384">A lot of his experiences that he described are very, very similar to what you read in the memoirs.</span> <span id="s385">So it fits in very well.</span> <span id="s386">But I never tried to….</span> <span id="s387">.</span> <span id="s388">when I was reading Itzhak Arrad’s book about ????</span> <span id="s389">Treblinka which is about the operation ???</span> <span id="s390">death camps which basically gassed all the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was living in because the section of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general government.</span> <span id="s391">The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland and created the general government and the Soviets took the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s392">So my father was in the general government.</span> <span id="s393">Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about Wolomin.</span> <span id="s394">There was description of deportations from Wolomin but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s395">There probably are no records of the Wolomin ghetto.</span> <span id="s396">In any case, for the sake of argument I say that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s397">I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s398">He never said that.</span> <span id="s399">This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin Mutti who wouldn’t have known because my cousin Mutti could only give me information about the pre-war period because he left in 1938.</span> <span id="s400">I have a memory from when I was a child of a friend of my father’s from Wolomin, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumberyard who he was in Auschwitz with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the war.</span> <span id="s401">He’s still alive, a man named Shaya May.</span> <span id="s402">I think he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s403">He was alive five years ago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s404">Shaya once I remember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually he was talking to my mother about my father during the war.</span> <span id="s405">He mentioned something about my father working for that traitorous Council or something like that.</span> <span id="s406">A lot of Jews hated the Council.</span> <span id="s407">He was certainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly would have come across his name if he were.</span> <span id="s408">The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had several hundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on the Council.</span> <span id="s409">So he may have worked on the Council.</span> <span id="s410">From my memories of all the stories of the ghetto years I don’t have any sense that he was in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s411">Obviously all the Jews had very little food and fuel and so forth.</span> <span id="s412">Things were very difficult in the ghettoes.</span> <span id="s413">But his family was intact.</span> <span id="s414">He had a son and his daughter.</span> <span id="s415">His son and daughter attended school.</span> <span id="s416">I think his wife taught school in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s417">My mother said that.</span> <span id="s418">Either she taught school or she taught piano.</span> <span id="s419">I think both stories, I remember.</span> <span id="s420">So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance that took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and sort of doing moral and cultural and so forth things.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t think I know very much more about the specific ghetto experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So you don’t know if they lived with other families or….</span> <span id="s423">?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: That I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s425">The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never wanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time.</span> <span id="s426">I should add I have another source about my father’s experiences and that is that when he went to school in America, when he came to America, the equivalent of “What I did on my summer vacation,” he had to write an essay about his experiences.</span> <span id="s427">He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of it is missing.</span> <span id="s428">But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on.</span> <span id="s429">He doesn’t provide specific details about what it was like in the ghetto or in the camps.</span> <span id="s430">There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears she made one.</span> <span id="s431">She doesn’t know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy.</span> <span id="s432">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s433">But the copy just doesn’t exist.</span> <span id="s434">Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal document that she typed for him.</span> <span id="s435">So I don’t know if he lived with others or what the situation was.</span> <span id="s436">Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation.</span> <span id="s437">Most of his family, of course, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s438">Simcha was in Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew.</span> <span id="s439">He was shot during the time of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s440">I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the street.</span> <span id="s441">So Simcha died before the deportations.</span> <span id="s442">And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved to Warsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don’t know why he had moved or what he did at all.</span> <span id="s443">Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since he was in Lukow he didn’t really know the war….</span> <span id="s444">.</span> <span id="s445">he actually knew my father the least well because my father was already in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s446">He remembers my father coming home to visit twice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that.</span> <span id="s447">His stories are really best.</span> <span id="s448">From my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too.</span> <span id="s449">Anyway so I really don’t know much about the ghetto years except that things were okay.</span> <span id="s450">His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay.</span> <span id="s451">Of course then came the deportations.</span> <span id="s452">During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto, his mother was shot.</span> <span id="s453">She was in her sixties and rather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or wherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they shot her.</span> <span id="s454">Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn’t in Lukow.</span> <span id="s455">She was shot.</span> <span id="s456">I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Do you know what year this was, was it ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it’s ’42.</span> <span id="s459">The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically and liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of ’42 and was over by October ’42 with some pockets left.</span> <span id="s460">That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in the….</span> <span id="s461">was it the Lublin?</span> <span id="s462">Yeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of other places.</span> <span id="s463">There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue.</span> <span id="s464">Those were destroyed in ’43.</span> <span id="s465">I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in ’42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the labor camp, in the Jeneska Road labor camp or Poniyet Tovah, I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father’s son was already twelve by that time then his older brother’s kids could have been teenagers.</span> <span id="s466">So maybe they were in….</span> <span id="s467">.</span> <span id="s468">But I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s469">I assume that everybody was just killed in ’42.</span> <span id="s470">His sister Nehama, though, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein.</span> <span id="s471">Yes, her name was Bernstein.</span> <span id="s472">Pearlman was my father’s wife’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s473">She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when I was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men’s Benevolent Association and all the people who had come from my father’s town -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama.</span> <span id="s474">They looked at me.</span> <span id="s475">I don’t look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her.</span> <span id="s476">But anyway she and her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the woods.</span> <span id="s477">They somehow escaped the ghetto.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t know if they escaped in ’42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding in the woods near there in the Lublin region.</span> <span id="s479">And they were only killed in ’44, about three months before the end of the war in that part of Poland.</span> <span id="s480">They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point.</span> <span id="s481">So I don’t know what happened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they were shot right away or whatever.</span> <span id="s482">But they did succeed in hiding.</span> <span id="s483">Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma.</span> <span id="s484">Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the name Helenie.</span> <span id="s485">There are pictures on the back that say Helenie.</span> <span id="s486">I think she was the only one that used a Polish name.</span> <span id="s487">My father didn’t.</span> <span id="s488">He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names.</span> <span id="s489">But she used both Nechuma and Helenie.</span> <span id="s490">But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of vodka).</span> <span id="s491">The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews.</span> <span id="s492">Now I don’t know if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles.</span> <span id="s493">Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows.</span> <span id="s494">I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there’s not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in Warsaw and presumably they were deported in 1942.</span> <span id="s495">Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family was deported in ’42 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were deported.</span> <span id="s496">In Lukow Haim, his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family hadn’t.</span> <span id="s497">My father’s brother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone.</span> <span id="s498">His son Mutti, followed him in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children.</span> <span id="s499">So they were all presumably killed also in ’42.</span> <span id="s500">Shia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding until ’44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I don’t know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported.</span> <span id="s501">Now this is not necessarily true.</span> <span id="s502">He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time.</span> <span id="s503">He definitely was deported to Auschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel, he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own family.</span> <span id="s504">But her family was mostly in Palestine because they were all Zionist who’d come mostly in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s505">So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else.</span> <span id="s506">So in fact the first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in English.</span> <span id="s507">So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn’t know English yet but Mutti knew English and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I didn’t read it quite as easily.</span> <span id="s508">But she found nobody else.</span> <span id="s509">So I assume obviously she would have found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people.</span> <span id="s510">So he was presumably killed either in ’42 or ’43 or ’44, everybody else.</span> <span id="s511">And Nehama definitely in ’44.</span> <span id="s512">Simcha at some point before ’42, everybody else in ’42 except for my father and his family.</span> <span id="s513">In any case assuming that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto in August/September of 1942.</span> <span id="s514">That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in Warsaw, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Maybe that lent itself also to them having slightly better food conditions or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s517">Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad the Wolomin was totally destroyed in 1942.</span> <span id="s518">So my father I know was in the ghetto until April of 1943.</span> <span id="s519">That’s Warsaw, that April ’43 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s520">In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that’s around, I mean the Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach.</span> <span id="s521">And they didn’t die that night.</span> <span id="s522">I’ll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s523">So Pesach of 1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then.</span> <span id="s524">I don’t know, maybe because he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience.</span> <span id="s525">His mother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach.</span> <span id="s526">My father, therefore, and his wife and his children and his wife’s sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s527">So he was in the ghetto after that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were liquidated.</span> <span id="s528">So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of ’43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s529">Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36.</span> <span id="s530">Well he wasn’t yet because his birthday is November, so he was 35 years old.</span> <span id="s531">And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s532">And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto.</span> <span id="s533">Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the ghetto down.</span> <span id="s534">And my father and his family decided to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s535">I don’t know if that means they went through the sewers or not.</span> <span id="s536">In Warsaw that’s how people escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s537">This is where he really told.</span> <span id="s538">My father told the stories from the escape from the Warsaw ghetto until liberation.</span> <span id="s539">That’s what he told.</span> <span id="s540">The ghetto experience didn’t interest him.</span> <span id="s541">That must mean that it was not too terrible.</span> <span id="s542">My image of hearing the story as a child was that they escaped into the woods.</span> <span id="s543">But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or around Warsaw even for that matter.</span> <span id="s544">So I don’t know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the sewers.</span> <span id="s545">But in any case they escaped.</span> <span id="s546">Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non-Jews.</span> <span id="s547">And nobody would do it.</span> <span id="s548">He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that.</span> <span id="s549">So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they escaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they were just out.</span> <span id="s550">They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that person because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go to a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I was a little kid when I heard this so I don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s551">Somehow Avraham, my father’s son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that’s my way of Hebraisizing it again, it’s Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham.</span> <span id="s552">Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s553">My father’s wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no.</span> <span id="s554">We’ll lose you if you do that.</span> <span id="s555">We have to stick together and go to the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s556">We’ll find Avremy at the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s557">And she just was mad with concern for her son who’s not technically her son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son.</span> <span id="s558">And she went to look for him and they never saw her again.</span> <span id="s559">I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to Auschwitz which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not Auschwitz, maybe she was taken to Treblinka, I don’t know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed.</span> <span id="s560">But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm house and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for.</span> <span id="s561">Who knows why he took them, but he took them.</span> <span id="s562">This is April of ’43, my father, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don’t know and then they were arrested, they were found.</span> <span id="s563">I mean it was very hard to really escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them.</span> <span id="s564">And he was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s565">They were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s566">Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them were not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don’t know how old his sister-in-law was, presumably in her thirties too but she was crippled.</span> <span id="s567">And she was as if the mother of these children.</span> <span id="s568">She was an adult female with two children.</span> <span id="s569">And so when they got to Auschwitz, he was sent to the left or the right, whichever way.</span> <span id="s570">He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which means that they were gassed.</span> <span id="s571">So in April of 1943 his son and his daughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s572">But he was in Auschwitz and he was a slave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time.</span> <span id="s573">He worked in Auschwitz and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot.</span> <span id="s574">He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was.</span> <span id="s575">My father talked about his experience in the camps a lot.</span> <span id="s576">Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950’s if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk .</span> <span id="s577">People would say Mark what was it like.</span> <span id="s578">And he would talk.</span> <span id="s579">And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this.</span> <span id="s580">And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much.</span> <span id="s581">He certainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it.</span> <span id="s582">And in fact when people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing?</span> <span id="s583">Like my father would say we found a rat and we ate it or something.</span> <span id="s584">And they’d say, ooh how could you eat a rat?</span> <span id="s585">It’s not really nasty.</span> <span id="s586">And he would say, you shouldn’t talk, you don’t know what it’s like to be in a fire.</span> <span id="s587">I remember the expression, you don’t know what it’s like to be in a fire.</span> <span id="s588">But he wouldn’t dwell on how awful it was except to indicate that it was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting.</span> <span id="s589">He indicated that but that’s not what he dwelled on.</span> <span id="s590">What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive.</span> <span id="s591">The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the camps was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do.</span> <span id="s592">I don’t mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together to try to survive, and so forth.</span> <span id="s593">For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things.</span> <span id="s594">He talked all the time of it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself.</span> <span id="s595">Onions or garlic so you could get vitamins.</span> <span id="s596">All of that which I’ve read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about the need to trade.</span> <span id="s597">Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed.</span> <span id="s598">So he talked about that a lot.</span> <span id="s599">He didn’t use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s600">But he talked about that you really needed to do that.</span> <span id="s601">He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s602">My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s603">And that the only way you could survive such a horrible place was to hold on to the will to live and that’s how you did it, you just held on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s604">Like literally held on to it.</span> <span id="s605">And every second said, I’m going to live, I’m going to live, I’m going to live.</span> <span id="s606">I just remember that vividly.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever.</span> <span id="s608">There are different strategies that people used.</span> <span id="s609">That I don’t remember, his own personal strategies.</span> <span id="s610">But I do remember him talking about that -- holding on to the will to live.</span> <span id="s611">I also remember that of course it made him lose all faith in God.</span> <span id="s612">Actually I don’t remember that, I take that back.</span> <span id="s613">He did lose all faith in God.</span> <span id="s614">But that he didn’t tell me about.</span> <span id="s615">My mother told me about that when I was older.</span> <span id="s616">He didn’t want me to know that because he didn’t think that was fair to me.</span> <span id="s617">He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn’t believe in God as a result of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s618">And he didn’t believe in God because his children had been killed and everybody’s children had been killed not just his.</span> <span id="s619">That didn’t stop him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shul all the time.</span> <span id="s620">He didn’t stop being a Jew, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s621">Well, actually he did stop going to shul until I was born.</span> <span id="s622">From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a shul, he would not do anything religious.</span> <span id="s623">He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not do anything religious.</span> <span id="s624">No, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s625">He would go to a Passover seder.</span> <span id="s626">I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shul.</span> <span id="s627">When I was born he didn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s628">He went to shul to name me.</span> <span id="s629">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s630">That’s what eastern Jewry was like.</span> <span id="s631">You were a Jew.</span> <span id="s632">You did things because you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s633">Jews named their daughters in shul.</span> <span id="s634">The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s635">You know you had to.</span> <span id="s636">Just because you didn’t believe in God didn’t mean that you didn’t name your daughter in shul.</span> <span id="s637">And that broke the ice and he went to shul all the time.</span> <span id="s638">He loved to go to shul.</span> <span id="s639">He absolutely loved to go to shul.</span> <span id="s640">He didn’t go every week, he wasn’t religious.</span> <span id="s641">But he went at least once a month.</span> <span id="s642">He really loved to go to shul.</span> <span id="s643">In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school but my mother didn’t want me to go because we weren’t that religious and in those days it was just orthodox schools.</span> <span id="s644">Getting back to his experiences I don’t remember that he talked about how he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss of faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: No, I don’t remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for soap which is not a specific incident; I’m sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was.</span> <span id="s647">I think in his testimony for reparations he did provide some specific instances.</span> <span id="s648">But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn’t remember them and had lost the carbon copy.</span> <span id="s649">I’m sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn’t singled out.</span> <span id="s650">I’m sure there were but I really don’t unfortunately know any very specific thing.</span> <span id="s651">In terms of what he actually did in the camp, I assume he did a variety of labor things.</span> <span id="s652">He could be a carpenter so presumably when they asked him what do you do, he said I’m a carpenter and they did have him building.</span> <span id="s653">My mother used to say that he built crematoria.</span> <span id="s654">But they were already built by the time he got there so I don’t -- see my mother was really bad at detail.</span> <span id="s655">It was a shame.</span> <span id="s656">I’m a historian concerned with detail and she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s657">And my father died when I was young.</span> <span id="s658">So I’m bringing all these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of something very specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: If you don’t have it that’s okay too.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- in the Warsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse, and he would say, lady, you haven’t been through a fire, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s661">People were in awe of my father.</span> <span id="s662">He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories.</span> <span id="s663">I don’t remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I’ll come to something.</span> <span id="s664">I don’t remember anything specific.</span> <span id="s665">I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of ’43 until January of ’45 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s666">In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s667">Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the camp and in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions of other people described -- marched off people to Germany.</span> <span id="s668">And my father was part of that death march.</span> <span id="s669">I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps.</span> <span id="s670">I remember him saying that it was very cold.</span> <span id="s671">It was January, it was winter, and they didn’t have boots and they didn’t have coats.</span> <span id="s672">Two thirds of the people died.</span> <span id="s673">And I remember him saying that you couldn’t fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die.</span> <span id="s674">The snow was deceptive.</span> <span id="s675">You think that it’s warm when you’re in it and so you could fall asleep.</span> <span id="s676">And then of course you freeze to death because in fact it’s not warm it’s cold.</span> <span id="s677">So you should never go to sleep in the snow.</span> <span id="s678">And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay awake.</span> <span id="s679">In some of the memoirs I’ve read about how they were put in barns, my father never talked about that.</span> <span id="s680">He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people up.</span> <span id="s681">The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point.</span> <span id="s682">He was taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s683">Other people went to other places.</span> <span id="s684">They were in Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s685">They were all taken to concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s686">He personally was taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months.</span> <span id="s687">I don’t know how long it actually took him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau.</span> <span id="s688">In some of the memoirs you read how that part of the way they were on trains and trucks and so forth.</span> <span id="s689">My father never said that.</span> <span id="s690">He just said the death march.</span> <span id="s691">He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s692">So he was in Dachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945.</span> <span id="s693">And I have a couple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation.</span> <span id="s694">Not of the moment of liberation.</span> <span id="s695">Not of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the actual moment but I won’t put this in my father’s record.</span> <span id="s696">It’s one of those classic stories, the other story of how this other person got out of Dachau.</span> <span id="s697">The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the streets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth.</span> <span id="s698">That’s not my father’s story.</span> <span id="s699">Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with him and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth.</span> <span id="s700">And after the war they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my father said what are you doing that for because now we have food.</span> <span id="s701">And Shia was still too scared that there would be no food.</span> <span id="s702">But that again is not my father’s story because that’s not what he did.</span> <span id="s703">He of course was nothing at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s704">He was utterly emaciated and utterly depleted.</span> <span id="s705">My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s706">I can’t believe that.</span> <span id="s707">But he must have weighed seventy or eighty.</span> <span id="s708">My mother was also an exaggerator a little bit.</span> <span id="s709">But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s710">He was not a huge man anyway, he was probably about five nine.</span> <span id="s711">He was broad but thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: He must have been strong to have survived all the labor and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s714">He was actually old to survive.</span> <span id="s715">Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why they’re still alive.</span> <span id="s716">My father if he were alive today would be in his eighties.</span> <span id="s717">I mean he happened to die when he was young.</span> <span id="s718">He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he hadn’t died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old.</span> <span id="s719">No, that’s not right.</span> <span id="s720">Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday.</span> <span id="s721">Whereas most of the survivors that you talk to I’m sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties during the war.</span> <span id="s722">My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been extraordinarily strong.</span> <span id="s723">It’s funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already be no longer at the height of their physical strength but it’s true.</span> <span id="s724">So it’s just amazing that he lived.</span> <span id="s725">But anyway he was liberated by the Americans.</span> <span id="s726">He did not go to a DP camp which was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find housing.</span> <span id="s727">He must have learned English working for them or before but he lived in an apartment in Munich.</span> <span id="s728">He had a real apartment and had a real job and sort of went about his business.</span> <span id="s729">I assume for a few months, I mean I assume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate.</span> <span id="s730">In fact he said that it was months before he felt like a human being again.</span> <span id="s731">I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked around the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist.</span> <span id="s732">He found a dentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth.</span> <span id="s733">The dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need.</span> <span id="s734">He was so into pain that it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s735">And the German dentist didn’t charge him because my father had a number, he had been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s736">He just showed his number.</span> <span id="s737">In fact in those days you just showed your number and you got anything.</span> <span id="s738">He didn’t pay for too much after the war.</span> <span id="s739">The apartment I think was also free.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived there.</span> <span id="s741">And I said how did you get food.</span> <span id="s742">Well, we got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Well, if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: No, I mean in cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: But if they lived in cities -- well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before that he didn’t have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: There was guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yeah, although the Germans didn’t have any food.</span> <span id="s748">They must have been given food by the American army of occupation.</span> <span id="s749">He must have just been given it.</span> <span id="s750">I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s751">I know somebody who studies the DP camps, she might know.</span> <span id="s752">Anyway, so he wasn’t in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s753">I assume he stayed in Dachau because that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s754">They set up barracks and gave people food and medicine and let them come to themselves.</span> <span id="s755">We have pictures of my father right after the war, not right, right after the war but in ’46 where he looks fine.</span> <span id="s756">He had obviously regained his strength and so forth.</span> <span id="s757">But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he did have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which is very weird.</span> <span id="s758">And she knew Yiddish which is very weird.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: I heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian.</span> <span id="s761">She was a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s762">Her name was Lisa, well probably Elizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname.</span> <span id="s763">Just a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s764">Her husband had been a soldier probably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access to food and people were starving.</span> <span id="s765">She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s766">To live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just ….</span> <span id="s767">.</span> <span id="s768">I remember him saying he used to have dreams.</span> <span id="s769">His mother would come and beat him up in his dreams.</span> <span id="s770">The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was -- a German shiksa no else.</span> <span id="s771">Well, I mean from my grandmother’s point of view a shiksa is a shiksa, it doesn’t matter what kind.</span> <span id="s772">But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn’t really help.</span> <span id="s773">I’ll show you her picture.</span> <span id="s774">She was gorgeous, just beautiful.</span> <span id="s775">I have this huge urge to look her up although she’s probably eighty-five years old, too.</span> <span id="s776">I mean at the end of the war how old was my father?</span> <span id="s777">In 1947 he was forty right.</span> <span id="s778">And she may have been ten years younger so she would only be in her mid-seventies at this time.</span> <span id="s779">I don’t know her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: I think it would be interesting to learn something about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I don’t know her name.</span> <span id="s782">Her name is Lisa.</span> <span id="s783">I don’t know her last name.</span> <span id="s784">Although actually some of my father’s Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America, they might know her name because she lived with him.</span> <span id="s785">All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s786">There she is, she’s with them.</span> <span id="s787">My father did know German though, he probably did speak to her in German.</span> <span id="s788">Anyway, so he lived in Germany and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the United States.</span> <span id="s789">That was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution.</span> <span id="s790">I guess because he worked for UNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that.</span> <span id="s791">And he came to the United States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in Munich.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t think he ever had any contact with her again.</span> <span id="s793">Maybe initially he did but not for very long.</span> <span id="s794">He got himself a job very quickly.</span> <span id="s795">It was the only job he ever had in America.</span> <span id="s796">He actually lived with a Lukower.</span> <span id="s797">He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when.</span> <span id="s798">But her son, Muttel, who was my father’s friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father’s friend in Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman.</span> <span id="s799">Muttel came later to America, too.</span> <span id="s800">But he lived with Mrs. Feldman.</span> <span id="s801">He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, he got a job right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know furniture that’s inside stores.</span> <span id="s802">And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with wood, he owned a lumberyard, and he was also very handy, actually more than handy.</span> <span id="s803">He was talented with his hands.</span> <span id="s804">He could build beautiful things and so on.</span> <span id="s805">So he got a job there, initially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn’t -- I don’t know, whatever -- but he also worked for them supervising job installations.</span> <span id="s806">When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he went out to Bambergers and made sure the job was done right.</span> <span id="s807">And what he wanted more than anything was to save up enough money to open some kind of business.</span> <span id="s808">He was an entrepreneur by nature and that’s what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s809">He died before he could do that.</span> <span id="s810">But that’s what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s811">So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days -- oh actually I have a funny story to tell.</span> <span id="s812">I know you’re mostly interested in the Holocaust but I love this story.</span> <span id="s813">When he came to America he was met at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus.</span> <span id="s814">Actually she was an aunt-in-law.</span> <span id="s815">She was his mother’s brother’s wife.</span> <span id="s816">His mother’s brother had died.</span> <span id="s817">They had come to America probably before World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American.</span> <span id="s818">Anyway his uncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I’ll speak to you in Yiddish, tomorrow only English.</span> <span id="s819">You’re now in America, you have to speak English.</span> <span id="s820">Presumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA.</span> <span id="s821">Today I will call you Mendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name is Mark.</span> <span id="s822">She gave him a name that was common in America.</span> <span id="s823">In 1947 Mark was a common name.</span> <span id="s824">So in fact, when he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark.</span> <span id="s825">So in America he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternate….</span> <span id="s826">.</span> <span id="s827">she called him Mark most of the time, but she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name.</span> <span id="s828">Mendel was his name.</span> <span id="s829">He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark.</span> <span id="s830">Although he used it, it was his American name.</span> <span id="s831">My cousins called him uncle Mark and my uncle called him -- I mean everybody called him Mark.</span> <span id="s832">Anyway he came to America, was met by his aunt, he got a job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in November of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950.</span> <span id="s833">The rest is history.</span> <span id="s834">He adjusted extremely well to America.</span> <span id="s835">He loved America.</span> <span id="s836">He felt utterly happy to be American.</span> <span id="s837">He had an American wife which is unusual for survivors.</span> <span id="s838">He didn’t feel the need to be -----of course he was friends with all the people who survived from his town.</span> <span id="s839">My mother hated them.</span> <span id="s840">They were a bunch of people who survived from this town.</span> <span id="s841">Actually a very large number considering how tiny the town was.</span> <span id="s842">Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel.</span> <span id="s843">I think Muttel had been in the camps.</span> <span id="s844">Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.</span> <span id="s845">God, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen.</span> <span id="s846">They’re so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s847">And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband.</span> <span id="s848">There’s this sort of crew of people that I grew up with.</span> <span id="s849">Those people, I haven’t seen them in a hundred years.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: But they all ended up in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: They all ended up in New York, all the survivors.</span> <span id="s852">There were probably eight of them; it’s not like there were hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s853">But there were some of them.</span> <span id="s854">Some of them actually subsequently moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s855">In the 50’s and 60’s they lived in America and 70’s and some of them retired to Israel.</span> <span id="s856">Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s857">But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America, in New York.</span> <span id="s858">I mean, unless they’re dead, I haven’t spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time.</span> <span id="s859">So my father adjusted very, very well to life in America.</span> <span id="s860">He really did.</span> <span id="s861">He didn’t want to have children because he lost two.</span> <span id="s862">He had one because he thought it wasn’t fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn’t have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your children.</span> <span id="s863">In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously.</span> <span id="s864">He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said.</span> <span id="s865">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s866">That was from my mother.</span> <span id="s867">He was in his daily life in America, fine.</span> <span id="s868">He joked and laughed and was successful.</span> <span id="s869">I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family.</span> <span id="s870">I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares.</span> <span id="s871">He missed his son profoundly.</span> <span id="s872">He was in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah.</span> <span id="s873">He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his son died just before his own.</span> <span id="s874">The loss of his children was really unbearable to him.</span> <span id="s875">The loss of everyone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I felt it an honor.</span> <span id="s878">I felt very privileged.</span> <span id="s879">I felt very special as a child.</span> <span id="s880">I felt that I was privy, very close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better than others.</span> <span id="s881">I felt honored.</span> <span id="s882">I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth.</span> <span id="s883">But I felt very special.</span> <span id="s884">I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn’t have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain of it.</span> <span id="s885">I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors.</span> <span id="s886">Both because of the Lukower, all of these people who had survived, but also because in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors.</span> <span id="s887">There were lots of survivors.</span> <span id="s888">I had friends whose parents were survivors.</span> <span id="s889">Not all my friends, certainly.</span> <span id="s890">In fact probably most of my friends didn’t have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg’s parents were survivors and whatever, I don’t have to name all the names.</span> <span id="s891">But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all.</span> <span id="s892">But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility, probably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old.</span> <span id="s893">I remember, my father always talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s894">We didn’t call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the Nazis, whatever.</span> <span id="s895">So I don’t remember not knowing about it.</span> <span id="s896">I always knew about it.</span> <span id="s897">But I do remember the first time I saw pictures.</span> <span id="s898">There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would know how horrible the camps were.</span> <span id="s899">And my father had a set.</span> <span id="s900">In the back it said “Zo vais in Dachau” So it was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s901">It was horrific pictures.</span> <span id="s902">You know those really gross concentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the place and so forth.</span> <span id="s903">And I remember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited.</span> <span id="s904">I remember that very vividly.</span> <span id="s905">I mean this wasn’t a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive.</span> <span id="s906">Not then, he was already dead.</span> <span id="s907">Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely.</span> <span id="s908">Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: I think that should probably cover it.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: As much as you guys need, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s912">If there’s anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have it in the museum we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah, I’m just trying to think.</span> <span id="s914">You know of course I’m not the survivor so I can’t give you the details that your survivors are giving you.</span> <span id="s915">My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn’t get a chance to question him and whatever.</span> <span id="s916">My cousin in Israel could only provide information about Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s917">My mother was bad at detail.</span> <span id="s918">So it’s a hard thing.</span> <span id="s919">Let me just think of a few other things randomly.</span> <span id="s920">My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s921">He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn’t hate all Germans.</span> <span id="s922">I mean I think the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that.</span> <span id="s923">He taught me that.</span> <span id="s924">He taught me that I had to distinguish between people.</span> <span id="s925">Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil.</span> <span id="s926">I probably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood.</span> <span id="s927">That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although.</span> <span id="s928">That was the sense I probably got.</span> <span id="s929">I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people.</span> <span id="s930">I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog.</span> <span id="s931">From my father I learned that you survived because you were clever.</span> <span id="s932">You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically.</span> <span id="s933">You were clever.</span> <span id="s934">You figured things out.</span> <span id="s935">You were lucky, gutsy.</span> <span id="s936">That’s what made you live, not being underhanded and mean but being tough and strong.</span> <span id="s937">In fact I had a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s938">I went to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact gave a paper on it.</span> <span id="s939">I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level.</span> <span id="s940">But I went to not all the sessions but many of the sessions.</span> <span id="s941">I went to the final session which was held at the kotel, at the wall, when there were speeches.</span> <span id="s942">Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird.</span> <span id="s943">But anyway English was the common language because there were French survivors and whatever.</span> <span id="s944">Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold.</span> <span id="s945">It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold.</span> <span id="s946">Begin, maybe he wasn’t the last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly.</span> <span id="s947">Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because thee were hundreds of speakers.</span> <span id="s948">He was going on.</span> <span id="s949">He was already prime minister.</span> <span id="s950">He was going on and on and he was really being nasty.</span> <span id="s951">He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn’t live in Israel they were traitors to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s952">It was a really not nice, disgusting speech.</span> <span id="s953">Half the crowd started to leave.</span> <span id="s954">They just started to leave.</span> <span id="s955">They picked themselves up and they walked.</span> <span id="s956">My American side, that is my Protestant side, I mean I’m not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you just stand on line whatever, was appalled that they would do that.</span> <span id="s957">Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think he’s saying awful things, and I certainly don’t agree with Menachem Begin politically and I though what he was saying was awful.</span> <span id="s958">But still he’s the prime minister of a country.</span> <span id="s959">You don’t get up and leave in the middle of his speech.</span> <span id="s960">It’s just not nice even if you’re cold and even if you’re unhappy you don’t do it.</span> <span id="s961">And so I was really annoyed.</span> <span id="s962">My sort of American side that hates when people cheat on line was getting very angry.</span> <span id="s963">And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation, wait a second, that’s why they survived.</span> <span id="s964">They just do what seems to them the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s965">And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood.</span> <span id="s966">My father’s dead for a long time and I’ve moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them.</span> <span id="s967">I didn’t leave because I’m not them.</span> <span id="s968">But they left because that’s why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life.</span> <span id="s969">The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings.</span> <span id="s970">Even if they’re a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics.</span> <span id="s971">And the ones who are were lunatics anyway.</span> <span id="s972">The ones who are were lunatics before the war.</span> <span id="s973">This had a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for the most part.</span> <span id="s974">There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals.</span> <span id="s975">All the survivors I know as children all of them made it.</span> <span id="s976">Even if they were just laborers, they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families.</span> <span id="s977">They were fine, they were really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that’s understandable.</span> <span id="s978">But anyway so I love them all because they are what they are.</span> <span id="s979">They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the moment instinctively.</span> <span id="s980">I don’t know if there’s anything else I can say at all.</span> <span id="s981">This is not about my father’s American experience and that’s of course what I’m most familiar with.</span> <span id="s982">He had a good one.</span> <span id="s983">He spoke English all the time to my mother.</span> <span id="s984">They spoke Yiddish when they didn’t want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s985">He was fiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn’t fast on Yom Kippur because he didn’t believe in God anymore and he’d gone hungry long enough.</span> <span id="s986">But I didn’t know he didn’t fast on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s987">He didn’t want me to know that because ……I mean I’m sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little.</span> <span id="s988">I think that’s all I have to say, at least now.</span> <span id="s989">If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add it.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s991">I want to thank you very much for your time and for this interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: You’re welcome, you’re welcome.</span> <span id="s993">Let me add just one last thing.</span> <span id="s994">I know this is not going to go into the cards that you’re doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Yes they will.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: So I’ll just say it.</span> <span id="s997">My son is named for my father.</span> <span id="s998">I’m named for my father’s mother and he’s named for my father.</span> <span id="s999">And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark and it’s very nice.</span> <span id="s1000">And he really feels connected to my father and to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1001">He has always known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do.</span> <span id="s1002">I feel it both in my professional life and in my personal life.</span> <span id="s1003">And I’m very pleased that I was able to tell my son about the Holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way that emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be careful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a Holocaust survivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey the meaning of the Holocaust to the next generation and I’m glad I was able to do it with my own son.</span> <span id="s1004">A lot of children of Holocaust survivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for interviewing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I have one more thing to add, I just remembered.</span> <span id="s1007">When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my father’s wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in September, October, November of 1939; you go escape.</span> <span id="s1008">After all the Germans won’t hurt women and children but they might hurt men.</span> <span id="s1009">And my father said well it’s true the Germans certainly won’t hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1010">His memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved.</span> <span id="s1011">The Germans were civilized and nice and so forth.</span> <span id="s1012">So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn’t be so bad but he didn’t want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn’t want to go to the east.</span> <span id="s1013">He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians.</span> <span id="s1014">I will take my chances with the Germans and I don’t want to leave my family alone and so forth.</span> <span id="s1015">So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1016">That’s all I wanted to add…</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1019">My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing terrible things to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1020">He understood that.</span> <span id="s1021">He just thought that ultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that it was at best to stay at home with family and take one’s chances with these Germans than go off to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Okay.</span></p></body></html>
