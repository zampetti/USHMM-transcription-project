mother’s name was Malie (or Mallie?)</span> <span id="s9">Sichel.</span> <span id="s10">Mother’s father’s name was Simon Sichel My father’s mother’s name was Hanna Winter, maiden name Monheimer.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Grandfathers’s name was Falk Winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Grandmother was about 80 about ‘22.</span> <span id="s13">Died in 1922.</span> <span id="s14">and never knew my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Never knew mother’s parents too.</span> <span id="s16">Never knew either grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">My parents married in 1899.</span> <span id="s18">They were matched.</span> <span id="s19">Introduced and the man who introduced mother to father said that father comes from wealthy parents.</span> <span id="s20">Only trouble in family is red hair.</span> <span id="s21">If she doesn’t mind red hair, he is the only child so she will do very well.</span> <span id="s22">So my mother said it doesn’t bother me, I have to see the man.</span> <span id="s23">When she was introduced she really fell in love with him and I don’t blame her, I would have too.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Set up by a matchmaker.</span> <span id="s25">When my mother’s parents died, she moved to her sister who was married and her sister’s husband was a teacher and a cantor.</span> <span id="s26">The cantor and teacher in our home town was a friend of his and that how he ur... not really a matchmaker but a friendly matchmaker.</span> <span id="s27">Actually through a mutual friend.</span></p> <p><span

too much.</span> <span id="s31">Very bossy.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SF: Comes naturally</span></p> <p><span id="s33">FF: Why do you have to look at each other like that.</span> <span id="s34">In fact when the minister in our town wanted a special sermon written up he came to my grandmother and she could write like a writer.</span> <span id="s35">She was very bright.</span> <span id="s36">And my parents were very good people, very honest people, very charitable people.</span> <span id="s37">They helped everybody.</span> <span id="s38">Everybody.</span> <span id="s39">No matter what religion or whatever.</span> <span id="s40">Color they didn’t have at that time.</span> <span id="s41">In fact one beggar came to town and my parents were away.</span> <span id="s42">They were away.</span> <span id="s43">They were invited somewhere.</span> <span id="s44">When he got off the bus someone said to him ‘Fraü Winter isn’t home today’ so he said ‘I might as well go’ because if my mother wasn’t home he wouldn’t come.</span> <span id="s45">And the Jewish schnorrers they used to call, came every few weeks.</span> <span id="s46">He ate by us, he slept by us.</span> <span id="s47">And for a while he didn’t come and my parents knew where he came from so they called up the Jewish community there and he(had) died.</span> <span id="s48">And he left my mother all his earthly goods, which were 100 marks, and my mother went and took the 100 marks and got him a tombstone.</span> <span id="s49">That’s how good my parents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">We had every year from the, what do you call that, orphanage in Furth where Ida was.</span> <span id="s51">We had 4 boys all summer and we dressed them with shoes and everything and we sent them back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">For years.</span> <span id="s53">I was in love with one and I wrote it on a post card.</span> <span id="s54">The president of the school called my father and he told me never to write things like that on a postcard.</span> <span id="s55">What did I know.</span> <span id="s56">That was really great.</span> <span id="s57">It was a good, good home.</span></p>

mustache?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">FF: Had a mustache.</span> <span id="s66">And your (Ruth’s) mother was the only one who resembled my father in size, in tall he was about like Uncle Leo.</span> <span id="s67">Not quite that tall but tall.</span> <span id="s68">Not stocky.</span> <span id="s69">He was well proportioned but not fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">My mother used to be very beautiful but in the later years she got stout.</span> <span id="s71">She got stout.</span> <span id="s72">You know they ate a lot of ....</span> <span id="s73">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s74">She

mother didn’t approve of it.</span> <span id="s80">I never could find anything wrong with my parents.</span> <span id="s81">I was very young when I left and whenever I came home I really had a good, good time.</span> <span id="s82">I was lazy and didn’t want to do any work.</span> <span id="s83">And my mother always said “child, one time in life must everyone work and someday it is going to hit

<span id="s95">The green grass.</span> <span id="s96">The pasture.</span> <span id="s97">And we had further away those pastures.</span> <span id="s98">They had to be gone after.</span> <span id="s99">Then we had a very big garden with all kinds of fruit: apples, pears, plums, nuts, and the gardens they were...and we had beautiful gardens with every vegetable under the sun.</span> <span id="s100">We never bought vegetables.</span> <span id="s101">We never bought salad.</span> <span id="s102">We never bought fruit.</span> <span id="s103">We grew all the stuff like that.</span> <span

<span id="s114">We had big cellars.</span> <span id="s115">I told you our house was built on the cellars of a castle.</span> <span id="s116">And in the cellars we had those big...they were like closets and you pulled out the drawers and they were full of apples and then on the ground we had earth and in the earth we buried red beets and all those kinds of things.</span> <span id="s117">They last(ed) from one winter until the spring.</span> <span id="s118">Beets were kept in the bushels and kept in the sand.</span> <span id="s119">Big sacks were on pieces of paper.</span> <span id="s120">And the apples.</span> <span id="s121">Auch, did we have apples.</span> <span id="s122">We had a cellar twice the size of this room and the wooden things in which the apples were, were all

life.</span> <span id="s130">You would have enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s131">Oh God, how you would have enjoyed it as a child, to come to a place like this.</span> <span id="s132">You didn’t appreciate it because that’s all you knew.</span> <span id="s133">It was hard work.</span> <span id="s134">But that’s all they had to do, really.</span> <span id="s135">I mean there wasn’t... no woman

<p><span id="s149">My older sister was Marta and my other sister’s name was Gerda.</span> <span id="s150">My older sister was born August 1st, 1900 in Wittelshofen and Gerda was born May 17, 1903.</span> <span id="s151">Marta married Samuel Bravman.</span> <span id="s152">He was born February 10, 1893 and Gerda married Emmanuel Danzig who was born on July 29, 1895.</span> <span id="s153">Marta and Samuel met in Wittelshofen.</span> <span id="s154">He lived there; he came back after the first World War and that’s how they met.</span> <span id="s155">I was 6 years old and don’t know any of the details.</span> <span id="s156">Gerda met Emmanuel through a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s157">I told that friend that I have a sister who is older than me who I would love to come to München.</span> <span id="s158">He invited her and they fell in love, they really fell in love.</span> <span id="s159">But he always loved me.</span> <span id="s160">He always told me he loved me.</span> <span id="s161">In a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Samuel was a cattle dealer together with my father and Ruth’s father was first a procorist (sp?</span> <span id="s163">and word?)</span> <span id="s164">.</span> <span id="s165">He worked for Truler (name?)</span> <span id="s166">procorist.</span> <span id="s167">Like an accountant.</span> <span id="s168">In the accounting line.</span> <span id="s169">He had education for it.</span> <span id="s170">And later they moved away.</span> <span id="s171">The firm was sold to a firm in England and they moved to England (the firm) and then her father worked for the temple.</span> <span id="s172">First he held mincah service and then he did everything.</span> <span id="s173">He was the shamus and the banus and the...he did everything there was to do in the temple.</span> <span id="s174">He held the afternoon services and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">And then one boy, Sigbert, my favorite, was born to Marta and Samuel.</span> <span id="s176">He was born September 19, 1923.</span> <span id="s177">He was just a pride and joy to everybody.</span> <span id="s178">That’s Bianca’s brother.</span> <span id="s179">He was really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Sigbert became a baker.</span> <span id="s181">He was so smart but you couldn’t send him to school (because of the times).</span> <span id="s182">He would have outdone anybody.</span> <span id="s183">So Ida worked in Karlsruhe in her uncle’s bakery and they brought him there as a baker.</span> <span id="s184">She said he was one of the best.</span> <span id="s185">He was really the pride and joy to everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Ruth: Where does Ida fit in?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">FF: Ida’s uncle married my sister.</span> <span id="s188">Ida was a friend who lived in the same town.</span> <span id="s189">Ida’s mother was a widow.</span> <span id="s190">Her maiden name was Bravman.</span> <span id="s191">And my sister married the Bravman.</span> <span id="s192">So Ida is not related to me at all, but she called my sister Aunt Marta and her husband Uncle Samuel and I wanted her to call me Aunt Flora and she wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s193">We went to school together.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">First, the Turner and Weiler.</span> <span id="s195">Their father’s name was Sichel and he was a brother of my mother.</span> <span id="s196">My father had no brothers or sisters.</span> <span id="s197">He was an only child.</span> <span id="s198">My mother had 12 brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s199">There were 12 children altogether.</span> <span id="s200">One cousin is Aunt Saler.</span> <span id="s201">Her mother was a Sichel.</span> <span id="s202">And there was another sister and she had two sons and a daughter and the two sons were in the first World War.</span> <span id="s203">One was killed in action and one was at the day of the (World War I) armistice he threw a letter in the mailbox to tell his parents when he is coming home and the mailbox exploded and killed him.</span> <span id="s204">So my uncle and aunt just died of broken hearts, of TB.</span> <span id="s205">And their daughter was very badly spoiled and through the Hitler time I don’t know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Uncle Emmanuel was also in Portland.</span> <span id="s207">He died, his wife died and his sons died.</span> <span id="s208">There were three uncles in Portland.</span> <span id="s209">Sons were sent to America.</span> <span id="s210">And the other sisters they all died.</span> <span id="s211">Some of them I never knew.</span> <span id="s212">Don’t know what my mother’s parents did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Ruth Turner is my first cousin and was born in Portland.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Herta is from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s215">Aunt Herta’s mother and my father were first cousins.</span> <span id="s216">Herta’s mother’s maiden name was Winter and my father’s name was Winter.</span> <span id="s217">My father’s father and Herta’s mother’s father were brothers.</span> <span id="s218">And Gretl’s father was another brother of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s219">I don’t know how many brothers there were and there were two sisters also.</span> <span id="s220">I was not too interested in some of the relatives.</span> <span id="s221">When you are young, what do you care about such things?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">We’re aren’t related at all to the Kalbermans.</span> <span id="s223">No relation whatsoever.</span> <span id="s224">My father’s mother.</span> <span id="s225">No.</span> <span id="s226">Daddy’s mother’s...Uncle Max Frank.</span> <span id="s227">My (Actually Siegfried’s) father’s mother and Uncle Max were brother and sister and Uncle Max married Tanta’s (Mella Kalberman’s mother) sister, which is the Vineland family.</span> <span id="s228">Lehman.</span> <span id="s229">That’s pretty far.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">There are some pictures of daddy.</span> <span id="s231">You know, you wrote on them.</span> <span id="s232">That’s our daddy.</span> <span id="s233">The oldest was daddy.</span> <span id="s234">That’s our daddy with his bicycle he was so proud of.</span> <span id="s235">That was with his dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Cannot tell you about your father’s brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s237">Your father had one sister, Hedwig, who was married.</span> <span id="s238">Had no children.</span> <span id="s239">Father’s birthday October 16.</span> <span id="s240">Mother’s was born in 1873.</span> <span id="s241">Could be.</span> <span id="s242">And father was born in 1874.</span> <span id="s243">He was a year younger.</span> <span id="s244">Hermann Frank and Therese Frank.</span> <span id="s245">Her maiden name was Frank.</span> <span id="s246">They lived in Buttenwiesen.</span> <span id="s247">In Bavaria.</span> <span id="s248">The sister’s name was Hedwig.</span> <span id="s249">She was born 1902 and the other brother’s name was Karl and he was born 1904, Ernst was born 1907, and Ludwig 1912.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">In Buttenwiesen Siegfried was also a butcher and cattle dealer.</span> <span id="s251">He came to the United States in 1939.</span> <span id="s252">A cattle dealer was this.</span> <span id="s253">They bought cattles and all depends.</span> <span id="s254">If they had cattles for ... if they bought them for slaughter then they fat(ten) them up and then brought them to the cattle market auction.</span> <span id="s255">If they had cattles which the people needed for milk or for er... and they sold them from one to another.</span> <span id="s256">We bred cattles too.</span> <span id="s257">They went to the auctions and bought what they needed.</span> <span id="s258">If they had orders for cattles for pulling the wagons then they went to the auctions and tried to get them.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">SF: People put orders in to them for what kind of cattles they needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">FF: That’s right.</span> <span id="s261">And then they bought them and then sold them for profit.</span> <span id="s262">Sometimes we bred some cattles.</span> <span id="s263">There was a big, big cattle market that was a few days away.</span> <span id="s264">He had to go a few days and then bring them home and then fatten them up and then bring them to the slaughterhouses.</span> <span id="s265">That’s how they made the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">SF: Any of father’s relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">FF: The cousins Otto Frank and Walter Frank.</span> <span id="s268">Their fathers were brothers.</span> <span id="s269">They’re very old.</span> <span id="s270">Also the sister-in-law also is very old.</span> <span id="s271">They live in New York.</span> <span id="s272">They came to America the year you were born.</span> <span id="s273">I went with her...she knew how to sew and wanted to make a living at it.</span> <span id="s274">I went with her to those trade places.</span> <span id="s275">I was already that big but I took her under my arm and I went with her.</span> <span id="s276">We walked all over where the sewing places were.</span> <span id="s277">You know, those sweatshops.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Ruth: How did you meet Siegfried Frank?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">FF: Oh, boy.</span> <span id="s280">Somebody, a very old lady, a friend of my parents who liked me a lot and whenever I from Munich home I stopped in that city which was called Nordlingen to visit that old woman because I really liked her.</span> <span id="s281">And they came to America and they always asked me to come and visit them and finally one day I went there.</span> <span id="s282">Daddy was very friendly with a couple from Buttenwiesen and they were cousins with those Lefiters and the Leiters.</span> <span id="s283">The people I was friendly with (Leiters) and the people he was friendly with.</span> <span id="s284">They called me up once and asked me to come at that and that time so I asked why.</span> <span id="s285">They said they had a very good friend who would like to meet me, so I asked ‘what does he do?’</span> <span id="s286">So they said he is a butcher so I had no time.</span> <span id="s287">I had no time.</span> <span id="s288">So then she said ‘when do you have time to come’ and I said ‘I don’t know I’m very busy.’</span> <span id="s289">So one day she called me up and said “Look, you held us up long enough now.</span> <span id="s290">This is the best and nicest man you have ever met and you better come.</span> <span id="s291">Butcher or shoemaker or whatever it is you better come.</span> <span id="s292">You get down from your high horse and you better come.”</span> <span id="s293">And so I went.</span> <span id="s294">And daddy liked me right away.</span> <span id="s295">I had a hat on and he didn’t like my hat.</span> <span id="s296">I wore a hat.</span> <span id="s297">He said he couldn’t understand how I could wear a hat....</span> <span id="s298">I was 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Look at this picture.</span> <span id="s300">It was when I was single.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">SF: It says care of Eiseman on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">FF: That’s where I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">SF: you worked for the Eisemans?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">FF: not for those.</span> <span id="s305">For anyone, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">And then he invited me a few times.</span> <span id="s307">I was also going with another fella who was...who came from Nürnberg.</span> <span id="s308">I was very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s309">Daddy wanted to go steady but I told him I had to go to Lake Placid where I worked and I have to find out first what I really want.</span> <span id="s310">I liked the other fella better because he was better looking.</span> <span id="s311">I got letters.</span> <span id="s312">Daddy wrote to me and he wrote to me.</span> <span id="s313">That other guy, his name was Weil, wrote a letter to me and the envelope was addressed to me but the inside was addressed to a girl in Germany where he was going steady.</span> <span id="s314">He wrote about me and some of things were absolutely untrue.</span> <span id="s315">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s316">Now I said to myself ‘you went long enough for the outside of the person, now you better go for the inside.’</span> <span id="s317">Then I kept writing to daddy and he couldn’t understand the letters were so different.</span> <span id="s318">They changed so.</span> <span id="s319">I told him later.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Then that Beno (sp?)</span> <span id="s321">Weil was his name.</span> <span id="s322">I figured I cannot write to him, I have to tell him.</span> <span id="s323">So then when I came back and daddy picked me up at Grand Central Station and brought me flowers and then he said he was taking me out to eat.</span> <span id="s324">Where do I want to go to eat?</span> <span id="s325">I said in the delicatessen.</span> <span id="s326">He was so relieved.</span> <span id="s327">He figured because I worked for such rich people that I have such rich ideas, you know.</span> <span id="s328">So we went there and we had a frankfurter and he was so grateful.</span> <span id="s329">He said to me ‘I though you have all those high ideas and this...’ and so that was it.</span> <span id="s330">Then a week or two later I met that other fella and he came and had something in a box like a thing of beer or whatever it was and he wanted to give it to me and I said ‘you hold it Beno.</span> <span id="s331">I don’t want to take a present from you.’</span> <span id="s332">I liked his mother a lot and I told him what I found and we broke up right then and there.</span> <span id="s333">I said I brought the letter back, I said ‘you put it in the wrong letter and said you wanted to send it to her so send it to her.’</span> <span id="s334">In the meantime it was very bad and you couldn’t write anymore to Germany so that’s how I met daddy and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">SF: What kind of pets did you have when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">FF: Oh, God.</span> <span id="s337">Dogs and cats and sheep and a goat, lamb, you name it I had it.</span> <span id="s338">Oh I had such beautiful dogs.</span> <span id="s339">I did.</span> <span id="s340">I had two dogs like this.</span> <span id="s341">The little one died and I buried him and put a cross on his grave.</span> <span id="s342">My little one Ami and the other one was Leo and the other was Hans (laughter) and they were Saint Bernards.</span> <span id="s343">They were so beautiful.</span> <span id="s344">They shot them.</span> <span id="s345">The Germans shot them when I was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">I was so afraid to look at a horse I wouldn’t go into the stable.</span> <span id="s347">I used to feed the cows.</span> <span id="s348">Those kind of things I loved to do but when the horse... We had two horses, one for my father and one....</span> <span id="s349">See in the Jewish religion you could never put a horse and a cow on a wagon to pull because a horse has more strength than a cow.</span> <span id="s350">Only two horses or two cows.</span> <span id="s351">So when we had in the summer when we had to take home the hay and all those kind of things, we had two horses for this and in the winter we only had one.</span> <span id="s352">That horse was so old but I wouldn’t go near it.</span> <span id="s353">We had some nice cows.</span> <span id="s354">We had little ones.</span> <span id="s355">Sometimes 40 and sometimes 5, it all depends.</span> <span id="s356">When I was a baby we had one for that purpose, for the milk, and when Bianca and her baby we had two.</span> <span id="s357">Always the steady one so the milk didn’t have to be...always the same milk.</span> <span id="s358">We had little ones.</span> <span id="s359">My father bought once 50 little ones.</span> <span id="s360">We had extra stables for a while to see them grow up.</span> <span id="s361">You know bigger than calves.</span> <span id="s362">They were beautiful.</span> <span id="s363">I loved to work with them.</span> <span id="s364">I loved to work with them.</span> <span id="s365">But nothing in the house.</span> <span id="s366">No cooking, no nothing.</span> <span id="s367">Boy’s work.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Our house was a nice house.</span> <span id="s369">It was nice to those times you know.</span> <span id="s370">You had a living room which was a dining room.</span> <span id="s371">In the middle of the living room was a dining room table which you could pull out.</span> <span id="s372">It was underneath.</span> <span id="s373">You pulled it out.</span> <span id="s374">We had everything there.</span> <span id="s375">We had everything there.</span> <span id="s376">We had a credenza, we had a buffet.</span> <span id="s377">But every house had in the middle of the living room a table.</span> <span id="s378">We had a beautiful stove.</span> <span id="s379">A square, long table.</span> <span id="s380">The table was a regular size and when we ate we pulled it out just like this and when we had company you pulled more out.</span> <span id="s381">Could be pulled out and out.</span> <span id="s382">We had beautiful flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Next to the living room was a room which used to be my grandmother’s room.</span> <span id="s384">When she died in 1922, I was 10 years old, I remember that.</span> <span id="s385">Then my father put his desk in and put his books in and a sewing machine in.</span> <span id="s386">We made it just like that.</span> <span id="s387">And then we had a kitchen with two big buffets.</span> <span id="s388">A milchdich and a fleishdich.</span> <span id="s389">And a stove and also a table and all those things.</span> <span id="s390">No icebox.</span> <span id="s391">Next to the kitchen was what they called a ‘schpice’(sp?)</span> <span id="s392">was like a cool room.</span> <span id="s393">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s394">How it was so cold I don’t know because we had no ice.</span> <span id="s395">It came from...it was built up from the cellars, see, and next to it, as big as this, we had what you called it your icebox but there was no ice in there.</span> <span id="s396">A pantry.</span> <span id="s397">It was very cold in there and I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Then we had the bedrooms.</span> <span id="s399">On the same level we had my bedroom and then on the other side we had my sister’s bedroom and upstairs was my parent’s bedroom and another kitchen if you wanted to use the kitchen for two families.</span> <span id="s400">You know my mother.</span> <span id="s401">It was really built for two families.</span> <span id="s402">We used it for storage, for storing things.</span> <span id="s403">Then there was another room where we had the flour.</span> <span id="s404">When you had so many people you made your own bread and you had the big bins in there.</span> <span id="s405">White flour and dark flour.</span> <span id="s406">All the things and corn and that kind of stuff in that so-called kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Then we had a room which was called the ‘gudes tzimmer (good room)”.</span> <span id="s408">We had the piano in there, we had the red velvet sofa in there and red velvet chairs and a big table and the most beautiful buffet you have ever seen in your life.</span> <span id="s409">I don’t know what ever happened to it.</span> <span id="s410">Right now you ask me (what kind of piano) I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s411">(Note: it was a Bechstein.)</span> <span id="s412">It was like this and had two hands up like this.</span> <span id="s413">There were like two handles which were put on there and it was an upright.</span> <span id="s414">It was a beautiful piano but I never liked to play it.</span> <span id="s415">It was on the second floor.</span> <span id="s416">Then we had another room where we had a laundry mangow(?)</span> <span id="s417">A mangow where you...after the wash dried you put it through that mangow.</span> <span id="s418">We were the only one in the whole... not to dry it, you put it through like your sheets your things you didn’t have to iron (e.g. a wringer).</span> <span id="s419">We were the only one to have that, no one else had that.</span> <span id="s420">Then we went upstairs and there were the maids’ rooms.</span> <span id="s421">On the third floor.</span> <span id="s422">Two maids rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Bianca’s parents lived in Munich and Ruth’s parents lived in the same town as we did.</span> <span id="s424">(Note: opposite of actual situation.)</span> <span id="s425">They had their own house.</span> <span id="s426">I remember and I don’t (what their house was like.)</span> <span id="s427">My father bought it from an old woman who had no children and nobody.</span> <span id="s428">She died and when she died Ida’s mother moved in.</span> <span id="s429">Ida’s mother was always renting a place you know.</span> <span id="s430">So she moved in and had the downstairs which was a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen and also (a place) like where you kept your fruit and your stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s431">My sister lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s432">They had beautiful things.</span> <span id="s433">When I think of the furniture she got when she got married my heart breaks still today.</span> <span id="s434">Beautiful furniture, and they a kitchen and a living room.</span> <span id="s435">One room was called a ‘spice tzimmer’ already.</span> <span id="s436">An extra room for dining.</span> <span id="s437">With a buffet and....it was a beautiful, beautiful room.</span> <span id="s438">They had such figurines and everything.</span> <span id="s439">We had it home too.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">We had a pewter, a whole wall of pewter and we had beer steins, pewter beer steins, other beer steins.</span> <span id="s441">Then my father never smoked but he collected some pipes and we had them hanging there and there were ebony pipes with silver things on them and we had beautiful silver.</span> <span id="s442">Oh my parents had such beautiful silver, which only came out when company came.</span> <span id="s443">And dishes and all that stuff which you buy now...the stuff you bought...the bowls and things ....pottery.</span> <span id="s444">We had all that stuff for Passover.</span> <span id="s445">We had tons.</span> <span id="s446">Up in the roof was in boxes and written on there yontiff fleishdich and milchdich.</span> <span id="s447">We had very beautiful furniture in the living room.</span> <span id="s448">Very beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s449">We had upstairs that buffet, it was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s450">(In the buffet was) good dishes all the porcelains, all good figurines.</span> <span id="s451">.</span> <span id="s452">The only thing I got from there were those pink little demi-tasse.</span> <span id="s453">All those birds, all this here.</span> <span id="s454">That’s why it means so much to mean.</span> <span id="s455">The birds came from home.</span> <span id="s456">I had so much I gave it away.</span> <span id="s457">I needed wedding presents for the Hoffheimers so I gave them the crystal bowls and all those kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">SF: What did the farm look like?</span> <span id="s459">How many barns did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">FF: I tell you something, when I left it was a sad looking thing.</span> <span id="s461">It was a very sad looking thing.</span> <span id="s462">We had no more cows.</span> <span id="s463">We had no more... They took the wagons out.</span> <span id="s464">We were the only family....</span> <span id="s465">See for transportation to the nearby cattle market my father had made like a truck which had to be pulled by two horses and he had this made.</span> <span id="s466">Everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s467">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s468">(Before) it looked like a very well kept farm, a very well kept farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">SIDE 2 We had two barns.</span> <span id="s471">Two big barns.</span> <span id="s472">We had hay wagons in there.</span> <span id="s473">We had a cow wagon for transportation.</span> <span id="s474">We had those wheel barrels.</span> <span id="s475">Whatever you needed.</span> <span id="s476">I don’t even know the name for all those kind of things.</span> <span id="s477">One day we had 40 (cattle) and two days later we had 4 or 5.</span> <span id="s478">We had one steady cow.</span> <span id="s479">Oh boy, we had one steady cow.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">SF: Was cattle dealing the family business?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">FF: Ya, my father’s father was a cattle dealer and then he also dealed with leather.</span> <span id="s482">Leather.</span> <span id="s483">Skins.</span> <span id="s484">Hides and leather.</span> <span id="s485">And he did very well with it.</span> <span id="s486">Sometimes my father, when they bothered him, so he says “ok, since he had this friend who had a leather factory so he used to say to him ‘oh, they bother me for so’.</span> <span id="s487">He made good money on that too.</span> <span id="s488">’” In the Jewish community he was the president for many, many years.</span> <span id="s489">For as long as I can remember.</span> <span id="s490">in the gentile community, he was everything but mayor.</span> <span id="s491">He was on the school board, he was the other board, he was for the poor, he was everything, everywhere.</span> <span id="s492">People used to come to us and brought complaints and he brought it up to the mayor and they had meetings and the school board they had meetings.</span> <span id="s493">He was just the only Jewish man in town for all those kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">SF: So he was the main contact between the gentile and Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">FF: He was president of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s496">When I remembered there were maybe 15 families there and then less and less.</span> <span id="s497">The children got married and moved away; the elderly people died and then later on everybody moved away.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">SF: What did the family do on a normal week?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">FF: The man went out to work and the woman was home and cooked and washed.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">SF: Somewhere we got all those doilies.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">FF: They did this in the winter in the evening.</span> <span id="s502">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s503">They were sitting there.</span> <span id="s504">That was the right way of doing for a well brought up family, just I was the only one who rebelled against it.</span> <span id="s505">I blamed my eyes.</span> <span id="s506">I used to sit like this and say ‘my eyes can’t see.’</span></p> <p><span id="s507">SF: What did the family do for entertainment?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">FF: They came to visit each other.</span> <span id="s509">The grandchildren came.</span> <span id="s510">They went to visit in the

mother.</span> <span id="s527">I played but I didn’t like to.</span> <span id="s528">It went too slow for me.</span> <span id="s529">They bought me a violin.</span> <span id="s530">I started learning and then they told me only boys learn the violin so I broke it.</span> <span id="s531">Couldn’t play it.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">SF: There was a bearskin rug on the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">FF: That wasn’t a bearskin.</span> <span id="s534">It wasn’t a bearskin.</span> <span id="s535">That was from one of our dogs.</span> <span id="s536">I hid the key of the piano.</span> <span id="s537">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s538">It was ....</span> <span id="s539">What do you call it when the dog dies and then you skinned it and have it fixed.</span> <span id="s540">There was one person who picked it up and did everything and they brought it back and it was laying like this but the head was up like that.</span> <span id="s541">That wasn’t a dog you can pet.</span> <span id="s542">They were dogs for the fields and the cows and for this.</span> <span id="s543">Then we had that skin and I had the piano up there.</span> <span id="s544">Then when our junior teacher taught me.</span> <span id="s545">When my mother came up once he had his arm around me like this.</span> <span id="s546">I was 15 or 16 and he was 18.</span> <span id="s547">So my mother said from now on, when I get the lessons, she has to be there because she didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s548">I said I wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s549">If you be there, I’m not playing piano anymore.</span> <span id="s550">So one day my mother came up and she sat there and did some whatever...crocheting, and I finished and no more.</span> <span id="s551">I was very young then.</span> <span id="s552">So I took the key and threw it in the dog’s mouth and went down where you couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s553">This room was only cleaned for Passover.</span> <span id="s554">No one was ever in this room.</span> <span id="s555">It was always locked.</span> <span id="s556">So then you went and shook out the rug and the things and the key came out.</span> <span id="s557">Then I told them what I did.</span> <span id="s558">My mother said ‘we’re not going to spend money.</span> <span id="s559">If you don’t want to play you don’t play”, so I never played.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Ruth’s mother played.</span> <span id="s561">They did everything my parents told them to do.</span> <span id="s562">Especially Ruth’s mother.</span> <span id="s563">She never said no.</span> <span id="s564">They used to say “The oldest can never say no.”</span> <span id="s565">The big ones never said that.</span> <span id="s566">They did everything they were told</span></p> <p><span

making ends meet.</span> <span id="s583">The only one who really made ends meet was your daddy.</span> <span id="s584">His father retired with 42.</span> <span id="s585">He had asthma and he had those boys.</span> <span id="s586">You know the boys were supposed to support the parents.</span> <span id="s587">He was a butcher.</span> <span id="s588">But what he did...daddy made money and very hard earned money and he put it all into the house.</span> <span id="s589">He built and built and built and daddy was promised a motorcycle and never got it.</span> <span id="s590">His youngest brother I

here.</span> <span id="s594">He spent the money the way they made it.</span> <span id="s595">He went out with girls like crazy.</span> <span id="s596">I never went out with him because I didn’t like the girls he went out with.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Then he had two more brothers.</span> <span id="s598">One was a baker.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t know what the other one was.</span> <span id="s600">I think Ernst was the baker and Ludwig was the salesman.</span> <span id="s601">Karl, I don’t know what he was.</span> <span id="s602">But the brothers were not that ambitious.</span> <span id="s603">He was the most ambitious one.</span> <span id="s604">That’s what the people told me from Buttenwiesen.</span> <span id="s605">Everyone said he was the best of all.</span> <span id="s606">And then he made the money so his sister could get married.</span> <span id="s607">She got 10,000 marks when she got married.</span> <span id="s608">SF: He made money for her dowry.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">FF: Ya.</span> <span id="s610">There is another relative in New York.</span> <span id="s611">I told you they are elderly people now.</span> <span id="s612">That’s the sister’s sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s613">She came to Buttenwiesen and she wanted to marry daddy.</span> <span id="s614">So they said that if he would marry the sister-in-law he would get the 10,000 marks back but he didn’t like her.</span> <span id="s615">She was a very nice person.</span> <span id="s616">Recha.</span> <span id="s617">You must remember her.</span> <span id="s618">She used to come to the house.</span> <span id="s619">But he didn’t care for her, he always said.</span> <span id="s620">So he had to marry out his sister for 10,000 marks and the studies of his brother cost another 10,000 marks.</span> <span id="s621">When it came to him.</span> <span id="s622">He did everything on bicycle.</span> <span id="s623">To get his motorcycle then something else came up.</span> <span id="s624">His father built and built and built and he never got it.</span> <span id="s625">That’s why when he got the car here he felt he was king.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">He was very active.</span> <span id="s627">He was very sporty.</span> <span id="s628">Football.</span> <span id="s629">All kinds of sports.</span> <span id="s630">He had muscles.</span></p> <p><span

years and then I went to high school.</span> <span id="s653">They went to public school to 15 or 16 and then they went to another school there which was called Volkpilldenschul (sp?)</span> <span id="s654">but I never went there so I don’t know what they learned.</span> <span id="s655">After they graduated public school they went every Saturday and Sunday to this same school but for different

id="s658">FF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s659">My parents sometimes took vacations.</span> <span id="s660">My parents went once to Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s661">They had baths there for arthritis and that stuff and then they wanted to go and there was this Jewish family in town and the man was very bad arthritis ridden and then my father sent him.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">SF: Did they ever go to another country?</span> <span id="s663">FF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">SF: Did they go with the family or by themselves?</span> <span id="s665">FF: They went by themselves but then they went to Munich but they only went separately to Munich because someone had to be home in the house.</span> <span id="s666">You had animals.</span> <span id="s667">You had cows, you had dogs, you had cats, you had maids.</span> <span id="s668">So my father came and my father came (to Munich) and he wanted to stay a week and then he only stood three days and we wanted to know why.</span> <span id="s669">So he said he goes up and down the street and nobody says “good morning, Herr Winter; good afternoon Herr Winter.”</span> <span id="s670">He was very lonesome so he left.</span> <span id="s671">And my mother wouldn’t go without my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SF: Couldn’t the people left behind run the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">FF: Yeah, but not the cattle dealers.</span> <span id="s674">The cattle dealers had to be there.</span> <span id="s675">When a farmer called then they couldn’t do it and they wanted my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">SF: Didn’t you have to have someone who lived further away for when the fields were snowed in?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">FF: No.</span> <span id="s678">Our man lived above the stables because when the snow was in someone had to feed the animals.</span> <span id="s679">He had the room above the stables and fed them.</span> <span id="s680">That happened quite often because sometimes we couldn’t open the shutters for days.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">SF: Tell us about the neighbor whose chickens you got drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">FF: It wasn’t a neighbor, it was an old woman down and around.</span> <span id="s683">She lived in this house.</span> <span id="s684">She didn’t like me because when I passed with the bicycle and she lived on the corner house I rang the bell like crazy on the bicycle and that drove her nuts.</span> <span id="s685">I knew it drove her nuts so I started a long time before and kept ringing the bell.</span> <span id="s686">So whenever something happened... Once her window broke.</span> <span id="s687">She called my father.</span> <span id="s688">Not by telephone because we were the only Jewish people who had a telephone.</span> <span id="s689">Then someone else got it.</span> <span id="s690">She told my father I broke her window and when I came home my father said I have to come in.</span> <span id="s691">He said “What did you do to Frau Pollock?”</span> <span id="s692">I said “I didn’t do anything papa.”</span> <span id="s693">He said “She says you broke her window.”</span> <span id="s694">I said I wasn’t even there.</span> <span id="s695">Ida was her love.</span> <span id="s696">You know.</span> <span id="s697">So I said “I wasn’t even there papa” so my father said he was going to go out and tell her and he told her.</span> <span id="s698">She said I did it anyway.</span> <span id="s699">She said all she wanted to do was be paid so my father said ‘Have it fixed.</span> <span id="s700">I pay you.”</span> <span id="s701">My mother got very mad.</span> <span id="s702">She said ‘You shouldn’t do that.”</span> <span id="s703">He said ‘She is an old woman.</span> <span id="s704">She has no children.</span> <span id="s705">What are you going to do, fight with her?”</span> <span id="s706">So whenever there was something... When it rained, when it snowed, when the sun shined, it was always me.</span> <span id="s707">So once she told the Hebrew teacher that she asked me a brucha, it was thundering and lightening and she said “Do you know the brucha for when it thunders and lights” and I said “I knew it but I forgot.”</span> <span id="s708">So she told him and he gave me a good licking because I didn’t tell her the brucha so I really felt hurt.</span> <span id="s709">Why is she riding around me all the time.</span> <span id="s710">I bring her fruit.</span> <span id="s711">I bring her cake and I’m so good to her and she just doesn’t like me.</span> <span id="s712">So I figured I’m going to do something that hurts her the most.</span> <span id="s713">I’m going to kill her chickens.</span> <span id="s714">I went home and I had this blue apron on, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s715">It had two pockets.</span> <span id="s716">I took some schnaps.</span> <span id="s717">One thing in our house I must say, nothing was ever locked.</span> <span id="s718">Even where we had the money the key was in the thing.</span> <span id="s719">Everything had a key.</span> <span id="s720">I took a bottle of schnaps and I took some Berches and I put them in.</span> <span id="s721">Instead of putting it in a bowl I put it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s722">You know they were all soaked through.</span> <span id="s723">I put my hands in my pockets and I went down there and I went drup, drup, drup and all the drups came and I just threw this schnaps there.</span> <span id="s724">The Berches with the... Whoever taught me this....no one ever taught me this.</span> <span id="s725">I made it up myself.</span> <span id="s726">They all came and they drank like crazy.</span> <span id="s727">I stood there and they all went down and I thought this time she really got it.</span> <span id="s728">I though they were killed already and I didn’t care a bit.</span> <span id="s729">I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">After a while I run again and they were all lying together, all together like a real clique.</span> <span id="s731">I didn’t say anything but my mother, I never forget, said to me “How come you’re home all afternoon.</span> <span id="s732">How come you’re not...” because I was always running around.</span> <span id="s733">I wanted to be home.</span> <span id="s734">My father came home and I kissed him and my father came home and was standing on the door.</span> <span id="s735">We took off his hat and we wiped his head with a handkerchief and one put the shoes on, the slippers on.</span> <span id="s736">All of sudden Frau Pollock comes running.</span> <span id="s737">“Herr Winter, Herr Winter, Herr Winter, you gotta come home.</span> <span id="s738">My chickens are dead.”</span> <span id="s739">So my mother said “What happened” because my father had connections with the veterinarian who treated the animals, you know.</span> <span id="s740">So my father said “I come right away” and my father run out and I run after him.</span> <span id="s741">He went there and he sees the chickens.</span> <span id="s742">It took a long time.</span> <span id="s743">They were really drunk.</span> <span id="s744">Then he came home and he took me by the hand and he says “this is sad, this is sad.”</span> <span id="s745">She had those gray, those real gray and white hens.</span> <span id="s746">He says “That’s everything she had.</span> <span id="s747">That’s really sad.</span> <span id="s748">I wonder what happened.”</span> <span id="s749">He’s going to speak to the veterinarian tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">So at night, after we were finished eating, I never forget, I stood on the door and I said “I know what happened to Frau Pollock’s hens.”</span> <span id="s751">So my father said “What happened?”</span> <span id="s752">“I made them drunk.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t think they’re dead but I think I made them drunk.”</span> <span id="s754">So my father said “You didn’t.”</span> <span id="s755">My mother said “She wouldn’t say it unless she did.”</span> <span id="s756">So they said “What did you do?”</span> <span id="s757">so I stood on the door.</span> <span id="s758">I had the copper door handle in my hand in case they go after me, if my mother goes after me, I’m right out, you know.</span> <span id="s759">So the whole everyone, the maid and everyone, they got hysterical.</span> <span id="s760">So the man, our knecht(?)</span> <span id="s761">says “You’re right.</span> <span id="s762">Because she does nothing but aggravating you and me too.”</span> <span id="s763">He says “She doesn’t like us” I said “I don’t think they’re dead because I saw them like this.”</span> <span id="s764">So my father got up and says “I can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s765">Who told you?</span> <span id="s766">Where did you get the schnaps?</span> <span id="s767">Where did you get the Berches.</span> <span id="s768">How did you cut the Berches?”</span> <span id="s769">You know it was heavy to cut it.</span> <span id="s770">I cut it.</span> <span id="s771">My mother looked and it was really sawed off like this, not the way it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s772">Well they couldn’t get up from the table, they were hysterical.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">So my father went out, he says to me “You have to come along and excuse yourself” and I said “no I’m not.</span> <span id="s774">I’m not.</span> <span id="s775">She hurt me and she lied about me and she told the Hebrew teacher about me and it wasn’t true and I’m not gonna go” and I wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s776">He went out and he says he wants to see what the chickens do and she was there crying with her hands in her apron and my father said “They look alright.”</span> <span id="s777">She says they come to.</span> <span id="s778">I don’t know what happened, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s779">He says “They’ll be alright.</span> <span id="s780">They’ll be alright.”</span> <span id="s781">And then he didn’t tell her.</span> <span id="s782">Later on he told her.</span> <span id="s783">He went out on a Saturday after the temple.</span> <span id="s784">He went there and he told her what happened and he said to her why it happened.</span> <span id="s785">He said “You leave this kid alone.</span> <span id="s786">She doesn’t do any harm to you.</span> <span id="s787">Everybody likes her and you are the only one who really does all this harm to her and she wanted to get back at you.”</span> <span id="s788">He says “you know I don’t help unless its necessary but you leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s789">She left me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">So when she died we were three girls: Ida, myself and Selma who is in England.</span> <span id="s791">We were supposed to sit there in the wake, you know, because we had no funeral home.</span> <span id="s792">I didn’t believe she was dead.</span> <span id="s793">I said to them “I don’t think she’s dead.”</span> <span id="s794">They said “She’s dead.”</span> <span id="s795">So I said “I got to try and I took a ball and I bounced the ball back on her, where she was laying there dead, on that wall and when she didn’t move I said “she’s dead.”</span> <span id="s796">“Now we have to sit quiet” I said, “Now I know she’s dead.”</span> <span id="s797">Because I used to throw the ball against the wall too and it annoyed her to death, you know.</span> <span id="s798">I said “She’s dead.</span> <span id="s799">We got to leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s800">Then we sat real quiet.</span> <span id="s801">Left her alone.</span> <span id="s802">Ida was crying.</span> <span id="s803">She said “you’re going to hit Frau Pollock” and I said “I’m not hitting her but I don’t believe she’s dead.”</span> <span id="s804">It was the first time I saw a dead person and it didn’t affect me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">SF: Did you do any work on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">FF: A lot.</span> <span id="s807">I did everything.</span> <span id="s808">I liked it.</span> <span id="s809">I mowed the grass.</span> <span id="s810">We had a machine where you drove around and this but there were corners where you couldn’t do so you had to have one of those long knives, we called it sense (sp?)</span> <span id="s811">and I did it.</span> <span id="s812">Once I cut my finger all across.</span> <span id="s813">Then we also had a hand one, a sickle, that’s called a sickle here too?</span> <span id="s814">And I had to go in the corners.</span> <span id="s815">I loved that work.</span> <span id="s816">I would have been the best farmer.</span> <span id="s817">I did everything on the farm.</span> <span id="s818">Fed the cows, milked them.</span> <span id="s819">I learned to milk on a goat.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">SF: Did you ever deliver any baby animals?</span></p> <p><span

where we had all this water coming through?</span> <span id="s828">But I tell you, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s829">We had a lot of water sometimes and it came all the way up but it couldn’t go up to our house because it was up on the hill, but a lot of people had water.</span> <span id="s830">Bianca’s parents had water in their cellar many times.</span> <span id="s831">Our house was

believe it but this child is undernourished.</span> <span id="s1644">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1645">The uncle had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1646">He was always gone.</span>

of a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">FF: No.</span> <span id="s1760">I needed an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1761">It said that the person who gives you the affidavit is responsible for you.</span> <span id="s1762">In case you come and you get sick, he has to take care of you.</span> <span id="s1763">You’re not supposed to be a ward to the state or country.</span> <span id="s1764">So then I didn’t hear and didn’t hear so Gretl Weil sister-in-law came also here and she called up Aunt Saler and she said to her “Flora is waiting for an affidavit from your brother, and if he can’t give it then my brother-in-law (Note: meaning Herbert Winter, brother of Gretl Weil) would it to me to bring it back so she says “Well, my brother would give it to her immediately but my sister wrote that Flora has trouble with her knees and she’s going to be trouble for him.”</span> <span id="s1765">This is something I don’t even think you should put on the tape.</span> <span id="s1766">This was my mother’s niece, Aunt Saler’s sister, who lived in a small town, also near Stuttgart and she had a breast operation and they were, at one time, very rich.</span> <span id="s1767">Then he gambled everything away and then they were very poor and she was very sick.</span> <span id="s1768">She wrote to my parents that they should help her and I should please come.</span> <span id="s1769">My mother said “Please go there.</span> <span id="s1770">You do a big mitzvah.”</span> <span id="s1771">That was when I was in-between, you know.</span> <span id="s1772">So I went there and helped her and she was sick that time and came home from the hospital, and I took care of her.</span> <span id="s1773">He was a real woman chaser that was part of why they lost a lot, because he had to pay off girls.</span> <span id="s1774">Then wherever he was he puts his arm around me and first I thought....then all of a sudden he wanted to get fresh so I got very panicky.</span> <span id="s1775">My cousin was upstairs in the bedroom and I was down there and I prepared a meal and all this.</span> <span id="s1776">Then the doctor came, Dr. Mertzbach and visited her every so often.</span> <span id="s1777">I had trouble with my foot because when I was very young I fell in skiing and my knee got water, in the kneecap was full of water.</span> <span id="s1778">I said to him “Dr. Mertzbach, I have trouble with my foot.</span> <span id="s1779">What am I supposed to do?”</span> <span id="s1780">He says “I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1781">Your cousin is well enough to take care of herself and you have to go to the consulate in time to come.</span> <span id="s1782">You better go home and nurse your foot.</span> <span id="s1783">Otherwise you never make it.”</span> <span id="s1784">When I told her that Dr. Mertzbach said I really should go home now.</span> <span id="s1785">You’re well enough.</span> <span id="s1786">You go to café every afternoon grenzien(?)</span> <span id="s1787">and all that so I’m going to go home.”</span> <span id="s1788">Because I paid all her bills she didn’t like that and she wrote to Simon that I’m going to be a risk for him.</span> <span id="s1789">Irene who came here said “Flora has trouble with her knee.</span> <span id="s1790">That’s a new one on me.</span> <span id="s1791">What kind of a thing is this.</span> <span id="s1792">Forget about your brother.</span> <span id="s1793">I bring her one from Herbert.”</span> <span id="s1794">She sent me one from Herbert and they sent me one from Detroit.</span> <span id="s1795">Then I had two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Then I started working at it and the first thing I needed the birth certificate and couldn’t get the birth certificate because he says he’s not going to give Jews birth certificates.</span> <span id="s1797">So I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1798">I got very panicky.</span> <span id="s1799">Bianca’s mother corresponded with Aunt Gretl.</span> <span id="s1800">So she says “Aunt Gretl would love to have you.</span> <span id="s1801">Then you be right there.</span> <span id="s1802">If you’re away from here and write for your birth certificate, he has to mail it.</span> <span id="s1803">He has to send it, yet.”</span> <span id="s1804">I mean later on they probably could do what they want.</span> <span id="s1805">So I went to Stuttgart and I wanted to take a lawyer first.</span> <span id="s1806">Then I went to one of those organizations, whatever they were and they said “we write for you and, if not, you have to take a lawyer” because he has to hand it out.</span> <span id="s1807">That’s how I got my birth certificate in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1808">They had me in their hands and I stood with them because I needed them.</span> <span id="s1809">That’s how I got the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1810">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s1811">Then I went to the consulate and they let me go through like nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">SF: There’s some story about somebody not wanting to give you the papers?</span> <span id="s1813">A girl that you grew up with.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1817">When Irene came back she wrote to me or called me up, I forgot now what it was, and she says “Your papers must come any day.”</span> <span id="s1818">I went there and I wanted to get the papers and I saw something laying there with stamps on it, like American stamps.</span> <span id="s1819">So I said to her “There is my mail.</span> <span id="s1820">Give it to me.”</span> <span id="s1821">She says “We don’t hand the mail to Jews.</span> <span id="s1822">There was this post office.</span> <span id="s1823">It had the door like this, half the size.</span> <span id="s1824">Here they gave you the mail and here on the bottom, that’s where they opened up to hand you the packages.</span> <span id="s1825">She said “I’m not giving it to you.”</span> <span id="s1826">So I pushed my foot in like this and I went underneath and I threw her in the corner and I said “You give it to me.</span> <span id="s1827">Otherwise you and me, none of us is going to come out alive here.”</span> <span id="s1828">Then she handed it to me.</span> <span id="s1829">Then I threw her in the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">SF: Then you went home and got packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Then I went home and then I had to go for the birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1832">No I didn’t get packed because I had to find out first how long it takes with the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1833">You don’t get it right away.</span> <span id="s1834">That takes a long time.</span> <span id="s1835">They had to inquire.</span> <span id="s1836">That took months and months.</span> <span id="s1837">It took a year.</span> <span id="s1838">A year and a half.</span> <span id="s1839">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1840">Then the Weils left and I was then I wasn’t even sure then that I get it.</span> <span id="s1841">Then I wouldn’t know where to go in Stuttgart because the Lowenthals, Saler and Weils left at the same time.</span> <span id="s1842">Then three or four days before this wonderful man came from the (Bureau of Records) and he says to me “I saw you were so nervous and I figured it takes a while.</span> <span id="s1843">I’m going to give it to you.”</span> <span id="s1844">He brought me my passport.</span> <span id="s1845">He was such a fine man.</span> <span id="s1846">He says “I hate to see what’s going on but what can I do?”</span> <span id="s1847">He was a wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">SF: So then you went home and packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">FF: Then I went home and I wanted to pack.</span> <span id="s1850">They wouldn’t take my packages on the mail.</span> <span id="s1851">The post office wouldn’t take my mail.</span> <span id="s1852">Wouldn’t take my package.</span> <span id="s1853">We didn’t have trunks made.</span> <span id="s1854">We had the steamers.</span> <span id="s1855">The regular steamers.</span> <span id="s1856">I had to ship it to Munich because it has to be inspected

wagon.</span> <span id="s1859">We were the only ones who had a wagon, where we loaded the cows in to bring it to the markets.</span> <span id="s1860">So we loaded the trunks and we brought it to where Herta comes from, to that city, to that town (Note: Wassertrüdigen), because we didn’t have any railroad where we came from and the post office wouldn’t mail it.</span> <span id="s1861">So we brought it there to the railroad and then they shipped it to Münich, to Ruth’s parents and from there on I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">In Munich Ruth’s father got me the trunks.</span> <span id="s1863">They had to be made to certain specifications and he did it.</span> <span id="s1864">I had in there two or three winter coats, a winter suit, my leather coat with fur on the bottom and fur

My mother came to Munich.</span> <span id="s1866">She wanted to see me packing.</span> <span id="s1867">This man who packed was so good.</span> <span id="s1868">He say’s...We had to pack it down where my sister lived, in the washroom.</span> <span id="s1869">You had to give them a certain place.</span> <span id="s1870">So he says “I’m going out for lunch now.</span> <span id="s1871">I be back in an hour.</span> <span id="s1872">I have to go to lunch.</span> <span id="s1873">I be back in an hour.”</span> <span id="s1874">He left everything open.</span> <span id="s1875">There was no seals.</span> <span id="s1876">People used to tell me that they had iron straps around, metals straps around.</span> <span id="s1877">You could put in whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1878">My mother came to Munich and I said at that time “Momma, what are you carrying?”</span> <span id="s1879">She says “A few things.”</span> <span id="s1880">My mother went down and put....I couldn’t go near it.</span> <span id="s1881">I couldn’t go near the packing.</span> <span id="s1882">I couldn’t care what they put in.</span> <span id="s1883">Ruth’s mother went down.</span> <span id="s1884">She says to me “You don’t even know what you have.</span> <span id="s1885">Go down.”</span> <span id="s1886">I said “I couldn’t see.”</span> <span id="s1887">I couldn’t see anything from home being taken and given to me.</span> <span id="s1888">Like my mother wanted to give me the candelabra and they lit it every Friday night.</span> <span id="s1889">I said “Momma, I can’t take it.</span> <span id="s1890">How can I enjoy it when I know...” And I wasn’t married then so how do I know I ever need it.</span> <span id="s1891">I said “Momma, I can’t take it.</span> <span id="s1892">I just can’t take it” and I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1893">This silver ladle I took because I said “This will always remind me of what it was.”</span> <span id="s1894">My mother said “You have to have it fixed.”</span> <span id="s1895">I said “No.</span> <span id="s1896">Its going to remind me.</span> <span id="s1897">I never have it fixed.”</span> <span id="s1898">Someday when you get it you can have it fixed if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">SF: What’s wrong with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">FF: Its banged up from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">SF: This is the one they threw through the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">FF: Yah, and I went down to get it.</span> <span id="s1903">I nearly broke my neck going down.</span> <span id="s1904">It was so steep you know.</span> <span id="s1905">I have something else here.</span> <span id="s1906">I never even knew I had it.</span> <span id="s1907">When I got married I emptied the thing....Well, no, I never got my trunk.</span> <span id="s1908">That was a big, brown trunk with the initials on FW and when I went from...I wanted to go from Karlsrühe into France because Bianca’s brother learned to be a baker.</span> <span id="s1909">You had to learn a trade, you know.</span> <span id="s1910">He was there to say goodbye to me and I wanted to see him once more.</span> <span id="s1911">He was my everything really.</span> <span id="s1912">He was like a brother to me.</span> <span id="s1913">I looked out of the train and I didn’t see my... they disconnected certain wagons and I looked and looked and I saw a lot of trunks on that one wagon and it didn’t go into France.</span> <span id="s1914">(In it)were my winter coats and my clothes in there.</span> <span id="s1915">My coats, my skirts, my shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">SF: And stuff your mother put in too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">FF: No.</span> <span id="s1918">No.</span> <span id="s1919">That was the trunk, all clothes.</span> <span id="s1920">I really don’t know anymore what was in it.</span> <span id="s1921">I had a big trunk.</span> <span id="s1922">That I didn’t even see.</span> <span id="s1923">That I did not see.</span> <span id="s1924">That was direct going to the boat or something.</span> <span id="s1925">I really don’t know what was...

id="s1941">I figured I take a taxi because I knew which hotel I go to.</span> <span id="s1942">That was all arranged.</span> <span id="s1943">I said “How do you come on Shabbos?”</span> <span id="s1944">He says “We gave in to a few things” he says.</span> <span id="s1945">“That’s one of them.”</span> <span id="s1946">We were happy to see each other and all that.</span> <span id="s1947">Then he invited me to go to Friday night to his uncle who was a veterinarian in Paris.</span> <span id="s1948">Dr. Leubrecht.</span> <span id="s1949">(SF: How did you meet him?)</span> <span id="s1950">In München.</span> <span id="s1951">He was a friend of Martin Bamberg.</span> <span id="s1952">He liked me then already and I liked him already.</span> <span id="s1953">But he always said “Look, we have to leave.</span> <span id="s1954">There is no sense getting serious here because who knows where luck goes” and I felt its true.</span> <span id="s1955">Then after we were there and we ate, and they were very religious, very fine people, he says to him “Did you tell Fraülein Winter what’s what?”</span> <span id="s1956">He says “No, no.</span> <span id="s1957">Later.”</span> <span id="s1958">So I felt very uncomfortable so I said....this is the first time I traveled on Shabbos too, because I couldn’t help it, so I said “How far is the hotel.</span> <span id="s1959">I feel very uncomfortable traveling on Shabbos.”</span> <span id="s1960">He says “When you’re in a strange country you do things you never thought you would do.”</span> <span id="s1961">So we walked and I said to him “What did your uncle want you to tell me?”</span> <span id="s1962">He says “Oh, I got a big surprise for you.</span> <span id="s1963">A big surprise.”</span> <span id="s1964">I was looking.</span> <span id="s1965">I thought he was going to give me a ring or something.</span> <span id="s1966">I said “What’s the surprise?”</span> <span id="s1967">He said “You not going to leave here.</span> <span id="s1968">You gonna stay here.”</span> <span id="s1969">I said “What for?”</span> <span id="s1970">He said “Because we got you Auffelhatsgennamt (sp?)</span> <span id="s1971">We got you a paper that you can remain here.”</span> <span id="s1972">He said it was “...very, very hard and we pulled a lot of strings to get that.”</span> <span id="s1973">I said “You’re out of luck.</span> <span id="s1974">I can’t stay here.”</span> <span id="s1975">He says “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1976">I said “I promised my father.”</span> <span id="s1977">He said “Promises are broken.”</span> <span id="s1978">I said “Not to my father.</span> <span id="s1979">I would never break a promise (to him).”</span> <span id="s1980">He says “You cannot do it to my uncle.”</span> <span id="s1981">I said “I do it to you and I do it to your uncle.</span> <span id="s1982">I promised my father.</span> <span id="s1983">I cannot go back on my promise.”</span> <span id="s1984">I said my father said it broke his heart for me to leave but I have to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s1985">He said “That’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1986">Nothing is going to happen here.”</span> <span id="s1987">I said “My father doesn’t say ridiculous things.</span> <span id="s1988">What my father says it is always true.”</span> <span id="s1989">He says “Please don’t do that.”</span> <span id="s1990">So we had to go to his uncle the next day on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s1991">First we went outside to a big, big department store.</span> <span id="s1992">We couldn’t go in because we couldn’t carry money.</span> <span id="s1993">I carried every paper I had with me.</span> <span id="s1994">Then his uncle said “Did you hear, did you hear?”</span> <span id="s1995">I said.</span> <span id="s1996">“Dr. Leubrecht.</span> <span id="s1997">I don’t know how to tell you but I might as well tell you right away.</span> <span id="s1998">I am not staying in Paris.”</span> <span id="s1999">He got pale.</span> <span id="s2000">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s2001">He got so pale He says “I cannot believe it.”</span> <span id="s2002">I said “I promised my father that I leave Europe.”</span> <span id="s2003">So he says to me “If you promised.</span> <span id="s2004">Das ist ein gebot (sp?)”</span> <span id="s2005">he says.</span> <span id="s2006">“And you have to fulfill it.</span> <span id="s2007">I understand.”</span> <span id="s2008">He understood but Leubrecht didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2009">He never wanted to understand it.</span> <span id="s2010">I said to him “You come to America.”</span> <span id="s2011">I said “I try if you want to come to America.”</span> <span id="s2012">But he started to finish studying.</span> <span id="s2013">He wanted to get done with it.</span> <span id="s2014">So that’s how I got to America.</span> <span id="s2015">Leubrecht was killed too.</span> <span id="s2016">The whole family was killed I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">SF: You had money hidden in skis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">FF: In Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2019">In skiing all the time.</span> <span id="s2020">You put it in the skis.</span> <span id="s2021">There was this shoemaker in München.</span> <span id="s2022">His name was Mr. Lehrs.</span> <span id="s2023">He did that for people.</span> <span id="s2024">He opened the skis.</span> <span id="s2025">As a shoemaker he knew how to do that.</span> <span id="s2026">Like you put soles together.</span> <span id="s2027">We went to Switzerland and the skis.</span> <span id="s2028">You could never take the skis into the train.</span> <span id="s2029">You know, there was extra provision outside to put it in.</span> <span id="s2030">That’s how we went.</span> <span id="s2031">Then we got there and there was a man, another Jewish man, Mr. Tzimitz (sp?)</span> <span id="s2032">, who opened them.</span> <span id="s2033">You couldn’t get smuggle money out from Germany.</span> <span id="s2034">You were never allowed to legally... That was the only place you could put money.</span> <span id="s2035">I didn’t know anybody in... You had to bring your own money in by yourself.</span> <span id="s2036">(SF: you smuggled money into the banks in Switzerland?)</span> <span id="s2037">FF: Yah, you got to Mr. Tzimitz and you had to pay Mr. Tzimitz something for opening your thing and he got a cut in there too.</span> <span id="s2038">(SF: so you smuggled money in for later?)</span> <span id="s2039">FF: You wrote to Switzerland that they should transfer it to America.</span> <span id="s2040">That’s what happened and that’s where I lost it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">SF: You lost it all?</span></p> <p><span

yah.</span> <span id="s2052">Every week somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2053">Most of the time in our house because it was the warmest house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">SF: Did anybody give you

had relatives here.</span> <span id="s2074">Through a relative here, his name was Frankenthaler, who was some kind of bigshot at the produce exchange.</span> <span id="s2075">Once he got here he

was ‘38.</span> <span id="s2141">Then they confiscated everything.</span> <span id="s2142">They threw you out.</span> <span id="s2143">I understood they took my parents and the Jewish people there to a prison.</span> <span id="s2144">They had to walk.</span> <span id="s2145">How they ever came from that prison to my sister in Munich I never found out because it was a big distance and I don’t think

<span id="s2152">We had company.</span> <span id="s2153">The Meyers.</span> <span id="s2154">My thoughts were “Oh my God, I hope daddy doesn’t have to go and I hope I can hear from my parents.</span> <span id="s2155">I hope they don’t break us up that I don’t hear from them anymore.”</span> <span id="s2156">Then we wrote to them and we told them when you were born.</span> <span id="s2157">Then I got a telegram.</span> <span id="s2158">A Red Cross letter.</span> <span id="s2159">Did I ever tell you that?</span> <span id="s2160">I wrote them from the hospital when you were born, and also to my in-laws.</span> <span id="s2161">My father always said to me “If we can’t write to you direct, we write with the Red Cross.”</span> <span id="s2162">See, he was so smart that he knew all this but he still didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s2163">He said “strenge hen redieren nicht mar (sp?)”</span> <span id="s2164">–strong men will not last long.</span> <span id="s2165">Everybody said

fainted and I hit my head against the steps and I lost milk.</span> <span id="s2174">You kept screaming and screaming and they wrote a letter in which they congratulated us for your birth and they said they were so happy that we got a boy, because I always wanted a boy.</span> <span id="s2175">So that was the letter and I never had any milk and I went to the doctor, Dr. Wesley, and I said I can’t understand this child is crying day and night and he tried and he says “You’re all dried out.</span> <span id="s2176">What happened?”</span> <span id="s2177">I told him and he said “When you’re scared that can happen.”</span> <span id="s2178">Then I had to put you on milk.</span> <span id="s2179">You know, and all kinds of formulas, whatever that was.</span> <span id="s2180">That’s why you

<span id="s2186">In fact there were some of the boys that I went to school with, to public school, and they came at night.</span> <span id="s2187">We had around our house those big gardens and they came in the bushes, crawling, and they came up and they said “Don’t you leave Flora.</span> <span id="s2188">We don’t want you to go.</span> <span id="s2189">No one’s going to do anything to you.</span> <span id="s2190">We don’t want you to go.”</span> <span id="s2191">There were a few boys who said that.</span> <span id="s2192">FF: I said no.</span> <span id="s2193">What changed you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">SF: I thought you said people who you used to help were spitting at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">FF: Yeah, the neighbors when I went down from my house to pass by.</span> <span id="s2196">I had to pass by.</span> <span id="s2197">She said “Heinele (fond term for Heinrich), what do you do when Flor passes by?”</span> <span id="s2198">and he spit.</span> <span id="s2199">That’s the only thing I wrote back to that mayor when he says I should come and visit or something.</span> <span id="s2200">I wrote back to him, that’s the first time I wrote back to Wittelshofen, I said “What happened to those people?”</span> <span id="s2201">And I wrote to which people I meant and he say’s they all died.</span> <span id="s2202">Too bad.</span> <span id="s2203">He says he remembers my parents very well.</span> <span id="s2204">I even know who he was.</span> <span id="s2205">He was a little boy.</span> <span id="s2206">Maybe now in the 50s.</span> <span id="s2207">He was a little kid then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">SF: You had several workers on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">FF: Yah.</span> <span id="s2210">We had those neighbors.</span> <span id="s2211">We supported them and we gave them half of our gardens too.</span> <span id="s2212">See our gardens went around five houses and that house was one of them and they didn’t have much garden on their own.</span> <span id="s2213">So my father always said “Take care of it and whatever comes off the tree you take.”</span> <span id="s2214">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s2215">They took it and then they turned against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">FF: (The workers) helped with the hay.</span> <span id="s2217">You had to get the grass off the ground and you had to work it and all that.</span> <span id="s2218">Whatever you have to do on a farm they did.</span> <span id="s2219">Our man lived above the barn because he had to feed the animals when you had the high snow.</span> <span id="s2220">You couldn’t leave the house.</span> <span id="s2221">The barns were just down the road but you couldn’t get out of the house.</span> <span id="s2222">You couldn’t open the shutters.</span> <span id="s2223">Sometimes two or three days.</span> <span id="s2224">Always had enough stuff in the house because you couldn’t...you always had everything in the house anyway.</span> <span id="s2225">That was a good time.</span> <span id="s2226">That’s when you were home and the house was so nice and warm and all that.</span> <span id="s2227">It was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s2228">Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">SF: Two stories.</span> <span id="s2230">One when you came home once and nobody wanted to light the fire because it was Shabbos and the other when you came home and there was a beggar there and you wouldn’t eat with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">FF: That was when I went to high school.</span> <span id="s2232">He was in the bus with me.</span> <span id="s2233">We had no train.</span> <span id="s2234">As I told you there was no train depot where I came from.</span> <span id="s2235">The train went to where Aunt Herta came from, der Wassertrüdigen, and from there we had to take a bus.</span> <span id="s2236">The bus went there twice a day, morning and afternoon.</span> <span id="s2237">The trains met the bus.</span> <span id="s2238">Otherwise sometimes you had to wait a half hour.</span> <span id="s2239">So I went in the bus and there was this man with a black coat and a beard, and when we got closer to the town he says to me “where is the banas(?)</span> <span id="s2240">,” that means the president of the Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s2241">So I said “Oh, that’s my father,” I said.</span> <span id="s2242">So he says “Well how do I get to him?”</span> <span id="s2243">I said “Oh, they’re going to be at the bus to pick me up so you can talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2244">I went out before him because I didn’t respect this type of people.</span> <span id="s2245">My father was already mad when he saw me going out before an old man.</span> <span id="s2246">So I said “Papa, there is the Pollack who wants to talk to you” so my father said to him “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s2247">He must have told him he is poor or whatever.</span> <span id="s2248">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2249">My father said to him “You come home with me and we take care of you.”</span> <span id="s2250">So I put my papa on the side and hugged and kissed him and I said “Papa, if this Pollack eats at our table, I’m not going to sit with him.</span> <span id="s2251">I’m not going to sit at the same table as that Pollack sits.”</span> <span id="s2252">My father just put me down and walked away, back to this man, and excused himself and went to this man.</span> <span id="s2253">Before we up to our house he called my mother and he talked to my mother something.</span> <span id="s2254">When I came home up there, oh God the maids were there with big hellos and the table was set so nice and always flowers on the table and a present, always a present when I came home.</span> <span id="s2255">My mother used to hang the present on the window so that when I came up the hill I saw already that a present was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2256">You know that Tyrolean jackets or whatever.</span> <span id="s2257">So I went in there and I wanted to take the present down and my mother said “Leave it here till later.</span> <span id="s2258">Leave it here.”</span> <span id="s2259">I thought “That must be a big thing that I have to leave it there.</span> <span id="s2260">I can’t rip it apart right away.”</span> <span id="s2261">Then my mother went out into the kitchen where the soup was steaming and everything, whatever there was.</span> <span id="s2262">I don’t know anymore.</span> <span id="s2263">I helped carrying it in.</span> <span id="s2264">The soup by us was always served in a soup tureen.</span> <span id="s2265">We never ladled it out.</span> <span id="s2266">It was done in the kitchen and then you brought it in.</span> <span id="s2267">Then my mother said “You take this plate.</span> <span id="s2268">Take it out in the kitchen” so I took it out to the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">I was sure I said that I wouldn’t eat with that man on the table there so he is eating out there.</span> <span id="s2270">I wanted to sit down and my mother said “No, you brought your place out there, that’s where you eat.”</span> <span id="s2271">“Not me in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s2272">“Yes, you in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2273">You wouldn’t eat with this poor man, so you have to eat where he isn’t.</span> <span id="s2274">That’s the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s2275">There were the cats and there were the dogs and there was I, because our help always ate on the table.</span> <span id="s2276">I cried and I cried and I cried so loud that my father just couldn’t help hearing it.</span> <span id="s2277">Then he came out.</span> <span id="s2278">He says “What is it?”</span> <span id="s2279">“I have to eat here because this Pollack eats in there.”</span> <span id="s2280">My father said “This is not a Pollack.</span> <span id="s2281">This is a poor man, a poor religious man, and I want to tell you something right now.</span> <span id="s2282">If this is why we sent you away, to come back as such a snot nose, then you aren’t going to go back.</span> <span id="s2283">You stay home because you have to learn bringing up at home.</span> <span id="s2284">They don’t do it, we will do it.”</span> <span id="s2285">My father never spoke like this to me.</span> <span id="s2286">He went in again and there I ate.</span> <span id="s2287">I wouldn’t even go in to get more food.</span> <span id="s2288">I wouldn’t go in and get my meat.</span> <span id="s2289">Our help they were sitting there and they felt terrible.</span> <span id="s2290">That’s where I had a terrible day.</span> <span id="s2291">I had a few terrible days, and my mother said to me “If you learned a lesson, you can come back.”</span> <span id="s2292">The next day I couldn’t eat there either.</span> <span id="s2293">The man was gone but my mother said “You learned a lesson, if you learned a lesson.”</span> <span id="s2294">But I came to Munich and every time a Pollack came like this, I felt the same way.</span> <span id="s2295">Mr. Schindler was a real Pollack.</span> <span id="s2296">He said to me “I am gonna bring you a Pollack.</span> <span id="s2297">You’re gonna marry a Pollack.”</span> <span id="s2298">I said “Mr. Schindler, don’t punish me, don’t say that.</span> <span id="s2299">.”</span> <span id="s2300">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2301">I never learned it at home.</span> <span id="s2302">I never learned it at home.</span> <span id="s2303">Just a terrible, terrible thing.</span> <span id="s2304">I felt very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">SF: What about the fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">FF: The fire?</span> <span id="s2307">I came home and in between coming here and staying home, still waiting for my papers and all that, and it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s2308">God it was so cold.</span> <span id="s2309">See I left in April or March and I was home for two months.</span> <span id="s2310">It was winter.</span> <span id="s2311">Winter.</span> <span id="s2312">So we sat there and we sat there, my momma wrapped up in things.</span> <span id="s2313">I said “Momma, that’s no good.</span> <span id="s2314">If you get sick, you have no doctor.</span> <span id="s2315">You can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2316">So my mother said “I can’t lay in bed all the time.”</span> <span id="s2317">We had no more help, we had no more maids, nobody you know.</span> <span id="s2318">I said “I’m going to do something.</span> <span id="s2319">I know it’s a sin but I’m gonna do it.</span> <span id="s2320">Before you and papa get sick I’m gonna go out and make a fire.”</span> <span id="s2321">My mother went like this but she said to herself “I wish she would do it.”</span> <span id="s2322">I went out and I put in a fire and the wood was cracking and I went in and said “You’re gonna feel all right soon.</span> <span id="s2323">I don’t feel good in doing it.</span> <span id="s2324">I did it the first time in my life but you’re not going to get sick because there is no one, no doctor who would take you, no hospital who would take you.”</span> <span id="s2325">I said “You need to help yourself.”</span> <span id="s2326">(SF: Because they were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s2327">FF: Yah.</span> <span id="s2328">So my mother didn’t answer me.</span> <span id="s2329">My papa comes down and says “What is it, what is it?”</span> <span id="s2330">My mother says “The Goye are here.”</span> <span id="s2331">My father went right back up in his room.</span> <span id="s2332">I said “Papa, I know you say that I am half a goy for doing it.</span> <span id="s2333">What’s going to be if you are sick?</span> <span id="s2334">If the lieber Gott (dear God) sees this, why do you do this kind of thing?</span> <span id="s2335">Why do you sit here?</span> <span id="s2336">It’s the first time in my life I did it, but somebody has to help you people.”</span> <span id="s2337">He said “I don’t know who brought you up, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2338">The big ones would have never done it.”</span> <span id="s2339">He always said that.</span> <span id="s2340">I said “Well I did it and I do it.</span> <span id="s2341">I’m glad I did it.”</span> <span id="s2342">Then they came.</span> <span id="s2343">Then the Oberdorfers came and the Gallingers came.</span> <span id="s2344">They all came to see what the goye did.</span> <span id="s2345">And every Saturday they came marching in.</span> <span id="s2346">They knew I’m gonna do it anyhow.</span> <span id="s2347">But I put food in the stove to heat up.</span> <span id="s2348">My parents wouldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s2349">That they wouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s2350">(SF: Because you had cooked it on Shabbat?)</span> <span id="s2351">FF: Yah.</span> <span id="s2352">I heated it up.</span> <span id="s2353">SF: When did they normally eat on Shabbos?</span> <span id="s2354">FF: After Shabbos was out.</span> <span id="s2355">We usually ate the main meal lunchtime but on Shabbos we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2356">We ate the main meal after Shabbos.</span> <span id="s2357">That’s what I did.</span> <span id="s2358">I ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">SF: The maids left at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">FF: They had to leave.</span> <span id="s2361">Long before.</span> <span id="s2362">(SF: Nobody would let them work there.)</span> <span id="s2363">No.</span> <span id="s2364">They made it terrible for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">SF: When did it get really bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">FF: It got bad already before I left.</span> <span id="s2367">When I left it was already bad.</span> <span id="s2368">But they left us alone.</span> <span id="s2369">Somehow they were afraid of me or they liked me.</span> <span id="s2370">They liked me.</span> <span id="s2371">The town really liked me.</span> <span id="s2372">Whenever I came home they brought me flowers and everything.</span> <span id="s2373">They always said when I come sunshine comes.</span> <span id="s2374">“Oh, Flora is home.</span> <span id="s2375">The sun is shining.”</span> <span id="s2376">They always said that.</span> <span id="s2377">In fact, once made a joke.</span> <span id="s2378">It was so snowy, they said “Send Flora out, the snow is gonna melt.”</span> <span id="s2379">I was always very happy.</span> <span id="s2380">I had no reason not to be.</span> <span id="s2381">The only trouble what I had was with my hair.</span> <span id="s2382">They didn’t like red hair.</span> <span id="s2383">I got over that very fast, because it was such a beautiful hair.</span> <span id="s2384">It was so, so full of luckin(?)</span> <span id="s2385">they used to say.</span> <span id="s2386">When I had it open, when I played...I had braids and when you opened the braids it was just like gold flowing.</span> <span id="s2387">It was very red.</span> <span id="s2388">At times it was redder.</span> <span id="s2389">They told me in the summer that if you go in the sun, the sun is bleaching it so I walked around in the sun like crazy.</span> <span id="s2390">I wanted bleached hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">SF: Tell me about where your mother looked up and said “there won’t be anything but trouble from there.”</span> <span id="s2392">Was it Berchesgarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">FF: No.</span> <span id="s2394">That was our mountain (Note: the Hesselberg).</span> <span id="s2395">Not Berchesgarten.</span> <span id="s2396">Is near Munich.</span> <span id="s2397">From our bedroom, the view from my parents bedroom was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s2398">All the mountains were there.</span> <span id="s2399">It was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s2400">Some people came... we had this doctor and he used to come and he used to say “Please let me paint from this window.”</span> <span id="s2401">And they did.</span> <span id="s2402">I used to say “Oh, momma, it looks so beautiful” but you get so used to it.</span> <span id="s2403">She says “This is going to bring nothing but tzoris (trouble)” and it did bring tzoris.</span> <span id="s2404">They put a youth castle up there and that’s where they came every few weeks, der Streicher and the Goering and the thing.</span> <span id="s2405">They came with the white coats and with the big glasses, those dark glasses.</span> <span id="s2406">We used to wear them for skiing.</span> <span id="s2407">You know, the blinders.</span> <span id="s2408">They came and when they came the bells were ringing.</span> <span id="s2409">The heart cruze (Swastika?)</span> <span id="s2410">went up, the flags went up.</span> <span id="s2411">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s2412">My mother used to say “Didn’t I tell you it’s a curse.”</span> <span id="s2413">It was a curse.</span></p> <p><span

So he said to my mother....yah he stood in our house.</span> <span id="s2964">He was such a wonderful speaker that when he came and spoke in the temple the minister came, the teachers came, everybody came to listen to him.</span> <span id="s2965">He had a voice, he was just a great man.</span> <span id="s2966">That’s what they thought.</span> <span id="s2967">Whenever he came I run out.</span> <span id="s2968">He used to stand like this and I run under the thing and run out so he said to my mother “What’s wrong?</span> <span id="s2969">Whenever I come, that little one runs out.</span> <span id="s2970">Doesn’t she like me.”</span> <span id="s2971">My mother said “I never asked her really” so my mother said to me before he came “If you stay home, why do you run out?”</span> <span id="s2972">I said “I don’t like him.</span> <span id="s2973">I don’t want him to touch me.”</span> <span id="s2974">My mother said to me “If you stay home, I buy you anything you want.</span> <span id="s2975">I buy you a new bicycle, I buy you...” “I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s2976">I don’t want to stay in the house.”</span> <span id="s2977">I run to my sister like crazy.</span> <span id="s2978">She knew.</span> <span id="s2979">She says “Oh, Dr. Brader came?”</span> <span id="s2980">That was it.</span> <span id="s2981">When he came and he made a speech and he came to eat, I’m sure I sat like this so when he gets up he wouldn’t touch me.</span> <span id="s2982">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2983">I was six years old.</span> <span id="s2984">So then my parents looked at him and everybody.</span> <span id="s2985">They just thought he was the greatest.</span> <span id="s2986">One day my father came home from the cattle market.</span> <span id="s2987">Usually I run down and I greeted him and he opened his little satchel and he gave me chocolate and he always bought me chocolate with coconut.</span> <span id="s2988">I liked that the best and he gave it to me and I hugged him and I said “Papa, don’t you feel good?”</span> <span id="s2989">He says “Yah.”</span> <span id="s2990">I said “Don’t you like me?”</span> <span id="s2991">“Oh yah, I like you.</span> <span id="s2992">I have to speak to momma.”</span> <span id="s2993">So he came up and he took my mother and he talked to her and they all got red in the face and they went in the room.</span> <span id="s2994">I stood there and I listened on the door and I heard them talk about Dr. Brader, Dr. Brader.</span> <span id="s2995">Then when my mother came out I was gone already, and I said “What’s wrong with Dr. Brader?”</span> <span id="s2996">My mother said “You wouldn’t understand.”</span> <span id="s2997">Well, Dr. Brader was caught with a soldier and they found out that both were gay.</span> <span id="s2998">The soldier was arrested and he (Dr. Brader) fled.</span> <span id="s2999">They thought he fled to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s3000">I grew up....it was just a terrible shame.</span> <span id="s3001">It was over all the papers and he was such a prominent man and everybody looked up to him.</span> <span id="s3002">The little city of Gunzenhausen, of Ansbach where he was, they were heartbroken.</span> <span id="s3003">They couldn’t believe to them.</span> <span id="s3004">In years later it was forgotten.</span> <span id="s3005">We got a new rabbi and it was forgotten.</span> <span id="s3006">I was with people in Switzerland, we went skiing, and we were very religious and we only ate in...they had very few Jewish restaurants but they had vegetarian places.</span> <span id="s3007">We got in those vegetarian places.</span> <span id="s3008">We sat down, I never forget it was a big round table like this, and I look up and I said “My God, there is Dr. Brader.”</span> <span id="s3009">He turned like this and run out.</span> <span id="s3010">I wanted to run after him.</span> <span id="s3011">I don’t know what I wanted to run (laughing) and they held me back and this friend said to me, he says “How dumb can you be?</span> <span id="s3012">He heard your name, he heard his name and he run and you want to run after him.</span> <span id="s3013">What do you want?”</span> <span id="s3014">I sat there.</span> <span id="s3015">I just couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s3016">It was the same man.</span> <span id="s3017">The same tall, heavy man.</span> <span id="s3018">He looked the same.</span> <span id="s3019">And I wanted to run after him.</span> <span id="s3020">That was our rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">He was replaced by a rabbi, Dr. Munk.</span> <span id="s3022">That’s Tanya’s uncle (Note: Tanya SF believes is the wife of Jack Kantal, son of Hella and Sol Kantal.)</span> <span id="s3023">(SF: Who officiated at

ago here.</span> <span id="s3066">The elderly people here they said they never heard of such big things.</span> <span id="s3067">When you speak to elderly Jewish people they say “We didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s3068">We went to temple and came home and that was it.”</span> <span id="s3069">Like Richie, Ruth’s (Note: FF’s niece) first husband, he had his bar mitzvah on Thursday.</span>

id="s3539">Right.</span> <span id="s3540">This is the way it was at home too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3541">SF: What were your favorite subjects in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">FF: Math.</span> <span id="s3543">Reading.</span> <span id="s3544">No, I didn’t like history.</span> <span id="s3545">I hated history.</span> <span id="s3546">Geography.</span> <span id="s3547">I loved

enjoyed math.</span> <span id="s3551">He loved math.</span> <span id="s3552">And reading.</span> <span id="s3553">He used to say he wasn’t good in writing, in writing letters, but his handwriting was 100 times better than mine ever, and when he sat down and wrote a letter he came right down to the point, he didn’t flower it up but he knew how to write a letter.</span> <span id="s3554">Just like Uncle Leo.</span> <span id="s3555">He always said he wasn’t good in writing.</span> <span id="s3556">He wrote very well too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">SF: You went away at what age to go to school?</span> <span id="s3558">FF: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">SF: Why did the send you away to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">FF: Because that was the only way, you go away.</span> <span id="s3561">Because that was the break of the public school.</span> <span id="s3562">12.</span> <span id="s3563">SF: Did most people continue their education.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">FF:

I don’t know how to explain it to you.</span> <span id="s3568">The teacher always said that, to tell you the truth I to say, I was too smart for the school there and they should put me in a better school.</span> <span id="s3569">He didn’t know what to do with me a times to ask questions, you know.</span> <span id="s3570">Then my mother said she didn’t know what to do and then my relatives came from Nürnberg, they came during the war.</span> <span id="s3571">They had no food so we gave them all the food, we had the chickens and we had the meat and we gave them....</span> <span id="s3572">Then they wanted to make good and they said “Why don’t you send her to us and we send her to school from hereon where she can learn better than at home.”</span> <span id="s3573">So that’s where I went.</span> <span id="s3574">Then I went to public school till 16, right?</span> <span id="s3575">How long do you go to public school?</span> <span id="s3576">14?</span> <span id="s3577">16?</span> <span id="s3578">Then I went right away from there to high school which we didn’t have home.</span> <span id="s3579">We had good teaching but not that excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">SF: So you went to high school in Nürnberg?</span> <span id="s3581">FF: Yah.</span> <span id="s3582">See we didn’t just have one class together.</span> <span id="s3583">We had classes together third and fourth and fifth grade.</span> <span id="s3584">We had it in the morning.</span> <span id="s3585">They had it in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s3586">It was just one schoolhouse.</span> <span id="s3587">In Wittelshofen.</span> <span id="s3588">Nürnberg, that was much different.</span> <span id="s3589">It was such an old building.</span> <span id="s3590">Oh, was it old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">SF: Was it unusual to send the girl away to school?</span> <span id="s3592">FF: Yah, very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">SF: You said Ida went away

don’t want to tape that....</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">SF: Did you have any very good friends in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">FF: Yeah, I had very good friends in school.</span> <span id="s3600">In Nürnberg they were very Nazis then already.</span> <span id="s3601">They used to sing some Jewish things against the Jews then already.</span> <span id="s3602">At home yeah.</span> <span id="s3603">They were good.</span> <span id="s3604">I was very good with them.</span> <span id="s3605">(SF: Who were your best friends?)</span> <span id="s3606">Selma in England who died and Ida naturally and there were a lot of...we were just like one family, there were a lot of girls I was very friendly with.</span> <span id="s3607">We didn’t even know any different.</span> <span id="s3608">I mean I didn’t go to their house and they didn’t come to my house but we were very family.</span> <span id="s3609">There was this girl, her name was Marga, who was at the post office who we supported.</span> <span id="s3610">Her mother had TB and she came home with me every day to eat.</span> <span id="s3611">When I expected my papers she says to me “We don’t give papers to Jews and I’m not giving it to you.”</span> <span id="s3612">She wouldn’t give me my paper and I went in and I threw her against the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">SF: Were your friends mostly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">FF: No, there was just Ida and Selma and me and Josef, he went away to become a teacher and that was all of us young people.</span> <span id="s3615">SF: Who was Josef?</span> <span id="s3616">FF: Gallinger, the one who took me down like this and I thought I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s3617">I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">SF: Did you ever have

<span id="s3625">What I read.</span> <span id="s3626">I read everything.</span> <span id="s3627">Whatever came across I read.</span> <span id="s3628">I don’t know any special books but I read any romance and anything.</span> <span id="s3629">Whatever a kid reads.</span> <span id="s3630">We had a very good school library.</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">SF: And you had good teachers too?</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">FF: One.</span> <span id="s3633">He killed himself later on because he went after girls.</span> <span id="s3634">He went after me too.</span> <span id="s3635">He kept me in school and then he sat down with me.</span> <span id="s3636">Because I didn’t empty that spit thing he kept me in school.</span> <span id="s3637">Then he sat on the bench with me and we went all over me and I went home and told my father and then another girl the same thing.</span> <span id="s3638">Then they called him and told him and he didn’t and just wanted to be good to us and then, years later, I was already in ...oh ya I was in München and he did the same thing and then they threw him out and he went to another town and did the same thing and then he killed himself.</span> <span id="s3639">But he was a very good teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">SF: How about in Nürnberg, what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s3641">FF: Everything.</span> <span id="s3642">But nothing specific.</span> <span id="s3643">(SF: What about the professor who did this?</span> <span id="s3644">–pointing to the pencil drawing/Mizrach).</span> <span id="s3645">Oh, he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3646">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3647">In Hebrew.</span> <span id="s3648">Zeigler.</span> <span id="s3649">He was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s3650">I tell you something Steven, you ask me something 50 years ago and if you want me to remember those things I have to make up a story.</span> <span id="s3651">I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s3652">If you asked me what he looked like I really don’t know anymore.</span> <span id="s3653">I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">SF: What did your parents do during the inflation?</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">FF: I was 14 years, 13, 14 years old.</span> <span id="s3656">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3657">My father built a new stable.</span> <span id="s3658">He built a beautiful stable.</span> <span id="s3659">A modern stable where you fed the cows...you know you used to have to go in between the cows to put the food in and then it went around.</span> <span id="s3660">Just the heads faced you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">SF: Then you bought a piano too?</span> <span id="s3662">FF: Yah, we bought a piano.</span> <span id="s3663">I must have said that.</span> <span id="s3664">I forgot in the meantime.</span> <span id="s3665">As I tell you Steven...</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">SF: Tell the story about the lady whose chickens you got drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3667">FF: Oh, well.</span> <span id="s3668">The lady I got the chickens drunk.</span> <span id="s3669">The lady didn’t like me and she lived downstairs in a house and every time I passed by with my bicycle I rang the bell like crazy because I didn’t want to run anybody over, you know, so she didn’t like me for that because sometimes she must have slept.</span> <span id="s3670">I woke her up with ringing the bell.</span> <span id="s3671">Everybody knew I was coming because I rung like a lunatic.</span> <span id="s3672">So whenever something was wrong in her place she blamed it on me even if I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s3673">She’s says “Flora did it.</span> <span id="s3674">Flora did it.”</span> <span id="s3675">Once I came to Hebrew school and he said to me “What did you do to Frau Pollock?</span> <span id="s3676">“ I said “nothing.”</span> <span id="s3677">He said “Yes you did” and he hit me.</span> <span id="s3678">I said “What for?”</span> <span id="s3679">He said the Frau Pollock said you did something.</span> <span id="s3680">I didn’t say good morning or...she asked me...oh no, I never forget Frau Pollock, it was thundering and she says to me “Do you know the brocha over the thunder or the lightening?”</span> <span id="s3681">I says “Yeah, but I forgot” and I should have remembered it.</span> <span id="s3682">Frau Pollock said to the teacher “You don’t teach your children right.</span> <span id="s3683">She didn’t even know the brocha over thing” so he hit me.</span> <span id="s3684">Everything what was wrong she blamed it on me.</span> <span id="s3685">So one day I felt very hurt because she said I did something and as bad as a devil as I was, I never lied.</span> <span id="s3686">I told the truth even if I know I get punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">So she made this up.</span> <span id="s3688">I don’t know what she told my father I did something I didn’t do so I said to myself “This time I’m going to hit you where it hurts you most.”</span> <span id="s3689">I just about had it.</span> <span id="s3690">She was this size but she was a devil.</span> <span id="s3691">So I had this apron on.</span> <span id="s3692">And she loved her chickens.</span> <span id="s3693">She always stood there and cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck and they stood in the middle and the clucks were all around her.</span> <span id="s3694">I put this challah, this Berches, in whiskey and as a child, as dumb as you are, and I put the whiskey things in my pocket and my pocket got all sticky and full of crumbs and I went to the chickens and I just through it.</span> <span id="s3695">I go cluck, cluck, cluck and all the cluck, cluck, clucks came and all the cluck, cluck, clucks they ate the thing and I stood there on the corner.</span> <span id="s3696">I know the spot.</span> <span id="s3697">I looked and they ate like crazy and I threw more.</span> <span id="s3698">I went home and I was the happiest person.</span> <span id="s3699">I said to myself “This time I got you.</span> <span id="s3700">This time I got you.”</span> <span id="s3701">It didn’t take an hour.</span> <span id="s3702">She comes running in and she had such small feet.</span> <span id="s3703">“Herr Winter, Herr Winter.”</span> <span id="s3704">My father was for everybody.</span> <span id="s3705">My mother used to call him the blitzachleiter.</span> <span id="s3706">He was like whenever the lightening hit they knew where my father was.</span> <span id="s3707">We had a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s3708">We had him under thing (retainer).</span> <span id="s3709">You never know what happens to the cows.</span> <span id="s3710">So she said “You got to call the veterinarian.</span> <span id="s3711">You got to call.</span> <span id="s3712">Oh my chickens are dying.</span> <span id="s3713">My chickens are sick.</span> <span id="s3714">My chickens are dying.</span> <span id="s3715">My children.</span> <span id="s3716">My children.”</span> <span id="s3717">My father said “What happened?”</span> <span id="s3718">She says “I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s3719">They were all right in the morning and I let them out and I come out and they are all laying there dead.”</span> <span id="s3720">So my father said she should go home and he is going to call the veterinarian and he is going to come out and he is going to tell her what to do.</span> <span id="s3721">He says “We get you chickens.</span> <span id="s3722">Don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s3723">“No” she says “We had those gray pearl chickens.”</span> <span id="s3724">They were all gray.</span> <span id="s3725">They looked like pearls, you know.</span> <span id="s3726">My father said “We help you getting it.</span> <span id="s3727">Don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s3728">So she run home and she had a kerchief around.</span> <span id="s3729">My father said “What could happen?</span> <span id="s3730">What could happen?”</span> <span id="s3731">I stood on the door and I said to my father “Papa, her chickens aren’t sick.”</span> <span id="s3732">He said “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s3733">I said “They’re not sick.</span> <span id="s3734">The chickens are drunk!”</span> <span id="s3735">So my mother said “Her chickens are drunk?</span> <span id="s3736">What are you saying? ”</span> <span id="s3737">I said “You’re going to hit me.”</span> <span id="s3738">(Background has Scott laughing.)</span> <span id="s3739">I always said that.</span> <span id="s3740">My father said “Tell the truth.</span> <span id="s3741">I don’t hit you.”</span> <span id="s3742">My father never hit me anyway.</span> <span id="s3743">My mother did the hitting.</span> <span id="s3744">I said “I tell you why.</span> <span id="s3745">Because she is always saying things about me and she’s always lying about me and even the lehrer, the teacher, hit me because she lied about me.</span> <span id="s3746">I’m sick and tired and I wanted to hurt her.</span> <span id="s3747">So I made her chickens drunk” My father started laughing (continued laughing in background by Scott) and my mother said “Solomon that’s nothing to laugh.</span> <span id="s3748">This is the undergang.</span> <span id="s3749">She said this is the trouble with that kid.</span> <span id="s3750">Whatever she does you laugh to it.”</span> <span id="s3751">He said “What did you do?”</span> <span id="s3752">and I told him what I did.</span> <span id="s3753">My mother said “Where did you get the whiskey?”</span> <span id="s3754">I said “Home, from here.”</span> <span id="s3755">“How did you do it.”</span> <span id="s3756">“In my pocket.</span> <span id="s3757">My pocket was all fat and greasy from the liquor.”</span> <span id="s3758">I said “You gonna hit me.”</span> <span id="s3759">My father said “No, I don’t hit you but what am I going to tell her?</span> <span id="s3760">Because if I tell her this, you really be mud (Note: Scott is continuing to laugh.</span> <span id="s3761">and FF is feeding on his laughter.)”</span> <span id="s3762">My father went out.</span> <span id="s3763">To tell you the truth I don’t know what he told her but when he came out the chickens came back to life.</span> <span id="s3764">I don’t think he ever told her what happened but he came home and he took me on his lap and he says “Would you promise me one thing?</span> <span id="s3765">Would you promise me not to do those things.</span> <span id="s3766">This time you got away good.</span> <span id="s3767">The next time it’s not going to work that easy.</span> <span id="s3768">Don’t do those bad things.”</span> <span id="s3769">I said “She condemned me all the time.</span> <span id="s3770">She blames me for everything.”</span> <span id="s3771">Ida could do anything she wanted.</span> <span id="s3772">She never was wrong and I was always wrong and I got tired of it.</span> <span id="s3773">My father told her, he said to her “Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s3774">This constant bothering and the constant hurting the kid and the constant telling her the things, I don’t want you to do it.</span> <span id="s3775">If she does something wrong then we punish her, but you don’t leave her alone...” I tell you what happened then.</span> <span id="s3776">She died a few years later.</span> <span id="s3777">We were supposed to sit there and watch over night.</span> <span id="s3778">See when the people died in small towns, you didn’t have a funeral parlor or anything.</span> <span id="s3779">You put straw on the floor and that’s where the person stood overnight.</span> <span id="s3780">The next day they got buried.</span> <span id="s3781">Ida, Selma and me were supposed to watch a few hours at night, you know, you changed off.</span> <span id="s3782">So I said to them “I don’t believe she’s dead” so Ida said “Yes she’s dead.”</span> <span id="s3783">I said “Let me do something.”</span> <span id="s3784">I took the ball and I always played ball and I was very good like a ...?</span> <span id="s3785">...I said “I’m going to throw the ball against the wall and if she doesn’t say anything then I will know she is dead.”</span> <span id="s3786">I took the ball, I threw it against the wall, she didn’t say anything, I said “She’s dead.</span> <span id="s3787">We have to sit.</span> <span id="s3788">We have to watch.</span> <span id="s3789">She’s dead.”</span> <span id="s3790">Then I believed.</span> <span id="s3791">We really had good times though.</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">SF: Anything else you can remember like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3793">FF: No.</span> <span id="s3794">Then came the hard times.</span></p> <p><span id="s3795">FLORA

them.</span> <span id="s3803">I told them what wonderful jobs I had.</span> <span id="s3804">I didn’t tell them what work I did.</span> <span id="s3805">They sent me people to visit me when they came over here.</span> <span id="s3806">Gretl Weil used to send me all the people who sold things.</span> <span id="s3807">Some of those German people who came here, they were a lot of doctors and lawyers and they had to start school again and they had no money so they sold canned stuff and stockings and everybody who she knew she sent to me.</span> <span id="s3808">I bought all that stuff because I couldn’t say ‘no’ and then I gave it all to her.</span> <span id="s3809">What was I going to do with canned stuff?</span> <span id="s3810">I worked for people.</span> <span id="s3811">I worked for some people they didn’t give me enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3812">SF: So then you had to spend your own money to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s3813">FF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3814">I left.</span> <span id="s3815">They had very terrible underwear.</span> <span id="s3816">I couldn’t stand that.</span> <span id="s3817">I had to wash it.</span> <span id="s3818">They had such torn, dirty underwear and I got sick over it.</span> <span id="s3819">I couldn’t... I had to sleep in the....</span> <span id="s3820">They had one child, they were teachers, and I had to wait till they were in bed and then I could sleep in the hall.</span> <span id="s3821">The hall had no light, and no window.</span> <span id="s3822">No nothing.</span> <span id="s3823">They just put a cot up.</span> <span id="s3824">They had like a paper closet.</span> <span id="s3825">You know, one of those brown paper things.</span> <span id="s3826">That’s where then hung my clothes in and I had nothing for my underwear and this I dropped in the bottom of the closet.</span> <span id="s3827">I said I can’t.</span> <span id="s3828">Then I had to do the wash and then one day she brought a lot of wash and I had to drip this all in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3829">I said to myself “This is funny.</span> <span id="s3830">They don’t wear this kind of underwear.</span> <span id="s3831">Flannel long nightshirts and this.”</span> <span id="s3832">She brought her parents to me too to wash.</span> <span id="s3833">So I said to her “No.</span> <span id="s3834">I can’t.</span> <span id="s3835">You’re too tricky for me.”</span> <span id="s3836">I said “What do you think I am, a slave?”</span> <span id="s3837">She says “You ought to be glad you have something to eat.”</span> <span id="s3838">I said “I’m not that hungry that I have to make a slave for you.”</span> <span id="s3839">I slammed the door and walked out.</span> <span id="s3840">Oh they were so tricky, you have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">Then I got another job as a cook.</span> <span id="s3842">Then they never paid us in time.</span> <span id="s3843">They had no money.</span> <span id="s3844">They lived above their means.</span> <span id="s3845">They lived on the East Side (Note: Of New York City).</span> <span id="s3846">Then they claimed that a lot of stuff was stolen.</span> <span id="s3847">Plates and linen and things.</span> <span id="s3848">They wanted to get some money somehow.</span> <span id="s3849">Then they came, the detectives came and they questioned us.</span> <span id="s3850">There was a chamber maid and me and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3851">I said “Why do you ask us such questions?</span> <span id="s3852">I never took a handkerchief or a piece of paper which didn’t belong to me.”</span> <span id="s3853">They said “Well, it was stolen.”</span> <span id="s3854">I said “ I don’t steal anything.</span> <span id="s3855">I don’t need that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s3856">I have more stuff than I need.”</span> <span id="s3857">So then I left too because I was hurt.</span> <span id="s3858">Then I went to Proskauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">No.</span> <span id="s3860">Then I took a job with an old couple.</span> <span id="s3861">It was opposite the Museum of, what was the museum, the one you look into the skies and the stars?</span> <span id="s3862">The Planetarium.</span> <span id="s3863">There was my room, was a small room that went off the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3864">I couldn’t lock it at night so I put the chair on to keep the door closed.</span> <span id="s3865">All of a sudden I woke up and I said to myself “I see this door moving” and that old fuzzy duddy comes marching in and wants to touch me all over.</span> <span id="s3866">I hit him on the hand and got up 3 o’clock in the morning and packed my suitcase.</span> <span id="s3867">When she got up I said “I’m leaving.”</span> <span id="s3868">She says “Why are you leaving.</span> <span id="s3869">I’m so satisfied and all this.”</span> <span id="s3870">I said “I don’t want to hurt you.</span> <span id="s3871">I can’t tell you the truth.”</span> <span id="s3872">I said “Just let me leave.”</span> <span id="s3873">I dragged my suitcases on 81st Street to the subway and went up to the Weils.</span> <span id="s3874">Brought my stuff and she said “What happened?”</span> <span id="s3875">I said “That old guy came and he wanted to fool around.”</span> <span id="s3876">Oh, God, I tell you.</span> <span id="s3877">You think he couldn’t hold a cup himself.</span> <span id="s3878">Starts fooling around we me.</span> <span id="s3879">So I left there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Then I went to Proskauer.</span> <span id="s3881">I saw it advertised in the paper that they needed a kitchen maid for Lake Placid.</span> <span id="s3882">So I went there.</span> <span id="s3883">Gretl says to me “How do you expect to do this?”</span> <span id="s3884">I said “I don’t know, I just got to do something.</span> <span id="s3885">I got to make more money.”</span> <span id="s3886">In the meantime was Ruth and Bianca (Note: FF’s nieces, the daughters of her two sisters, who escaped to England on the kindertransport) in England and I signed up that I send every month $20.</span> <span id="s3887">With those teachers you didn’t make more than $40, how could you send $20.</span> <span id="s3888">(SF: What do you mean those teachers?</span> <span id="s3889">Oh, the ones you worked for?</span> <span id="s3890">FF: Yah, $40 a month.)</span> <span id="s3891">I went around that building a few times and then I went into the service entrance.</span> <span id="s3892">That bothered me though.</span> <span id="s3893">Then I went up and they called Mrs. Proskauer.</span> <span id="s3894">She says “Can I help you?”</span> <span id="s3895">I said “Yes, I saw your advertisement in the paper and I’d like the job.”</span> <span id="s3896">So she looked at me and said “You want to be a kitchen maid?</span> <span id="s3897">Do you realize what that consists of?”</span> <span id="s3898">I said “No.”</span> <span id="s3899">She says “You have to wash, you have to do all the dishes.”</span> <span id="s3900">There were no dishwashers.</span> <span id="s3901">“You have to wash all the towels and you have to do the chauffeur’s and the gardener’s bungalow and then we have an extra bungalow where my daughter and her family live for the summer.</span> <span id="s3902">They come from Boston and you have to do the dining room and the bedroom there too.</span> <span id="s3903">You don’t have to do anything for the children.”</span> <span id="s3904">So I said “I’m willing to do it.”</span> <span id="s3905">She said “You’re very thin and you’re very young.</span> <span id="s3906">Do you think you can do it?”</span> <span id="s3907">I said “I can do it.</span> <span id="s3908">I have no other choice.”</span> <span id="s3909">She says “Well, we try you out here.</span> <span id="s3910">We have to come for a month here to the house.</span> <span id="s3911">57th Street.</span> <span id="s3912">You have to see how to wait on the table.</span> <span id="s3913">You have to help the chambermaid, you have to...” So I did everything good.</span> <span id="s3914">I washed the dishes and I washed...she soaked it with Clorox and my fingers they were all red and hurting but I did it.</span> <span id="s3915">I think I got $75 a month.</span> <span id="s3916">You got tips and everything and I didn’t take the tips.</span> <span id="s3917">I left them laying there till they said “You better take the tips.</span> <span id="s3918">In (this) country they tip you so I run and got the tips.</span> <span id="s3919">(SF: Who tipped you?)</span> <span id="s3920">They had a lot of visitors.</span> <span id="s3921">So I made about $1000 in the summer.</span> <span id="s3922">So that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">SF: You stopped working for them after the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">FF: No.</span> <span id="s3925">I got...then they had a chambermaid who was a terrible Nazi.</span> <span id="s3926">An Irish woman.</span> <span id="s3927">She was such a Nazi.</span> <span id="s3928">Oh, she was terrible.</span> <span id="s3929">I fought with her.</span> <span id="s3930">She used to say “What do you have to work for those rich Jews.</span> <span id="s3931">You’re Jewish yourself.”</span> <span id="s3932">I said “What is your husband?</span> <span id="s3933">The chauffeur for Vanderbilt, and they are good Catholics and so are you.”</span> <span id="s3934">I said “Answer me.</span> <span id="s3935">You answer me and I answer you.”</span> <span id="s3936">She hated the Proskauers.</span> <span id="s3937">She just was terrible.</span> <span id="s3938">She hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s3939">She didn’t hate me she said, because I didn’t have anything either, but the rich ones she hated.</span> <span id="s3940">Mrs. Proskauer heard that.</span> <span id="s3941">There was a small bathroom near the kitchen where we always fought.</span> <span id="s3942">She called me in once and she said to me “This can’t keep on anymore.</span> <span id="s3943">She hurts you so.”</span> <span id="s3944">I said “Yah, I answer her back.”</span> <span id="s3945">So she said there is no necessity that you have to run away from and get the same thing here.”</span> <span id="s3946">She said “She’s going to go.”</span> <span id="s3947">She went in and she says “Mary.</span> <span id="s3948">Here is your ticket.</span> <span id="s3949">Leave tomorrow.</span> <span id="s3950">I’ve had enough of you.”</span> <span id="s3951">She wanted to say goodbye to me so I said “You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s3952">You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s3953">You want to say goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s3954">The hell, I don’t care where you go.</span> <span id="s3955">For my part you go to hell but don’t you put your hand out for me.”</span> <span id="s3956">So I became the chambermaid.</span> <span id="s3957">(SF: Which was easier?)</span> <span id="s3958">Oh yeah, was much easier.</span> <span id="s3959">Then you got a lot of tips.</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">SF: You were essentially responsible for making up all the beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">FF: Yah.</span> <span id="s3962">Then I ate all that Ex-lax.</span> <span id="s3963">Didn’t I ever tell you.</span> <span id="s3964">I wanted chocolate.</span> <span id="s3965">I needed chocolate so bad.</span> <span id="s3966">They didn’t have any chocolate.</span> <span id="s3967">In every night table there was Ex-lax.</span> <span id="s3968">It looked like chocolate.</span> <span id="s3969">Tasted like chocolate.</span> <span id="s3970">So everywhere I broke a piece off.</span> <span id="s3971">In every night table.</span> <span id="s3972">I had about six rooms and Jeanne had about six rooms.</span> <span id="s3973">I said to her “Jeanne could you get me a little chocolate.</span> <span id="s3974">She said “There’s no chocolate.”</span> <span id="s3975">I said “Ex-lax.”</span> <span id="s3976">She said “That’s not chocolate.”</span> <span id="s3977">I said “Well I like it.</span> <span id="s3978">I need some chocolate.”</span> <span id="s3979">I said that I’m a chocoholic.</span> <span id="s3980">So she got me chocolate and I got me chocolate and I just couldn’t leave the bathroom.</span> <span id="s3981">I was supposed to serve on the table at night and I got such cramps and I just couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s3982">Oh, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">I went there three times to Lake Placid.</span> <span id="s3984">Every time I went there I cried.</span> <span id="s3985">I was so homesick.</span> <span id="s3986">The chauffeur went after me.</span> <span id="s3987">He threw me once over...not the chauffeur.</span> <span id="s3988">No, he was nice.</span> <span id="s3989">They had a Canadian gardener and he threw me once over his bed.</span> <span id="s3990">He wanted to fall over me and I went back like this and he had glasses.</span> <span id="s3991">He couldn’t see without glasses and the glasses went in the corner.</span> <span id="s3992">He said “Get me my glasses!”</span> <span id="s3993">I said “For my part you can lay there day and night.</span> <span id="s3994">I wouldn’t get you your glasses.”</span> <span id="s3995">Then I went to Mrs. Proskauer and told her what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3996">SF: How do you spell Proskauer?</span> <span id="s3997">FF: P-r-o-s-k-a-u-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">SF: When you were up at Lake Placid there was an accident when you hit your head on the rock?</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">FF: You mean on the swimming.</span> <span id="s4000">Oh God, I nearly drowned.</span> <span id="s4001">That’s why I can’t swim anymore.</span> <span id="s4002">I have pictures of it.</span> <span id="s4003">I took the daughter’s bathing suit because I didn’t have a nice one.</span> <span id="s4004">I had a European one.</span> <span id="s4005">I couldn’t afford to buy one here.</span> <span id="s4006">I said “Ooh Francis had such a beautiful bathing suit” so the chauffeur was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s4007">He had two married daughters.</span> <span id="s4008">He says to me “Toots, go ahead.</span> <span id="s4009">Put the bathing suit on.</span> <span id="s4010">I take pictures.”</span> <span id="s4011">So I went to put the bathing suit on and he says “Go up on that rock.</span> <span id="s4012">It’s nicer when up there.”</span> <span id="s4013">I went up on that rock and those rocks were kind of loose, for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s4014">You know, the water hit against them all the time.</span> <span id="s4015">I held like this and the rock loosened and the rock and me went into the water.</span> <span id="s4016">They thought that I was joking.</span> <span id="s4017">They told me I came up the third time and my eyes were all like this.</span> <span id="s4018">Then the chauffeur who was dressed in his uniform, he went in with a big stick and got me out and threw me on the floor and I threw up water for hours and I was all night.</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">Then Jeanne slept with me because I threw up all night and I was like delirious.</span> <span id="s4020">I was just worried about the bathing suit.</span> <span id="s4021">If I would drowned and have Francis’s bathing suit on then they think I stole the bathing suit.</span> <span id="s4022">So I wouldn’t go across.</span> <span id="s4023">See we were on an island Camp Highwall was on an island.</span> <span id="s4024">Whenever we had a day off I wouldn’t go because I wouldn’t go on the boat.</span> <span id="s4025">I couldn’t smell water.</span> <span id="s4026">I had to do above where the water was, where the boathouse was, there was this man’s room on top.</span> <span id="s4027">You know, where the men came together and they had this, what you had (Note: Pool table) and all this and that was my place to clean, to keep in order.</span> <span id="s4028">Not vacuum or anything, just to keep in order.</span> <span id="s4029">It was above the water.</span> <span id="s4030">It was a beautiful room with leather chairs and this.</span> <span id="s4031">I couldn’t go so I made out with Jeanne who was a chambermaid.</span> <span id="s4032">I said “Jeanne do me a favor.”</span> <span id="s4033">No, Jeanne was the waitress.</span> <span id="s4034">I was the chambermaid.</span> <span id="s4035">I said “I do anything for you, but go down and do the boatroom.</span> <span id="s4036">I can can’t go.</span> <span id="s4037">I can’t smell it.”</span> <span id="s4038">She says “I understand.</span> <span id="s4039">I do it” and she did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4040">SF: Did you ever hear from her afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s4041">FF: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s4042">She came very often with her husband and her children.</span> <span id="s4043">She had a half a dozen children.</span> <span id="s4044">On the end it got too much for me and then she gambled(?)</span> <span id="s4045">.</span> <span id="s4046">He name was Jeanne Gristman.</span> <span id="s4047">She lived in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s4048">So, oh God, I tell you that was terrible.</span> <span id="s4049">Oh was it terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s4050">SF: Then what did you do after the Proskauers?</span></p> <p><span id="s4051">FF: I got married.</span> <span id="s4052">Daddy called me every day.</span> <span id="s4053">When he said four o’clock, then he called me four o’clock.</span> <span id="s4054">Mrs. Proskauer knew something happened so she called me in once and she said “Flora I hope you’re not going to leave us.</span> <span id="s4055">I hope you’re not going to leave us.”</span> <span id="s4056">I said “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s4057">She said “I understand you get calls every day and it looks like serious.”</span> <span id="s4058">I said “Mrs. Proskauer, you have two daughters.</span> <span id="s4059">Don’t you want them to be married?</span> <span id="s4060">I’m sure my mother would want me the same thing to do.”</span> <span id="s4061">So she says “Well if you leave, we wish you the best.</span> <span id="s4062">We hate to see you go.”</span> <span id="s4063">Then when I told her she says “Don’t go to your relatives.</span> <span id="s4064">Take the room upstairs.</span> <span id="s4065">Stay in the room.”</span> <span id="s4066">They had a triple apartment.</span> <span id="s4067">She says “Stay here until you get married.</span> <span id="s4068">You go to your relatives, you never have peace for a minute.</span> <span id="s4069">Stay here.</span> <span id="s4070">The room is yours.”</span> <span id="s4071">But I promised the Weils to go so I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s4072">SF: What did you do at the Weils?</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">FF: They went to Florida.</span> <span id="s4074">A week before I got married.</span> <span id="s4075">Two weeks before I got married.</span> <span id="s4076">They thought that...then tante was there, Gretl’s mother was there you know.</span> <span

and I go on and the painter stands there.</span> <span id="s4081">I said “What do you think you’re doing?”</span> <span id="s4082">He says “I’m ordered to start painting today.”</span> <span id="s4083">I said “You’re not painting here.</span> <span id="s4084">I said I am here with my aunt and that’s a handful.”</span> <span id="s4085">Oh, the Mrs. Weil extra gave me a tip.”</span> <span id="s4086">I said “I don’t care what she gave you, you’re not going to paint while I’m here.”</span> <span id="s4087">They thought they go to Florida and I do their house painting.</span> <span id="s4088">When they come back they come in a clean house.</span> <span id="s4089">(SF: They were wrong.)</span> <span id="s4090">FF: You bet they were wrong.</span> <span id="s4091">You have no idea

they had to take her to a home.</span></p> <p><span id="s4098">SF: I thought she invited you to the island.</span> <span id="s4099">FF: No.</span> <span id="s4100">She didn’t.</span> <span

generous.</span> <span id="s4641">I gave him a tie.</span> <span id="s4642">I still remember, I brought the tie...my mother wrapped it.</span> <span id="s4643">I said “You don’t have to wrap it up.”</span> <span id="s4644">She says “Yes, you do.”</span> <span id="s4645">So she wrapped it up and I went down and I said “That’s your bar mitzvah present.”</span> <span id="s4646">It was a silk tie.</span> <span id="s4647">It was one thing.</span> <span id="s4648">It didn’t even have much shape.</span> <span id="s4649">But there wasn’t much made for bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s4650">You

working and so decent.</span> <span id="s4674">I invited them and her mother.</span> <span id="s4675">Then Hildie worked in Lord and Taylor and I went there very often and then he came in and then we went to eat out.</span> <span id="s4676">He was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s4677">Then Hilda died.</span> <span id="s4678">She went up the steps to go to work and she couldn’t catch her breath.</span> <span id="s4679">When she got to Lord and Taylor she looked so bad they took her to the doctor who said “Take her to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s4680">She never came home.</span> <span id="s4681">Then he home alone.</span> <span id="s4682">He was robbed twice.</span> <span id="s4683">He went to his son, to Pittsburgh, who is married to a Chinese or Japanese girl, very fine girl, they have a lot, I think four or five children.</span> <span id="s4684">That killed...suffered terrible through that.</span> <span id="s4685">Then two years ago I sent him always a package to the nursing home in Pittsburgh and I didn’t hear from him.</span> <span id="s4686">He didn’t say ‘thank you’ and I didn’t hear from him.</span> <span id="s4687">Then somebody who lives in Paula’s (Note: Seligman) house in Flushing, in that complex, told me that he died.</span> <span id="s4688">But the son didn’t let me know.</span> <span id="s4689">When Hilda died he let me know.</span> <span
