<p><span id="s115">Q: Ah, I see.</span> <span id="s116">So you never got to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: They were dead when I came along.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s119">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I mean, most of my cousins would -- when I was little, I was sitting on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s121">Some of them were married

a well-to-do family or a struggling family?</span> <span id="s129">How would you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, they were -- they were well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Do

--</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: My father -- His father started the business in Boppard.</span> <span id="s136">And then when he died, my father took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What

No.</span> <span id="s142">It was a small town, and there weren't too many Jews.</span> <span id="s143">Well, you knew everybody.</span> <span id="s144">I mean -- and, no, we had one congregation, and it wasn't kosher.</span> <span id="s145">I mean, there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Were your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: My father was on the board of -- of the shul.</span> <span id="s148">But, I mean, we weren't -- we kept the High Holidays, but we weren't too religious, you know.</span> <span id="s149">I mean, like on Purim and some of these holidays, he'd work and what-have-you.</span> <span id="s150">We didn't have a kosher home.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did -- Was there a -- You said there weren't too many Jews in Boppard?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was it -- Could you give me a sense of the numbers?</span> <span id="s154">Would it have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s156">You know, I left when I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s157">All I know is we had -- we had a Hebrew school, and all the kids were in one room, the big kids in the back and the little kids like me in the front row.</span> <span id="s158">They were -- There were four rows, so you can imagine how many families --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Not many.</span> <span id="s162">And if it was a two-room schoolhouse --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: And -- No, it was -- it was upstairs where the synagogue room was.</span> <span id="s164">Synagogue was downstairs, and upstairs was -- And, I mean, there may be -- have been some people where the kids were out grown already or they didn't have any children.</span> <span id="s165">As I say, I was 10 years old; my parents knew everybody, but I didn't know -- I knew everybody in town sort of, but I didn't know their, you know, past and what-have-you.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Were you -- If you went to a Jewish school, a Hebrew school, did you have any interaction as a child with -- with not -- with Gentiles, with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: All my friends because I went to a Cath -- in Boppard was a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: And there was one like a public school, went to eighth grade, and then there was a Catholic school with the nuns which went all the way 12 -- you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: And that's where my sister and I went, and then there was a boys' school that was like this Catholic school but only for boys.</span> <span id="s172">So we went to this -- my sister and I went to this Catholic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Well, that's unusual that Jewish parents would send a child to a Catholic school --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: It was the only better school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Better than the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s178">Do you have any memories of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s180">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And what kind were they?</span> <span id="s182">Anything stand out?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Oh, in kindergarten I loved to play with the boys.</span> <span id="s184">And I remember the nuns were very nice.</span> <span id="s185">When they went to services, you know, they wouldn't leave us alone -- I was little, four, five years old -- in the school rooms.</span> <span id="s186">So we had to go with them to service, but they said, "Don't get up, don't kneel."</span> <span id="s187">I mean, they were very decent.</span> <span id="s188">You know, in those days people didn't wear pants.</span> <span id="s189">The kids didn't wear pants, and we'd go -- like we'd have a break, we'd play outside.</span> <span id="s190">We'd go up on the stairs, and I remember two and two holding hands going upstairs and this nun coming in the back of us, and she would call my mother and say, "You got to do something, her skirts are too short.</span> <span id="s191">We can see her panties."</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you have any best friends in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes, I had some -- I had some good friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: But a lot of the -- in fact, one of them -- some of them came from out of town, and one of them used -- came from out of town, and she would come to my house every day for lunch.</span> <span id="s198">And so you know -- and I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s199">I mean, either they're all too or they're gone; I don't know what happened to them during the war.</span> <span id="s200">But there were these -- I played with them until I left Germany.</span> <span id="s201">In fact, I've got like a -- what they call a poussy (ph) album, you know, where they write things, and they all wrote nice memories and nice things in that book when I -- before I left.</span> <span id="s202">They knew I was leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Well, here's the interesting thing is that your beginning school years if you were born in 1926, I'm assuming you must have started school, kindergarten 1931, 1932, something like that.</span> <span id="s204">Would that be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Nineteen -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s207">And in 1933, Hitler comes to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s210">So in your world, you know, your child's world in Boppard, did you sense any of these political things that were in the air?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, after 1933, for instance, in school, we all played -- the kids would play with me, and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s212">But they couldn't invite me to their houses for birthday parties or to come and play.</span> <span id="s213">They couldn't come to my house to come and play and what-have-you, you know.</span> <span id="s214">And they'd heard -- so I got friendly with a couple of Jewish kids who didn't go to that school and -- but they were killed afterwards; they were -- they went to Auschwitz, their whole families.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: They were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So well, the change was is that you couldn't socialize -- within the school you were allowed to socialize --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yeah, until 1936, and then my parents got a -- got a phone call that they should -- that we couldn't go to school there anymore, it wouldn't be safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s220">So the nuns called.</span> <span id="s221">I mean, the Catholic school called and said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s223">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s224">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s225">They warned my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And -- But I'm trying to get a sense that until 1936, was this like a -- a kind of oasis in this -- in the changing world?</span> <span id="s227">I mean, did you feel any -- any of the -- In public schools sometimes, teachers became very hostile to --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: -- Jewish students --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- because of the political changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: I wondered whether or not there was more leeway within a nonpublic school such as a religious school and whether they were able to create a wall between the outside world or whether or not the same thing happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No, the nuns were very nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Oh, yes, oh, yes, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s237">And, as I say, in school we kids all played together.</span> <span id="s238">But it was on the outside where I could not be seen with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: That hurts a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: And things like I remember a friend of my parents, he was a lawyer, and they had a parade one day down Main Street -- we lived on the main street.</span> <span id="s241">And he looked out the window, and they arrested him for looking out the window and watching the parade, that sort of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s242">And -- But I didn't know -- at the time I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s243">My parents told me after I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s245">Of incidents like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: That what happened to this man, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What was your home life like?</span> <span id="s250">Tell me a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh, very happy.</span> <span id="s252">My mother was sort of a quiet lady.</span> <span id="s253">But, I mean, she was -- she was a beautiful pianist, and she would make my sister and me sit on the carpet and listen to her play.</span> <span id="s254">And my father had a wonderful sense of humor.</span> <span id="s255">I was always getting into trouble.</span> <span id="s256">My sister was reading books, and she was sitting, and she was the good girl.</span> <span id="s257">And I was always getting – like, for instance, the office of where we lived was downstairs, the building -- the business --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: -- and we lived upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: And I would sometimes lock the door of the office, and my father would have to get somebody to climb out the window, come around.</span> <span id="s262">They knew exactly who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: {Laughing.}</span> <span id="s266">But sometimes the mischievous children --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: But then my -- then my father would come out, and he'd give me a wallop on my back side, and then half an hour later, I'd be sitting on his knee, and he would be kidding around.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So tell me a little bit about his personality, about what kind of a person he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: He was -- Well, I can only say when I remember him, he was always good-natured and very fair.</span> <span id="s270">I mean, he would never punish me because I was little wild thing.</span> <span id="s271">And my sister was always good sitting there, reading her books and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s272">But I mean, in school, we both did well, and that was important to them, you know.</span> <span id="s273">But no, he had a wonderful sense of humor, and we would go -- they would -- it was a beautiful area, and we'd do a lot of hiking.</span> <span id="s274">And, as I said before, in the summer we'd have a lot of family coming and people coming staying with us because it was sit -- on the Rhine and the beautiful walks and -- and, you know, you go up on -- into the hillside part, and on top there would be a restaurant overlooking the Rhine and stuff, and we'd go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Oh, that must be pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: -- and take them there on Sundays and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s277">We took the children there, my granddaughters and my kids there to show them where we were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Was there any trace of your family from when you went after the war back to Boppard with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, most of them got out of Germany.</span> <span id="s280">Some of them went to -- some -- As a matter of fact, some of my father's sisters had come here at the end of the 18th century --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: 19th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: -- to New York.</span> <span id="s283">No, 1891, 19th century.</span> <span id="s284">No, 18th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: No, no, no. 19th century but in 1891.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: But in 1891, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: It gets confusing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And it was only actually two.</span> <span id="s289">One went -- one where the family -- the one that wasn't married went to Holland; she was killed.</span> <span id="s290">And then my father had one brother who was married, had no children, and they didn't get out; they got killed.</span> <span id="s291">That was the only one that get didn't out.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So the -- he had, if I take it correctly, one brother and three sisters, that is, one in the Netherlands who didn't make it, one in --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: That was my mother's sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Oh, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: -- in the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So tell me about your father's siblings.</span> <span id="s299">How many did he have so that we're clear on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: He had I think three or four brothers.</span> <span id="s301">See, some of them were living out -- in the United States already, so by the time I came along, they weren't even there anymore.</span> <span id="s302">They were dead and --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Were they mostly older than he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: He was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Ah, yeah, so if he was born in 1877 --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A.</span> <span id="s307">Some were born in the 19 -- in the 1840's and '50's.</span> <span id="s308">He was born --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s312">Yeah, well, it could very easily be that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s314">No, he was the youngest of the whole.</span> <span id="s315">And my mother too on her side there.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did -- Did your -- Did his family live in Boppard for generations, or had they -- had your grandfather come to it from someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, the grandfather was born there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s319">So it was -- it was in the family for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: There was what they called a Judengasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Ah, a street that would be the Jewish street?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: The Jews lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: And that's where they were born.</span> <span id="s325">And then my grandfather bought the building on the Main Street and -- after they were allowed to, I guess -- I don't know what year that was -- and he started the business, and he moved upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And that's where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: And that's where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Tell me a little bit about the apartment, then, upstairs that -- above that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, we had -- let's see.</span> <span id="s330">We had -- well, a kitchen and -- and on -- on -- well, downstairs was all office and, of course, under -- in those days the refrigerator was under the stairs.</span> <span id="s331">I don't know if you ever heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: No.</span> <span id="s333">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No, you know, the stairs.</span> <span id="s335">And the refrigerator wasn't in the kitchen; it was under the stairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Because it's the coolest place?</span> <span id="s337">Is that why?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span> <span id="s339">I guess there was no -- there was no space in the kitchen for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And -- And I used to throw the key from the door under there.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Oh, that's mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Because it's hard to get to.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I know.</span> <span id="s346">Well, they had long arms, they got --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Somehow they got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, I mean, it was normal, like a two-story house here, and upstairs we had one, two, three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s351">And there was a -- a big room which was our playroom where we used to play and where we -- our friends used to come, where we had our toys.</span> <span id="s352">And we had a maid, and I remember on Christmas on the -- on the table there, my mother would have a little Christmas tree with all kind of gifts.</span> <span id="s353">No, we had a maid for a long time.</span> <span id="s354">And then in 1933, I think it was, we weren't allowed to have any maids under 60 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So 60, 6-0, and older could still work as maids but nobody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Right.</span> <span id="s357">And so we had to let that one who'd worked for us -- Maria who worked for us forever and we knew her whole family, I mean, she was wonderful, and we loved her.</span> <span id="s358">And we got this old maid, and we hated her.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: And so we let her go, so my mother did her own thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s362">What was the name of the maid that you loved?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A. Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Maria?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Mm-hmm</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And was she from in town too, from Boppard?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s368">There was behind -- Boppard was down by the Rhine, and then there was -- it went uphill, in other words like -- like the grape --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: The vineyards?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The vineyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Vineyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Vineyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: And then on top there was called Hunsruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s376">I've heard of Hunsruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: You have?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Yeah, It's a small place, but I've heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A. No, it's not a town.</span> <span id="s380">It's a whole area.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A. And there were farms up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: And her parents were farmers, and she had a brother.</span> <span id="s385">And somehow -- I don't know how my parents got her because she was there as long as I could remember, and she came from one of the families there.</span> <span id="s386">And every once in a while, she -- I remember she would take us kids up there to her family.</span> <span id="s387">She had a brother who had a -- had a motorcycle, and I remember going on that motorcycle; it was the most exciting thing in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s389">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And even after she had to leave, every once in a while she'd crawl in in the evening and bring my mother some stuff from the farm, some foods and stuff.</span> <span id="s391">And no, she was very nice.</span> <span id="s392">She died.</span> <span id="s393">I mean, she -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: But not during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, it had nothing to do with the war.</span> <span id="s396">She wasn't Jewish, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s398">Yeah.</span> <span id="s399">So it sounds like the -- the experiences that you had with people who weren't Jewish, just regular everyday German people --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: -- were for the most part quite positive and --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Very positive.</span> <span id="s403">I mean, we -- my parents, of course, knew everybody in town.</span> <span id="s404">And I knew a lot of the people, and I -- my problem was like, for instance, my sister had a bicycle, and in 1935 my sister -- my parents sent her to a yavneh in Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: And so her bicycle was at home.</span> <span id="s407">I wasn't allowed to use it, but I used to crawl out with it, and I would fall off it, and somebody would see me and call my mother before -- and I would go home, and you know what I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">In trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Where did your sister go in Cologne, a yavneh, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: A school, it's a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: A Jewish school --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: -- for high school children or --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s417">It was a -- It was for -- yeah, for high school.</span> <span id="s418">She was already in the upper, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s420">But that's quite far from Boppard, isn't it, Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Not that far.</span> <span id="s422">I mean, take the train up there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So she would commute, or did she stay overnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Oh, no, she -- she stayed overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s426">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s427">How -- If you can remember, and if your parents told you later, how were their lives affected after 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, one of their neighbors who wasn't Jewish came over one night and told my father -- this -- this was after I had left Germany -- "You better get out of here.</span> <span id="s429">I heard rumors.</span> <span id="s430">Something's going to happen to you."</span> <span id="s431">So -- So they bought our house --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: -- and my parents moved to Cologne where they weren't known, had an apartment there until they emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Ah, I see.</span> <span id="s435">So this -- was this a family friend, or was this just --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, well, you know, they were all what they call on the "du" level.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Yeah, the familiarity level.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s439">I mean, they lived there forever, and my parents lived there forever, and we used to go in and out of their house, and they used to come to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: But did you ever see any Nazis, I mean, people with -- who belonged to the Nazi party or --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s442">I had a girlfriend next door; she was about a year older.</span> <span id="s443">The parents had a jewelry store, and she used to -- you know, she used to come to our house, and I used to go to their house and what-have-you.</span> <span id="s444">And her brother was a little bit older, and he belonged to the youth -- the German youth group.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: And when he wasn't home, she would climb over the back fence into our garden, and we would play together.</span> <span id="s447">But God forbid us if he was home, we wouldn't be seen together.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, all the young kids had to go into this youth thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: The Hitler Jugend?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: The Hitler Jugend?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And -- And aside from that, before you left Germany, did you sense that your father's business was suffering in -- at any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Look, I wasn't 10 years old.</span> <span id="s456">I knew nothing about business.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: As long as I had something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s462">So it sounds like if there were such things that your parents kind of shielded you from those -- from the nastier parts?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s464">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s465">But we knew that we had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s466">We knew that outside of the school we couldn't talk to these kids that I would play with in the school, you know.</span> <span id="s467">We knew, and we were very upset about it.</span> <span id="s468">But, you know, all of a sudden, they're having a birthday party and you're not invited.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: That hurts a child.</span> <span id="s470">That hurts a child, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s472">So on.</span> <span id="s473">But -- As I say, then I made friends with a couple of kids that were in my Hebrew school, and everything was within walking distance, so it wasn't a matter of catching the bus to get to their house or -- or somebody driving -- getting into the car and driving.</span> <span id="s474">You just walked wherever you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Well, in the Hebrew school, what are the things that you've studied?</span> <span id="s476">And then I have another follow-up question after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Oh, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s478">I remember learning how to read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s479">We studied -- Oh, God, I don't know, it's so long ago.</span> <span id="s480">All I remember, one day one of the friends, her name was Ella, she was like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: She was large?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: And she was fat, and she used to eat candy all the time.</span> <span id="s483">And so the rabbi who was our teacher too, he caught her and took it and put it in his desk drawer.</span> <span id="s484">And when there was a break, the kids said, "Hilde, go and get it back for her.</span> <span id="s485">We're not going to tell anybody.</span> <span id="s486">We're not going to tell him.</span> <span id="s487">We're not going to do anything."</span> <span id="s488">Well, he comes back, the first thing he opens the door, okay, who took it?</span> <span id="s489">Everybody looked at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: {Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: They didn't say who, but they looked at me.</span> <span id="s492">So I had -- I had to write a hundred times "Wer hailt (ph) der stiehlt."</span> <span id="s493">It means who steals -- who lies -- he who lies steals.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Say it in German for me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: "Wer hailt der stiehlt."</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: "Wer hailt"?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: "Der stiehlt."</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So hailen (ph) means to lie?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Uh-huh, I thought lugen meant to lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, it's probably a local word of some sort.</span> <span id="s502">Anyhow, by the time I got home, my sister'd already gotten there.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">{Laughing.}</span> <span id="s504">And I had to sit down and write a hundred times.</span> <span id="s505">I got no protection.</span> <span id="s506">I had to sit down and write it a hundred times.</span> <span id="s507">{Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And all because you wanted to have Ella have her candy back.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s510">{Laughing.}</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Did life -- in the school itself, did you go to that school until the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: So did things change there?</span> <span id="s514">Did people tell stories there of what was going on with their families, with themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No.</span> <span id="s516">There weren't many Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s517">There was only -- one of my parents' friends, they -- their two daughters were there.</span> <span id="s518">And then one other boy -- one other girl was there, and then we were the only Jewish children there, and the others were all older than I was anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Because it was a small commun -- small congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s522">So tell me, is there anything else from your prewar life and your pre-leaving Germany life, I should say, that -- that -- that stays -- you know, comes to mind that stays with you that is something that -- that shaped --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s524">Well, always to me was important going swimming in the summer.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, my parents always took us swimming every day.</span> <span id="s526">We could walk down alone.</span> <span id="s527">You know, you'd have your bathing suit on and a cover on, and you'd just walk because you walked everywhere.</span> <span id="s528">And my sister and I would walk down after school or the hikes we took together and -- and then the company we used to have in the summer, and we took them on hikes and to these restaurants where you could oversee the Rhine and the ships coming and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: That sounds beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: And, you know, you could take -- you know, there were the cruises on the Rhine, and they would stop, and you'd go into the castles and all that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Sounds very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh, yeah, it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: So how did it come about that in 1936 you leave Boppard, that you leave Germany?</span> <span id="s534">What developed?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Well, first of all, I couldn't go to school anymore there.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: To the Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yeah, to any school.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: And my -- my mother was friendly with the wife of the rabbi in Dusseldorf who married my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: And she had a sister who lived -- I don't know if you ever heard of the Inter-Aid Committee in London, they helped children get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Was this the Kindertransport, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No.</span> <span id="s546">I had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s547">And they -- And this lady -- I didn't even know her -- called her sister, the rabbi's wife, if she knew anybody, she heard of this family who wanted to take three 10-year-old girls out of Germany.</span> <span id="s548">And so this rabbi's wife -- I don't know even know her name.</span> <span id="s549">No, I know her second name, _______, she called my mother.</span> <span id="s550">And I mean, she knew us girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: And would she be interested.</span> <span id="s553">And so my mother yes, but what -- she wanted to know more about the family, you know.</span> <span id="s554">And anyhow, comes August -- August 16th, my -- took the train -- my parents.</span> <span id="s555">My mother was going to go with me.</span> <span id="s556">She went with me, took me just to make sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: And my father went as far as Cologne.</span> <span id="s559">One thing I will never ever forget him standing there, the first time I ever saw him, the tears running down his eyes -- his cheeks.</span> <span id="s560">Well, he didn't know whether he'd ever see me again because he didn't know what would happen to them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: So my mother took me to England, and there was this lady that her name was Jessie Wait (ph).</span> <span id="s563">And she took -- And the people that actually had us come over, they lived -- had a big estate in the country, and they owned this house in Nottingham so that we could walk to school, to a private school.</span> <span id="s564">And this lady, Jessie Wait took care of us.</span> <span id="s565">I mean, she was very strict, but she was very good, very fair.</span> <span id="s566">And -- And so my mother went back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: She -- Yeah, so she was able to see where you'd be?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: See where I was going.</span> <span id="s569">And I remembered, you know, they had an extra bedroom, so she slept there.</span> <span id="s570">And the next morning, I got up out of my bed and went to that room to see here, and she'd left already because they figured I'd be too upset -- both be too upset, you know.</span> <span id="s571">So she took the train back to London already.</span> <span id="s572">So -- So I cried a little bit, and that was it, you know.</span> <span id="s573">There were two -- the other two girls had come a few days earlier.</span> <span id="s574">And, no, we went to private school.</span> <span id="s575">We had piano lessons; we had dancing lessons.</span> <span id="s576">We had -- what do you call it -- speech lessons, English speech lessons, all private stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s577">And we had a piano; I mean, there was nothing -- nice garden.</span> <span id="s578">And on the Sundays in the spring and summer -- the people that got me over there, they had a cricket team.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: So in the summer they would have a cricket match in their park, they could -- you know, which was around their building, their home.</span> <span id="s581">And then they had this huge tent, and comes lunch time, we'd all sit together with these fellows.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Cricket players?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: They came from New Zealand, from India because they -- these cricket teams, they traveled all over, you know.</span> <span id="s584">And we'd have lunch with them.</span> <span id="s585">And those things you don't forget.</span> <span id="s586">And they had a beautiful swimming pool.</span> <span id="s587">They would pick us up on the Sunday morning, they'd send a chauffeur with -- and the car and pick us up, the three girls, and we'd go out there.</span> <span id="s588">We'd have a wonderful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Was this termed in any way?</span> <span id="s590">Did this -- Was this an open-ended kind of invitation that you stayed there as long as you need to, or was it for two years, or was it for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s592">It was, I guess, open-ended.</span> <span id="s593">I mean, when the war started in 1939 over there, the -- the other two, their parents had come to England, one in London, the other one in Glasgow in Scotland, and so they went to live with their parents.</span> <span id="s594">So the people sent me to a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s596">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Out in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: And there -- And the principals of both schools were absolutely fabulous.</span> <span id="s600">Like on the -- what's it?</span> <span id="s601">In November 8th -- the 18th of November?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Armistice Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Oh, Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s606">On the Fridays we always had to read the Times, the London Times, and they gave us exercises to do, you know, questions and what-have-you.</span> <span id="s607">And I read about it, and I burst into tears, and the -- and they called the principal in, and she took me, and she let me sit in her office all day to quieten me down and so on.</span> <span id="s608">And in the -- in the boarding school, the principal used to, you know, call me in, and I remember getting a letter from -- my parents got out in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: That's quite late.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: And -- And went to Spain; they were able to get into Spain.</span> <span id="s611">They had to pay somebody off in Berlin, they had to go to Berlin, and they flew to Barcelona.</span> <span id="s612">And so evidently the principal saw that there was a letter for me from Spain, and she came in to -- We were having breakfast.</span> <span id="s613">She said, "Usually at lunch time you get your mail, but I've got to make an exception.</span> <span id="s614">Hilde, come to my office."</span> <span id="s615">So I wondered what's going on now?</span> <span id="s616">By that time I was, what, about 15 years old.</span> <span id="s617">And here was a letter from my mother -- from my parents in Barcelona that they'd gotten out, you know.</span> <span id="s618">But they had to wait there for a ship.</span> <span id="s619">There was no such thing getting on the plane.</span> <span id="s620">They had to wait for a ship to take them over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Tell me, what happened to your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: My sister came here -- she went in 1939, she -- her school had a whole group of kids they sent to England.</span> <span id="s623">And she went and lived with a very, very nice Quaker family.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So was she part of the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, no, from her school where she went, from the yavneh.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: They had a group of kids, and they -- you know, they were able to get them into England.</span> <span id="s628">And she stayed in Bristol with a family and helped take care of the children there, and they were very, very good to her, very nice.</span> <span id="s629">But she came over then; a couple of years later she came over.</span> <span id="s630">She came before me.</span> <span id="s631">And she lived with a cousin until my parents came.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Okay, now I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s633">When you say she came a few years before you, you mean to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s636">I'm still --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I should have said --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: It's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, because I came in '44, and she came in '41 -- '40, '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, she went to England in '38.</span> <span id="s646">I'm lying, '39, not '39, '38.</span> <span id="s647">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Did you meet her soon after she came to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Because you hadn't seen her for a couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I know.</span> <span id="s652">No.</span> <span id="s653">I went there one summer vacation; I went and stayed with them for a couple of weeks, you know.</span> <span id="s654">And -- But, of course, they didn't have the long vacations they have here in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: So -- and I went -- I went down to Bristol and -- for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s657">And then soon after, she came here, you know.</span> <span id="s658">And she was going to school, and she took care of those -- helped take care of the children there and helped in the house and what-have-you.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Now, when she came and you were able to meet her that summer, did she tell you of what was going on in Germany and what had gone on with the family since you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, not really, because I had read that in the Times -- in the -- in the London Times on that Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: About Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: About Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s663">But then somehow, I don't know, we were kids, we were just trying to have a good time together, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s665">You didn't talk about the hard things, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: -- the tough things?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s670">How frequently did you write -- Were you able to write to your parents during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: For a while I was able to write.</span> <span id="s672">I had a relative in Holland and sent them -- and my parents sent them letter, and they would forward it.</span> <span id="s673">But then when the Germans came into Holland, that was the end of that so --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s675">But that would have been after the war started, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s677">Well, right after the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s679">So for three years you were able to correspond with them in this fashion of having --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Any fashion --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: But -- But after that -- so the correspondence stopped, and you didn't know what was going on with your parents at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Neither of you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, because I had no way of getting in touch with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And neither did your sister, she was already out of the country --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s690">Yeah.</span> <span id="s691">And the first that you hear, then, is when you get this letter from Barcelona in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q; So between '39 and '41 you don't know whether they're dead, whether they're alive, whether they're deported, whether they're --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Well, between the time that -- I'm not sure of the exact day when Holland was invaded.</span> <span id="s695">Between that time -- as long as Holland was free, I was able to send a letter to Holland, and they would send it on and vice versa.</span> <span id="s696">But once Holland was gone, that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s698">So where were your parents the last time you had any correspondence?</span> <span id="s699">Were they still in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And how was your father able to make a living?</span> <span id="s702">Was it from the proceeds of having sold the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Well, he wasn't in business anymore because being in business, people know you.</span> <span id="s704">You got to have a license; you got to -- you know, all that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s706">So how did they eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: They had some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s709">So it was the -- it was the sale that they were able to have before things got very strict --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: -- that they still were able to live off of?</span> <span id="s712">Is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s714">I mean, they didn't have to go hungry.</span> <span id="s715">It's just they had to -- people didn't know them in Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: So if they went to a store, they just had to go in and out and be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Did you ever see their apartment in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes, once.</span> <span id="s720">And in '38 -- no, in Christmas vacation of '37, I went back once and went to Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: The end -- Christmas of 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Well, was it much different from what you had left?</span> <span id="s724">I mean, you saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Well, we had a whole house in Boppard.</span> <span id="s726">This was an -- I mean, it was a nice apartment to -- It was -- I slept in the living room, and they had their bedroom, you know.</span> <span id="s727">You had sort of hide, get lost somewhere.</span> <span id="s728">They had to get lost because nobody knew them there, and they were able to get away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did the atmosphere in the streets, was it different than what you had remembered from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, it was -- it's -- you have to remember, Cologne was a big city.</span> <span id="s731">Boppard was a little town where you knew everybody; you'd go out your front door, you'd immediately see people that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s733">So I guess what I'm going after is a sense of the politics in the air and whether there was more Nazi symbolism, whether there were more kids on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: The same all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: The same.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Same all over, same all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I mean, the friends I had in Boppard, like next door, we couldn't correspond.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s740">Did you ever correspond with any of your friends after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: They'd all moved out.</span> <span id="s742">Some of them gotten married and moved away, and it was very hard getting in touch with them.</span> <span id="s743">Some of their parents were still there, you know.</span> <span id="s744">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Was -- Was the -- Were the relationships broken?</span> <span id="s746">You had left when you were 10 years old and --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well, they were because I had a different life then.</span> <span id="s748">And -- and my -- you know, my whole life was completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s750">When your parents were in Barcelona, how long did they stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s752">Probably two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s753">They'd stay there till they could get on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: And then they came to where in the UK?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Oh, they went straight to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s759">So they didn't even come to the UK, they went straight to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And the reason for that was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Well, they had -- they had relatives here.</span> <span id="s763">They had planned on coming here, but their -- their number, you know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: The quota number?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Was too high to get out earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s767">Do you know when they applied for a U.S. visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s769">Look, I was nine, 10 years old, 11 years old.</span> <span id="s770">I don't know when.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s772">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: In those days they didn't discuss that with us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: So you knew that they were in the United States, they wrote to you from the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Oh, yes, oh, the minute they got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: And, I mean, I know I had cousins here.</span> <span id="s778">My father had two sisters who lived here who had gone there, you know, years ago and so on.</span> <span id="s779">And there was another cousin who was dead by the time I came here who gave them their -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Sponsored them?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yeah, sponsored them and what-have-you.</span> <span id="s782">He had some kind of business and so on.</span> <span id="s783">But the thing is I've got papers of all these things, and every once in a while Julia will go through them and be just amazed, these old papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: They really show the history of what happens to people, the documents from way back then.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So you're in -- when your parents come to the States in 1941, your sister soon follows, correct?</span> <span id="s787">She comes --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: She was here a little bit -- few months before her -- before them.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s790">She was able to go because your relatives sponsored her into the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: No, right.</span> <span id="s792">I mean basically they sponsored the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: And she lived with this cousin.</span> <span id="s795">I mean, the cousin was married already and what-have-you, you know.</span> <span id="s796">I mean, they were all so much older than we were.</span> <span id="s797">They lived in Flushing.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: I know it, yeah.</span> <span id="s799">And so she came over -- remind me again in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: A little bit before your parents.</span> <span id="s802">Then your parents came.</span> <span id="s803">And why is it that you stayed in Britain until 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well, first of all, I was too young to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: And I had a good life there, and my parents couldn't afford me.</span> <span id="s807">You know, my mother had -- my father had a job washing dishes in a restaurant, and my mother was packing hair nets into envelopes in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: It was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I would have had to go to school.</span> <span id="s810">But when I was 14, the people where I lived, you know, the younger people all had to go in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: So they asked me would I mind leaving school in eighth grade and going to work for them in the -- they had a big furniture business.</span> <span id="s813">And I said, "No, of course not."</span> <span id="s814">So -- And I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s815">I learned -- I worked for the lawyer in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: And I worked there until I came here.</span> <span id="s818">And they were all very good to me.</span> <span id="s819">And, I mean, I had a good life.</span> <span id="s820">I can't -- I really can't complain except that I wasn't with my parents, you know.</span> <span id="s821">But they were very good to me.</span> <span id="s822">They still sent a car for me every -- every Sunday to come out to their place and all that.</span> <span id="s823">And -- no.</span> <span id="s824">And I went -- and one of the girls that I had lived -- had lived with us, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: -- her parents moved to Nottingham because the father needed a job so -- certain -- actually the name of the people that got him, Sir Julien Cahn, he owned a house they gave them to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: So Julien Cahn was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: -- furniture --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: -- manufacturer?</span> <span id="s832">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Not manufacturer.</span> <span id="s834">Stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Stores, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: And they -- And he like lent them a house.</span> <span id="s837">And they said I could stay with them, I didn't have to pay, you know.</span> <span id="s838">So then I worked in his office, so we helped -- one of the girls and her father worked in the office, and I worked for the lawyer in the office.</span> <span id="s839">When I came here -- this is amazing -- my parents said, "You got to finish high school, got to finish high school."</span> <span id="s840">They didn't forget.</span> <span id="s841">So I went downtown.</span> <span id="s842">I was working downtown; I had a job in an import/export place.</span> <span id="s843">So I went to Washington Irving High School and asked them, and they said, "Well, we got to test you first."</span> <span id="s844">So by the time the test was finished and they evaluated, they said, "Listen, all you need is civics and American history, you're ahead of everything else.</span> <span id="s845">In math and everything else, you ahead of everybody."</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: In all the subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: So all I do is go to night school for the -- a couple of semesters like and I got my -- I've still got it, my high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: {Laughing.}</span> <span id="s849">That shows you British education, doesn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s852">So tell me a little bit about what was it like when you did come to the States?</span> <span id="s853">It's the first time you see your parents in eight years, and you left a child, and you're there as an 18-year-old.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Well, I'll tell you something else.</span> <span id="s855">When I came over, I came on a -- on a -- in a convoy, in a banana boat; it was full of kids, full of Jewish kids whose parents were here in the same situation.</span> <span id="s856">And we were told "If we let you go, you must not tell anybody not even your parents that you're coming" because it's a convoy, the other boats have soldiers and armaments in them.</span> <span id="s857">We went -- We left on the first of March.</span> <span id="s858">We went all the way up north; it took us a whole month to get to New York, to Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s860">So you went by Greenland and Canada and things like that to get to Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: All the way up north.</span> <span id="s862">Took us a whole month.</span> <span id="s863">I arrived here on the first of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: And my parents didn't even know I was coming.</span> <span id="s866">So there was a lady from -- I don't remember the organization, a women's -- Jewish women's organization; they had a -- midtown they -- on 59th Street someplace, they had an office.</span> <span id="s867">And she took me there.</span> <span id="s868">And my parents at that time couldn't afford a telephone, so she couldn't -- so she had to take me there; and it was on the Saturday, and luckily they were home and -- well, everybody cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: {Laughing.}</span> <span id="s870">Yeah.</span> <span id="s871">Yeah.</span> <span id="s872">I mean, a lot had happened in those eight
