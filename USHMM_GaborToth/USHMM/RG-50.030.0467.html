And Mr., Mr. Holczer, if we can just begin by you telling me your name at birth and the place of birth and your date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I, my name is Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in Budapest in 1929, August 31.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And, will you tell me something about your mother and your father, their, their names and their family backgrounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My father was, my father’s name is Lajos Holczer.</span> <span id="s15">He comes from a very poor working class family, a Jewish family that was almost totally assimilated into the Proletarian environment.</span> <span id="s16">They lived on the outskirts of Budapest in a tenement without any water and electricity.</span> <span id="s17">My grandmother was practically the sole supporter of the family until the children got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a lumpen proletary (ph) person who did not really care too much about father responsibilities.</span> <span id="s18">The, so my father was the oldest one who made it into adult life, there was somebody else ahead of him but died of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s19">And he has always been a great support to his brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s20">He was a working man, he has always worked for other people.</span> <span id="s21">Eventually, he became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a formal education and after the war, he joined a co-op.</span> <span id="s22">He rose to kind of a mid-level managerial position but he basically was always just a working man.</span> <span id="s23">He never went beyond the second grade and he taught himself how to read and write and everything else.</span> <span id="s24">He had exceptional qualities in math and law.</span> <span id="s25">My mother comes from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz.</span> <span id="s26">This is where the Danube turns suddenly south and she comes from a middle class family, Orthodox, very religious.</span> <span id="s27">She had a brother and a sister, both of them who died in World War II.</span> <span id="s28">The sister was deported, the brother died in labor camp.</span> <span id="s29">Her entire family from Vacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died there.</span> <span id="s30">My mother never had to work, basically, my father was always making enough money and she enjoyed just being a housewife.</span> <span id="s31">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you say how many brothers and sisters your father had?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, yes, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow up, because his older brother died, very early.</span> <span id="s34">So, the burden of supporting the family was always on him.</span> <span id="s35">So he was the provider type and my mother had no basic responsibility.</span> <span id="s36">She was basically what you would call a petit-bourgeois lady and I always admired my father’s values more than my mother’s but that doesn’t mean I didn’t love my mother.</span> <span id="s37">My mother also survived the war with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: How did your father and your mother meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father and mother met, so that, my father was working for a wholesale drug distribution firm.</span> <span id="s40">By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply firm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, making cologne water, things like that.</span> <span id="s41">It had nothing to do with what we call drugs today.</span> <span id="s42">It was not a pharmaceutical company.</span> <span id="s43">And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it was the custom of middle-class families to send their daughters to secretarial school and then have them work for a few years for some firm, hoping that they’re going to catch a husband.</span> <span id="s44">And my mother caught my father there, which was very much to the dislike of her family because my father, they felt, was much below their class and they made him feel that way in all his life.</span> <span id="s45">Of course, I cannot really say what would have happened after World War II because my mother’s entire family was wiped out, practically.</span> <span id="s46">Only a few people who lived in Budapest remained.</span> <span id="s47">So, but I resented them for a very simple reason, that they looked down on my father who I thought was a, was a very, was a man of integrity and, and hard-working, a good human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I had a very strange relationship with my mother’s family, especially my grandparents because they were very religious and I was born irreligious and whenever I had to visit with them they forced me to wear a hat even in the middle of the summer and eat a certain kind of very strict kosher food, go to the synagogue every night and pray and, and in general, they considered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a shaygets, somebody who is kind of just an outsider because I never really went along with their, with their religious rules.</span> <span id="s50">I also resented the fact that my grandmother was kind of a, of a, of a very angry person.</span> <span id="s51">I felt that, that the way she treated others and the way she treated my grandfather, I resented that.</span> <span id="s52">I didn’t like to go there and my mother, of course, always wanted me to go and visit and I have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore.</span> <span id="s53">And one day, this was, I must have been about eleven or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge ham hock and got out and when the people went to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were coming and that was my last visit.</span> <span id="s54">They immediately sent me back to Budapest and I never had to visit again.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Was your mother angry with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s57">My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an understanding.</span> <span id="s58">Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my mother’s sake.</span> <span id="s59">And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to Israel, I was in Israel which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father doesn’t know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words.</span> <span id="s60">He has no idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that.</span> <span id="s61">So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let’s just eat what is available.</span> <span id="s62">And so we did not have a kosher household anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Now was your father’s entire family not very religious, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes, yes, they weren’t.</span> <span id="s65">They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness.</span> <span id="s66">They knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s67">And interestingly, quite a few of them survived because of the place where they lived.</span> <span id="s68">Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of—city tenement—that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this area and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the family.</span> <span id="s69">I have an uncle in Hungary and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side.</span> <span id="s70">So a great deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement.</span> <span id="s71">So that helped rescue them.</span> <span id="s72">The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible years that, that would help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your household on holidays, or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">Yes.</span> <span id="s76">My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the synagogue, your mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do whatever with religion.</span> <span id="s77">He just asked me to respect my mother’s wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did.</span> <span id="s78">After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to synagogue again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, inside.</span> <span id="s79">And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say I am a Jew but I’m not Jewish.</span> <span id="s80">And they ask me, “How can that be?”</span> <span id="s81">And I said, “Well, it’s easy.”</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s84">It’s a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don’t, but I always just associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years.</span> <span id="s85">But I can’t remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being.</span> <span id="s86">And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if I had any doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: My relationship with my father was always very good.</span> <span id="s89">I [indecipherable], I considered him always my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s90">And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my father.</span> <span id="s91">My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from ’74 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the U.S. I always considered him an absolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn’t need any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in Hungary and was always giving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it on himself.</span> <span id="s92">He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child…</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes, always, always.</span> <span id="s95">He was always that way.</span> <span id="s96">Just a very simple, very simple man.</span> <span id="s97">Very, extremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being.</span> <span id="s98">And with my mother, I always had a little bit of my doubts that she’s not as straightforward as my father.</span> <span id="s99">And there were little incidents that kind of, as a child, it’s amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and you cannot get rid of it.</span> <span id="s100">And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never forgive my mother for, was that while my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia, she took a little job and she worked for a drugstore in the center of Budapest.</span> <span id="s101">And next to the drugstore was an antique store.</span> <span id="s102">Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he liked my mother.</span> <span id="s103">My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he would wait for her when she closed this shop to escort her home because he lived the same way and I didn’t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my mother and it’s not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, I was protecting my mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and laughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind.</span> <span id="s104">And I could never forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game.</span> <span id="s105">And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the two of us was piano.</span> <span id="s106">She decided that I’m going to be a great piano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the piano and she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and run after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was so we were running around the table and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn’t catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since in World War II, our piano was destroyed.</span> <span id="s107">We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad.</span> <span id="s108">She wanted to buy another piano and I said no.</span> <span id="s109">When I, when we came up from the cellar after liberation, I said, that’s it.</span> <span id="s110">I am now a man.</span> <span id="s111">I basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more piano and I never sat down to play the piano.</span> <span id="s112">Never.</span> <span id="s113">I never had the urge.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship with your mother’s family and I was interested in hearing your relationship with your father’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: My father’s family was my favorite side of the family.</span> <span id="s116">I had a grandmother, a typical Proletarian woman with thirteen children and not much of a husband.</span> <span id="s117">And I remember going out and loving every moment of spending time with them because here I came, I was the, the, the second grandchild in the family.</span> <span id="s118">There was one older one who, unfortunately, during the war, was killed.</span> <span id="s119">So I was kind of the sweetheart of everybody and they were pampering me and taking me to places and my grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous knowledge of how to make beans in at least fifteen different ways.</span> <span id="s120">There were beans every time I went out, they had beans, beans, but she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-hearted, a typical country woman.</span> <span id="s121">She came from southern Hungary from a very small village and after raising thirteen children during the day, she left them in the care of my father and then went from door to door selling silk stockings just to add a little bit to the, to the income.</span> <span id="s122">The, my father’s brothers and sisters were, of course, some of them are only just a few years older than I am, so they were almost like brothers and sisters to me at that time and since there was no money at all in the family, they resorted to somehow, illegal things.</span> <span id="s123">I remember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissor—pair of scissors—and cut a big hole and pushed me through the hole into the ice skating rink, nearby, so we always went ice skating.</span> <span id="s124">A lot of things were solved not by very legal ways, but as a child, this was life to me.</span> <span id="s125">There were a lot of children in the tenement constantly horsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me and, and, and disciplining me and getting ahead or going to the synagogue, nothing.</span> <span id="s126">It was a great freedom and I just enjoyed it very very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did you have a particularly close relationship with any of your father’s siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Any of my father’s brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mmm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Let’s see, did I?</span> <span id="s131">No, I really had a very, very good relationship with all of them, with practically all of them.</span> <span id="s132">And I cannot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly and interestingly, I spent the least time with him.</span> <span id="s133">He was a, just kind of a very outstanding figure, a tall, very mascular [sic] man who went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World War II and somehow worked for a shoe factory, which was a very famous shoe factory all over the world, Bata, got married there and came once to visit us and I still remember his visit.</span> <span id="s134">I was so impressed with him, with his, there was just an air about this man that impressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, when there was the big uprising, there was a big Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 1944, and he was an officer in the, in this uprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught him and he was hanged.</span> <span id="s135">So, we knew this for sure because his wife survived the war, he was a Gentile and he has two children living in Switzerland today.</span> <span id="s136">One, I’m sorry, one, the other one is a stepbrother.</span> <span id="s137">He has one and I met him and so I knew the story.</span> <span id="s138">But, this, this was the man who, to me, was an outstanding representative of my father’s side of family.</span> <span id="s139">But, today, there are only two men and one women [sic.]</span> <span id="s140">left of the thirteen.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, they’re in their late seventies, so, but on my mother’s side, no brothers, no brother, no sister, practically.</span> <span id="s142">I only have one cousin left on my mother’s side in Budapest today.</span> <span id="s143">He’s younger than I am, so, that’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: What were your, did you have particular interests as a child or special things that you liked to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I was an avid cyclist.</span> <span id="s146">I loved to, I loved to bicycle.</span> <span id="s147">I would come home from school and immediately take off and go, there was a big park, we lived near the, the, we lived on the Pest side and there was a so-called rose garden in the center of Pest and that’s where I met with my friends every afternoon.</span> <span id="s148">And we were comparing our bicycles.</span> <span id="s149">Bicycles were the same as cars today for us.</span> <span id="s150">I mean, it was, it was a thing and we admired the one who had the custom-made one or had just even custom-made parts, and so we had big races on bicycle and then that was it, so I was heartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take in when the Germans occupied Hungary was the bicycle and the radio.</span> <span id="s151">And I lost it.</span> <span id="s152">I also belonged to an underground Boy Scout group, I was an avid underground Boy Scout.</span> <span id="s153">The reason I say underground because we couldn’t be legal Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s154">The Boy Scout movement, which was based on brotherhood and equality of all, declared that Jews are not equal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organizations were disbanded and Jews were also thrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were not affiliated with some Jewish school or something.</span> <span id="s155">I belonged to the so-called Three-Hundred Ten, number Three-Hundred Ten Jokay Mór Boy Scout group.</span> <span id="s156">Jokay Mór was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist.</span> <span id="s157">He was not Jewish but he was a humanist.</span> <span id="s158">And we met illegally, sometimes in the basement of synagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, in one, the small groups consisted of about ten, between ten and fourteen people and so we just rotated and did all kinds of things, besides hiking, we were building model airplanes and did what, what Boy Scouts usually do, otherwise.</span> <span id="s159">I have always, always dreamt these days, I had always dreamt about one day having a uniform.</span> <span id="s160">The uniform was unbelievably important for me, like most kids of my age at that time.</span> <span id="s161">And I was always dreaming about it and at school, I just looked at my classmates who were, of course, Christians and could wear the uniform and just, I dreamt about that one day, I’m going to have a uniform and the sad thing is that after the war, when we met for the first time, those who survived in our group, and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most of us, it didn’t mean anything anymore.</span> <span id="s162">We were, it’s hard to say, either we were too old or too cynical by that time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did you attend a secular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, except my first fourth grades were in a, the Jewish orphanage ran a school, it was basically a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage was in charge in order to have enough money to raise the orphans.</span> <span id="s165">So the orphans lived in a dorm while we who were coming from the outside, we had to pay tuition.</span> <span id="s166">And it was nearby, I spent four years there and then, middle school.</span> <span id="s167">I went to a secular state school, middle school because it was exactly next door to my house.</span> <span id="s168">And then, of course, came the… 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn’t go to high school.</span> <span id="s169">There’s one incident in my middle school that I felt had very, very important consequences for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s170">We were, as basically innocents abroad, to the point where I really didn’t pay much attention to being Jewish or not Jewish until this incident happened.</span> <span id="s171">In fifth grade, it was an art class and my art teacher was drawing something on the blackboard and we had to copy it, exactly.</span> <span id="s172">And then color it exactly.</span> <span id="s173">And he came by and for some reason, I used a different kind of color or something and he always walked around with a huge cane, which was not unusual in those days for teachers because teachers… End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s175">And Mr. Holczer, I was just asking you about your education and you were going to tell me about an experience that you had that you said was very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and then for the rest of the class, class to copy it and color it.</span> <span id="s177">The, teacher came around and made sure that everybody’s following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means business, he had a big cane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors and used something different.</span> <span id="s178">He became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started to beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose.</span> <span id="s179">And I also became frantic seeing the blood coming from, from my nose and all this so I ran home.</span> <span id="s180">I mentioned before that I lived next to the school.</span> <span id="s181">The other house was where we lived, apartment house.</span> <span id="s182">And I ran up to my mother’s, into my mother’s arms and asked her to clean me up and come and basically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of eleven, I couldn’t believe that this is going to be the way it is.</span> <span id="s183">And I wanted her to come in and do something about it.</span> <span id="s184">And after she cleaned me up she said, “Now you must understand, a lot of things that you cannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for your behavior.”</span> <span id="s185">And I said, “What, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color,” and she said, “Well, you don’t understand just now.”</span> <span id="s186">[Clocks chiming] And the reason, what I left out was a very important thing.</span> <span id="s187">The teacher was yelling at me as I was running out of the class, “I hope you go to Palestine to sell oranges.</span> <span id="s188">That’s where you belong.”</span> <span id="s189">And so when I told my mother, this is when her reaction came.</span> <span id="s190">So she came back to school with me and instead of demanding some kind of a remedial action for this, apologized to the teacher.</span> <span id="s191">And I thought that was, that was a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s192">I didn’t understand at that time.</span> <span id="s193">I did understand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take.</span> <span id="s194">Obviously, she was afraid that maybe they will kick me out of school if she does something else.</span> <span id="s195">And every Jewish family, of course, wanted to have their son finish middle school.</span> <span id="s196">And that incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it created a mental block.</span> <span id="s197">I never drew or never painted in my life since.</span> <span id="s198">I am such idiot when it comes to, to do anything with my hands that involves drawing or painting that it is pathetic.</span> <span id="s199">When we play some games, for example, with my friends, when I have to draw something, they can’t believe that, they think my perception is that of a mentally retarded person and it is, it is just a, just a block.</span> <span id="s200">However, I appreciate art very much.</span> <span id="s201">I never fail to go and see an exhibit of paintings and drawings.</span> <span id="s202">I just don’t want to do it and I cannot do it myself.</span> <span id="s203">Now it’s possible that this can be unlocked in time but by that time I won’t be alive.</span> <span id="s204">So, I rather just leave this.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did you father care about this incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, my father was not around anymore.</span> <span id="s207">He heard it after the war and of course by that time, I could, I understood the whole situation better.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Was that the first instance of anti-Semitism that…</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: …Hit me for the first time?</span> <span id="s210">Well, the first one, I remember was when I was six and I was playing marbles with, with kids and I won.</span> <span id="s211">And one kid said, threw the marble down the gutter and said “I’d rather throw it down the gutter than to give it to a Jew.”</span> <span id="s212">And I went home and asked my mother, “What, what does it mean?”</span> <span id="s213">So, that really was the first time that something like this hit me.</span> <span id="s214">And since I went to a Jewish school for the first four years, I was not really exposed to things like this.</span> <span id="s215">But the minute I switched and in fifth grade, everything started.</span> <span id="s216">Luckily, there were some teachers of course, in our school who tried to make up for this.</span> <span id="s217">And I remember a couple of them.</span> <span id="s218">Unfortunately, they’re not alive anymore but they did everything possible to, to make our life a bit more civilized.</span> <span id="s219">And one of them was even fired because of that.</span> <span id="s220">But not everybody was like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: He was fired because he was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: He was very protective of, of Jewish children and he was also fired because we had a special subject called, how would I, how would I translate this, Defensive Studies, which meant, basically, kind of a ROTC type, except it was sheer propaganda.</span> <span id="s223">We had to, the book contained sentences that were so revolting as far as Hungary’s neighbors were concerned.</span> <span id="s224">For example, the Romanians were described as monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual level and, I mean, for every nationality that surrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory term.</span> <span id="s225">And, actually, the book was preparing you that one day we will get even.</span> <span id="s226">And what he was, among other things, he was teaching this subject, and he said, “Put the book away and let me tell you what life is about.”</span> <span id="s227">And it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture that he would give us every day.</span> <span id="s228">And, after the war, to our great satisfaction, but not surprise, he was named as the first director of the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences, so, he, they recognized him.</span> <span id="s229">And he was then, I talked to him later and he was in the Illegal Social Democratic Party, so that also helped him.</span> <span id="s230">But, there were teachers and I had a teacher, I don’t even know if he had any political conviction, but he was a human being and he always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in middle school, I had to go once a week to three hours of, of labor, battalion practice.</span> <span id="s231">This was one of the most humiliating experiences that anybody can have.</span> <span id="s232">They had the scum of earth in charge of us, it was not teachers or any… we had to report either at school or somewhere on the outskirts of Budapest to a practice ground where these hired instructors that were a lot worse than any drill instructor I have ever seen in any movie, any American movie, because it’s not that, it was not just the physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, but it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish this and a Jewish that, and these were people hired to do this job and besides of marching and, and digging and building, constantly, we were abused and constantly even physically so.</span> <span id="s233">Many times they beat us and all this.</span> <span id="s234">And we had to go there about three hours on a certain day.</span> <span id="s235">The Christians then went to three hours of practice of what you would call today ROTC.</span> <span id="s236">They had, they had marching drill practices and all this.</span> <span id="s237">But ours was completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: What year did that start?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: What year?</span> <span id="s240">Well, I was in fifth grade, right, so it was about 1940 when I entered the middle school.</span> <span id="s241">It was about 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: By that time, had any of the anti-Jewish legislation, I know there were a few things that Hungary had adopted, was that affecting your family at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in the family, such as my aunt, who was very young, one of my father’s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year old man.</span> <span id="s244">He was called up to go to the eastern front and, and he go into labor battalions, in ’41, I’m talking about ’41 because that’s when Germany declared war, Germany attacked the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s245">Immediately, the very young, I think twenty-one old Jewish men were called up.</span> <span id="s246">They had to go to a certain place in their own clothes.</span> <span id="s247">They didn’t get any uniform, anything, and taken to the eastern front immediately for mine, got to, to pick up mines, okay?</span> <span id="s248">And many of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how to do it, of course, blew up.</span> <span id="s249">Now, the reason I am mentioning this because my father’s sister who was very young and married to a young man, interestingly, when he was taken to the front, for some reason, somebody made a mistake and his unit was issued Hungarian army uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: This is her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Her husband, yes, okay.</span> <span id="s252">And he then went to the photographer for something and just had a picture taken, proudly posing in a Hungarian military uniform, he sent home.</span> <span id="s253">By the time, the picture arrived at home, he was dead.</span> <span id="s254">He was blown up on a mine.</span> <span id="s255">And this picture initiated a whole avalanche of events in our family because my aunt who was an extremely shrewd person, used this picture to start, to basic… declaring herself first as half-Jewish, which was an exceptional position then.</span> <span id="s256">And as the Nuremburg laws were tightened more and more so, she took one more step and one more step and one more step in pushing this whole idea that she’s not really under this category of the Nuremburg laws.</span> <span id="s257">And it, the whole thing accelerated to the point where the last, when the only way she could be declared an exceptional person, as they were called, which means that you’re not considered Jewish, was to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene I remember: her taking my grandmother down and my grandmother had to, under oath, sign an affidavit that she is an, she was an illegitimate child because my grandmother was cleaning house for a lawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by that time, a bachelor.</span> <span id="s258">And she signed this affidavit which made her a, a Christian.</span> <span id="s259">And with a husband who died in military uniform, so he was obviously a Christian, with her mother signing this affidavit that she was illegitimate, and the father was a Christian, she practically cleared herself and then set out to save the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s260">And, as I mentioned to you before, she did an excellent job up until 1944, October, that was the point where nobody could do anything anymore because hell broke loose in Hungary and the scum of earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow Cross Party took over and ruled from October 15th until January 18th when Pest was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Back in the beginnings of the war, when there were, did your, did your family experience economic hardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s263">Obviously, everybody experienced this because the men were away and there were very, very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family.</span> <span id="s264">And so a lot of people were actually either starving, or the mother had to go and look for a job, or if the children were old enough, they had to go and work and do something.</span> <span id="s265">We were in a very good position, my mother and I, for a while, because my father’s employer felt obligated to send us part of his regular monthly salary, so we did get money.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Let’s come back to that and first, if you would, tell me how your father was taken away and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Okay, my father was taken away several times.</span> <span id="s268">You know, Hungary was kind of a strange part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews.</span> <span id="s269">They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do.</span> <span id="s270">So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary’s a very small country and you don’t have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior, or something.</span> <span id="s271">So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives.</span> <span id="s272">Because somehow that was below the dignity of that class.</span> <span id="s273">Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British.</span> <span id="s274">And so in between, it depended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country.</span> <span id="s275">Some of them were a little bit more German-oriented than others.</span> <span id="s276">And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because the Germans didn’t like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion.</span> <span id="s277">My father was in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so we could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let’s say, forty-five can go home.</span> <span id="s278">So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s279">Up until 1944, March, when the Germans marched into Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: So when your father was called to be taken away . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was.</span> <span id="s282">I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, for a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released, we could walk around a little bit.</span> <span id="s283">And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him.</span> <span id="s284">Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good.</span> <span id="s285">For some reason, and I cannot really remember exactly what happened and why.</span> <span id="s286">We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s287">I remember, even then, they, they were told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we could talk over a few things.</span> <span id="s288">And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years until he came back after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And he, where did he go exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: He went to, he was in a copper mine in Bor, B, O, R which is I think the nearest is Niš which is Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s291">And he was there, he was always telling me about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them.</span> <span id="s292">They had Croats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, I’ve forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians.</span> <span id="s293">And he mentioned when he came home, interestingly, he said, “Son,” he said, “we never, we never really worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians.”</span> <span id="s294">He said, “We had never seen such beasts as the Croatian SS was.”</span> <span id="s295">They called them Ustašas, you know.</span> <span id="s296">He was there and I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my memory, I think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was when, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans decided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern Yugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up these slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp ___________ were killed and my father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by Tito’s partisans.</span> <span id="s297">And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans, he could work for the partisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over, they said.</span> <span id="s298">And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they saved his life and he volunteered to work.</span> <span id="s299">So he worked in a flour mill somewhere around and came home with all kinds of documents and, and little medals that testified to the fact that he was a good worker and did his share.</span> <span id="s300">And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to eradicate any of the memories attached to Tito, unfortunately we had to burn everything and we had to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito.</span> <span id="s301">People were hanged all the time without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you.</span> <span id="s302">So, he was very bitter about this, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s303">He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he lived today.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Let’s stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: I would like to ask, you were just describing your, your father’s experience in Bor and I wonder if when he was taken away to Bor if that, you and your mother and your father were recognizing that this was going to be the big one, as it were and if you can recall that separation and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed.</span> <span id="s308">But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died?</span> <span id="s309">And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, “Son, there were two kinds of people in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s310">We got a canteen of water every morning.</span> <span id="s311">The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves.”</span> <span id="s312">And I said, “Half a canteen of water would make you clean?”</span> <span id="s313">He said, “No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself.”</span> <span id="s314">And he said, “And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I’m not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I’m still caring about myself.”</span> <span id="s315">So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I’m sure, that was who survived.</span> <span id="s316">And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn’t like your face or the way they moved.</span> <span id="s317">Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he’s going to return, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn’t have heard from him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefield.</span> <span id="s318">It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home.</span> <span id="s319">And he came home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, “Here I am.”</span> <span id="s320">He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that.</span> <span id="s321">He sent a friend up.</span> <span id="s322">A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, “When did you hear from him?”</span> <span id="s323">and all this, and “Do you think he’s alive?”</span> <span id="s324">and all this, and slowly he said, “Well, I have a feeling that he is alive,” and slowly he led us to this.</span> <span id="s325">I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack.</span> <span id="s326">The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes.</span> <span id="s327">And he knew that we were starving and so that was it.</span> <span id="s328">Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because you could not stay in your apartment.</span> <span id="s329">You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s330">And because of the history of this house, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first.</span> <span id="s331">So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to leave your apartment.</span> <span id="s332">We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said “We will keep this for you, and keep this for you,” and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again.</span> <span id="s333">Or resurfaced again.</span> <span id="s334">They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything.</span> <span id="s335">It’s all disappeared, and what could you do about it?</span> <span id="s336">You said okay.</span> <span id="s337">But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take.</span> <span id="s338">And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish apartments were given to bomb those people whose… Gentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn’t live in anymore.</span> <span id="s339">And I had no idea of course what happened to our apartment.</span> <span id="s340">We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 66, and I, my first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left.</span> <span id="s341">We just, we couldn’t do anything with it, so.</span> <span id="s342">And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I’m going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I’m going to give them two hours to get out of here.</span> <span id="s343">And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here.</span> <span id="s344">And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two sons.</span> <span id="s345">And they were tailors.</span> <span id="s346">And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said, “But, but, where can we go?”</span> <span id="s347">And I said, “Why did you come here?”</span> <span id="s348">And he said, “Well, we have, we have no place.</span> <span id="s349">Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a Jewish apartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January,” so he said, “Could, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?”</span> <span id="s350">And so my mother came up and she said, “Why can’t we just divide the place between us?”</span> <span id="s351">And here it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me.</span> <span id="s352">My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we’ll, we’ll make it.</span> <span id="s353">And so we lived there under the same roof and we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s354">And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace.</span> <span id="s355">They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized.</span> <span id="s356">And my father was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime.</span> <span id="s357">And next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women who died one after another.</span> <span id="s358">It was a, like a Salvation Army place.</span> <span id="s359">They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I’m sorry I lost contact with them.</span> <span id="s360">But then, we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people.</span> <span id="s361">So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn’t speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept.</span> <span id="s362">And she said, “I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace.”</span> <span id="s363">And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time.</span> <span id="s364">And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets.</span> <span id="s365">Now one day we came home and my mother said, “This, this place smells like cologne water, very good cologne water,” and she rushed to her cologne water in the armoir but these two Siberians, Russians were very hard pressed to get alcohol, anything, they would drink.</span> <span id="s366">I mean, there were stories that I can’t believe, that they went to the museum and drank alcohol out of these scientific lab experiments and—including embryos—but I never believed those stories, but this is true.</span> <span id="s367">They drank my mother’s cologne water.</span> <span id="s368">They were so, so hard pressed for alcohol.</span> <span id="s369">And that was about our only experience with Russians in our house.</span> <span id="s370">Otherwise, most people lost their watches.</span> <span id="s371">They were very hard pressed for watches.</span> <span id="s372">It was a time when nobody in his right mind would walk around in Budapest with a watch on his wrist.</span> <span id="s373">They just, they were fascinated.</span> <span id="s374">They stop you and they took your watch.</span> <span id="s375">That was their, their, their thing.</span> <span id="s376">Well, anyway, okay, ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So the Russians had moved into your apartment then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yeah, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: During the German occupation, this was before. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s381">This was during the Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Oh, after.</span> <span id="s383">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s385">I’m talking about after, this all happened after.</span> <span id="s386">Oh no, there were no Russians during the German occupation.</span> <span id="s387">I wish there were.</span> <span id="s388">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: I wanted to go back just a little . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: …bit, I had, I had wanted to ask you about when you were younger as a child and you were in school, were your friends mostly Jewish . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Or did you share . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s395">Mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s396">There were a few Gentile friends who never, ever mentioned religion, never really made us feel inferior, just a few.</span> <span id="s397">And after the war, I made it clear how much I appreciated it.</span> <span id="s398">So, I’m glad that I could do that.</span> <span id="s399">Now, I also have to say that not many of my classmates survived because my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they were working outside Budapest on the day when the deportations came to that village.</span> <span id="s400">And the gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and they decided not to let them go home but deport them.</span> <span id="s401">So very few Jewish classmates of mine survived.</span> <span id="s402">Gentiles, again, the war, the army eventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the last few months, the Arrow Cross people, they forced children out into the street with a gun.</span> <span id="s403">So quite a few of them did not survive.</span> <span id="s404">I really had very few contact with, with, with the few that survived but there weren’t too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: And you had mentioned that your father’s employer was helping you and your mother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s407">Yes.</span> <span id="s408">Yes.</span> <span id="s409">And my father was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And so the help that he gave you then during the time that your father was away was enough for you and your mother to… [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s412">I also took a job.</span> <span id="s413">I was a messenger boy up until 19… until the yellow star came into existence… ’44 March.</span> <span id="s414">I was a messenger boy for architectural firm.</span> <span id="s415">Because of the bicycle.</span> <span id="s416">I could bicycle around then, so I was delivering messages and things.</span> <span id="s417">So, that supplemented also, my father’s salary which wasn’t a full salary, just part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: And as the war progressed, was the next significant event then, would have been the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">1944, March, if I remember it, 19th, is when the Germans had serious doubts apparently, that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the idea of getting out of the war because by that time I think Romania was ready to jump and the situation in Italy was very shaky so they decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in a very right-wing government which was still a lot better than what came in 1944, October.</span> <span id="s421">That will be the other stage.</span> <span id="s422">But let’s take a look at what happened when the Germans marched in, the yellow star had to be worn within a few weeks, or… So, the labor battalions were more intensified.</span> <span id="s423">Now everybody who was eighteen had to go, that was now, they lowered the limit and the deportations started.</span> <span id="s424">So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing, the deportations.</span> <span id="s425">They started in the countryside, eventually coming to Budapest.</span> <span id="s426">They were supposed to come to Budapest, you know, by the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: You mentioned that your friends were deported one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: How did you manage to avoid being deported yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt, the one who gained this special status, said to me, “Please, I just have some very bad feelings, I don’t want you to go today out and work.</span> <span id="s431">Stay home, stay with me.”</span> <span id="s432">She took me to her apartment and that was the day when it happened.</span> <span id="s433">It was just a, just a miraculous instinct that she had.</span> <span id="s434">And that is what saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the German occupation did you feel, were you able to feed yourself and your mother adequately?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, what I did was, I gathered, I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found that the best way to do this whole thing is first to get some papers that would qualify us—at least to those who don’t know us—as Christians.</span> <span id="s437">So I took my mother’s jewellries, sold it, and bought papers.</span> <span id="s438">And the papers were blank and you had to fill it out.</span> <span id="s439">And I did that.</span> <span id="s440">Also, I got some papers and I fill it out with the same name from a cousin of mine who was adopted but had birth certificate and everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a Gentile.</span> <span id="s441">And his parents gave me his papers too so I had kind of this double insurance, moving around, in case I needed it.</span> <span id="s442">For a while, I did not use these papers.</span> <span id="s443">I waited until, you know, we got the point where it was necessary.</span> <span id="s444">Also, there was a danger that until the Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find out if you had false birth certificates.</span> <span id="s445">All they had to do is call the principality, you know, and that, that municipality and check, okay?</span> <span id="s446">And so, actually, we waited until practically the first village fell and, after that, it was much easier to fill it out, to a town or a village that had, that was already occupied under occu… Soviet occupation because they couldn’t check anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And after that point, did you use those papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we were moving a lot.</span> <span id="s449">First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my father’s friends.</span> <span id="s450">They were Seventh-Day Adventists.</span> <span id="s451">And they offered their place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we left.</span> <span id="s452">Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, hearing, feeling, looking, what can happen?</span> <span id="s453">Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews.</span> <span id="s454">They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment.</span> <span id="s455">And it is possible that something that was safe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when he was walking down the street, going into places, “Here is a Jew, doesn’t wear a yellow star, what is he doing?”</span> <span id="s456">And so, your life depended on nuances, those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So you just took off the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the yellow star and said, “You stay with me,” and then my mother came there, too.</span> <span id="s459">And this is how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street, One, in the Fifth District of Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Now, I think before you even moved into that house, there had been a lot of Allied bombings . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Had there not?</span> <span id="s463">Of Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So where were you during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well, we, whenever there was a, up until we had to leave our own apartment, when there was a bombing we lived in the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours.</span> <span id="s467">But usually, the bombings came at night, so, I, one thing that war taught me how to be very organized because there was no light.</span> <span id="s468">You couldn’t turn on the light.</span> <span id="s469">No, that was a major offense.</span> <span id="s470">If they saw any light, when the sirens went off, they, they considered you collaborating with the, with the enemy, you know, giving signals.</span> <span id="s471">So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the darkness I could pick every one of my clothes and still do, to run down.</span> <span id="s472">We had seconds to run down in the bombing, started.</span> <span id="s473">Usually, there was no really intense bombing of Budapest.</span> <span id="s474">Most of the bombers, many times, Americans, were flying over to Romania, to Ploeşti, to bomb the oil fields.</span> <span id="s475">There was really not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very badly bombed.</span> <span id="s476">Budapest was, Budapest was mainly destroyed during that siege from December until January 18.</span> <span id="s477">That was the main reason for the destruction.</span> <span id="s478">But before that, there was not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: So, when was it that you moved in with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know.</span> <span id="s481">Late fall that… when we felt that that place was the best place to be.</span> <span id="s482">And then it turned out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there was a famous Hungarian psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s483">Psychiatry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early stage.</span> <span id="s484">This man became very famous and since there weren’t too many, a great deal of his clientele were famous politicians, actors, actresses, writers.</span> <span id="s485">So he was well-known all over the place and he had this idea that he is going to save his family and friends by number one, contacting a fascist officer and I’ve no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is willing to play this game of declaring the house a clinic and, and do everything possible to save the people inside the house and then he found this man and his name was Jereczian Ara George.</span> <span id="s486">And this is in reverse order because Hungarian names are in reverse order.</span> <span id="s487">The last name is what we consider first so in English you would say George Ara Jereczian.</span> <span id="s488">The, I remember him, a very handsome man, a very, kind of a man of stature and a fascist uniform, hand grenades hanging from his belt.</span> <span id="s489">I mean, he was intimidating to anyone.</span> <span id="s490">To, with us, he was very kind.</span> <span id="s491">The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and families in that apartment house jammed, absolutely jammed.</span> <span id="s492">While we could still live upstairs, probably there were at least five to ten people to a room.</span> <span id="s493">When we lived in the basement, no one is to tell, we were just side by side on mattresses because when the siege of Budapest started, you couldn’t live upstairs anymore.</span> <span id="s494">So this man moved in with a few of his men who apparently were loyal to him and his girlfriend and they set up their headquarters there and they were practically like a, a, a support group.</span> <span id="s495">The clinic had its official emblem there and the whole operation looked like it was a legal operation to save anybody who is injured.</span> <span id="s496">‘Kay?</span> <span id="s497">Now, we’re at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Why don’t we pause here?</span> <span id="s499">I’d like to ask you some more . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s503">We’re on tape two, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s504">And if we can just go back a little bit and I’d like to know something about during the, you mentioned that you stopped going to school at a certain point and I wanted to hear about what you did with your days at that time.</span> <span id="s505">When was that exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me.</span> <span id="s507">After I finished what would be eighth grade here, it was the fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they call gymnasium, which is high school in Europe.</span> <span id="s508">I could not get into a high school and so it was not a long period but between 1944, I have to figure this out.</span> <span id="s509">Let’s see, 1925, 40, right.</span> <span id="s510">So there was a year, ’43 because I was, I left the school, ’43 so I had one year when actually I didn’t do much except odd jobs.</span> <span id="s511">My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I delivered, worked for an architectural firm and delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I could not get into high school.</span> <span id="s512">The higher four grades of high school, the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s513">And so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high school, I wouldn’t miss much.</span> <span id="s514">And this is why I had a private tutor.</span> <span id="s515">I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I, war would be over—we were always optimists—and I could go to, instead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem.</span> <span id="s516">So for Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother’s distant family, who lived in Budapest.</span> <span id="s517">And this is how the year went by.</span> <span id="s518">There was really not much else, a little work and a little study.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother aware of the so-called Final Solution and what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s521">My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what happened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by the that time it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations end up.</span> <span id="s522">So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can’t change and she still has to live for her own little immediate family.</span> <span id="s523">But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware.</span> <span id="s524">And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC.</span> <span id="s525">And I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio.</span> <span id="s526">He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors and he would listen to BBC.</span> <span id="s527">At a very early age and would tell me that this is the truth.</span> <span id="s528">Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people who listened to foreign broadcasts.</span> <span id="s529">And it was punishable also by going to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And yet, despite your awareness of what was happening elsewhere in Europe, you and your mother remained, or at least your mother remained optimistic enough to find you a tutor and to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s532">Yes.</span> <span id="s533">[talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that people in boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right?</span> <span id="s534">It’s just that, this part of the, of the optimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn.</span> <span id="s535">That was with us.</span> <span id="s536">That kind of a feeling never left us and we never really gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Was your tutor Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s539">She was.</span> <span id="s540">And she was just a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I eventually met her when I was in Israel, again.</span> <span id="s541">She emigrated to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And, were, well let’s just go forth to the, okay, let’s go back to your, your home with your aunt that you had moved into several months after the German occupation and you had begun to describe to me this house, and the man who had been a member of Arrow Cross who had established it as a clinic.</span> <span id="s543">And as, as it was established as a clinic, did the same people who had been living in it before, did some of them move out or have to leave or just more people came?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean, anybody who would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s545">And it was, to most people, it was clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated.</span> <span id="s546">There was no other way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it?</span> <span id="s547">They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted another week or so.</span> <span id="s548">The lucky thing is that they just ran out of time.</span> <span id="s549">I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous Hungarian doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Before the house was established as a clinic . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: It was a Jewish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: It was a Jewish house . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s554">It was a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s555">It had, it was a designated Jewish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And who was living in your aunt’s apartment with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family.</span> <span id="s558">Some other aunts and brothers of my father, my mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment and there were plenty of people in it.</span> <span id="s559">But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you know.</span> <span id="s560">We could, we could sleep very well.</span> <span id="s561">There were a lot worse arrangements in Budapest at that time.</span> <span id="s562">There were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near the Danube, where, I understand, people couldn’t even sleep.</span> <span id="s563">They just were, you know, practically back to back in a room, there were so many people jammed in.</span> <span id="s564">This is the one that Wallen… what was his name, the Swedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his little area, Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s565">But I never, I went a couple of times by, but I never went up but I noticed that there just, there were just lots of lots of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And then this house, before it was established as a clinic, were there non-Jews living as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s568">Yes.</span> <span id="s569">And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed there.</span> <span id="s570">They just stayed there.</span> <span id="s571">By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that, since the war inevitably is coming to an end, it’s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come.</span> <span id="s572">So that must have been their reasoning.</span> <span id="s573">And it was not, not impractical, actually.</span> <span id="s574">At the same time, even in the last week, we were in danger of being taken to the Danube, that was the, the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered outside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the river.</span> <span id="s575">It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter and the Danube was red and full of corpses.</span> <span id="s576">But I remember that even the last week, somebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist authorities and they came and tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George’s own people in the house, the bodyguards.</span> <span id="s577">And he seemed, he almost seemed helpless.</span> <span id="s578">We were already lined up and then he again arrived there, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special higher authority that said, “Clear out of here.</span> <span id="s579">This is a protected territory and we do our job for the government and leave us alone.”</span> <span id="s580">We confronted the man after the war.</span> <span id="s581">I know that.</span> <span id="s582">He was caught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week before Budapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers.</span> <span id="s583">I also remember another man who was a fascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite antagonistic toward us and we were worried about him.</span> <span id="s584">And also the last week, they brought him in with a head injury.</span> <span id="s585">He was shot in the head in the street fighting.</span> <span id="s586">There was tremendous street fighting and he was just left there to die.</span> <span id="s587">And I don’t know, I was just fascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was always afraid of and here he was, basically a nothing anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s588">And in spite of my good judgement, I watched him, kept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was dying.</span> <span id="s589">And I can’t, I still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn’t look at another human being, even an animal that is dying.</span> <span id="s590">But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me of revenge and satisfaction that this scum is, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to see how he was going.</span> <span id="s591">And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was taking me back to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was.</span> <span id="s592">But, there, there were incidents like this and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy.</span> <span id="s593">My job was basically to take legs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called operating room which was a, a dark part of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s594">And when in, when in January 18th, we went up, upstairs, everybody was horrified.</span> <span id="s595">There were huge piles of limbs just piled up on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s596">And most of it, I had to pile up because I was the one who was always sent up with these.</span> <span id="s597">The doctors operated without any anesthesis [sic], anything.</span> <span id="s598">There were, there were, there was nothing and it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know.</span> <span id="s599">But that, whenever I look into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive.</span> <span id="s600">We die but they keep their secrets.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Had any of the other people who were living in your aunt’s apartment, did they have papers, false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father’s brothers wore the uniform of a military police and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers’ neighborhood, they got papers and they got uniforms.</span> <span id="s603">They were supplied with everything, both of them.</span> <span id="s604">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Were you using your papers at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers.</span> <span id="s607">That was the only time I used mine.</span> <span id="s608">And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn’t mean anything if they stopped a man because they didn’t even ask for papers.</span> <span id="s609">They asked for you to drop your pants.</span> <span id="s610">And since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to detect who was a Jew.</span> <span id="s611">And I have to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who, amazingly appeared at the time when I thought that this was my last moment on earth.</span> <span id="s612">I was sent out to get something, I think, if I remember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell on the street from shrapnels and we needed some meat.</span> <span id="s613">And the only kind of meat, whenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was horsemeat.</span> <span id="s614">And of fallen horses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes.</span> <span id="s615">Airplanes flew very low and they were just machine-gunning anything that moved.</span> <span id="s616">And I always ran out and I also crawled out to get water.</span> <span id="s617">There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you could get some water.</span> <span id="s618">And a patrol came and caught me and they said, “Okay, here, come, come into the doorway of this house,” and they were shouting, yelling, “This looks like a Jew and took off your pants, take off your pants,” and they give me the order and I was kind of snow-white probably and shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher rank came and said to the guys, “Look, I see four, five Jews on that corner.</span> <span id="s619">Go immediately, see, catch those, I take care of this idiot here.</span> <span id="s620">And so we went under the doorway and I was unbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking and he said, “Listen,” he said, “are you crazy?”</span> <span id="s621">He said, “I don’t know where you come from, do you have a place where you were staying?”</span> <span id="s622">I said yes.</span> <span id="s623">He said, he said, “Go back and I don’t ever want to see you again on the street.”</span> <span id="s624">And we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people, “This idiot, he’s not a Jew,” he said, “he’s an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a hero apparently.</span> <span id="s625">Go back to your mother and don’t ever leave the house.”</span> <span id="s626">And I told my mother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave the place, under no circumstances.</span> <span id="s627">And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were liberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint committee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency supplies, food supplies, they were bringing them in.</span> <span id="s628">And who was at the door letting people in?</span> <span id="s629">I recognized this man.</span> <span id="s630">And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his lapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem.</span> <span id="s631">And I said to him, I said, “Hey, you know, you saved my life?”</span> <span id="s632">And he looked at me, he said, “You too?”</span> <span id="s633">He said, “There were many more.”</span> <span id="s634">And turned—he didn’t really want me to elaborate or nothing.</span> <span id="s635">And there were many people like this.</span> <span id="s636">Now who they were, I was very curious and I went to find out and most of the people who were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot of them had very fair complexions.</span> <span id="s637">They were blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned enough Hungarian, and good Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there were other people in the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in the Arrow Cross movement.</span> <span id="s638">And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: How did you get food during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: During the siege?</span> <span id="s641">Well, during the siege . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Well, I’m sorry, not only during the siege but during the time of the establishment of the clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man I told you who saved us, he had good source of supply.</span> <span id="s644">So, there was always a center of supply.</span> <span id="s645">The only thing that we could not get was of course, what did we get, flour and beans.</span> <span id="s646">These were the two and soya.</span> <span id="s647">People made, there was incredible things out of soyabeans.</span> <span id="s648">I have great respect for soyabeans.</span> <span id="s649">They made sausage, they made, you name it, and it all tasted like real sausage or soyabread was marvelous.</span> <span id="s650">And they made bread of rice and just invented all kinds of things that they had never eaten before.</span> <span id="s651">But the, the big thing was meat.</span> <span id="s652">Everybody wanted to have meat so we always watched out, looked out for horses, horses.</span> <span id="s653">And you should have seen, when a horse fell on the street, ah, everybody was running with huge knives and carving it out and running back into the basement because . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: People wearing the stars at that time?</span> <span id="s655">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore stars.</span> <span id="s657">Okay?</span> <span id="s658">Nobody, that was a taboo.</span> <span id="s659">No.</span> <span id="s660">And that was his order.</span> <span id="s661">‘Kay?</span> <span id="s662">We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us, it was not true, it was just to boost our confidence but by that time there was such confusion everywhere, in higher government places that who, who knows what was really the truth and what was not?</span> <span id="s663">Only he can.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: So he would distribute the food and then everybody would take it back to their apartments…</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s666">We did, we had pretty good organization.</span> <span id="s667">No, he was the one who secured the food by, you know, sending a contingent of people to, to get it and then we brought it back and then we, we divided it.</span> <span id="s668">He had his little place there and he was just, these are all intelligent people and very disciplined people.</span> <span id="s669">He did not have to go down personally and do anything, really.</span> <span id="s670">All we needed him for is to, to, to help us survive, to, to protect us from the outside world.</span> <span id="s671">But inside, we organized everything ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Was everybody who lived in the building in some way involved [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Some way, yes.</span> <span id="s674">Yes.</span> <span id="s675">They had to.</span> <span id="s676">They had to, they did something.</span> <span id="s677">Okay, at least, if nothing else on paper.</span> <span id="s678">My mother was a nurse, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And your only job was to take these limbs?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Well, I was, what they called, I was a messenger, you know, I was an errand boy.</span> <span id="s681">I was fifteen, and so, that was, I had a little uniform and a gray overall with a, kind of a military cap.</span> <span id="s682">But I was in charge of taking the, the severed things up.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Did you have any friends in the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend.</span> <span id="s685">And it was the first time in my life that I really felt a sexual attraction toward a woman.</span> <span id="s686">And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I. And I think under different circumstances, probably, we would have been much cozier but it was, there were too many people around.</span> <span id="s687">I liked her.</span> <span id="s688">She was a, believe it or not, there was a, among other things, there was a famous Hungarian Jewish comedian who also ended up in our, in our place.</span> <span id="s689">Alphonso.</span> <span id="s690">And this was the other half of his act, a young woman.</span> <span id="s691">And we became good friends and I had all kinds of fantasies about her and maybe she, too, about me.</span> <span id="s692">But my mother was around and too many people and so our attraction never really came to anything else, but just that.</span> <span id="s693">But we spent a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a nice puppy love, I think, that I’ve had for the first time in my life with an older, somebody was at that time older, not too old.</span> <span id="s694">I think she was in her early twenties or so, but I was just fifteen.</span> <span id="s695">And the, I also had a strange relationship with an Italian girl.</span> <span id="s696">The Italian government of Badoglio (ph), that was his name, his Air Force chief I think, or Air Force minister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when things got very hot in Italy, he brought her back to Hungary because he felt that in Hungary she has a better chance of survival, being the wife of the famous Italian Air Force general.</span> <span id="s697">In Italy, everybody knew that she was Jewish and they were afraid of deportation.</span> <span id="s698">So, and he had a daughter, and somehow I had a lot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest, the Italian embassy maintained a school.</span> <span id="s699">And I fell in love with this girl.</span> <span id="s700">And the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the stupid I did was, during the terrible, during those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some food like horsemeat or something, I would walk, they lived about a half an hour from our house and I would walk on the street, of course walk, try to run from one block to another, very close to the walls to deliver food to this girl and to her mother.</span> <span id="s701">And, and I felt that this was my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">End of tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s704">Am I pronouncing your name correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Holczer.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Holczer.</span> <span id="s707">Holczer.</span> <span id="s708">I’m interested in hearing, you were just describing some of your friendships to me and I’m interested in hearing what you did for entertainment, how you, if you managed to find any games to play or ways to have fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not play any games because the day went by with constantly watching out to survive.</span> <span id="s710">We watched the streets, we listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s711">I remember that I was terribly concerned with the expression of adults around me, I watched their faces.</span> <span id="s712">I always suspected that they know more than what they would tell me and somehow, in the last few weeks, I just became obsessed with, with this business of survival.</span> <span id="s713">I couldn’t think of anything else and my uncle, who is, the one who is still alive, reminded me that my constant question to him was, practically hourly, “How long will this last?</span> <span id="s714">How long will this last?”</span> <span id="s715">This was my constant question.</span> <span id="s716">I was just counting the hours.</span> <span id="s717">We knew that the, that the streetfighting between the Germans and the Russians cannot be more than a couple of city blocks away.</span> <span id="s718">We saw German soldiers, injured, moving down the street and we heard, practically, the gunfire as if it were next to us.</span> <span id="s719">Some people came in injured who reported that just a couple of blocks from us there were already Russian soldiers so it was that, that, that tension that kept me from doing anything else except just waiting for that final onslaught when I can see that our area is liberated.</span> <span id="s720">There was just no mood for playing.</span> <span id="s721">We were not children.</span> <span id="s722">None of us were children.</span> <span id="s723">We were, all our conversations, I remember, with the, with the kids of my age down there, all, everything was always revolving around survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: So even before the, the actual siege you didn’t have?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, i still contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comrades, they were the ones that I kept up with.</span> <span id="s726">But once of course, the siege started then, there was no chance to, to go out and do anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: So some of your, your Boy Scout comrades had escaped the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Oh yes, well, remember these were not school, these were not school people, I told you that.</span> <span id="s729">No, these are all from various, the Boy Scout group, the membership consisted of people from anywhere in Budapest and for various areas and quite a few of them survived.</span> <span id="s730">So, even after the war, of course, we met for awhile and then we decided there is nothing in it for us anymore and that’s when I joined the Zionist Movement.</span> <span id="s731">That gave me a lot more important goals than the Boy Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: The, the Boy Scouts, your friends from the Boy Scouts weren’t in the ghetto then.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: No.</span> <span id="s734">Some of them did go in, you know, some of them did go in.</span> <span id="s735">But others weren’t.</span> <span id="s736">And so we communicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: You would go to each other’s home?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s739">Yes.</span> <span id="s740">Strictly, you know, strictly so.</span> <span id="s741">We didn’t want any conversation, any, any public place that can be overheard.</span> <span id="s742">Because our main concern was the kind of topic that others shouldn’t hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Such as what?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Well, where are the Russian forces?</span> <span id="s745">What did you hear?</span> <span id="s746">All this.</span> <span id="s747">What did the radio say?</span> <span id="s748">We didn’t have any radios, the Jews, right?</span> <span id="s749">But those who were hiding, and were perhaps with a Christian family, they could still listen to BBC so that was the, the entire existence was the war and the topics were just that.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Now the, the clinic, what, who were the people that the clinic would treat?</span> <span id="s751">Was it just anyone who would happen to be injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat fascist officials according to all the papers and the, the permit that our leader, you know, had.</span> <span id="s753">But there was such chaos in the last few weeks, you know, when the siege of Budapest started, that we treated everybody who came in from the street who was injured.</span> <span id="s754">And it was pathetic, sometimes, that people would come in with some very minor problems and leave the clinic, and within minutes they were brought back with, with practically their guts out.</span> <span id="s755">In other words, in order to reach us, they went through such danger that they lost their lives, eventually.</span> <span id="s756">We had, we had no medicine left, we had practically nothing.</span> <span id="s757">So we couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s758">Anybody, anybody was treated.</span> <span id="s759">And doctors are doctors.</span> <span id="s760">I was always interested in, especially when there was a fascist official, what did they do to him?</span> <span id="s761">Would they take advantage of the fact that here we are, you know, lost all family members and all this, but I talked to, this interested me and I talked to some of the doctors and they said there’s no such thing, a doctor cannot do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Did the clinic work with any of the other rescue organizations in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s764">By that time, there was no contact, nothing.</span> <span id="s765">Everybody’s out for, for itself.</span> <span id="s766">There was, there was just, everything collapsed.</span> <span id="s767">The streets were ruled by twelve year old children with submachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never amounted to anything, and this was their way to get their revenge.</span> <span id="s768">They were shooting first, truly and asking questions after.</span> <span id="s769">It was, it was the, a total reign of terror.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: What about before the siege, siege?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross movement took over on October 15, the, they started.</span> <span id="s772">It was just as bad.</span> <span id="s773">And the minute the admiral who was the head of Hungary, Admiral Horthy finished his speech in which he announced that as far as he was concerned the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s774">He was arrested, his bodyguards were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And you, as soon as that, that date, October 15, you just didn’t go outside anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house, the story I told you began to get, take shape, okay?</span> <span id="s777">This was when we kind of put our heads together and we learned that this psychiatrist is taking steps to bring this man in and all this.</span> <span id="s778">We had to act very quickly because events were really coming to an end.</span> <span id="s779">The Russians were approaching Budapest rapidly and we knew that again, that gives the, these guys very little time to kill all of us.</span> <span id="s780">And they were getting more and more vicious, amazingly.</span> <span id="s781">Instead of saving their skin, they became even more violent.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Okay, so, before the siege, and you were sometimes going out . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: You would deliver messages?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s786">I had, you know, the uniform and the ID and all this.</span> <span id="s787">I was sent to get our rations, you know, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine.</span> <span id="s788">Yeah, I was just a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: But you had no contact with the Red Cross or with the different legations.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, we had some, some very vague contact with the Red Cross, I probably picked up medicine from them or something for the, for the organization.</span> <span id="s791">But personally, I had no as a, as an individual, I had no contact other than with the, just with the Swiss Embassy.</span> <span id="s792">I told you I had a Switz, Swiss schutzpass, that by the time the Arrow Cross movement started, meant very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: How did you, how did you get that schutzpässe?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Well, you could go to the Swedish Embassy or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you on the list and eventually would give it to you.</span> <span id="s795">And it was really just a, kind of a, a smokescreen.</span> <span id="s796">There was not much, if you were lucky, they respected it and they let you go.</span> <span id="s797">If you were unlucky, they just tore it apart and said, “Step into the wagon,” you know, and you were gone.</span> <span id="s798">You could never, never know.</span> <span id="s799">It, those embassies issued this in good faith but the people who looked at it, you were at the mercy of those.</span> <span id="s800">And I just happened to go to the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and then probably you heard the story, the Japanese, it was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I think it was in Lithuania or somewhere, did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: So, in Hungary, it was mainly the Swedish and the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican too.</span> <span id="s803">There was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a collaborator.</span> <span id="s804">He did not really act very courageously under the Nazi era.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Do you remember when the siege began?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s807">It was in December, if I know, December 20th or something, very close to Christmas.</span> <span id="s808">That’s when it… really, it just, all of a sudden we were shot at from every direction.</span> <span id="s809">We knew that Budapest was totally surrounded.</span> <span id="s810">The airplanes were just coming day and night.</span> <span id="s811">They were called ratas, R, A, T, A, these small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything on the street that moved.</span> <span id="s812">It was very dangerous to get out on the street.</span> <span id="s813">And of course, then, when it came to night, anybody was moving could have been also shot by the fascists, by the Arrow Cross people, ‘cause they were also moving.</span> <span id="s814">And it, it was a lot of noise, a lot of injuries, a smell of, of the stench of, of gunpowder and, and corpses came closer, you know?</span> <span id="s815">War has a certain smell, a very very unpleasant smell that you can really honestly feel.</span> <span id="s816">And as a child, I learned that.</span> <span id="s817">That’s, that’s all I can tell you, but . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Now, so the entire building then moved down into the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements.</span> <span id="s820">Some of the newer houses’ basements were clean, perhaps dry, you know.</span> <span id="s821">And you could make it with a little effort to become temporary living quarters.</span> <span id="s822">But those built in the 19th century, they were damp, dark, they were just awful.</span> <span id="s823">Cold.</span> <span id="s824">And luckily, that this house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly new house.</span> <span id="s825">And the basement was livable.</span> <span id="s826">Now where I lived, where I lived before, in most of my life, back, that basement was such that I, oh, I wouldn’t have wanted to spend any time right there because it was a damp, old typical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you know, movies or read about Dickensian novels.</span> <span id="s827">Also, there were rats, loved this kind of a moist dark environment.</span> <span id="s828">But here, I remember our basement as quite civilized in, in this house.</span> <span id="s829">So it was, the hardship was not really bad and so many people, the heat, I think, of the bodies made up for the cold outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: How many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that basement, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: How big was the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire floor of the house, because it was, usually the basements were what you can consider a low floor.</span> <span id="s834">So, it’s, I cannot really describe it in, in square footage because at that time I didn’t even, I didn’t even know about that, but it, it was a good size apartment house floor, okay, just picture it.</span> <span id="s835">And there were mattresses down, and everybody brought the mattresses down, and there were people very closely situated and, was in a way, it was kind of a warm place.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Were there separate rooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: There were a few, but mainly the separate rooms were, were given to the doctors for operation, operating rooms and, and supply rooms and things like that.</span> <span id="s838">Most of the people lived in, in these big open areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: So the treatments continued, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s841">Up until the, practically the last minute.</span> <span id="s842">And then the liberation, January 18, is when we heard the emergency wall of our basement.</span> <span id="s843">We heard a knock and by law, there was a, an emergency entrance to every one of these basements between two houses that consisted only of one layer of bricks.</span> <span id="s844">So, and there had to be a pick next to it.</span> <span id="s845">So we heard that a pick was working, breaking through.</span> <span id="s846">And then, must have been about four o’clock, five o’clock in the morning and all of a sudden the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier, Soviet soldier, came through first and then the whole body.</span> <span id="s847">And this was first time, I think, that he got a hug from people because, and he couldn’t understand why, he was absolutely bewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldiers were not welcomed with great enthusiasm anywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for a German victory and we, we were just hugging and kissing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Before we go forward, you, so the treatments continued but so, somebody was actually was going out onto the streets during that time and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: We were, yeah, bringing in people from just the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity.</span> <span id="s850">And people would come in on their own too, you know, with a, with a shrapnel or something in their leg or a small injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And was somebody going out to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Well, we had beans.</span> <span id="s853">We, we, I remember that we practically had beans every day.</span> <span id="s854">Beans, beans and beans.</span> <span id="s855">As long as you have beans, you can really survive.</span> <span id="s856">And water, yeah, water was dripping but still, we could get at enough water to, for drinking.</span> <span id="s857">Nobody took a shower, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s858">There was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Was there a place to cook in the, in the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s861">People had these little, you know, stoves.</span> <span id="s862">A lot of people had little stoves and they shared those, whole families.</span> <span id="s863">There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment because we all, we only had one important thing in our mind, to get out of there, alive.</span> <span id="s864">And people shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: So everybody managed to get along [talkover]?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as leaving somebody starving or leaving somebody without fuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best.</span> <span id="s867">And of course, there are small little skirmishes mainly a couple of old people who just didn’t understand the situation completely, and had unreasonable demands or something and we had to step on their toes, and… But no basic, no, no big problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: How many doctors would you say there were out of that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: It’s hard for me to look back but I would say we had at least thirty doctors there, at least.</span> <span id="s870">And we are talking about the cream of, of the Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know?</span> <span id="s871">Really, they went out and famous professors from universities so this man, this Doctor Völgyessi who was the psychiatrist living in the house originally, he had a very large circle of friends, and so he managed to gather the ones that he could and brought them in.</span> <span id="s872">And there were many other people, I don’t know how they got there.</span> <span id="s873">I just read a few years ago that the chief architect of Budapest, the main architect of Budapest today, was with me in the basement in this house.</span> <span id="s874">I… somebody sent me, I think, a newspaper article or while in visiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an interview about it.</span> <span id="s875">Because it was the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Was Jereczian still in, still with you at that point, at the point of the siege?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Jereczian?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stayed, he never left the place.</span> <span id="s880">Yeah.</span> <span id="s881">So, no, he was there all the time.</span> <span id="s882">And if he had to leave for some reason, he made sure that he left enough people there to, to protect us.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: So he had made just a complete break from the Arrow Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even joined them and what was his job there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s885">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s886">Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few years to write about these things and clear up this thing and I was not there in these, from ’48 to ’50.</span> <span id="s887">And after I came back, you just didn’t want to, those were the worst years of Stalinism and you didn’t want to get involved with anything because you didn’t know what he was doing at that time and so, no questions asked was the best policy.</span> <span id="s888">But, later on in the sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a concert impressario and that he took certain shows back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s889">And I even saw his name and I am, I really regret that I didn’t go to see him.</span> <span id="s890">I should have looked for him somehow and talked to him.</span> <span id="s891">So I feel so strongly about this whole thing that if I knew today that he is still alive, living, I would probably go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s892">That’s where he lived and, and, and just thank him again.</span> <span id="s893">But I know that he received a great deal of recognition from people.</span> <span id="s894">But I know, I don’t know exactly what, if he’s alive today.</span> <span id="s895">He was, I would say, about ten, at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so it’s hard to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Well, let’s go back to the, to the liberation.</span> <span id="s897">So there’s a Russian soldier who broke through and you all embraced him and then, and then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: What did I do after that?</span> <span id="s899">Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s900">I went with the Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into a store and they broke into every store that still had anything, I went with them.</span> <span id="s901">And after they were through and took what they wanted to take, I took what I wanted to take.</span> <span id="s902">In other words, I did what we called zabralny which means to confiscate things.</span> <span id="s903">I was full of hate, I was full of frustration and I thought this, this was the way to get even, probably.</span> <span id="s904">And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a little supply of all these stolen goods that I got from shops that were just there, most people wouldn’t dare to go in with the Russians, but I put back my yellow star and I went with them and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-Semites and beat the hell out of you, the, the others, they, they were welcoming you.</span> <span id="s905">They said go ahead.</span> <span id="s906">Also, we had a, a little Jewish domestic from Romania with us, who joined us and helped my, my mother and she also spent the last few months with us in this, in this basement.</span> <span id="s907">And she was from Romania and with the Russians we had Romanian troops coming in.</span> <span id="s908">And she was a beautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Romanian officers were just, just absolutely crazy about her.</span> <span id="s909">So she took me by the hand and she said, “Come with me.”</span> <span id="s910">And she went with these Romanians to all the jewelry stores and she amassed a fortune within days in jewelry.</span> <span id="s911">And then said goodbye to us and disappeared.</span> <span id="s912">We never found out what happened to her.</span> <span id="s913">She had a fiancee in Romania, whether she found him or not, we suspected she eventually ended up in Israel like most young people of that time.</span> <span id="s914">But I went with her and Romanian officers, I went with Russians.</span> <span id="s915">I was kind of a street urchin for awhile.</span> <span id="s916">I enjoyed the fact that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders.</span> <span id="s917">And my mother could not control me either, you know?</span> <span id="s918">I was now a man and I was just intoxicated by this, and so I had a little store there, that, with all the stolen goods, and my father saw this when he came home and found out, asked me what happened and I told him.</span> <span id="s919">And he was absolutely just horrified that I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I got it from.</span> <span id="s920">It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came with me and he stayed outside and I had to deliver it back.</span> <span id="s921">And I tell you, some of those people could not believe that this happened.</span> <span id="s922">And today, of course, I feel very good about this but not, not at that time.</span> <span id="s923">So, in, it took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real emotions that I’m not a Hungarian, I never had a Hungarian passport, you know?</span> <span id="s924">I never had any, any identity, Hungarian identity.</span> <span id="s925">They, I was always being denied of being a Hungarian even though my parents were born in Hungary and practically everybody back generations born in Hungary and so I joined the Zionist Movement.</span> <span id="s926">And in 1948, the, the, the Communists completely took over the government.</span> <span id="s927">They called it the Year of Turn.</span> <span id="s928">And all other organizations except for Communist youth organizations were banned.</span> <span id="s929">So again now I was in the underground Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Okay, so this is tape three, side B of an interview with Mr. Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s932">And will you describe to me your father’s homecoming, what that event was like for you and your mother?</span> <span id="s933">And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of him who then by small dosage made us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was coming, but of course, it was a tremendous emotional experience for him to appear there and, the fact that he immediately understood why there are two families living in the apartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it was just a very nice homecoming.</span> <span id="s935">Because number one, we saw him, number two he brought food, which helped us to have a little feast then, and number three is that he, we knew that that’s what he would have done, he would have split the living quarters and would not throw a family of four, family of five who were out of their own, well, problems, housed in our place.</span> <span id="s936">We… naturally, we were totally just overwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, set out to see the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s937">He wanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that’s, this is what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you had left, when did you, let’s go back a little bit again.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: You had left the, the house on Zichy Jeno Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s942">Zichy utca.</span> <span id="s943">Yeah, I left it practically the day after we were liberated and went back to see what happened to our apartment.</span> <span id="s944">And that’s where I found that family living in it.</span> <span id="s945">‘Kay?</span> <span id="s946">And, then shortly we moved back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it must have been April or May when my father finally appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: It was, very scarce.</span> <span id="s949">But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then for city people to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food.</span> <span id="s950">We also hired a person with a horse to drag it back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s951">It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they confiscated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods.</span> <span id="s952">And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian village.</span> <span id="s953">On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going on.</span> <span id="s954">And we knew that it doesn’t affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn’t have any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle over there because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s955">And so the Russians were very edgy and they confiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also incarcerated my aunt and myself.</span> <span id="s956">And I have no idea what happened, but the next… my aunt was with me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said, “Don’t worry, everything is going to be fine.”</span> <span id="s957">And the next morning, we were given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go.</span> <span id="s958">And I can only guess what was the price.</span> <span id="s959">The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both.</span> <span id="s960">So yes, if you had still some belongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food.</span> <span id="s961">Because the farmers always have food.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: How long did that cartful of food last you?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations were also sending packages and, and would supply us regularly.</span> <span id="s964">So that helped too.</span> <span id="s965">We were not really, you know, in danger of, of starving to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: And did you go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high school at the age of eighteen.</span> <span id="s968">And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization give me signals that it was time to go to Israel because they couldn’t guarantee that we would have more time.</span> <span id="s969">The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very tightly.</span> <span id="s970">So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to my family and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number one.</span> <span id="s971">Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes.</span> <span id="s972">They said, “Do us a favor.</span> <span id="s973">Go to that town, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related,” and all this and that, “and ask them if they would like to have a high school orchestra to play a concert in town.</span> <span id="s974">And if they say yes,” —which probably they would, they said, because which little town doesn’t like a free concert— “go to a printer, here is money and have nice posters printed.”</span> <span id="s975">And they give me the date.</span> <span id="s976">I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn’t realize at that time that this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the border, my mother’s birthplace.</span> <span id="s977">On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-owned bus by that time from a state-owned company.</span> <span id="s978">We were all either holding an instrument or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border.</span> <span id="s979">On the border, when we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February.</span> <span id="s980">We were eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus driver.</span> <span id="s981">And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem, we, we knew that we had a definite plan.</span> <span id="s982">And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take about a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, “All right, go.”</span> <span id="s983">And as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, “Go across this field and there is a barn there and don’t ask any questions, just get into the barn.”</span> <span id="s984">That’s what we did.</span> <span id="s985">They closed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement, who was leading us?</span> <span id="s986">—the peasant woman who was in the pub.</span> <span id="s987">She shed her twelve skirts or so because those women still wore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing.</span> <span id="s988">Now she had a leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke Hebrew with our leader.</span> <span id="s989">She was a, an Israeli army officer, born to Hungarian parents who spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, to distract.</span> <span id="s990">And she led us down to the river, everything was supposed to happen so that on the other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between Austria and Hungary was already closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in between this Year of Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before.</span> <span id="s991">The, the end, at the end we crossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started to talk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s992">It was very cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an hour when they finally left.</span> <span id="s993">Then we couldn’t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was supposed to wait for us.</span> <span id="s994">So it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken to Bratislava, where the gendarmerie was paid off.</span> <span id="s995">We were nominally arrested by the gendarmerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I remember, and the next morning, we were taken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] and within about a half an hour they opened.</span> <span id="s996">We were in Vienna, in the American section of, of, of Vienna.</span> <span id="s997">At that time, Vienna was divided.</span> <span id="s998">So this was my, my great escape to Israel.</span> <span id="s999">And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: You mentioned how you had joined this Zionist organization that you realized that you, you were not really a Hungarian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Was it the desire to have a place that led you to join the Zionist Organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1004">I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt—at that time remember it was the last few weeks of the war—that I was, if I fought, I was going to fight for, for the Jewish homeland.</span> <span id="s1005">And I already associated myself more with that than with Hungary.</span> <span id="s1006">That was, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though I’d never seen it before.</span> <span id="s1007">So, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: How did your parents relate to your decision, to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad.</span> <span id="s1010">But I said, “You can come and, and join me,” you know.</span> <span id="s1011">And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn’t, because after we left, it was impossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile.</span> <span id="s1012">So, I corresponded and this was, this was one of the reasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, ‘cause I realized that I needed to make up for the years that my father was away.</span> <span id="s1013">So I returned to Hungary and it was the worst of the Stalinist era.</span> <span id="s1014">It was like 1984, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Did he, did your father identify himself as a, did he feel a Hungarian nationalism in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No, my father never really made an issue out of this.</span> <span id="s1017">He never made an issue out of this, you know?</span> <span id="s1018">One way or another.</span> <span id="s1019">Just, he, he, he loved his environment, Budapest.</span> <span id="s1020">He loved to go to the coffee house and play cards with his friends and drink coffee and, and, probably gossip or whatever, politics.</span> <span id="s1021">He loved that.</span> <span id="s1022">And he told us a cute little joke.</span> <span id="s1023">They always asked him why doesn’t he follow me, when he was already alone, after my mother died and he, he said, “I tell you a joke.”</span> <span id="s1024">He said, “Mr. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee house”—it was called Hungaria, it’s a very famous, or New York, it had two names.</span> <span id="s1025">New York before and after the German occupation, called Hungaria because you couldn’t give a place New York.</span> <span id="s1026">Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people say, “Mr. Kohn, it is now the 1940s, we are after the war, all your friends are gone.</span> <span id="s1027">They’re all in New York, what are you doing here alone in the coffee house?”</span> <span id="s1028">And Mr. Kohn said, “Look son, what would I have done had I also left for New York?</span> <span id="s1029">I would have arrived there one day and the next day I would have looked for my old friends and I would have found them and the third day we would have sat down to talk, about what?</span> <span id="s1030">The good old days in the coffee house.”</span> <span id="s1031">He said, “Look son, I am already in the coffee house.”</span> <span id="s1032">And my father always said, “This is my coffee house.”</span> <span id="s1033">In other words, this was his life, this was his environment.</span> <span id="s1034">You know, he was always on his feet, he was always going around in Budapest and he was also working almost up to the last year just before he died.</span> <span id="s1035">He was, he just couldn’t be without work.</span> <span id="s1036">He was a workaholic and he knew that in this country, you need language.</span> <span id="s1037">And he had very poor language facilities, he would have never learned English.</span> <span id="s1038">So, it was a realization but we, we saw him as much as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: What did you do when you arrived in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, living in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1041">I learned to work with the tractors at that time, and then we, with a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth, most of them from my old organization from Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian border by a town called Afula and started our own settlement.</span> <span id="s1042">So, I was really working the, as a farmer, kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Did you play any role in the War of Independence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Very little, almost none.</span> <span id="s1045">I got there very late, remember, so I do not claim any, any real major role at all.</span> <span id="s1046">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: And then you decided to come back in 1950?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for my parents and part of stupidity on my part, that I believed that things are the way Communist papers describe it in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1049">I decided to return, perhaps temporarily, perhaps not.</span> <span id="s1050">And when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it was a fatal mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Had you found any of that sense of home that you were looking for when . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: when you went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1055">I found my parents, but other than that, it was, it was a terrible period for any human being, especially people who came from the West.</span> <span id="s1056">It was the worst for those, because you were considered unreliable and especially coming from Israel, even more so.</span> <span id="s1057">The reason was, that by that time, Stalin was very paranoid and Zionism was one of his main targets.</span> <span id="s1058">So, it, it, this is, this is something that is not much to do with the Holocaust anymore.</span> <span id="s1059">It was just very hard for anybody to live under Communist rule at that time, but especially for Jews.</span> <span id="s1060">Well, I don’t know if you know that in 1953 when he was dying, he looked up and he saw some Jewish doctors around his deathbed and he said, “They are poisoning me, they’re against me.”</span> <span id="s1061">And he said, “Arrest them.”</span> <span id="s1062">And practically hours before he died, they arrested Jewish doctors and I was just at the University in Hungary, studying and that was my state, the time of my state examination.</span> <span id="s1063">And Hungary had to follow everything that the Soviet Union did so they were looking for anybody who had anything to do with Zionism.</span> <span id="s1064">And they found me at the university and I was let go, weeks before my state exam.</span> <span id="s1065">So, it, it was difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: When you had been in Israel, had you, do you feel, did you feel that you had found some of what you were looking for there?</span> <span id="s1067">Was your intention to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1069">Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1070">I had some very deep feelings about the country as such and then again, I was still a young man, eighteen, and I was also influenced by a great deal of these revolutionary Marxist ideas.</span> <span id="s1071">And there were many things that were not to my liking, that I would have loved to see differently.</span> <span id="s1072">And so when I left Israel, I did not just leave it with nostalgia.</span> <span id="s1073">I left it because I thought that finally, somehow, in Hungary, I’m going to find, find that utopistic state, that, that is, is justice and equality for everyone.</span> <span id="s1074">And, I was just a little bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I did.</span> <span id="s1075">So it a was a, a double reason to return.</span> <span id="s1076">A, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: What did you do for work when you returned home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I couldn’t work for awhile because I was unreliable, anybody who came from the West, especially from Israel.</span> <span id="s1079">Finally, with some great connections, I was hired to sweep and clean a garage, a state-owned garage.</span> <span id="s1080">And that would have been my future for a long time, had it not been for a, just a, a very fortunate incident when the Party secretary of my, my company was sick and a substitute Party secretary was there.</span> <span id="s1081">And I appeared at her office because there were big posters, they wanted workers youth to go to college because they figure that some of the middle class and the former upper class that sends its sons to college and I asked if she can recommend me and she said, “Well, I don’t know you but why don’t you dictate a recommendation to my secretary?”</span> <span id="s1082">And so that was the big first hurdle that I went through because the regular Party secretary would have never written that letter.</span> <span id="s1083">So, with this, I went to a university forum, but the trouble is you had to write your autobiography, and the minute they got to a point of Israel, which you could not in those days just stay silent about two years of your life, when they found out they said ‘Thanks but no thanks,’ and again a strange thing happened.</span> <span id="s1084">One of the faculty members who was on the committee, cause the committee that interviewed people consisted of faculty member, Communist Youth Organization, the Communist Party, the union, various organizations.</span> <span id="s1085">He came after me and he said, “Holczer, Holczer,” he said, “was your father from the suburb of Budapest?”</span> <span id="s1086">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1087">He said, “Was there a soccer team in which he and four or five of his brothers played at the same time?”</span> <span id="s1088">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1089">He said, “I played with your dad.”</span> <span id="s1090">He said, “Come back in September,” he says “You were a minor when you left Hungary.</span> <span id="s1091">Let’s see if the minister of education can exempt you,” you know?</span> <span id="s1092">Amnesty you, pardon you, whatever.</span> <span id="s1093">Well, anyway, I went back in September and nobody knew who I was, nobody, they had no idea, go away.</span> <span id="s1094">So I looked for him and he went in to the Party secretary and he came out and he said, and he said, “I am happy to inform you that the minister of education give you a dispensation.</span> <span id="s1095">You can enter the university.”</span> <span id="s1096">And he said, “This is the last time you and I ever talk to each other.”</span> <span id="s1097">He said, “Don’t even greet me.”</span> <span id="s1098">He said, “You don’t know me.”</span> <span id="s1099">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1100">This is how I got in.</span> <span id="s1101">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1102">So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">End of Tape 3, Side B Tape 4, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s1105">So you entered university, what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And you stayed, you studied what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: I studied, my major was geography and my minor was history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: What were you interested in doing after you gained your degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: I wanted to be a geographer.</span> <span id="s1111">I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or teach geography.</span> <span id="s1112">I love geography.</span> <span id="s1113">And, in Hungary, it was a very important subject at that time.</span> <span id="s1114">But in America, it was no subject at all.</span> <span id="s1115">I, when I arrived here, people were just looking at me and they said, “No, this is, unfortunately, we are not teaching geography here.”</span> <span id="s1116">It was incorporated into what they called social studies in the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: So, after you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: So, I switched and I made, I went back to school here in 1959, and switched and had a history major, ‘kay.</span> <span id="s1119">And I left geography just out there, I didn’t touch it anymore, so I got a master’s degree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: After you graduated from, from college while you were in Hungary, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Then I taught in a junior high school in the suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in Budapest until 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Did you play any sort of role in the Revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Just a very minor one.</span> <span id="s1124">In the 19th district of Budapest, I was asked to form the New Democratic Teachers’ Union.</span> <span id="s1125">And I had very ambivalent feelings about the revolution because I was afraid that the same elements, the same kind of elements who came up in 1944, October 15, eventually will dominate it.</span> <span id="s1126">I just did not trust the revolution so I stayed away from it.</span> <span id="s1127">I understood the anger of the people and I sympathized with the, with the desire to have a free country, but I didn’t trust some of the groups that participated in it.</span> <span id="s1128">And what, what really precipitated my departure is that a few days before I left, I saw some groups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it.</span> <span id="s1129">I realized that I would never be able to live here anymore.</span> <span id="s1130">There will be absolutely no, no peace for somebody who is either a human being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Had you experienced directly any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s1133">Hungarians are with the Austrians and Poles, probably the three most anti-Semitic countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s1134">I felt much less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my nineteen years that I recently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So you decided to leave Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border with a cousin of mine who just graduated from high school and was always in political trouble with the police for his outspoken attitude, so, he followed, he came with me, and we then crossed the border after, I think about six, seven days or so.</span> <span id="s1137">And arrived in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Was it difficult to leave, did you need any exit visa or any . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, it was totally illegal.</span> <span id="s1140">We were walking usually from dawn to dusk and whatever the conditions were, you know, favorable, we didn’t really like to walk in broad daylight but of course we couldn’t walk in the darkness either because we didn’t know the terrain.</span> <span id="s1141">We slept in, in haylofts, the farmers were quite kind.</span> <span id="s1142">They felt probably a little bit guilty for not participating in the revolution and slowly approached the border this way.</span> <span id="s1143">And then before the border, it was then a little bit difficult, and we had to have, we had connections because a third person joined us whose relatives lived in a border town and they helped us to get over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And then your parents were still living…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1146">My parents were still there and I told them definitely that this time I want them to follow me, eventually, when they can come legally.</span> <span id="s1147">Because I didn’t want them to, they were by that time, the age when you don’t just chase somebody across snowfields.</span> <span id="s1148">So, we arrived in Graz, that was the first Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s1149">Every country opened its arms.</span> <span id="s1150">[dog barking] Lie down, Gelsey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: So you arrived in, in Graz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: And the world was then open to us and I intended to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1153">I wanted to stay in Europe, and I just thought that Sweden would be a good place for me to, to be.</span> <span id="s1154">But my cousin got away from me while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a hotel which was one of the gathering points for the Hungarian refugees, and left a note for me to come and follow him.</span> <span id="s1155">And I promised his mother that I would take care of him so I followed him and this is how I ended up in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: You followed him all the way to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1158">Well, of course, it was very easy.</span> <span id="s1159">All I had to do is go and tell the authorities there, the, the ones who were in charge of the Hungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I changed my mind and I want to go to the U.S. Not only that, they already, they already had some messages from the Red Cross saying that if I show up, and the reason I was away, because previously he had asked me to go to Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his relatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, but he wanted to go to school there.</span> <span id="s1160">He was totally intoxicated by the, by the light, western lifestyle because he had never been to the West.</span> <span id="s1161">And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he was gone.</span> <span id="s1162">So, but he left messages.</span> <span id="s1163">So the Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Did you have any idea why he would have done such a thing, of just leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredictable fellow, you know?</span> <span id="s1166">You could not really, he was, he was a just a restless person and I think he figured, well, why not, I want to see the U.S. and, and his message to me was, “You can always go to Sweden from the U.S.</span> <span id="s1167">You will have the money and opportunity, but maybe you won’t have the opportunity to go and see the U.S. if you live in Sweden.”</span> <span id="s1168">Little, little did he know about economic conditions in the eighties and nineties that, I think, more Swedes can travel much easier and come here than we in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Why did you prefer to go to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: You know, I am a romantic.</span> <span id="s1171">And I just felt that I would not want to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s1172">Europe, to me, was always my home.</span> <span id="s1173">I loved the old towns, and I always loved clarity and that, the Scandinavian purity, maybe, that I have seen too many, I had seen too many Scandinavian movies, Swedish movies.</span> <span id="s1174">But they just appealed to me, the lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1175">And I liked the fact that the social security, that people have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1176">And just a lot of things appealed to me about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated fairly, so, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: And you had, yet you had enough money to just travel to the U.S. instead and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: No, I had no money.</span> <span id="s1179">We didn’t need any money.</span> <span id="s1180">[talkover] No.</span> <span id="s1181">Nobody had any money.</span> <span id="s1182">All you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and taken to Graz by the Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found every religious denomination having a booth, who welcomed you.</span> <span id="s1183">You could go and say that I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made no difference and then name the country where you wanted to go to.</span> <span id="s1184">And, and it was very simple, you didn’t need any money.</span> <span id="s1185">Then, next step was each had a place in Austria where they temporarily would house you, even give you a little pocket money and there you waited for your transportation to go to that country.</span> <span id="s1186">And that so, I did not really want to be attached to any religious organization so I went to a very independent one called the Tolstoy Foundation.</span> <span id="s1187">It was founded by Tolstoy’s daughter and, using I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy’s books, and so they are the ones who brought me to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1188">It was all gratis.</span> <span id="s1189">I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one who flew all Hungarian refugees over.</span> <span id="s1190">MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of them from Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1191">Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after Budapest.</span> <span id="s1192">And, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization because my cousin came through a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1193">So in St. Louis they were waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1194">If you were a Hungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world, the whole world felt very guilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything possible.</span> <span id="s1195">I mean I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1196">I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I thought, you know, I was some dignitary or something.</span> <span id="s1197">They were waiting for me at the airport and I was just… But first I had to spend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening camp for people.</span> <span id="s1198">They screened out the sick, the U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and some other illnesses, they went to Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members and such.</span> <span id="s1199">I don’t know what the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit.</span> <span id="s1200">And so this is how I ended up in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1201">My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two months, not even that much.</span> <span id="s1202">He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to Champagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left.</span> <span id="s1203">And we were housed, we were taken by an American family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so you could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you.</span> <span id="s1204">And, apparently, his wife felt that maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow remedy the problem but it didn’t.</span> <span id="s1205">And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a very ideal situation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually, I met a professor of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of, Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival.</span> <span id="s1206">And when they heard… I hated St. Louis, I just couldn’t find anything redeeming about that, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this, they took me to Aspen, Colorado and they said, “You can always work here for a dollar an hour, too.”</span> <span id="s1207">And I loved it.</span> <span id="s1208">I stayed there for almost three years.</span> <span id="s1209">And most of my friends and connections and everything in my American life practically comes from that period.</span> <span id="s1210">From my Aspen period, people who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one.</span> <span id="s1211">So, I am, I was very lucky again to end up there.</span> <span id="s1212">Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Were you teaching there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved enough.</span> <span id="s1215">I wanted to go up to Alaska for one summer.</span> <span id="s1216">I went up to Alaska and worked for the Forest Service and then came to Fresno, California, which offered me a loan.</span> <span id="s1217">I couldn’t get a scholarship because they didn’t know much about me.</span> <span id="s1218">My papers did not arrive from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1219">So it was, but at least they offered me a National Defense Loan so that helped me to start school.</span> <span id="s1220">And I stayed in Fresno for two years when I got my teaching credentials and my master’s degree in history.</span> <span id="s1221">And I, those were, scholastically speaking, they were good years.</span> <span id="s1222">I had very good instructors and, and good friends and sponsors and, I did not regret it.</span> <span id="s1223">And then I ended up in the Bay Area where I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s1224">And met my wife there.</span> <span id="s1225">And I was teaching in Marin County.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Were you in touch with your parents throughout this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1228">All the time.</span> <span id="s1229">And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Were there plans for them to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1232">They, once I got married in ’67, they came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and then in 1974, when, see I married my wife with three children.</span> <span id="s1233">They were tiny, their, their father abandoned them, he was alcoholic.</span> <span id="s1234">And so, my wife and I raised them.</span> <span id="s1235">And by the time, 1974, I get an offer from a friend of mine in Switzerland to come and help him, he was a director of a school in a children’s village in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous children’s village, Pestalozzy Children’s Village.</span> <span id="s1236">Do you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: No.</span> <span id="s1239">Okay.</span> <span id="s1240">And so, and I loved the mountains, I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to Europe.</span> <span id="s1241">And since we had only one child at home by that time, and he was willing to come so we went over.</span> <span id="s1242">We, we resigned our jobs and we went back and the job fell through.</span> <span id="s1243">Because in the meantime, the Swiss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring foreigners unless they can find a local person for the job.</span> <span id="s1244">And after years of advertisement for this particular position, they couldn’t find anybody, a couple came just as we were being interviewed.</span> <span id="s1245">So it fell through and in 1964, no I mean 1965, before I got married, I came over to Europe to teach for the Army, just for a year.</span> <span id="s1246">I just needed, I was a very confirmed bachelor, and I needed a year to think about whether I want to marry somebody with three small children and here a confirmed bachelor.</span> <span id="s1247">So I stayed for a year when I decided yes, but during the year, I got to know a lot of people in the system, in the Department of Defense School System.</span> <span id="s1248">So now that the job fell through and we basically gave up our jobs here in the States, I had only one, you know, opportunity here, to go over and see if any of our, our, any of my former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife and myself.</span> <span id="s1249">And not only that I found some but they were now in very, very high positions and they said, no problem.</span> <span id="s1250">And both of us, within a year, started to teach.</span> <span id="s1251">My wife got a job even before me, because it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary.</span> <span id="s1252">So she started out and we lived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area, also from Aspen.</span> <span id="s1255">She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me to get a job there so we can be close and we were there.</span> <span id="s1256">Now all of a sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by that time it was very difficult to get a job for a teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job available, finally, was teaching special ed classes.</span> <span id="s1257">And I said, children are children, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1258">I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a credential.</span> <span id="s1259">And the man who hired me was also a Holocaust survivor so it, it really helped.</span> <span id="s1260">I told him very honestly why I want the job and I said, “It doesn’t matter why I want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you can, you can bet on that.”</span> <span id="s1261">And I hope I did.</span> <span id="s1262">So, he hired me and this is where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s1263">She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she stayed only for a few years and then when I came back in 1965, then I went into special ed for the county, for Marin County, and I stayed for almost ten years, nine years.</span> <span id="s1264">So that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s1265">And then I switched.</span> <span id="s1266">With the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: What was it like living in Germany all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Well, it was much more pleasant than I had envisioned, frankly.</span> <span id="s1269">I found that there is a very large segment of a new German generation that is, is absolutely appalled, okay, of the past.</span> <span id="s1270">And I met a lot of intellectuals who had a very good vision of the past, and not only that, they spread the knowledge around.</span> <span id="s1271">Naturally, there is an element in, in Germany, that is, you know, that is the scum of earth, but frankly, they are very much the minority.</span> <span id="s1272">And I, I could live in Germany much easier, probably, than I could ever live in Austria, where it doesn’t take more than a few minutes to hear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist remark, especially if they have a couple of beer.</span> <span id="s1273">You know.</span> <span id="s1274">So, there is, there is a new Germany.</span> <span id="s1275">Now, with East Germany joining, it is a problem.</span> <span id="s1276">But West Germany itself, was, I would say, a pretty civilized state.</span> <span id="s1277">Okay, now the East Germans, that’s a different, that’s a, that’s a tragedy right now, that they had not been instructed by the proper history teachers, and, there are big problems in East Germany because the East Germans said, “The Nazis, oh no, they live in West Germany.</span> <span id="s1278">We, we are good Communists here, we don’t have to worry about the past.”</span> <span id="s1279">And this attitude then led to what is happening nowadays in Germany with the skinheads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Was it difficult at first for you to accept that Germany was so, that you could really get along with some of these Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Well, again, you know, I followed my father.</span> <span id="s1282">He came to see us in Germany once and while he was there, our landlady’s son was killed in a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year old, a young man.</span> <span id="s1283">And we had to go to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1284">And my wife said to my father as she look around, “Grandpa, look, all these men of your age.</span> <span id="s1285">Do you sometimes think of all the ghosts that are around here behind these men?”</span> <span id="s1286">And my father said, “You can’t live with hate.”</span> <span id="s1287">He says, “There are ghosts everywhere.</span> <span id="s1288">There are Indian ghosts in America, too.</span> <span id="s1289">You have your own ghosts.”</span> <span id="s1290">And that’s just the way that, you can’t constantly think of that.</span> <span id="s1291">And we befriended Germans who were a lot more even liberal than, than we are.</span> <span id="s1292">And so, I mean, you can find all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1293">That, but there, Germany, I don’t really worry too much about Germany as much as I worry about Russia and, and Poland and Austria and there you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: We’ve got a few more minutes.</span> <span id="s1295">So, is there anything, what made you decide to return to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is a drawdown situation where they were pulling out quite a few troops from Germany and we reached, my wife reached the point where she just said she wanted to be close to the children.</span> <span id="s1297">We have four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1298">She, this house which didn’t look like this at that time was a small little place, this was one end of the house and that was the other end of the house.</span> <span id="s1299">A partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a veterinarian, but it was a very small place.</span> <span id="s1300">It was available.</span> <span id="s1301">They bought it and he called us and my wife said, “Look, I stayed in Europe for nineteen years with you, now I would like you to stay where I would like to be and it is so nice to be so close to family.”</span> <span id="s1302">Our son is only four hours away, in Nashville, with a little baby.</span> <span id="s1303">And oh, and she gets along with her sister very well and we all get along, we never had an argument.</span> <span id="s1304">So, that was an ideal situation so that’s how we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">End of Tape 4, Side A [NOTE: SIDE TWO OF TAPE 4 IS BLANK] Tape 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: I'm Arwen Donahue and I'm here with Robert Holczer in Paris, Kentucky on April 29, 1996.</span> <span id="s1307">This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview.</span> <span id="s1308">And first to… ask you a couple of questions about the issues that came up in the last interview.</span> <span id="s1309">I just wanted to get your aunt's name, for one thing, the aunt whose apartment you stayed in on Zichy Jeno Street, what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Her name was Aranka, that is Goldie in English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y.</span> <span id="s1311">She's still living in Hungary at this date and probably it would be very difficult to communicate with her because she is number one, old, and number two, I think that she has some mental problems that she developed since the war and, but she certainly is the heroine of the whole story and my survival, so I try to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult and I'm very, very sorry about that.</span> <span id="s1312">But she has a son who lives in Switzerland so at this point she's still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: I didn't quite understand how just go back a little bit, when you lived in the house on Zichy Jeno Street, before it became a clinic, it was a Jewish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: And yet there were some people who lived in the house who were non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Non-Jews, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: And I suppose your aunt was considered one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: But before the house was designated a clinic, if anyone in the house were to be liquida… were to be put into the ghetto, would they have gone apartment by apartment, or would they have taken the entire house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: They would have gone apartment by apartment and, of course, if you could prove that you are a gentile, and that was very easy because every concierge had a list, years ago this was a law in Hungary, that every concierge had a list and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-Jews way back, because when you change your residence in Europe, you have to go to the police and report it.</span> <span id="s1321">In other words, every European country, they know who is at that point where.</span> <span id="s1322">And so this list existed, all they had to do, come and talk to the concierge and all the concierges were basically serving the government, they were in my estimate, what I call the common man, and their attitude changed regarding of what the government was doing and they were lackeys and so there was no big problem, they always could tell who were the gentiles and who were not by just showing the list.</span> <span id="s1323">But there were gentiles still living in the Jewish houses who had a nice place and they just didn't want to move, you know?</span> <span id="s1324">And so when, for example, at one time we were lined up because the house was discovered and this George Ara Jereczian was not there with his guards.</span> <span id="s1325">I think they went to buy, get some rations for the house, and so we were really without any defense, and we were lined up, then the gentiles who are not down there be also lined up because they, apparently they had known what was going on and could identify themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: But you were lined up although you lived with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: We were, yes, we were lined up, we were lined up.</span> <span id="s1328">And then in the last moment, a lot of things happened.</span> <span id="s1329">This aunt of mine, for example, she was also out, most people who could go on the street were always out looking for something to eat and bring home and when she saw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she just went up to her and started to kick her and said, “This stupid slut.</span> <span id="s1330">Just, she is so stupid.</span> <span id="s1331">Every time people say line up, she lines up, she's not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1332">And all this, and in front of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged her mother out of the line up and she had a personality that nobody argued with her.</span> <span id="s1333">So they assume that she is a gentile, therefore her mother is a gentile, too.</span> <span id="s1334">And then we were saved because George Ara Jereczian came home and immediately, his men immediately went to these punks and said, you know, “Clear out of here in short order, papers and everything else.</span> <span id="s1335">And if you want, you know, we'll call the Ministry of Defense.”</span> <span id="s1336">And so, they knew their job and threatened these people who then left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: You mentioned that there were about ten people living in that apartment with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: About ten, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: And some of them were her brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay?</span> <span id="s1341">Among them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us.</span> <span id="s1342">They were also under some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever uniform they could get, but when things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two weeks, they joined us, so they were there, too.</span> <span id="s1343">Then there were some husbands, my, one of my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1344">It was a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband, everybody, so there was even humor then.</span> <span id="s1345">And some children.</span> <span id="s1346">So we might, it's possible we were even more than ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the relatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous doctors were there who then went on and came to this country and elsewhere and the whole family was there, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: What about her other brothers and sisters, other than those who were in the apartment?</span> <span id="s1348">Where did they… were they at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all together in the same apartment, it was her apartment and because ordinarily a gentile would not have had anything to do with Jews, but this was an extraordinary place because we, she knew that if they really stormed the house, the Arrow Cross people, and if they really eliminate George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then everything is lost, it doesn't make any difference, so... and inside the house, of course, there was absolutely no other rule except you made up your own so nobody cared.</span> <span id="s1350">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: But she had, there were thirteen all together, siblings, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen brothers and sisters and some of them were already dead and others were elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1355">One was in what was Slovakia at that time and participated in the Slovak uprising against the Germans and was hanged, was captured and hanged.</span> <span id="s1356">My father was in Yugoslavia, so there were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't even know where he was, so they were dispersed.</span> <span id="s1357">The women were together, the women we could get together and, but the men, only two of them.</span> <span id="s1358">So there were altogether five, five of the thirteen, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Also, what was the name of the psychiatrist, the famous psychiatrist who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Völgyessi, Völgyessi.</span> <span id="s1361">He was the most famous Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Would you spell his name, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what is it, well, anyway, two dots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Umlaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Völgyessi.</span> <span id="s1366">And he, he was a very influential man and I, if I remember correctly, I heard, at that time as a child, that he was the main reason that this whole setup was the way it was.</span> <span id="s1367">That he had the connection, he knew George Ara Jereczian and he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Do you know what became of him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a relatively younger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are not in Hungary, that they are probably in the U.S., so if ever there is a reunion, I will see them.</span> <span id="s1370">As a matter of fact, I would like to see them because I was deeply in love with one of the, the little Völgyessi girls.</span> <span id="s1371">I was a young kid then, it was just a puppy love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Who else of the group that was with you in the apartment on Zichy Jeno Street survived?</span> <span id="s1373">You and your aunts and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay?</span> <span id="s1375">But, oh you mean since?</span> <span id="s1376">Who's still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: So everyone went through okay, went through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Oh, we went through the same experience and nobody... in that house, the only people who were taken away were a man between eighteen and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or eighteen and fifty-five, before, before October 15th when the labor, when they truly were just going to a labor camp, labor organizations, that is when all the men, so there were no men until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken away.</span> <span id="s1379">So, some of the families who lived there, for example, their father was not with them by that time.</span> <span id="s1380">And, I don't know of anybody who survived.</span> <span id="s1381">In other words, unfortunately, most of these people were then in a forced march toward Germany at the end of the war and somewhere in, probably western Hungary, they were just either killed or died of typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Did you keep in touch with anyone else from the clinic after the war, other than your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1384">You know, I was fifteen when the war ended, and I regret this very much, but outside my family, my family is the only one, and there are only two members living in my family and they are the only ones.</span> <span id="s1385">I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am now really very much interested in keeping up with some other people, but they, they just, they never really bothered and they are not very good letter writers so, and if I go to Hungary, maybe I will look for it, I would like to and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get to the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hungary, if they have some knowledge of, is there a group that still comes together, because there were kids of my age and I'd like to know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: When you returned to your apartment, you described, in our last interview, about returning to your apartment after the war and finding that there were other people who were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Mmm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Were your things, were you furniture, any of your belongings still in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little left in our apartment, what was left, a couple of boxes, and I don't know why they were left there, this family never touched.</span> <span id="s1390">And that, to me, was immediately, I give them some good points for that.</span> <span id="s1391">But when I opened it, our apartment got a direct hit when the siege of Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and most of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheets or something like that, and so they all had big holes in them.</span> <span id="s1392">And, however, a very beautiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins we had for a long time until they disintegrated.</span> <span id="s1393">My wife mended them and we used them.</span> <span id="s1394">And now, what happened to the furniture?</span> <span id="s1395">A lot we give to neighbors to say, “If we come back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us and if we are not, then it is yours,” so, and they took it and now not one of them had a piece left that they can give back to us.</span> <span id="s1396">They all said the same thing: the Russians took it.</span> <span id="s1397">Now, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands, what are they going to do with a piano?</span> <span id="s1398">What are they going to do with a table, what do they need it?</span> <span id="s1399">The Russians only went for one thing.</span> <span id="s1400">Watches.</span> <span id="s1401">They had watches up to their ears, it's as if they had never seen watches before, that was the only thing.</span> <span id="s1402">They stop you on the street and that was the only question, “Davay chasi!”</span> <span id="s1403">That means, “Give me your watch.”</span> <span id="s1404">Nothing else, I mean what can a, a foot soldier who is going on and on and on across Europe, what is he going to do with anything that takes up space and has weight?</span> <span id="s1405">And so it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely nothing was returned from the neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Any of my friends?</span> <span id="s1408">Well, as I mentioned before, my class, junior high class, was practically totally taken and deported under those very unusual circumstances, so I had to look for the kids who were not my schoolmates, but, or either lower or higher classes, and also the ones that I used to play with when I went to the city park which was not far away from us.</span> <span id="s1409">And I would say that about half of them I found, but the other half perished, you know, either because of the fires, you know there was bombs, or because they were killed during the Arrow Cross era, after October 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: You, in our last interview, had talked a little bit about meeting up with some of your friends around Budapest and that you would talk about the war and that was exclusively what you would talk about.</span> <span id="s1411">When you met up with them again after the war, what did you talk about then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it.</span> <span id="s1413">And part of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Party.</span> <span id="s1414">Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts.</span> <span id="s1415">And we found out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up.</span> <span id="s1416">And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the Communist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too.</span> <span id="s1417">Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist Party, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in—on the other side.</span> <span id="s1418">So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1419">And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit.</span> <span id="s1420">So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts.</span> <span id="s1421">But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief.</span> <span id="s1422">And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work.</span> <span id="s1423">Then, you know, this was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists.</span> <span id="s1424">They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure.</span> <span id="s1425">Immediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one occasion.</span> <span id="s1426">And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people.</span> <span id="s1427">And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life.</span> <span id="s1428">My only conflict was with my parents.</span> <span id="s1429">Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group.</span> <span id="s1430">There were many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1431">And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1432">And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans.</span> <span id="s1433">That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of there.</span> <span id="s1434">Even I had a girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days.</span> <span id="s1435">And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was after, but we'll get to this.</span> <span id="s1436">Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these times I went to school, too.</span> <span id="s1437">Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce.</span> <span id="s1438">Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the window.</span> <span id="s1439">So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything.</span> <span id="s1440">So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, “No, I am not going to do that.”</span> <span id="s1441">There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating.</span> <span id="s1442">He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers.</span> <span id="s1443">And I went to see him and I said, “This man should be removed from the school.”</span> <span id="s1444">And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">End of Tape 5, Side A Tape 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I just had to quit.</span> <span id="s1448">And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was a school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still.</span> <span id="s1449">Just like my previous high school was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a teaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you finished—and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the school—you were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education.</span> <span id="s1450">I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any.</span> <span id="s1451">Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we didn't take very seriously.</span> <span id="s1452">So actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school.</span> <span id="s1453">But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma.</span> <span id="s1454">So I had a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and… so these are the two schools.</span> <span id="s1455">Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious.</span> <span id="s1456">Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground.</span> <span id="s1457">As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern European country, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, those countries that knew what democracy was.</span> <span id="s1458">And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of course, Romania was very different.</span> <span id="s1459">But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it.</span> <span id="s1460">So we were doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some Jewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway.</span> <span id="s1461">The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business.</span> <span id="s1462">By 1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1463">By that time we could only go illegally across the border.</span> <span id="s1464">And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town and they knew it.</span> <span id="s1465">My job was to go to the mayor of the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on some given date.</span> <span id="s1466">I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many times because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play.</span> <span id="s1467">I then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date and the concert.</span> <span id="s1468">Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a corner of Budapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything like that.</span> <span id="s1469">And just wait for further instructions there.</span> <span id="s1470">And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle class or upper class.</span> <span id="s1475">I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class.</span> <span id="s1476">My father came from a very low class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary.</span> <span id="s1477">My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town.</span> <span id="s1478">They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining.</span> <span id="s1479">Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious.</span> <span id="s1480">Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them.</span> <span id="s1481">They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me.</span> <span id="s1482">I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1483">But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home.</span> <span id="s1484">And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion.</span> <span id="s1485">And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them.</span> <span id="s1486">And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they became.</span> <span id="s1487">And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there was no law.</span> <span id="s1488">The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that.</span> <span id="s1489">My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1490">And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, “Excuse me, but I don't want to join you.”</span> <span id="s1491">Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched.</span> <span id="s1492">The fact that he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life.</span> <span id="s1493">But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then.</span> <span id="s1494">And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here.</span> <span id="s1495">And, do you have any other questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Mmm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is coming.</span> <span id="s1500">And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1501">That disappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war.</span> <span id="s1502">And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided any kind of such thing.</span> <span id="s1505">I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope.</span> <span id="s1506">Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid.</span> <span id="s1507">So I, and it's not, they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part.</span> <span id="s1508">Now, the ones who are up there, went to college and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews.</span> <span id="s1509">It's a very interesting phenomenon.</span> <span id="s1510">But I have not experienced anything except when, right after the war at school.</span> <span id="s1511">Okay?</span> <span id="s1512">I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans, especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of being in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth.</span> <span id="s1515">The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have.</span> <span id="s1516">We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a country, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous feeling.</span> <span id="s1517">And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1518">And all of a sudden these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking people.</span> <span id="s1519">And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally.</span> <span id="s1520">And they were in charge of all these camps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this.</span> <span id="s1521">I mean, which young person doesn't like this?</span> <span id="s1522">The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, “God, it's beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1523">And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger.</span> <span id="s1524">I remember once I was up in the Börzsöny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released.</span> <span id="s1525">The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders.</span> <span id="s1526">And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people.</span> <span id="s1527">And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew.</span> <span id="s1528">I mean, and when I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those kids.</span> <span id="s1529">And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them.</span> <span id="s1530">And they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got quite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they were leaders because we followed them.</span> <span id="s1531">So the, the bus going back to my escape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there.</span> <span id="s1532">Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food.</span> <span id="s1533">We went in and we were given money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal.</span> <span id="s1534">And she started to flirt with the bus driver.</span> <span id="s1535">And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big problem here, right?</span> <span id="s1536">We knew that we were on a timetable.</span> <span id="s1537">All of a sudden, the bus driver said to our leader, “How long do you think we will be here?”</span> <span id="s1538">And our leader said, “Well, all these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes.”</span> <span id="s1539">He said, “Good, I'll be back.”</span> <span id="s1540">and left with the woman.</span> <span id="s1541">We ate, and our leader said, “Okay, line up outside.”</span> <span id="s1542">And instead of going back to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down in a muddy field, it was February and snow and mud everywhere.</span> <span id="s1543">We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, “Okay, don't worry.</span> <span id="s1544">Everything will be okay.”</span> <span id="s1545">After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were, they said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1546">The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which border, Czech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1547">And once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this.</span> <span id="s1548">So as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip in blue jeans.</span> <span id="s1549">I looked at this woman's face, said, “Hey, I have seen her before.”</span> <span id="s1550">And I looked and said, “This is the woman in the pub.”</span> <span id="s1551">This is to show you how organized they were.</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization.</span> <span id="s1553">I mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1554">If you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive.</span> <span id="s1555">All right?</span> <span id="s1556">Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies.</span> <span id="s1557">Once we got down to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high enough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time.</span> <span id="s1558">Now this is February, imagine.</span> <span id="s1559">We got over to the other side and it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1560">There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet.</span> <span id="s1561">And many of us got sick, right there.</span> <span id="s1562">I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that.</span> <span id="s1563">Now, then the border guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I have ever been colder in my life since then.</span> <span id="s1564">And so we huddled together because now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway beyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, the truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back, we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the time, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">End of Tape 5, Side B Tape 6, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s1567">So you'll say something about the group of people that you were with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics.</span> <span id="s1569">He lives in Israel at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend.</span> <span id="s1570">He's about the only person I keep up with.</span> <span id="s1571">Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there.</span> <span id="s1572">But the others, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out because my wife… Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know.</span> <span id="s1573">Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1574">In Bratislava they took us to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, they took us to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, good food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on.</span> <span id="s1575">And it was very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching.</span> <span id="s1576">And they took us to the railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of Vienna.</span> <span id="s1577">Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1578">We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing we were always warned about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section.</span> <span id="s1579">We were free to wander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and Soviet.</span> <span id="s1580">And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous.</span> <span id="s1581">But, basically, it was a good time.</span> <span id="s1582">Vienna was full of refugees, full of life.</span> <span id="s1583">After one week or so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to Austria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden.</span> <span id="s1584">It is a, on a lake, just the other side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just above our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still pushing for it, we wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s1585">We stayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy.</span> <span id="s1586">In Italy, they took us again to the train station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular train, we just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at that time?</span> <span id="s1587">And we were taken down to Bari.</span> <span id="s1588">Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girls were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one?</span> <span id="s1589">I mean it was a funny thing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls.</span> <span id="s1590">In Bari, a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a ship.</span> <span id="s1591">It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa.</span> <span id="s1592">Everybody got sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought from Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primitive.</span> <span id="s1593">And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych myself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up.</span> <span id="s1594">And I remember I was the only one on the ship who could eat.</span> <span id="s1595">Everybody else was just constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was just yellow and green and wouldn’t want to look at food.</span> <span id="s1596">Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the Loire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, “Shalom haver.”</span> <span id="s1597">And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name.</span> <span id="s1598">And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal—which was a good one—he invited us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor café, to drink something with him.</span> <span id="s1599">And during the conversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he said, “Oh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor.”</span> <span id="s1600">I said, “Where did you sail?”</span> <span id="s1601">He said, In the Mediterranean, of course,” and I said, “What ship?”</span> <span id="s1602">He said, “The Galilea.”</span> <span id="s1603">“What time?”</span> <span id="s1604">He said, “From 1948 to 1950 something.”</span> <span id="s1605">Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was one of the sailors.</span> <span id="s1606">Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, that was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then.</span> <span id="s1607">I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case.</span> <span id="s1610">There were, not everybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own.</span> <span id="s1611">So we lost, I would say, about one-third of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally among the group or did someone else decide it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1614">This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where we were recruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid.</span> <span id="s1615">So almost every Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know?</span> <span id="s1616">So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1617">And who decided it?</span> <span id="s1618">It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except the ones who came from very religious families.</span> <span id="s1621">They knew quite a bit and for them it was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids.</span> <span id="s1622">There were so many Hungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak.</span> <span id="s1623">And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1624">And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with you no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually.</span> <span id="s1625">I was there in Israel for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything.</span> <span id="s1628">Then we got our own land, own piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because part of the train line was in Jordan.</span> <span id="s1629">This was the land that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any mines.</span> <span id="s1630">And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area.</span> <span id="s1631">And so we were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason.</span> <span id="s1632">Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots.</span> <span id="s1633">And I remember that Arab town practically you could see the people on the street, and here we were on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't need.</span> <span id="s1634">I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1637">And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they were just scared to death.</span> <span id="s1638">These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very little.</span> <span id="s1639">And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20th-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them.</span> <span id="s1640">The owner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working.</span> <span id="s1641">As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies.</span> <span id="s1642">Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1643">So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the… Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis.</span> <span id="s1644">So at night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap.</span> <span id="s1645">We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better fence jumpers than we were.</span> <span id="s1646">So this was one contact that we had.</span> <span id="s1647">The other one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons.</span> <span id="s1648">And they would come over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals.</span> <span id="s1649">And they were unbelievably good thieves.</span> <span id="s1650">They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls.</span> <span id="s1651">Nobody could ever figure out how they did it.</span> <span id="s1652">So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come.</span> <span id="s1653">And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?</span> <span id="s1654">And so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there.</span> <span id="s1655">Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending.</span> <span id="s1656">All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them.</span> <span id="s1657">And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know.</span> <span id="s1658">And so they went away.</span> <span id="s1659">Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, “Peace, peace.”</span> <span id="s1660">So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, “Sit down on that side of the border.</span> <span id="s1661">What can we do?”</span> <span id="s1662">They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, “Okay, let's go down.</span> <span id="s1663">What do they want?”</span> <span id="s1664">They just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, “Hey, bring me a watermelon.”</span> <span id="s1665">Yalla Jibbu Battiyah.</span> <span id="s1666">And they brought a watermelon and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff.</span> <span id="s1667">And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s1668">And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, “Oh, we ate in Jordan.”</span> <span id="s1669">And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol.</span> <span id="s1670">What happened, apparently somebody saw them and reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1671">And you know that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab.</span> <span id="s1672">Very innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious.</span> <span id="s1673">I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1674">And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason.</span> <span id="s1675">So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, “How come you speak some Arabic?</span> <span id="s1676">Where did you learn it?”</span> <span id="s1677">And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, “You have one luck that I have a son of your age.”</span> <span id="s1678">He said, “If I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire,” he said, “I am going to just make dust out of you.”</span> <span id="s1679">And of course, we never went back again.</span> <span id="s1680">That was, these are some experiences living on the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Do you remember what you would talk about with these, with the guards before they were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned.</span> <span id="s1683">And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies.</span> <span id="s1684">It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: How many people were members of this kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1687">But other kibbutzim had sometimes mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">End of Tape 6, Side A Tape 6, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Okay, this is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s1690">Did you find that your dream of Israel was fulfilled, the utopian ideal that you had and some of your, your thirst for a place where you felt you belonged, was fulfilled there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: At first I was very, very idealistic.</span> <span id="s1692">Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart.</span> <span id="s1693">And there were more and more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so-called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime and… but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me.</span> <span id="s1694">You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human being.</span> <span id="s1695">There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image of ourselves.</span> <span id="s1696">There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to Hungary eventually in '51.</span> <span id="s1697">One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother.</span> <span id="s1698">Somehow I always considered my mother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood.</span> <span id="s1699">And I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type.</span> <span id="s1700">So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1701">And now he was home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed.</span> <span id="s1702">And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people.</span> <span id="s1703">And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in Israel except the bad things.</span> <span id="s1704">This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was misled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a marvelous country today.</span> <span id="s1705">And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they were afraid what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s1706">And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know?</span> <span id="s1707">I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this.</span> <span id="s1708">Well, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn’t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1709">And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well organized as you were escaping from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1711">When you arrived in the kibbutz, did you, did you share the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work.</span> <span id="s1713">Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today.</span> <span id="s1714">It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect.</span> <span id="s1715">No, I admired the way they carried on.</span> <span id="s1716">Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary.</span> <span id="s1717">And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were some other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to Hungary, was that… was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to become a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, Black Sea, Romania and then Hungary.</span> <span id="s1720">Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few Hungarians in Romania, I then… eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also Romania was tremendously gray and I could only think of 1984, going across Romania.</span> <span id="s1721">And that was only the beginning, 1951, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: You're referring to the book, 1984?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: You're referring to the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Yes, I refer to the book 1984, or the movie rather, okay?</span> <span id="s1726">It's the same thing, but the movie is the one that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania.</span> <span id="s1727">So I arrived on the Hungarian border and here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, “I don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from.”</span> <span id="s1728">And he looked at me and said, “Welcome to Hungary.”</span> <span id="s1729">And this was a border guard officer.</span> <span id="s1730">And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean?</span> <span id="s1731">Well, I learned very quickly.</span> <span id="s1732">When I boarded the train again on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania and then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled.</span> <span id="s1733">Never have I been misled before or after the way I was.</span> <span id="s1734">I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1735">And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent.</span> <span id="s1736">And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a state-owned garage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: How did you get the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist officials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something.</span> <span id="s1739">And that was the only job I could get.</span> <span id="s1740">What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would not want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me.</span> <span id="s1741">Some probably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Because you had been in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it was a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you know.</span> <span id="s1744">So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, “You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there.”</span> <span id="s1745">So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, “Well, I don't have time to write you a recommendation.</span> <span id="s1746">I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth, why don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it.”</span> <span id="s1747">So I passed the first hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this.</span> <span id="s1748">This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for everything, everything.</span> <span id="s1749">So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight people.</span> <span id="s1750">And when they got to certain points, they said, “Come on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here.”</span> <span id="s1751">Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university.</span> <span id="s1752">He came out and he said, “Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?”</span> <span id="s1753">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1754">He said, “Didn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?”</span> <span id="s1755">And he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1756">And he said, “Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe something can be done.”</span> <span id="s1757">Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him.</span> <span id="s1758">And I found him and he said, “Just a second.”</span> <span id="s1759">He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, “I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permission to enter the university.”</span> <span id="s1760">And he said, “Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other.</span> <span id="s1761">Never again.”</span> <span id="s1762">He said, “That is the price.</span> <span id="s1763">You understand?”</span> <span id="s1764">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1765">Said, “and say hello to your dad.”</span> <span id="s1766">That was it.</span> <span id="s1767">I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team.</span> <span id="s1768">And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?</span> <span id="s1769">And this is how I got in.</span> <span id="s1770">And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few.</span> <span id="s1771">And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week.</span> <span id="s1772">Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, “Who are these?”</span> <span id="s1773">They said, “Doctors.”</span> <span id="s1774">And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, “Are they Jewish doctors?”</span> <span id="s1775">And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1776">They said, “Arrest them.”</span> <span id="s1777">And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died.</span> <span id="s1778">And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college.</span> <span id="s1779">They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down.</span> <span id="s1780">So they found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that.</span> <span id="s1781">And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: You mentioned in the last tape that your father had, after he returned from Bor, he was appointed on a committee for housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Mmm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: What, what happened with his work, with his career, did he remain on that committee after the communist takeover, or did he continue, you also mentioned that he went back to work for his former employer, did he continue to work for this former employer?</span> <span id="s1785">What became of his career?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I mentioned, was a volunteer work.</span> <span id="s1787">Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something.</span> <span id="s1788">This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job.</span> <span id="s1789">And it did not require a great deal of his time.</span> <span id="s1790">He immediately looked for some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-between of state farms or state enterprise and private enterprise.</span> <span id="s1791">Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-ops, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working for a co-op where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but also working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the merchandise and do it at home.</span> <span id="s1792">They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and things like that that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home.</span> <span id="s1793">And then they would bring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a warehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked.</span> <span id="s1794">The only problem he had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person.</span> <span id="s1795">But he never joined, he always said, “No, absolutely no.”</span> <span id="s1796">So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Did your mother have to start working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: No, my mother was totally just a mother and a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't remember my mother having, you know, political opinion or anything like that, she had other interests.</span> <span id="s1799">She read a lot and went to the movies and she loved visiting around during the day, she was kind of a social butterfly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: You mentioned that in school you were studying geography and history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: And that the other students who were in school with you were, were also didn't have a lot of sympathy for communism.</span> <span id="s1803">Did you all get together with your classmates and did you, did you talk about politics often, what was the mood like among your, your, your fellow students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics.</span> <span id="s1805">You know, eventually, throughout these years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and… because they were always eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can still talk to them, they’re just careerists and they just want to go ahead.</span> <span id="s1806">But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things.</span> <span id="s1807">Obviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a restaurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what.</span> <span id="s1808">So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college.</span> <span id="s1809">And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements.</span> <span id="s1810">We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a state exam.</span> <span id="s1811">And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which you had a topic.</span> <span id="s1812">And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee.</span> <span id="s1813">And I went to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to read.</span> <span id="s1814">Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others.</span> <span id="s1815">Can we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">End of Tape 6, Side B Tape 7, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: This is tape three, side A of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s1818">Do you want to continue with what you were saying about your. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Oh, the Russian exam.</span> <span id="s1820">And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it.</span> <span id="s1821">But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn’t they realize that something is wrong?</span> <span id="s1822">Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on.</span> <span id="s1823">And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s1824">There were very few people.</span> <span id="s1825">So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year.</span> <span id="s1826">And this was a small village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too.</span> <span id="s1827">And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one.</span> <span id="s1828">And then after this year that I spent in… I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, I had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a summer camp.</span> <span id="s1829">They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if I would like to come and teach in the district.</span> <span id="s1830">And I said, “Naturally, this is it!”</span> <span id="s1831">And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: When did you graduate from college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: '53.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: And so it was in '54?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: So you taught for two years in a suburb of. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1838">One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb.</span> <span id="s1839">Junior high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: You mentioned that you were involved with the Democratic Teacher's Union at one point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union.</span> <span id="s1842">I was not a Party member, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this I wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an anti-communist because you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power, there would be no pogroms and your life is safe.</span> <span id="s1843">And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary, this was their greatest fear, that what will happen to them now.</span> <span id="s1844">And anti-Semitism is now rampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too.</span> <span id="s1845">So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that.</span> <span id="s1846">So I was just teaching in this suburb and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and all this.</span> <span id="s1847">And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council and one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands.</span> <span id="s1848">And I looked out the window and all my desire to ever do anything or to stay there, just went away.</span> <span id="s1849">Right in that moment.</span> <span id="s1850">I realized that this is now when I have to leave.</span> <span id="s1851">Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was transferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know?</span> <span id="s1852">A good salary, I started to write for the newspaper, the… stories about young people.</span> <span id="s1853">I ran camps and financially, and I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain.</span> <span id="s1854">But when I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, “This is it.</span> <span id="s1855">I will never return except to visit.”</span> <span id="s1856">And I told my parents, “In two weeks, I'm leaving.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with young people and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at the time, what, where did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were you teaching, were you teaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a broader range of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the afternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups.</span> <span id="s1859">And I was running the geography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities.</span> <span id="s1860">I took them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts.</span> <span id="s1861">And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big camps.</span> <span id="s1862">But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing.</span> <span id="s1863">I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have.</span> <span id="s1864">A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, “No, a child wants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world.”</span> <span id="s1865">And so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1866">And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my group as adults.</span> <span id="s1867">And when I went back later on, ten years or fifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and they always came and they said, “You know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there.</span> <span id="s1868">And we would have been following you all the way out to the border.”</span> <span id="s1869">I didn't tell them that I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of them learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but eventually went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1870">So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see.</span> <span id="s1871">I even see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people.</span> <span id="s1872">They came from the old communist underground, you know?</span> <span id="s1873">And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people.</span> <span id="s1874">But they would never discuss it because they were too loyal to the Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: When 1956 came and some of the demonstrations started, were you intrigued in any way or did you mainly feel concerned about the fascist elements that you were seeing?</span> <span id="s1876">Did you go to the big demonstration on October 23rd?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1878">I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the crowd.</span> <span id="s1879">The mood of the crowd.</span> <span id="s1880">And so I was in the street all the time, watching what's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent.</span> <span id="s1881">I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s1882">And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back.</span> <span id="s1883">I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents.</span> <span id="s1884">The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: You also mentioned that there was an extreme amount of anti-Semitism during that time.</span> <span id="s1886">Would you just tell me some examples of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism is so rampant, has been and still is, I must conclude that all Catholic countries are that way in Eastern Europe, only the Catholic countries.</span> <span id="s1888">Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries where, and some of them have very little Jews, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews left.</span> <span id="s1889">I have experienced anti-Semitism all the time, [coughs] excuse me, and even when I go home nowadays to visit, well I haven't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters I receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was never very much interested in bringing this out because they are, rather, they consider themselves Hungarians, the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'm always surprised that this is a main concern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed.</span> <span id="s1890">In 1919, Hungary became the first fascist country of Europe, even before Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even today under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for everything just like in the Middle Ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: How long did you have to prepare to leave, you made the decision to leave and then, how long did it take before you actually left and how did you make preparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to fourteen days to get going.</span> <span id="s1893">I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there, too, because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that.</span> <span id="s1894">And eventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to fourteen days, I can't remember exactly, but no more than two weeks.</span> <span id="s1895">I just wanted to see exactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I approach the border, the most practical way, a lot of people were practically there and then captured and brought back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1896">And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in the last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you know, be captured, so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical aspects of how to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">End of Tape 7, Side B Tape 8, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: I’m going to sit next to you, Robert, so we’re not leaning too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1900">I… basically, I want as little to do with Hungary as possible, and Hungary usually come up in my dreams, in a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: It does?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1903">I..</span> <span id="s1904">.</span> <span id="s1905">obviously I’m not that devoted to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1906">I’m not a person who really believes much in national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and religion, than anything else, so I’ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and there... I still am not.</span> <span id="s1907">So, does it sound all right?</span> <span id="s1908">Yeah, an eye on there.</span> <span id="s1909">All those countries, so they wouldn’t turn Fascist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Okay, I’m going to slate the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: It’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: This was probably off the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Yeah, that’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: You don’t want to… although I can, you know, I can…</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: What we can…</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I’m willing to say this on tape, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1921">Okay.</span> <span id="s1922">It’s March 17th, 1999, and we’re in the home of Robert Holczer, in Paris, Kentucky, and conducting an interview that’s... that’s based on his post-Holocaust life, just basically following up on... on a couple of other interviews we’ve done for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and this interview is sponsored jointly by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Kentucky Oral History Commission.</span> <span id="s1923">And I’m Arwen Donahue, here we go.</span> <span id="s1924">Well, I’m curious, before we…</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: …go into the chronology, to hear more about your theory of nations.</span> <span id="s1927">Did... you were talking a little earlier, just about how you really have an ambition of going back to Hungary and finding the people who are living in the same house that you were during war time.</span> <span id="s1928">So, do you... but then again, you don’t have a lot of strong feelings for Hungary.</span> <span id="s1929">Do you dislike going back, when you have visited?</span> <span id="s1930">Or, how do you feel about visiting there, even?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: I’ll hold it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1934">I don’t mind visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don’t mind visiting, because I still have friends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with.</span> <span id="s1935">But, on the whole, when I am there, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just because of what happened to me, it’s also a tremendous generation gap.</span> <span id="s1936">Most of the people of my age, are... [dog barks] probably you have to stop that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Yeah, I’m wondering what... Hungary…</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yes, that I..</span> <span id="s1939">.</span> <span id="s1940">as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I realize is not just what happened... because of what happened to me, but also because I am now a..</span> <span id="s1941">.</span> <span id="s1942">I..</span> <span id="s1943">.</span> <span id="s1944">reaching the age when most people are just not around any more.</span> <span id="s1945">And I..</span> <span id="s1946">.</span> <span id="s1947">it’s a strange thing to walk through streets where you used to play, and you know that nobody is there any more from your previous life.</span> <span id="s1948">However, when I hear some anti-Semitic remarks, which you can hear often in Hungary, even today, or I see some very rude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not to be here, yeah.</span> <span id="s1949">So... and I have never been a patriot of Hungary.</span> <span id="s1950">I’ve never had a Hungarian passport in my life.</span> <span id="s1951">I’ve always been really, stamped.</span> <span id="s1952">Every document I ever had in Hungary, had a big... a ZS on it, which meant I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1953">So, since I was never a first class citizen, not even a second class, no citizen at all, I just don’t have any attachment to the country, as such.</span> <span id="s1954">I do have attachment to certain places where I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Are you an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me, when they hear my accent, what happened to me, how come a foreigner is teaching American government?</span> <span id="s1957">Some of my students question me and I said, “Well, I have been an American much longer than you, and your parents.”</span> <span id="s1958">And so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Do you feel more of an attachment to being... to America than Hungary in any sense?</span> <span id="s1960">I mean, by being a citizen, by having lived here for so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s1962">I must be honest and say that I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most people would have.</span> <span id="s1963">The flag or a national anthem doesn’t really mean much to me.</span> <span id="s1964">I don’t consider that patriotism.</span> <span id="s1965">But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution, and I appreciate the fact that I can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my patriotism manifests itself this way, and not by waving the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Did you know anything about the Constitution before you came, or how did you learn about... about the Constitution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: No, I didn’t, because I couldn’t... I couldn’t read it, I didn’t speak English, and in Hungary, they were not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was growing up.</span> <span id="s1968">But when I came here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I went back to school, and was a history major, I had to... so, base... my first encounter with the Constitution was in college, in Fresno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: And what... what impressed you about it, or what was your response to it when you first _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admire the people who wrote it.</span> <span id="s1971">I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I wish that we had some of that caliber walking around today in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Was becoming a citizen of the United States an important event for you?</span> <span id="s1973">Did it mean anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport.</span> <span id="s1975">And the fact that now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20th century, the fact that you are a human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, is not sufficient proof for you to travel around the world and be protected by international law.</span> <span id="s1976">Considering all this, I felt much safer now that I have a country behind me and I am protected in case I am in trouble somewhere.</span> <span id="s1977">Yes, it meant a great deal, because those days, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a sense of security that I had from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Well, going back to then, when you first arrived in the United States, in 1956?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Do you remember your conceptions, your ideas about what the United States was then and what you actually found and what your first impressions were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially the U.S. was never painted as a paradise.</span> <span id="s1982">Never even painted as any country that is desirable to live in.</span> <span id="s1983">All I heard about it was negative.</span> <span id="s1984">However, I was raised in a family, my father was a very enlightened man, and he raised me on the truth, so I knew that this is the country of the free.</span> <span id="s1985">And I had no qualms about this.</span> <span id="s1986">The thing that bothered me a great deal about coming here, and also I, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this was not my first choice, you know, I had to follow my cousin.</span> <span id="s1987">What bothered me, I have... I was never that much in favor of modern times and fast times, and a landscape with skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life.</span> <span id="s1988">I was a typical European, who felt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered houses, and a lot of people on the street, and sidewalk cafés, and little restaurants.</span> <span id="s1989">Then to go to a country where none of this would exist.</span> <span id="s1990">So I had my reservations this way, emotionally.</span> <span id="s1991">I had no qualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a place that doesn’t have much traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Did you find that to be true, that your impression was that there was no tradition here, or did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Yes, yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1994">I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example Christmas.</span> <span id="s1995">I consider our life here quite plastic and I understand why.</span> <span id="s1996">I am not faulting anyone for it.</span> <span id="s1997">I know that a country that is so young as the United State, just never had the opportunity to develop those traditions that European countries have, that existed now for thousands of years.</span> <span id="s1998">And so... But it is just sad.</span> <span id="s1999">I feel that a great deal of problems come from the fact that we are so young, and we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager who just became totally uncoordinated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: But you mentioned that your father taught you about America, that it was... that it was the Land of the Free.</span> <span id="s2001">What did that mean to you?</span> <span id="s2002">What did that mean to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we listened to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure, even the Voice of America could be heard.</span> <span id="s2004">And, of course there, we heard a great deal about the western... so-called western world.</span> <span id="s2005">And realized that while we are living there as practical slaves, in the western world, people have a very good life.</span> <span id="s2006">And that appealed to me a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: How long were you in Camp Kilmer, when you first arrived in the U.S., in New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: I think it was no more than two weeks.</span> <span id="s2009">It was just a screening process to just give a very superficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the country.</span> <span id="s2010">They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately, people who were sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the United States.</span> <span id="s2011">For example, if you had TB.</span> <span id="s2012">And then, from there... and also, they were in charge of sending you somewhere.</span> <span id="s2013">So, they were kind of dispatchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: So it was then that you got sent to…</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time, adopted, of course, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united.</span> <span id="s2020">They were a..</span> <span id="s2021">.</span> <span id="s2022">you might say upper-middle class American family with some problems and they thought that getting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstances.</span> <span id="s2023">And I was, within weeks, working for a wholesale jewelry company.</span> <span id="s2024">I was just a stockboy.</span> <span id="s2025">And, very simple work, and that was my job.</span> <span id="s2026">And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with me, of course, we were walking around and going to a movie, even though we couldn’t understand much of it.</span> <span id="s2027">But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society.</span> <span id="s2028">And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television.</span> <span id="s2029">And the family was... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we could never figure out what his moves would be next.</span> <span id="s2030">The... his wife was a very darling woman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian refugees, the situation might change.</span> <span id="s2031">They had a mentally retarded son in an institution, who came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young man, who was always creating something electrical, or mechanical, even.</span> <span id="s2032">So, we had good relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only when we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don’t know where she is.</span> <span id="s2033">I understand they got a divorce after.</span> <span id="s2034">It was in... unbearable to live with somebody who was so unpredictable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: You mean when you left for Europe to move there with Jan and…</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: ... much later.</span> <span id="s2038">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2039">Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in the United States?</span> <span id="s2040">I know you had the idea originally that you didn’t want to stay, and you wanted to go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s2041">Were you thinking, after you had arrived, that you would actually stay?</span> <span id="s2042">What... What were your thoughts about the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if I wanted to, and be accepted by a..</span> <span id="s2044">.</span> <span id="s2045">any country and get some legal status anywhere.</span> <span id="s2046">The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn’t really do much about it any more.</span> <span id="s2047">So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn’t want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s2048">Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone.</span> <span id="s2049">I worked mainly, this is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms.</span> <span id="s2050">And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time.</span> <span id="s2051">You were either of German descent, or you were Black.</span> <span id="s2052">And luckily, when I became very, very upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be... to go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home.</span> <span id="s2053">And they introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s2054">I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s2055">And many times, in a huge dance hall, I was the only white face.</span> <span id="s2056">And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers?</span> <span id="s2058">What was the story with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn’t prevent them from being prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2060">It was just a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person.</span> <span id="s2061">And I felt this, everywhere.</span> <span id="s2062">I just... and the situation at home, where I was staying with these people, was also not very happy.</span> <span id="s2063">And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country and the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much.</span> <span id="s2066">In one of these weekend excursions, I was introduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date.</span> <span id="s2067">And eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in danger, and my life was in danger.</span> <span id="s2068">And she said, “You don’t understand this now, but twenty years from now you will understand.</span> <span id="s2069">And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each other.”</span> <span id="s2070">And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know, basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: So, up until then, you really hadn’t realized what a strong division there was, or what a taboo there was against interracial relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I thought I am coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive about these things.</span> <span id="s2073">And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, that I knew could not be erased very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you were there?</span> <span id="s2075">Was there... were there any at… you know, discussions, just in the wake of the Brown versus Board of Education decision that interracial education would be happening?</span> <span id="s2076">I mean, were you aware, or... that the schools would stop being segregated?</span> <span id="s2077">Were there any things like that happening in Saint Louis that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone.</span> <span id="s2079">So I only lived there for five months or so.</span> <span id="s2080">And I..</span> <span id="s2081">.</span> <span id="s2082">my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss anything political with people.</span> <span id="s2083">I did watch television, because I felt that it was a good way to learn, and I got certain ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met, you know, this kind of a problem in Saint Louis, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: How did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have to, you learn everything.</span> <span id="s2086">You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English.</span> <span id="s2087">No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn.</span> <span id="s2088">Not so easy to write, but to learn, because it’s... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages.</span> <span id="s2089">I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it.</span> <span id="s2090">I could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s2091">I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through.</span> <span id="s2092">And among all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most progress, because I just decided I don’t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don’t want anything to do with this.</span> <span id="s2093">I really want to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: It was a..</span> <span id="s2095">.</span> <span id="s2096">you mentioned in the last interview that it was a friendship with... was it a professor at Washington University?</span> <span id="s2097">Was that how you got out of Saint Louis and to Aspen?</span> <span id="s2098">How did your acquaintance with this man come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: He saw a newspaper article about us, in the... I think it was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch.</span> <span id="s2100">He... Because we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees.</span> <span id="s2101">And he cut it out and misplaced it somewhere, and only a few month after, somehow th-the article came up and he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house.</span> <span id="s2102">And by that time my cousin was gone, so I went and I met him and his family.</span> <span id="s2103">He just wanted to socialize and talk about the days in Hungary.</span> <span id="s2104">He came to... he had come to this country before I, right after World War II.</span> <span id="s2105">And his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and they had one son.</span> <span id="s2106">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: But they were not Jewish, were they, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Yes, yes…</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: ... were... they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: ... they were.</span> <span id="s2111">And... but of course, this doesn’t have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s2112">Interestingly, I last... I lost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year when I went to Aspen.</span> <span id="s2113">And Mrs. Chabay was there.</span> <span id="s2114">The professor, Mr. Chabay, was already dead, but she was there, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement home.</span> <span id="s2115">And so I had a good chat with her about the good old days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: When you met them, did they ask you about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s2117">Did you talk at all about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally.</span> <span id="s2119">But they were also very much interested in my... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good.</span> <span id="s2120">Something happened to me after I moved out of my original family, and established my independence.</span> <span id="s2121">For a couple of month, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a room, because they needed some money, and they had a room with a separate entrance, so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad experience, and so I was just ready to leave, anywhere, in the United States.</span> <span id="s2122">And this is when they showed me a film of Aspen, Colorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was a member of the music festival staff, and said, “You are coming with us.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Do you want to say anything about the experience that you had, that was bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Well, it was... I don’t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it, but it was just a strange coincidence that my father’s company’s... every company in Hungary had a Party secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what was going on.</span> <span id="s2125">And my father’s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who rented the room.</span> <span id="s2126">So, he and his wife immediately, when this came to the surface, they immediately were afraid that I might report on them back to Hungary, which I had no interest, I couldn’t care less, except one day they... I heard a big argument and I realized that they were arguing about abortion.</span> <span id="s2127">The man wanted his wife to abort, she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s2128">They were very... social climbers, real social climbers, who were constantly adding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when and how they can move, they can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the last on their priority list.</span> <span id="s2129">And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home, and she was in a pool of blood.</span> <span id="s2130">She had done something to herself, and I found her, and it… End of Tape 8, Side A Tape 8, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: This is tape one, side B, of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s2132">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: And so the young man knew now that I..</span> <span id="s2134">.</span> <span id="s2135">we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would report this back to his mother.</span> <span id="s2136">And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his mother.</span> <span id="s2137">Then, next, the mail from home stopped.</span> <span id="s2138">I did not get any, any, any mail, which was very strange, because I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall write to each other.</span> <span id="s2139">They received letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to you?</span> <span id="s2140">And nothing.</span> <span id="s2141">This went on for weeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the woman confidentially asked me to step aside, and told me that she was with them somewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were saying that they are stopping all my mail and stuff it under their mattress.</span> <span id="s2142">I left the place very quickly, I went home, looked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted them with this, and I knew that I would have to move out, and that’s exactly when this happened, that I was invited and they said, “Oh, you come with us.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: So you went to Aspen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2145">I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise.</span> <span id="s2146">Not only that it was beautiful and now, I had always been a mountain man, but the people, I just loved the people.</span> <span id="s2147">That was way before Aspen was discovered and made into the rich man’s Mecca.</span> <span id="s2148">It was now a..</span> <span id="s2149">.</span> <span id="s2150">it was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th Mountain Division that exist... that trained there during World War II, and many of its members came back and established Aspen.</span> <span id="s2151">It was just a marvelous group of people.</span> <span id="s2152">Today, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on streets, and the recreation centers and parks.</span> <span id="s2153">And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return and see all my friends names as street names and park names and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about the place that was so appealing to you, and also how that changed your perception of the United States, if it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: What appealed to me is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other.</span> <span id="s2156">The winters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists coming to the music festival.</span> <span id="s2157">You needed other people’s help and you had to help others, too.</span> <span id="s2158">There was just a camaraderie there, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal.</span> <span id="s2159">I was still young, and the fact that I could get a job where I..</span> <span id="s2160">.</span> <span id="s2161">my hours were not so regimented, even then... there, I felt so free.</span> <span id="s2162">The pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other areas of the United States.</span> <span id="s2163">There was so much color in the place.</span> <span id="s2164">All kinds of people coming and going.</span> <span id="s2165">It was just a..</span> <span id="s2166">.</span> <span id="s2167">for a newcomer, it was a marvelous, marvelous introduction to American life.</span> <span id="s2168">There were people there who were truly the most middle class, rigid family.</span> <span id="s2169">There were people who were a very relaxed family.</span> <span id="s2170">All kinds, and they were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me.</span> <span id="s2171">I also loved the fact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state back then, that some miner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them back at the turn of the century when the panic came and many of those miners went back to Italy and you... what is today Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2172">So, there was a little bit of the old.</span> <span id="s2173">Not everything was concrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few buildings.</span> <span id="s2174">I was very glad to see that not everything is rebuilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: When you formed friendships with people and made contact with people there, did they... were they interested in your past, and where you’d come from and what had happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s2176">Did anyone ask you about that, and did you feel compelled to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested.</span> <span id="s2178">These were the type of people, the locals and well, most people worked in businesses that catered to tourists.</span> <span id="s2179">And it was an asset if you had an accent, and if you look like somebody who had an interesting past, because they... sometimes they hired me for a certain job just because I had a story.</span> <span id="s2180">And yes, people were constantly questioning you about this, and I couldn’t care less, it... as a matter of fact, I enjoyed this kind of fifteen minutes in the sun.</span> <span id="s2181">And so, I mean, in this respect, I had no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Did you find that people had an understanding of what had happened during the war, and the history of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Mm, mm, well no, not much.</span> <span id="s2184">The only people with whom I could really communicate about the war, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European theater, and as I, as I mentioned before, many of the so-called 10th Mountain Division’s members settled there, and I loved to talk to them, because they were very much involved in the liberation of some of the European countries, so they knew where I came from.</span> <span id="s2185">I just have to add one more thing to this, that interestingly, the reason I am so fond of Aspen, even today, because I believe that my life in America was shaped by that two and a half years I spent in Aspen.</span> <span id="s2186">Almost every major friendship, almost every major contact I had, after I left Aspen, was based on something that happened to me in Aspen.</span> <span id="s2187">Almost every one of them.</span> <span id="s2188">I still am very close, and my closest friends today, I say, in the U.S. are those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little café house called the Epicure.</span> <span id="s2191">And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when a very nice looking Austrian gentleman stopped by and, who looked, I remember, who looked exactly like the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me... he watched me washing dishes and he said, “Oh, I am so and so, I am a friend of Mr. Chabay.”</span> <span id="s2192">And that was the gentleman who brought me to Aspen.</span> <span id="s2193">He said, “And I would like you to come over and see my shop.”</span> <span id="s2194">And he brought me over to his shop, he had a nice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a watchmaker and that was his main profession, but he also had a very, very nice place.</span> <span id="s2195">And he asked me... we conversed in German, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he said, “How do you like my shop?”</span> <span id="s2196">And I said, “What a nice, nice, cute place.”</span> <span id="s2197">He said, “Would you like to work for me?</span> <span id="s2198">I can give you this much,” which was a lot more than washing dishes.</span> <span id="s2199">I said, “But how can you hire me?</span> <span id="s2200">I don’t speak English.”</span> <span id="s2201">He said, “I didn’t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.”</span> <span id="s2202">And he said... And I said, “Yes,” and he said, “You’re hired.”</span> <span id="s2203">And that was the kind of attitude that prevailed in Aspen.</span> <span id="s2204">Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding.</span> <span id="s2205">So I worked for Kurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July.</span> <span id="s2206">And our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he’s the one, he and his wife, in their eighties, I visited them last year.</span> <span id="s2207">Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse me.</span> <span id="s2208">A young man came in around September, and by that time there weren’t too many people in Aspen, because it’s a seasonal place.</span> <span id="s2209">At least back then, the off season, you could hardly see anybody in the street.</span> <span id="s2210">At the end of September, people were leaving, the music festival was over, and the ski season came around in December.</span> <span id="s2211">So everybody left, vacation, travel.</span> <span id="s2212">A young man came in and started to talk to me.</span> <span id="s2213">He said, “I got a problem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.”</span> <span id="s2214">I said, “Look, that’s not... shouldn’t be a problem.”</span> <span id="s2215">In my broken English I said that, and he looked at me and he immediately said, “Well, where are you from?”</span> <span id="s2216">And of course, the whole story came about and I said, “Well, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother?”</span> <span id="s2217">He said, “Because she has everything.”</span> <span id="s2218">And this is how I met a then young man by the name of Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family.</span> <span id="s2219">And on his twenty-first birthday he received a nightclub from his parents, called, The Limelite.</span> <span id="s2220">He just kept coming back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends.</span> <span id="s2221">We’d occasionally go out at night and he would bring his date and I would bring a date, and had a very nice relationship.</span> <span id="s2222">And then he came back later on, and he said, “I have to leave my place, and there are three apartments in the nightclub.</span> <span id="s2223">I just hate to leave the place unattended.</span> <span id="s2224">Would you mind moving into one of the apartments?</span> <span id="s2225">You can just stay there, and when I come back we can just share apartments, and no problem.”</span> <span id="s2226">Well, who’d... who would refuse a free apartment?</span> <span id="s2227">I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came back in December to open it that year, he said to me, “Look, I desperately need somebody that I can trust, to be the cashier.</span> <span id="s2228">How would you like to work for me?”</span> <span id="s2229">He said, “I double your salary.”</span> <span id="s2230">And I said, “Well, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love dearly and I just... I just can’t leave.”</span> <span id="s2231">He said, “Oh, this is America.</span> <span id="s2232">We don’t have to worry about that.</span> <span id="s2233">I’ll take care of that, I’ll talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2234">He said, “You know, Robert, here, we don’t even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my check somewhere.”</span> <span id="s2235">He says, “There’s no loyalty here.”</span> <span id="s2236">I said, “No?</span> <span id="s2237">You want me to be loyal to you.”</span> <span id="s2238">The conversation went on and on and on and I said, “Well, I just cannot go to my friend, Kurt Breznits and say, ‘I am leaving,’ because you double my salary.”</span> <span id="s2239">But the truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school.</span> <span id="s2240">That was my aim, that once I mastered the language, I would go back to school.</span> <span id="s2241">So, by the... I went to work next day, and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, “Robert, you don’t have to have these problems in this country.</span> <span id="s2242">This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be delighted if you can make twice as much money as you made here.</span> <span id="s2243">I can’t afford that salary.”</span> <span id="s2244">But I said, “But we were such good friends.”</span> <span id="s2245">He said, “Well, from now on, as long as you’re in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.”</span> <span id="s2246">So... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early dinner, just so I can come.</span> <span id="s2247">And we had dinner together and talked a great deal.</span> <span id="s2248">And we saw each other other nights too, but that problem was solved, but I could never understand this distance that is between employees and employers.</span> <span id="s2249">I’m still, even in my old days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave.</span> <span id="s2250">I know it’s silly, but it was just pounded into me that you are loyal.</span> <span id="s2251">And so I worked for the Limelite, which became a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the time when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you know, the great time of folk singing.</span> <span id="s2252">Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them came to this nightclub.</span> <span id="s2253">And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I ended up managing the place.</span> <span id="s2254">And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, because his hated nightclub was sold.</span> <span id="s2255">He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were singing there, three, four people, and they formed a group called “The Limeliters,” named after the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him.</span> <span id="s2256">So, he sold the club, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left.</span> <span id="s2257">But I maintained relations with one of the group, and his family.</span> <span id="s2258">These are people who still very much around today, you know, the four.</span> <span id="s2259">And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who was my friend, is still producing CD’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to continue your education?</span> <span id="s2261">Was that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the money to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some kind of a business, was more and more expensive.</span> <span id="s2263">As Aspen became more and more fashionable, everything became more expensive.</span> <span id="s2264">Besides, I had no interest in opening a business.</span> <span id="s2265">I always thought of myself as an educator.</span> <span id="s2266">I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska.</span> <span id="s2267">They said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it’s fascinating, and it’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s2268">And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try to make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Why Fresno?</span> <span id="s2270">Why Fresno?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: Why Fresno?</span> <span id="s2272">Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I’m the most unlikely person to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction.</span> <span id="s2273">Hundred, hundred ten degrees heat.</span> <span id="s2274">Why Fresno?</span> <span id="s2275">Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary.</span> <span id="s2276">It was against the law, at that time, to send anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with somebody.</span> <span id="s2277">And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they were afraid to do that.</span> <span id="s2278">But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we’ll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that.</span> <span id="s2279">And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education.</span> <span id="s2280">And so I applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship.</span> <span id="s2281">That’s what it was called back then.</span> <span id="s2282">And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in Fresno.</span> <span id="s2283">And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very unknown to me.</span> <span id="s2284">And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... Fresno is the center of the Armenian population in America.</span> <span id="s2285">And they were... I hit it off with them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master thesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the Armenians were persecuted terribly.</span> <span id="s2286">And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation is all good.</span> <span id="s2287">And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that I was very sympathetic to Kemal Ataturk.</span> <span id="s2288">Of course, I condemned the method of getting rid of Armenians, but I was... I found some goodness.</span> <span id="s2289">So we had some little differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno.</span> <span id="s2290">I liked them.</span> <span id="s2291">I had a lot of foreign, foreign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, than if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish.</span> <span id="s2292">Here I had a chance to talk to professors.</span> <span id="s2293">It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Were you feeling surprised that you’d been to several very different places in the country, with very different atmospheres.</span> <span id="s2295">Were you surprised at how much variation there was in this country, that you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe…</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Uniformity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, “This is not a country, this is a continent.”</span> <span id="s2299">I said, “Don’t think in terms of a country, this is a continent.”</span> <span id="s2300">It’s... it will be that way for a long, long time, and I think it still is.</span> <span id="s2301">When I travel, in spite of the uniformity that modern age brings, you can still see that it is... it’ll take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn’t, perhaps this is the way it should be, that we still have areas that... like you can open your eyes and realize that you are not in Chicago, or not in New York.</span> <span id="s2302">And hope that they will keep it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your first interview about what happened then, and how you... how you had gone from... it was after you got your Master’s degree, you went from Fresno to teaching, in a special ed school, in Marin county, and you mentioned you had a..</span> <span id="s2304">.</span> <span id="s2305">you had wanted to go there because you had girlfriend in the area.</span> <span id="s2306">And do you want to say anything more about that time, or do you want to go on to saying something about... I’d be interested in hearing how you met Jan and what... kind of how your relationship grew, and was built, and whether... and what she knew about your past and what you talked... I’m getting ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s2307">Why don’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: No, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: ... you answer my first question first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me that was just incredible.</span> <span id="s2311">I practically pinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked around, and the scenery.</span> <span id="s2312">I just couldn’t believe that I was that lucky.</span> <span id="s2313">I just couldn’t find words to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the San Francisco Bay Area had for me.</span> <span id="s2314">And still, it holds just a fascination.</span> <span id="s2315">It’s almost like Europe in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2316">I lived in Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2317">I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself.</span> <span id="s2318">Today, of course, it would be impossible.</span> <span id="s2319">And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex, overlooking what they call Raccoon Straight.</span> <span id="s2320">And these are small, little islands in the bay.</span> <span id="s2321">The sailboats were going back and forth all day.</span> <span id="s2322">Tourists, you know, boats, and it was just a very, very picturesque environment.</span> <span id="s2323">The type of people I associated with, mainly through school, through my job, were very pleasant.</span> <span id="s2324">Most of them were very young, and we did a lot of things together.</span> <span id="s2325">I also had plenty of opportunity, of course, to go on my own.</span> <span id="s2326">And those days, I just was a restless spirit.</span> <span id="s2327">I had a tendency to walk down, for example, at night, and see the streets... the lights of San Francisco, and just feel that there is something going on in the city that I’m not part of, and I just have to hop into my car and go there.</span> <span id="s2328">And I did that, and it was then fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, I was in the city, going around.</span> <span id="s2329">And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a couple of things.</span> <span id="s2330">And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I’m not part of it, so I hopped in my car and went back.</span> <span id="s2331">So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty which really was just around me, all over.</span> <span id="s2332">And I loved to hike up on Mount Tamalpais.</span> <span id="s2333">Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I would live my life here, probably forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: What year was it?</span> <span id="s2335">What year was it when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: 1961.</span> <span id="s2337">And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching mentally retarded students, but I didn’t mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian proverb that said for any... for something that you like, you would even let people chop wood on your back, and I strongly believe in this.</span> <span id="s2338">And so, I just... I didn’t really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children.</span> <span id="s2339">As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you.</span> <span id="s2340">Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too.</span> <span id="s2341">But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion.</span> <span id="s2342">And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself, I’m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating... teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing.</span> <span id="s2343">And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher’s meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never have dusty shoes.</span> <span id="s2344">And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every hour, I mean it was strange.</span> <span id="s2345">And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn’t much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women.</span> <span id="s2346">And... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children.</span> <span id="s2347">And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn’t really want others to know much about her.</span> <span id="s2348">And I found out later there was a reason for that.</span> <span id="s2349">Then… and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, “Oh, this lady’s quite cold.”</span> <span id="s2350">That was my first impression.</span> <span id="s2351">And never bothered really much.</span> <span id="s2352">But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me up, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Mentally retarded teachers, or students?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2355">No, teachers of retarded students.</span> <span id="s2356">And she called me up and she wanted my advice in something, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">End of Tape 8, Side B Tape 9, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm.</span> <span id="s2360">And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn’t call me and ask for help.</span> <span id="s2361">And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other.</span> <span id="s2362">But we never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out.</span> <span id="s2363">And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, “Oh, by the way, Jan got a divorce.</span> <span id="s2364">She is divorced, and she looks good.”</span> <span id="s2365">And according to... excuse me... according to Jan, I said, “Wow,” which I deny.</span> <span id="s2366">I never said such thing.</span> <span id="s2367">But anyway, this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her.</span> <span id="s2368">So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right.</span> <span id="s2369">And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was a pretty serious relationship.</span> <span id="s2370">But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was not going to get married without giving it some thought.</span> <span id="s2371">So, I did what my previous girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany.</span> <span id="s2372">And I arrived there, and I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right person for me, so I came home.</span> <span id="s2373">And we got married on Mount Tamalpais, on the top of Mount Tamalpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the mountain we both saw every day, coming and going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: How old were her children at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Five, six and eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the war at some point, or did you tell... did they know anything about your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now.</span> <span id="s2378">As little children, they kept asking me a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, maybe they fear they knew... they heard everything.</span> <span id="s2379">But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just as a pastime, never really ask any questions.</span> <span id="s2380">And they are around movies concerning the Holocaust and... back those days.</span> <span id="s2381">But no.</span> <span id="s2382">But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a bit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2383">They were too little, and I didn’t want to, of course, cause nightmares, but it was mainly just life, what was life when I grew up and what I..</span> <span id="s2384">.</span> <span id="s2385">the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent.</span> <span id="s2386">They thought that a baby is going to be born with an accent.</span> <span id="s2387">And they laughed at my mistakes that I made, because sometimes they were really funny.</span> <span id="s2388">And inadvertently, I did say certain things that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Pardon me?</span> <span id="s2391">Such as, I..</span> <span id="s2392">.</span> <span id="s2393">for a long time, I thought that fungus is really fangus, and so everybody called fungus a fangus.</span> <span id="s2394">Once I told them something about a lawyer, and I..</span> <span id="s2395">.</span> <span id="s2396">instead of lawyer, I kept saying liar.</span> <span id="s2397">And they couldn’t understand, and in the end they said, the difference is of no... when I learn, I said, “God, there is no difference, lawyers, liars, what’s the difference?”</span> <span id="s2398">And so there were many cute episodes.</span> <span id="s2399">Drift and draft, I remember I had trouble distinguishing that.</span> <span id="s2400">“Close the... close the door, because there is a drift.”</span> <span id="s2401">And so ever since, everybody called it drift and not draft.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: What about Jan?</span> <span id="s2403">Did you talk with Jan about your much... in the early times of your getting to know each other, about your experiences during the Holocaust, and about just the Holocaust in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2405">There is no problem there.</span> <span id="s2406">She really wanted to know everything and I told her everything.</span> <span id="s2407">And she read a great deal.</span> <span id="s2408">And, as a matter of fact, she is my police woman, because she doesn’t allow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television, because she says I have such nightmares that she doesn’t want to wake me up and it just... too much trouble.</span> <span id="s2409">But I was amazed that after we got married, how much time she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books on Jewish history, and then, of course, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks.</span> <span id="s2410">She has Jewish cookbooks and she knows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when somebody ask me about some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her, because she knows a lot more about it than I do.</span> <span id="s2411">I just, because of my indifference to religion, I just never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the background, but she did.</span> <span id="s2412">And of course, there was never any question about conversion, anything like this, because I myself, I was not practicing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: How... was her family accepting of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn’t have liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone.</span> <span id="s2415">Her mother was a very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married.</span> <span id="s2416">So, the only relatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20th-Century human beings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: Okay, so you stayed in the Bay Area until 1974, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2420">What did you think of... were you aware of what was going on with the... with the Summer of Love, and the Free Speech Movement and all that stuff that was happening in Berkeley, and San Francisco in the late sixties?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2422">By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could understand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene very much.</span> <span id="s2423">For example, I remember when I..</span> <span id="s2424">.</span> <span id="s2425">even before I settled in the Bay Area, I would come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in San Francisco, to the beatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people.</span> <span id="s2426">I really enjoyed the beatnik era.</span> <span id="s2427">I liked those people, they were very introspective and intelligent.</span> <span id="s2428">There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated.</span> <span id="s2429">Occasionally, when somebody played the piano, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading.</span> <span id="s2430">They were all part of the scene.</span> <span id="s2431">That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to North Beach.</span> <span id="s2432">Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back from Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything started, especially the Vietnam War flared up.</span> <span id="s2433">And our family was very much involved in that.</span> <span id="s2434">We were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs.</span> <span id="s2435">My wife joined the Another Mother for Peace movement.</span> <span id="s2436">We were demonstrating, and there was a very cute episode that happened to us.</span> <span id="s2437">She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice, flowery material to make a dress.</span> <span id="s2438">And we went to a big demonstration over in Berkeley, and had to make our own signs.</span> <span id="s2439">And we were getting the signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin’s sign, and what did we see?</span> <span id="s2440">A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we realized it was her dress material that she had bought.</span> <span id="s2441">He was so fascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had to have flowers on your signs, that he didn’t think twice, and he was cutting out the flowers from... what... we didn’t know what to do about it, and then we decided just to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn’t get punished.</span> <span id="s2442">So that was Vietnam.</span> <span id="s2443">My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that she fears that he should not run again.</span> <span id="s2444">And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and he announced that he would not run.</span> <span id="s2445">So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for that decision.</span> <span id="s2446">But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times.</span> <span id="s2447">And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then.</span> <span id="s2448">We also lived, by that time, in Inverness, in an area that was in the center of all these cults, and rock bands and so the kids were exposed to all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the hills.</span> <span id="s2449">It had advantages, it had disadvantages.</span> <span id="s2450">The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter what parents would say to their children, they always had a place to go and because these rock groups had open house, you could help yourself at the fridge, or whatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it.</span> <span id="s2451">And so it was in a..</span> <span id="s2452">.</span> <span id="s2453">in the sense, difficult.</span> <span id="s2454">And many of our children in the area, were runaways.</span> <span id="s2455">They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about the Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to them?</span> <span id="s2457">And did you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how were you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2459">Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, but as you were asking me, I realize I didn’t really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s2460">I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak.</span> <span id="s2461">I was more involved in what is happening in America, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give too much thought about the past.</span> <span id="s2462">So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts.</span> <span id="s2463">So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect.</span> <span id="s2464">And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were oppressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: But you did have nightmares about the past, you mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by watching some television story, or reading something in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s2467">Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming distant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you’re... you’re there in this nation that had perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States.</span> <span id="s2469">Was it a bigger issue that The Holocaust?</span> <span id="s2470">Was it more of a..</span> <span id="s2471">.</span> <span id="s2472">did it have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: The... now, this is a very complex story.</span> <span id="s2474">When we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the open.</span> <span id="s2475">It was not something hushed up under the rug.</span> <span id="s2476">There were discussions about it in schools.</span> <span id="s2477">I spoke about it to high school students, mainly.</span> <span id="s2478">The whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification.</span> <span id="s2479">Now, I must also say that there weren’t too many people who were alive in World War II, by this time.</span> <span id="s2480">Because I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost.</span> <span id="s2481">And so, most people are dead, who were in World War II.</span> <span id="s2482">Now of course, it doesn’t mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was dead.</span> <span id="s2483">Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything.</span> <span id="s2484">It would have been totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn’t have made any difference.</span> <span id="s2485">I rather concentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation.</span> <span id="s2486">And I found that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2487">They were very ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially.</span> <span id="s2488">I felt that they were progressive enough.</span> <span id="s2489">The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light.</span> <span id="s2490">How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany joining.</span> <span id="s2491">A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany.</span> <span id="s2492">So, those people had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it.</span> <span id="s2493">And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East Germany, even today.</span> <span id="s2494">Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification didn’t bring immediate remedies to all their problems.</span> <span id="s2495">So they had to again go back and blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren’t too many.</span> <span id="s2496">So, since they couldn’t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: You were living in Frankfurt at the time that the Wall... that the Berlin Wall came down?</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: Do you... Did you foresee any of this?</span> <span id="s2500">Did you, at the time... what were your emotions at the time, and your thoughts at the time that the Wall came down and you were seeing the... that there was this... unification was going to be happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of history that is... has just very, very few companions.</span> <span id="s2502">That it was something extraordinary.</span> <span id="s2503">And now, just a couple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime, something like this will happen.</span> <span id="s2504">But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then, then, it was inevitable.</span> <span id="s2505">It still, it was a surprise, and it was naturally something that will always be in my mind, because just a few weeks before, my granddaughter, who was about fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we went to the Wall in Berlin, and we had pictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that you can bring back your children here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day, and the Wall will still be here.</span> <span id="s2506">And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Did your... have you talked to your grandchildren about... have they been interested in a..</span> <span id="s2508">.</span> <span id="s2509">in your experiences during the Holocaust, or ask you questions about…</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who is twenty-four... I’m sorry, twenty-four?</span> <span id="s2511">No, no, twenty-two, I talk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2512">And we usually go together to movies, not necessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we saw, “Life is Beautiful” together, and I make a point to take her to movies that deal with history... modern history, or the Holocaust, so we can talk about it.</span> <span id="s2513">I want her to know everything.</span> <span id="s2514">The, the... I have two grandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2515">And they are at the... they were at the age, they went through too fast for my taste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will slow down.</span> <span id="s2516">And the other... grandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: So, when you were in Germany, you were teaching... were you teaching American students?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American high school, where The American Army and the American diplomat’s kids would go.</span> <span id="s2519">Just like any other high school.</span> <span id="s2520">We had a..</span> <span id="s2521">.</span> <span id="s2522">that was a school district, just like an American school district.</span> <span id="s2523">It was funded by the same way, and operated the same way and everything was the same, only the scene was Frankfurt, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: Did you know... did you have other Jewish friends in Germany at the time who had been through the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: No, no, I did not have any.</span> <span id="s2526">I had some German friends and we talked about the Holocaust, and they knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I never really wanted to make it a big deal, I didn’t want them to think that I solely exist and maintain the friendship to kind of pound in the subject.</span> <span id="s2527">They knew about me, they knew about my life, and we discussed it in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they were genuinely interested and sorry for what happened.</span> <span id="s2528">But, other than that, no, no, I did not have any other… occasionally, my high school teacher friend, the German couple, they invited me to their schools, to talk.</span> <span id="s2529">And Germans amazed me because, in our house, for example, there was a lady who was a farmer’s daughter, and she was in a..</span> <span id="s2530">.</span> <span id="s2531">kind of a mid-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she had constantly friends from Israel, and she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2532">I had another... I have another very old friend in Germany, I met back in the early 1960’s, and we have been friends ever since, and she has friends constantly visiting her from Israel.</span> <span id="s2533">She’s also not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2534">So, there’s a lot of contact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don’t know whether this is a result of a..</span> <span id="s2535">.</span> <span id="s2536">of a bad conscience or something, but certainly you cannot hold somebody who was not even alive at that time responsible for anything that happened.</span> <span id="s2537">No, that would be unreasonable.</span> <span id="s2538">But it’s not... today, it’s not a big issue.</span> <span id="s2539">It is a sad fact of history, especially in the western part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: Did you have thoughts at that time, of where you wanted to stay, whether you wanted to stay in Germany and settle there, and make your home there, or did you picture coming back to the United States at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name, which is a German name and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War II.</span> <span id="s2542">And that was just for a few months, so I didn’t include in any citizenship, just by a mistake and because of the strange happenings of the times.</span> <span id="s2543">They classified me as German in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we were.</span> <span id="s2544">But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking Czechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all connects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not considered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he was Jewish, but because of they said he was a foreigner.</span> <span id="s2545">He could not prove that his grandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true.</span> <span id="s2546">But because of this, and other reasons, I could have gotten German citizenship.</span> <span id="s2547">I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of money that way, because of what happened to my family in World War II, and all this, but I never had, for a second, a thought.</span> <span id="s2548">I mean, how can I think about settling in Germany, and taking German citizenship?</span> <span id="s2549">There are so many reasons why I shouldn’t have done this, right?</span> <span id="s2550">Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would be a little bit too much for me to bear.</span> <span id="s2551">Second is that I have an American family, and my wife was ready to return to the United States.</span> <span id="s2552">There no way would she have stayed in Europe with me.</span> <span id="s2553">So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">End of Tape 9, Side A Tape 9, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s2556">Do you want to say anything else about Germany before we go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you’re interested in anti-Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I ran into the most anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria.</span> <span id="s2558">And I was amazed that the... so many years after the war, I don’t see a lot of changes.</span> <span id="s2559">That here is a country that, unlike Germany, was considered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not, and played this role very successfully.</span> <span id="s2560">And today, it is just terrible.</span> <span id="s2561">It’s, the right wing elements are all over it.</span> <span id="s2562">And you can go to any pub and just wait until they have a few drinks, and there will be some talk about the good old days.</span> <span id="s2563">So, no, I thought Germany dealt with the problem much, much better than Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: So you came to the U.S. in 1993, you returned.</span> <span id="s2565">Did you come straight to Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington.</span> <span id="s2567">And by that time, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own Briarbrook Farm, had called us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a home here for a very, very little money, and that sounded just like a good investment.</span> <span id="s2568">My wife, of course, immediately knew it was going to be our home.</span> <span id="s2569">I just considered maybe just an investment.</span> <span id="s2570">We bought it, and then slowly, she worked on me to retire here.</span> <span id="s2571">Because I had no intention to come here.</span> <span id="s2572">I wanted to be near a big city and I loved California.</span> <span id="s2573">And she insisted that she did not want to go back to California, even though she lived all her American life there, and so she won.</span> <span id="s2574">Well, she followed me to Europe for twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they were, but basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at least we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our son and her... and his family in Nashville.</span> <span id="s2575">So, that was an... also another consideration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about Kentucky in general?</span> <span id="s2577">Did you consider it to be kind of a backwards place, or did you have... had you heard any stereotypes about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: Well, we used to visit here, almost every summer when... while we were in Europe, every second summer or so, we would come back and stop here, too, for a few days.</span> <span id="s2579">And so I could... I was always very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really opened my eyes as to what is here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but call it an inside sulker.</span> <span id="s2580">That’s what I was, sitting on the couch during the day, and occasionally complaining that there is really not much to do here.</span> <span id="s2581">And this was going on, I was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm.</span> <span id="s2582">As I put it to my wife, an area that doesn’t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what am I going to do there?</span> <span id="s2583">And also the fences bothered me, that you can’t go anywhere, everything is fenced in.</span> <span id="s2584">And how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike somewhere?</span> <span id="s2585">You run into a fence within minutes.</span> <span id="s2586">And I was just not very much for settling here.</span> <span id="s2587">And then, I knew that she was very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in ’91, that was shortly after we bought that little house... people were still living in it, the partners of the farm, and I was walking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught up with me, because I spent a great deal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the smells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the smell of the grass.</span> <span id="s2588">And all of a sudden, I began to smell and look at the very things that were so dear to me when I was little and I was constantly hiking with my friends.</span> <span id="s2589">And I realized that this is not a bad place, and besides, it was so peaceful.</span> <span id="s2590">At night there was no noise.</span> <span id="s2591">And so I came back and the whole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.</span> <span id="s2592">And I said, “I want to say something to you.”</span> <span id="s2593">I said, “I just made up my mind, I can live here very well.”</span> <span id="s2594">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s2595">All my sulking went away, all my reservations went away.</span> <span id="s2596">I knew I was not going to come to the middle of New York City.</span> <span id="s2597">I knew that there is not going to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris.</span> <span id="s2598">But I thought that I can make the best of it, and that I can live here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Q: Did you have concerns culturally, what it would be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: Yes, that was my main concern.</span> <span id="s2601">I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour from here, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had reservations and I still have reservations.</span> <span id="s2602">I feel a little... I would have really felt much worse, perhaps twenty, thirty years ago, but at the time when television brings you, especially the educational channel and the history channel and Discovery and there are so many channels now that you can get, that brings... they bring a lot of good knowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing.</span> <span id="s2603">Second, of course, the internet connects you with the world.</span> <span id="s2604">So, one is not so isolated any more.</span> <span id="s2605">Still, I am still yearning to go to a town where the streets are crowded.</span> <span id="s2606">I don’t want to live on a crowded street all the time, but sometimes, and I want to go to a sidewalk café, and I want to eat some different food that doesn’t taste the same, and just converse with people.</span> <span id="s2607">I feel that there is, right now in this country, there is great suspicion.</span> <span id="s2608">You just can’t walk up to people and start talking.</span> <span id="s2609">And Kentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most other states.</span> <span id="s2610">It just... there is always that suspicion in a person’s mind, based on all the stories that we hear day by day by day by day, of violence.</span> <span id="s2611">Violence really kind of poisoned the atmosphere in this country a great deal, and I’m very sensitive to that.</span> <span id="s2612">So, I would love to just go to a park and sit on a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as I used to when I was younger.</span> <span id="s2613">But that’s impossible.</span> <span id="s2614">We don’t go to the park to begin with, because there are no... not many parks, and there aren’t... not too many people, if you find a park.</span> <span id="s2615">And when it gets dark, of course, you clear out, and you just don’t have that kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Do you... Have you formed relationships with people just in the community in Paris?</span> <span id="s2617">Neighbors, do you spend time in, in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: Well, with neighbors, I just don’t have that much with... in common.</span> <span id="s2619">One neighbor next to our farm is a hog farmer, and I don’t know anything about hogs and he doesn’t seem to be interested in many other things.</span> <span id="s2620">And the others are way down.</span> <span id="s2621">I go to Paris to take care of some business that is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that.</span> <span id="s2622">And my hobbies... one of my hobbies is antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique business in Paris, and I can go in and spend some time and talk to them.</span> <span id="s2623">But I do not have a close friend.</span> <span id="s2624">Now my... however, my association with the so-called master gardeners association in Lexington brought me together with people.</span> <span id="s2625">I do volunteer work for the arboretum in season, every week, and so... one day, and these are the people, usually, that I am the closest to, because we have a common interest, gardening.</span> <span id="s2626">We spend time together, we have meetings.</span> <span id="s2627">And after the season is over, we continue seeing each other.</span> <span id="s2628">So, yes, but since I came back... and that has also something to do, of course, with my age, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourself, or have they reached out to you in any way?</span> <span id="s2630">Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect.</span> <span id="s2632">They are interested my accent, and I cannot really say that they are suspicious or they reject me.</span> <span id="s2633">One man, a young man told me this last year.</span> <span id="s2634">Said, “You know, you are much better off than I.” And he said, “You open your mouth, and everybody says, ‘Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?</span> <span id="s2635">’” And he said, “I open my mouth and they say, ‘Hey, you are not from here, are you?’</span> <span id="s2636">And you know what they mean,” he says, “that I’m a damn Yankee.”</span> <span id="s2637">And I don’t know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent.</span> <span id="s2638">I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture.</span> <span id="s2639">And that’s about it.</span> <span id="s2640">The only people I’m really mad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, “What’s that?”</span> <span id="s2641">Because I know that they are putting me on.</span> <span id="s2642">That… if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too.</span> <span id="s2643">But... and another thing that, of course irritates me, when… my hearing is not that good any more, and this has nothing to do with accent and all this, it’s just that some people are very intolerant, and if you ask, you know, “Will you please repeat it?”</span> <span id="s2644">They just say, “Forget it.”</span> <span id="s2645">And the word forget it really irritates me.</span> <span id="s2646">But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born.</span> <span id="s2647">Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I’ve travelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Did you say awhile... maybe the first interview we did, at that time were you working with the Historical Society in Paris, or with the museum?</span> <span id="s2649">Do you still do that at all, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: No, I don’t do it any more, and frankly, I can’t even come up with a good reason why.</span> <span id="s2651">Perhaps it’s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I knew, many of them left and I..</span> <span id="s2652">.</span> <span id="s2653">it’s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to make friends and to build kind of a circle around yourself.</span> <span id="s2654">And also when I first joined, the Historical Society was a lot more vital than it is now.</span> <span id="s2655">I think it just settled into a routine life, and it just... I was just not interested any more.</span> <span id="s2656">The museum was established, it’s running smoothly.</span> <span id="s2657">I don’t think they really need me there any more.</span> <span id="s2658">So I rather concentrate on the Master Gardener’s Association, where I can do something, actually work.</span> <span id="s2659">I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit around and talk about what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: Have you taken a particular interest in Kentucky history since you’ve been here, or in learning about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: I..</span> <span id="s2662">.</span> <span id="s2663">well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, but I did take my first class, last year, in the history of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s2664">Cincinnati fascinated me from the very beginning, because when I saw it, I said, this is the closest thing, around here, to a real city.</span> <span id="s2665">The others seem like villages, all of them.</span> <span id="s2666">I can’t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an urban environment.</span> <span id="s2667">And the... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly and the original downtown... unfortunately, Lexington is destroyed, as we know it, and what is left of it is just struggling.</span> <span id="s2668">Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes.</span> <span id="s2669">I was so interested in Cincinnati, and Cincinnati’s history, that I took a class, a whole week Elder Hostel class.</span> <span id="s2670">I like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it’s usually a hands-on class, but this time I made an exception, ‘cause I wanted to know the history, background, and more about the area.</span> <span id="s2671">And it was not just Cincinnati, it was northern Kentucky, too.</span> <span id="s2672">It was very good.</span> <span id="s2673">So I’m hoping to do some more.</span> <span id="s2674">And of course, here and there I read a book about Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2675">I take some authors who are local and look into their works, and David Dick lives in the area, and his books... so, I am.</span> <span id="s2676">But I am not really an expert on Kentucky history, I leave this to people who are natives.</span> <span id="s2677">I just have a kind of a..</span> <span id="s2678">.</span> <span id="s2679">really a surface interest in just the basics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q: Do you feel that you can stay here and live here and be at home here for the rest of your life?</span> <span id="s2681">Is that something you think about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Oh, I settled this already with myself.</span> <span id="s2683">That’s it.</span> <span id="s2684">This is my last station.</span> <span id="s2685">I am here for good, and naturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I might... I could think of some other places where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of it.</span> <span id="s2686">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: It seems like you could, if you look back on... on your whole life and where you came from and what your experiences have been, that you could say to yourself that this was almost the last... last place that you would have landed.</span> <span id="s2688">You think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2690">I wouldn’t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way.</span> <span id="s2691">Because at that time I still was more, somehow I felt that I..</span> <span id="s2692">.</span> <span id="s2693">that there was still a great deal to discover.</span> <span id="s2694">And I know that, now that I reached the age, and considering the fact that I have heart problems, that I can’t just jump around any more.</span> <span id="s2695">And even though I would love to visit some other corners of the world, and our country, I have to take it easy, and this is basically a very good point to be.</span> <span id="s2696">I really like to explore more of the eastern part of the United States.</span> <span id="s2697">That’s a very good place to be, and the fact that we lead here, otherwise in kind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and sister-in-law, that here... we have been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never had a conflict, not even a minor one.</span> <span id="s2698">We eat our meals together quite a bit.</span> <span id="s2699">We go, usually together to the theater or a party or something.</span> <span id="s2700">We do a lot of things together.</span> <span id="s2701">We are... they are our companions, and we are theirs.</span> <span id="s2702">And so I..</span> <span id="s2703">.</span> <span id="s2704">considering all this, I am very happy, and at peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: Have you encountered any anti-Semitism since you’ve been here to Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2707">I have never heard anything like this.</span> <span id="s2708">I think there are so many... so few Jews here.</span> <span id="s2709">Of course, that doesn’t mean anything, there are very few Jews left in Poland, and there’s still anti-Semitism, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: And then you mentioned that you talk... have been talking with school groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: Will you say something about what that experience is like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are very few people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what it is.</span> <span id="s2714">And so, one schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always invites me, about two, three times a year.</span> <span id="s2715">And last time, it was a closed circuit television that they put me on, with some other classes around Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2716">And... but most of the time, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, because that’s how old I was when the real disaster hit me.</span> <span id="s2717">And so I can kind of get down to their level of understanding and explain certain things to them.</span> <span id="s2718">And I find that they are very receptive, very receptive.</span> <span id="s2719">So, I consider it a mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Are these students... is this Bourbon county schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: Yes, Bourbon county school system.</span> <span id="s2722">I’ve never been to the Paris school system, but it’s Bourbon county, which is, just basically, geographically speaking, it’s also in the city, they just split, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s2723">And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools.</span> <span id="s2724">I spoke to the high school last year, but mainly it’s the middle school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: Do you find that the students are they all familiar with the terminology, the term Holocaust?</span> <span id="s2726">Do they know... do they have a basic grasp of what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: The middle school students, because of the teacher’s eagerness to clarify everything, are much better informed than the high school students.</span> <span id="s2728">I was amazed.</span> <span id="s2729">I went to the high school, I..</span> <span id="s2730">.</span> <span id="s2731">once I went to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst.</span> <span id="s2732">They were just uninterested, sleepy people with a professor who, himself, put me asleep.</span> <span id="s2733">I just couldn’t blame the students, by that time, they were so turned off, that no matter what I did, I could have stripped nude, and it wouldn’t have made much of a difference in that class.</span> <span id="s2734">But the middle-school kids, the junior high, they are just great to talk to.</span> <span id="s2735">One girl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one little girl stayed behind, and I usually spend about an hour and a half with them.</span> <span id="s2736">I speak to them for awhile and then let them ask questions.</span> <span id="s2737">And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind and she was waiting for me, waiting for me, when after everybody left, she came up, and she hugged me, and she kissed me, and she said, “This is all... for all the missed loves and kisses that you could not get from your parents during those years.”</span> <span id="s2738">I thought that was just charming.</span> <span id="s2739">And she just turned around and left.</span> <span id="s2740">It was... there was no other, you know, second thought about it.</span> <span id="s2741">And so, it was just very, very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Have you not... I mean, well, you mentioned you hadn’t experienced anti-Semitism, have you experienced anybody kind of asking you why don’t you go to church, or you know, kind of asking you what church do you go to, or just expecting you to be Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Yeah, I..</span> <span id="s2744">.</span> <span id="s2745">that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot comprehend that, how can anybody who doesn’t steal, doesn’t cheat, doesn’t embezzle, has been married for thirty-three years, why am I not a church goer?</span> <span id="s2746">And that is what I have to explain many times to people.</span> <span id="s2747">Not only that, when I say I’m a non-believer, of course, I think I’m out of their favors.</span> <span id="s2748">And... but I try to make a point there, too, that one does not have to go to church and belong to a religion, to lead a decent life.</span> <span id="s2749">And I say that.</span> <span id="s2750">I look around and see how many people who go to church are in the news, beating their wives and embezzling money from the school’s treasury, or from the county treasury or using highway funds for their own purposes.</span> <span id="s2751">You don’t have to go.</span> <span id="s2752">You can set your own rules.</span> <span id="s2753">So, I do more argument about that than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: Do you tell them that you’re... that you’re Jewish and that that’s part of the reason why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: Well, I tell them always.</span> <span id="s2756">I’m not making any ________________.</span> <span id="s2757">I am... I always say, I’m Jewish, but I am not a Jew... I am a Jew, but I’m not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2758">And of course, first, nobody understands what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s2759">And I say, “Ethnically speaking, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2760">I come from a ethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.”</span> <span id="s2761">I said, “Now these people have been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a thousand years, and therefore there is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there’s no such thing as a pure anything any more, since history mixed us up quite successfully.</span> <span id="s2762">But, when it comes to religion,” I said, “even though I am a Jew, my religion is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2763">I have no religion.”</span> <span id="s2764">I said, “I am not... I do not belong to any organized religion.”</span> <span id="s2765">So eventually I think they understand what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Do you ever get any responses to that?</span> <span id="s2767">People getting into a conversation, or is that just kind of heads nodding, and then…</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: Well, of course there are always those who feel that they can perhaps sway me over.</span> <span id="s2769">And I always say, “Look, I’m seventy years old, and you have no idea how many people tried, and you are just wasting your time,” I said.</span> <span id="s2770">And so eventually, they see that they are.</span> <span id="s2771">So they give up and many of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those who kind of shy away, because I might, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you never know what they think of you if you say I’m a non-believer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Oh, we’re about to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">End of Tape 9, Side B Tape 10, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer.</span> <span id="s2775">Okay, do you have any contact with other Holocaust survivors in Kentucky, or have you... do you know anything about anybody, besides you mentioned somebody earlier on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: No, no, I don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s2777">And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and is very active in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to get in touch with me, because he wants me to come and talk to some group within the congregation, but they never contacted me.</span> <span id="s2778">I really don’t have any connection to any other group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Do you feel any desire or any interest in having that kind of connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: I wouldn’t mind.</span> <span id="s2781">I’m completely neutral.</span> <span id="s2782">I am not going out of my way to look for it, and... because I don’t like to dwell that much upon past.</span> <span id="s2783">And... but I wouldn’t reject if they... if they would want to establish any contact with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: You live in a rural area of, you know, central Kentucky, and there are a lot of, I mean, as far as other... as far as minority groups, other than the main group, the... probably the main other group would be migrant workers, and I’m interested in just hearing your... your perceptions of how people in the area deal with minority groups, and your observations about... about that, if you have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there.</span> <span id="s2786">Germany had an economic boom in the 1950’s, just like we have now, which meant that the... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled.</span> <span id="s2787">Most Germans just wouldn’t want to work in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could produce.</span> <span id="s2788">So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that’s what they were called, and they were mainly from Turkey.</span> <span id="s2789">And this was back in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s2790">The German economic miracle produced a migration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal.</span> <span id="s2791">They had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories.</span> <span id="s2792">Now, today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down considerably.</span> <span id="s2793">These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are grandparents.</span> <span id="s2794">They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a very nice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not allow family members to follow.</span> <span id="s2795">They could go home on vacation, send the money back, but nobody was allowed to... allowed to come.</span> <span id="s2796">So, the family members came, and you know, one family member then brings another family member, and pretty soon... I think today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people.</span> <span id="s2797">That’s quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with.</span> <span id="s2798">But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest.</span> <span id="s2799">So now, here came the problem of what to do with them.</span> <span id="s2800">Are they citizens, are they not citizens?</span> <span id="s2801">And welfare, are they qualified for welfare?</span> <span id="s2802">So, I am afraid of the same thing here.</span> <span id="s2803">Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job.</span> <span id="s2804">They are working here in a job that most other people wouldn’t take.</span> <span id="s2805">So, nobody has great reservations.</span> <span id="s2806">When they see... I heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or a murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I don’t consider this extraordinary.</span> <span id="s2807">But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when this economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people.</span> <span id="s2808">Now, they are not going to work.</span> <span id="s2809">If they don’t work, what will happen to them?</span> <span id="s2810">To their mind?</span> <span id="s2811">What will happen to those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same as they do in Germany.</span> <span id="s2812">The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived.</span> <span id="s2813">People died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed.</span> <span id="s2814">Several, several times this happened.</span> <span id="s2815">So, I hope that we’d... it doesn’t come to this.</span> <span id="s2816">I think that the... we need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome.</span> <span id="s2817">They are here for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came in by the same rights.</span> <span id="s2818">If there is illegal immigration, that is not for Kentucky to try to stop it, because we can’t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that’s not our problem.</span> <span id="s2819">But those who are here, they are here.</span> <span id="s2820">So what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s2821">But the churches, the schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that these are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily.</span> <span id="s2822">They are not here temporarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mind draw parallels to your own experience, and experience of Jews in Europe?</span> <span id="s2824">I mean, even though it’s not... I mean, with the Jews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of years and they certainly belonged there, but... but the idea of some kind of economic problems making one majority group turn against a minority group and persecuting them.</span> <span id="s2825">Do you think that makes you particularly…</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: Yeah, yes…</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">Q: ... sensitive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison.</span> <span id="s2829">I..</span> <span id="s2830">.</span> <span id="s2831">definitely, that… they would be made scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall.</span> <span id="s2832">But I don’t think that in America we ever have a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more.</span> <span id="s2833">I know that we had them, of course, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the Japanese Americans in the West coast, but I don’t think that would ever come to this.</span> <span id="s2834">I’m more afraid of individual treatment of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: Incidents like skinheads getting…</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them realistically, that we let their children come to school without any reservation, because children in the world everywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where they go, they should be in school.</span> <span id="s2837">And number two is that we do not go overboard with bilingual education.</span> <span id="s2838">These kids know how to speak Spanish, they should know how to speak English, and even the families, I think, would appreciate the fact, that we would just throw them into an English speaking class, and I can guarantee that in three months, they would speak English, without even an accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: The one thing that I..</span> <span id="s2840">.</span> <span id="s2841">that I missed asking was about your parents.</span> <span id="s2842">I..</span> <span id="s2843">.</span> <span id="s2844">you mentioned, maybe in the last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2846">Not for my wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: Not for your wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: Mm-mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: They came in 1967 to visit.</span> <span id="s2851">They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks.</span> <span id="s2852">And my mother, of course, would have loved to stay here.</span> <span id="s2853">My father, he was just used to his life in Budapest, and he was very anxious, eventually, to get back.</span> <span id="s2854">So there was no question that they would stay here.</span> <span id="s2855">And my father, who has always been around little businesses in his life, he did the usual thing that people at that time did, from Eastern Europe, traveling to the West, they were constantly counting what... certain prices on merchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money.</span> <span id="s2856">I mean, I was thinking about getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he would beat any calculator.</span> <span id="s2857">So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were with us, was Long’s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area.</span> <span id="s2858">And he... he would just... if we did something, the rest of the family, with my mother, and he did not want to be part of it, he just said, “Oh, just drop me at Long’s Drugstore,” and he would spend an entire day at Long’s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking everything, figuring out prices and this.</span> <span id="s2859">So, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: They…</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing here, and he was smiling always, because he couldn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s2862">So, finally, I had to... I explained, I talked to the people, and said, “This is my father, he doesn’t speak any English, and he loves your store.”</span> <span id="s2863">And this is all he did.</span> <span id="s2864">We drop him off here, he’s totally harmless.</span> <span id="s2865">He never killed a fly in his life.</span> <span id="s2866">He just likes to... and so they laughed, and they just... and eventually they all kind of tried to communicate with him and he with them.</span> <span id="s2867">And another thing that... just blew his mind, that all you can eat little places in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2868">And we used to go to one that had very nice stuff, steam table, of course.</span> <span id="s2869">And he just could not understand that here, we were five, seven people go, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and so finally he said, “I can’t,” he said, “in Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in one day.”</span> <span id="s2870">So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and explain to her where my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down with us, and she said… ‘cause my father said, “How do you make money, all you can eat?”</span> <span id="s2871">So, she then pointed out to my father, that look, “Here is your granddaughter.</span> <span id="s2872">Look what she has.</span> <span id="s2873">She really didn’t take much.</span> <span id="s2874">Look at your wife, she didn’t eat that much.</span> <span id="s2875">Look at you, you didn’t eat that much.</span> <span id="s2876">The two boys,” she said, “the two boys, okay, so they might take up... up to the price that they paid, but look, all of you, you’re eat…” and so, she was very patiently explaining.</span> <span id="s2877">She said, “Our problem is not what people eat, it’s what people try to put into their jacket.”</span> <span id="s2878">She says, “You’d be surprised how many people come in here with a bag, and all this.”</span> <span id="s2879">My father could not understand this, that even in America people… because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view of America.</span> <span id="s2880">But I forgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long’s Drugstore, he learned this sentence to say.</span> <span id="s2881">First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how to say in English, so the children can understand.</span> <span id="s2882">He says, “This country is invincible.”</span> <span id="s2883">After looking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in this... just in this store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this... he said, “This country, my son, is invincible.”</span> <span id="s2884">He had unlimited faith in this country.</span> <span id="s2885">And I don’t know whether in a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, “Why don’t you stay here?”</span> <span id="s2886">He told them a joke.</span> <span id="s2887">I think I…</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: Yeah, you did, you did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: ... I say it, so I’m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and everything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was ready to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: What year did he die, he and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: My mother died in 1971, and my father died in, let’s see, 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">Q: Had you seen them again, since... in between…</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, yeah.</span> <span id="s2894">I was in Germany, so they called me and I come, and he had a stroke, and... but I was not with my mother when she was dying.</span> <span id="s2895">My father just called me.</span> <span id="s2896">So... but they have always been great supporters of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: Do you have anything else that you’d like to add?</span> <span id="s2898">I’m about out of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A: Well, if you give me a couple of minutes…</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: ... You can stop that, and see if there’s anything else, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: Shall I pause it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: Are you involved with any other activities besides the Master Gardener’s Association?</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program.</span> <span id="s2906">We have... my wife, I think, participated in just about fifteen or so, and I am just about five behind.</span> <span id="s2907">And what we usually do, we are taking hands-on type classes.</span> <span id="s2908">My idea is that I want to know everything before I go, about... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always wondered about blacksmithing.</span> <span id="s2909">What does a blacksmith do?</span> <span id="s2910">How does he do it?</span> <span id="s2911">So I took a class in blacksmithing.</span> <span id="s2912">I took a class in kaleidoscope making, because that interested me... me, too.</span> <span id="s2913">How does a kaleidoscope work?</span> <span id="s2914">How do you make one?</span> <span id="s2915">And I took several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as a hobby.</span> <span id="s2916">We also took a beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to... in Hawaii, an Elder Hostel class for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2917">We were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest and then Polynesian culture.</span> <span id="s2918">My wife is very active in basket weaving.</span> <span id="s2919">She’s a member of the basket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers Association, or whatever... I don’t know if this is the official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes.</span> <span id="s2920">Also, she’s a quilter, so as a quilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians.</span> <span id="s2921">And she doesn’t ever come home complaining that maybe they considered her an outsider.</span> <span id="s2922">She feels very much at home with all these people.</span> <span id="s2923">We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian center for crafts, and take a hands-on class.</span> <span id="s2924">Our next class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, we have taken a class in Charleston and we want to go back, this is our next class.</span> <span id="s2925">We studied outdoor cooking and we are going back now to study Charleston’s gardens.</span> <span id="s2926">We take trips.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: Is this West Virginia, or South Carolina?</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s2929">And while there, we visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just walking around in a European city.</span> <span id="s2930">And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips.</span> <span id="s2931">We love to go, as I mentioned, to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s2932">We go up to Louisville.</span> <span id="s2933">My wife, as a quilter, goes sometimes to western Kentucky, which is the quilter’s place, you know, Paducah is the quilter’s museum.</span> <span id="s2934">In other words, we are active here, and I took the class in History of Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2935">And I plan to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist organizations.</span> <span id="s2936">I volunteered to participate in the Kentucky water watch program, which I enjoyed very much.</span> <span id="s2937">It just ended with the Licking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner Creek, was our responsibility.</span> <span id="s2938">Four times a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so that was, I felt I was part of Kentucky, doing this.</span> <span id="s2939">We are... we try to stay active and my wife is mainly involved with these quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that takes me out in nature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fighting the elements.</span> <span id="s2940">I still have a little bit of that spark.</span> <span id="s2941">So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation this fall, I’d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little rivers here.</span> <span id="s2942">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: Is there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2947">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s2948">I mean, I can’t... can’t really…</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s2950">This concludes the... an interview with Robert Holczer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Cornelia Oestreicher When Robert lived there, the street number was 39.</span> <span id="s2953">It was later changed to 66.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">First name: Ferencz</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">First name: Imre USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 PAGE 94</span></p></body></html>
