Singer, my maiden name is Mendelowitz(ph), and in the United States, Mendelowitz(ph).</span> <span id="s12">I was born in Berchem(ph), which is a suburb of Antwerp, Belgium.</span> <span id="s13">On August 16, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Question: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s16">My dad had a furniture workshop and mom was a housekeeper, house, homemaker.</span> <span id="s17">We were three small children.</span> <span id="s18">And we lived in what was known as a Jewish neighborhood, which encompassed sort of six, seven streets in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s19">We went to school, Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner, Saturday we went to synagogue, but Saturday afternoon sometimes we snuck off to the movies.</span> <span id="s20">And life was pleasant, you know, with three sisters, sometimes we played together, other times we fought, we did homework, there was a beautiful clock at the end of our street, and after school we'd go and play there, we'd ride our bikes, we'd play ball on the wall next to our apartment house and life kind of was pleasant.</span> <span id="s21">It was pleasant.</span> <span id="s22">On the week-end, on Sundays, neighbors, friends, everybody'd get on their bikes, we'd go the park, have a picnic.</span> <span id="s23">And the park was a beautiful park, it was called the Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park and had a beautiful pond with swans and we enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s24">I re-visited it recently and, seems smaller than it did when I was small.</span> <span id="s25">And, everything seemed alright for awhile and what I didn't realize, however, was that the, there was a depression.</span> <span id="s26">And that my dad was having financial problems.</span> <span id="s27">He eventually lost his business which was, he had a furniture workshop.</span> <span id="s28">He made custom furniture.</span> <span id="s29">He lost it.</span> <span id="s30">And then went off to the coal mines to get work.</span> <span id="s31">People tried to get work just about wherever they could.</span> <span id="s32">And, he even worked for the Fourth Company for a short while.</span> <span id="s33">And then eventually got a position with a steamship company and started sailing the seven seas.</span> <span id="s34">And this was about early '36, '37.</span> <span id="s35">And at that time we had gone back, we had gone, I wouldn't say back exactly, my mom did go back, but we went with my mom to Romania because my family originated from there, and that was the last time I saw my grandfather, my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s36">Most of them did perish in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s37">By 1937, we rarely saw my father.</span> <span id="s38">We always saw him like every three months, every four months, when he'd come home for about two or three days and then would take off again.</span> <span id="s39">At about the same time, he made the acquaintance of an officer on his steamship, on the steamship he worked on, the man was a German and a Christian.</span> <span id="s40">And I'm mentioning that because he'll be coming into our lives later on again.</span> <span id="s41">Otherwise, I wouldn't have identified him like that.</span> <span id="s42">Carl would not always be able to go back to Germany when the ship docked in Antwerp to see his family because time was short, so he would stay with us and we became very fond of him.</span> <span id="s43">In 1938, there was an influx of refugees in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s44">They came from Austria, from Germany and the whole Jewish community opened up their homes for them.</span> <span id="s45">We, ourselves, in our small apartment, had four people staying with us.</span> <span id="s46">I think it was four, I'm not sure if it was three or four, but from what I remember, there were two couples.</span> <span id="s47">And around the dinner table a lot of talk was going on about what went on in Germany, about what I know now to be Chrystalnacht(ph), and I remember becoming fearful, I remember going to bed and thinking about it and I say, well, maybe we're going to have to run away.</span> <span id="s48">And I would ask my mother about it, and she said, don't worry, old people tell stories, they're exaggerating.</span> <span id="s49">She says, nothing's happening, Austria, Germany, they're civilized countries.</span> <span id="s50">The people there are like here, she says, maybe some things are happening, after all, you know, I always tell you that there are people who are antisemetic, and who don't like Jews, but nothing like what they're telling you.</span> <span id="s51">So, time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Let me just, before you go further, just ask, you said that you lived in a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s53">Did you have contact with Christian people?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s55">Of course.</span> <span id="s56">I went to public school.</span> <span id="s57">I went to public school and then after school the boys went to what they called Hebrew school and the little girls went to what they called Yiddish school.</span> <span id="s58">We learned how to read and write in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s59">Of course we had contact because in public school it was mixed.</span> <span id="s60">I didn't go to a secular, I mean I went to a secular school, I didn't go to a religious school.</span> <span id="s61">So, yes, we did have contact, but the reason I mentioned the Jewish neighborhood, is, there were Jewish people living all over Antwerp, but the neighborhood that I'm speaking of was, I would almost say 90% Jewish.</span> <span id="s62">There were Christians living there also, but it was the neighborhood where you had all the kosher butchers, you had synagogues almost on every second street, and kosher restaurants, and if you really walk those streets you really didn't think there was another world.</span> <span id="s63">As a matter of fact, until I went to kindergarten, I spoke just Yiddish.</span> <span id="s64">I didn't know there were other languages, except the Hungarian and Rumanian that I heard my parents speak, which I never learned.</span> <span id="s65">So, for me, until I went into regular public school, I thought that the only people who existed were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s66">But then, of course, I came in contact with everyone.</span> <span id="s67">And speaking of school, in Belgium, in many of the European countries, school isn't five days a week like here in the United States.</span> <span id="s68">You go to school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, full days.</span> <span id="s69">Thursday is a half day and then a half day on Saturday.</span> <span id="s70">So, we were not excused from that, although many times, we were absent on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s71">However, when we did go to school, our teacher would excuse us from reading, I mean from writing on the board or writing in our notebooks and then I had one teacher who sat us in the back of the room so she would remember who not to call on to write.</span> <span id="s72">And that wasn't overly comfortable, but it was something that we adjusted to.</span> <span id="s73">And, okay, going back to '38, '39, there was, I remember hearing talk about Poland being invaded and I heard talk about Belgium being neutral, but it was very vague at that particular time.</span> <span id="s74">It wasn't until later that I learned the full history of that.</span> <span id="s75">In 1940, the spring of 1940, I was at a summer camp.</span> <span id="s76">In Belgium, you had socialized medicine, you also had a system whereby poor children were offered what they called Fresh Air Camp experience.</span> <span id="s77">And you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a Fresh Air Camp to kind of be physically rehabilitated, get good food, get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy.</span> <span id="s78">So, I was sent to one camp for two weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another camp.</span> <span id="s79">And I remember the morning, this is very clear in my mind, the morning of May 10, 1940.</span> <span id="s80">We were sitting and, to the best of my recollection, having breakfast in the dining room, and the radio was playing some music, the music was stopped and an announcement was made that the German armies are walking into Belgium.</span> <span id="s81">Which shocked the counselors, everyone, they practically jumped out of their seats.</span> <span id="s82">And rushed us to finish our breakfast.</span> <span id="s83">Took us back to the dorms, we had to pack our little bags, they got us onto buses and took us back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s84">I got there, I remember getting to Antwerp and I remember the streets being full of people, rushing back and forth and talking.</span> <span id="s85">It was very chaotic.</span> <span id="s86">Very chaotic.</span> <span id="s87">Almost, you know looking back on it now, is I can understand it, what happened is everybody was caught by surprise.</span> <span id="s88">Nobody expected it.</span> <span id="s89">And people were packing up wagons, and this holds true for both the Christian and the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s90">Everyone was running.</span> <span id="s91">Because from what I learned later on, is the Belgians were as afraid of the Germans as anybody else would be, at the time.</span> <span id="s92">Because during World War II, there was a lot of resistance in Belgium and...World War I, I'm sorry, I apologize.</span> <span id="s93">World War I.</span> <span id="s94">There was a lot of resistance in Belgium against the Germans.</span> <span id="s95">And, from what I heard at the time, was that the, a lot of torturing took place.</span> <span id="s96">So Belgians were tortured and they were frightened.</span> <span id="s97">I don't have, myself, any specific cases that I could document, but it's sort of one of these known facts within the country.</span> <span id="s98">So, everybody was running.</span> <span id="s99">Now, we had a slight problem.</span> <span id="s100">My mother and the two of us.</span> <span id="s101">By then, of course, remember I said my father was on a ship.</span> <span id="s102">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to us, my father's ship in '38, had docked in Canada and he had a sister who lived in New York, who had been sent there after World War I because her father had been killed on the front and there was an aunt in New York who was willing to take in the little girl and raise her.</span> <span id="s103">So, my father called her from Canada and she says, have you heard?</span> <span id="s104">This was after November of 1938, have you heard what happened in Germany?</span> <span id="s105">And my father says, no, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s106">She says, don't go back.</span> <span id="s107">He says, what do you mean, don't go back?</span> <span id="s108">I've got my wife, I've got the two children, I've got to go back.</span> <span id="s109">And she urged him to stay and she sent someone for him and they illegally brought him into the United States.</span> <span id="s110">I shouldn't even say this, but he became legalized.</span> <span id="s111">He eventually entered the American Army, served honorably and was honorably discharged.</span> <span id="s112">As soon as he got to New York and settled down, they started making arrangements to bring us to the United States.</span> <span id="s113">That, they encountered great difficulty.</span> <span id="s114">First of all, my father wasn't here legally, as yet.</span> <span id="s115">Secondly, we, even if my uncle and aunt made the arrangements to bring us, we fell under the Rumanian quota.</span> <span id="s116">The Rumanian quota, as for most Eastern European Jews, was very long.</span> <span id="s117">It could sometimes take up to 10 years, waiting to come.</span> <span id="s118">And I came across something that was very interesting here in the United States, in the immigration department of the years '37 through '40, immigrants were listed by countries, except for one group.</span> <span id="s119">One group was listed as Hebrews.</span> <span id="s120">I'll show it to you later.</span> <span id="s121">But, anyway, getting back to 1940.</span> <span id="s122">I had been sent to the summer camp as did, my second sister was sent.</span> <span id="s123">So, two of us had been away.</span> <span id="s124">I was back now, the little one, the youngest was back.</span> <span id="s125">The middle one wasn't back yet.</span> <span id="s126">Now, mother tried desperately to reach the camp.</span> <span id="s127">We didn't have a phone in our home.</span> <span id="s128">She had to go to a shop to get, actually, most of the phones were at the post office, to try to call.</span> <span id="s129">Somehow, she couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s130">And had absolutely no knowledge where my middle sister was.</span> <span id="s131">Someone with a car and a trundle seat in the back, getting ready to escape to France, because that's where everybody was heading, everybody was heading towards Northern France, offered us a seat if we would just go right away.</span> <span id="s132">And my mother had a terrible dilemma.</span> <span id="s133">Does she take two of us and go, does she wait for the third one and get stuck and lose all the children, as well?</span> <span id="s134">And I learned later, of course, at that time I didn't know, although she talked about it, I had a vague recollection of what she was telling me.</span> <span id="s135">Because I remember her saying, Florika(ph), that's a diminutive in Belgium for Flora, we have to try to find Charlotte so we can leave.</span> <span id="s136">But, I remember her also saying, if I can't find her, maybe we should go anyway and see if we can find her later on.</span> <span id="s137">And, while she was pondering this question, which I now as a mother and a grandmother, I realize it's one of the most difficult ones you ever have to do, and I hope that no mother ever has to ponder this kind of dilemma.</span> <span id="s138">She kept talking, but at the same time she started packing some little bags.</span> <span id="s139">My youngest sister at the time had the measles and she had a high fever, which was another problem.</span> <span id="s140">The people who had the car kept saying, we're leaving, we're not waiting any more.</span> <span id="s141">And she kept begging them, wait a little while longer, maybe they'll bring my Charlotte.</span> <span id="s142">Finally, they said, no, we're going.</span> <span id="s143">And she made a decision.</span> <span id="s144">She told one of the neighbors who had decided not to go, to wait out the war or whatever was coming, she says, if my Charlotte comes, please keep her for us.</span> <span id="s145">And we got into the car, into the trundle seat in the back, it was an open seat, and we, we went.</span> <span id="s146">So, it was the two of us and my mom.</span> <span id="s147">And her idea was that if we can get to France, maybe to Calais(ph), and maybe get a ship to Britain, Great Britain, maybe from there, and she was, pure fantasy.</span> <span id="s148">We had no Visas, nothing.</span> <span id="s149">But, somehow, this is the plan that she had made.</span> <span id="s150">From Britain to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s151">So, we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Was this kind of exciting for you?</span> <span id="s153">Or scary?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I remember, what I remember is not understanding why we're not waiting for Charlotte.</span> <span id="s155">That I remember.</span> <span id="s156">And, it was, I don't know, I can't explain it, it was frightening, I don't remember being excited.</span> <span id="s157">I don't remember being excited.</span> <span id="s158">It was a lot of chaos, and it was, it was strange.</span> <span id="s159">But, I can't say excited in the sense of feeling like I'm living a drama or anything like that.</span> <span id="s160">No, I don't recall anything like that.</span> <span id="s161">I just remember it being very chaotic, very strange, and I remember having to, to just sit in the car and clutching my doll, I had a fairly new doll that I had gotten just before I had gone away to the camp.</span> <span id="s162">And I remember clutching my doll and holding on to her, to the doll.</span> <span id="s163">My mother placed the little one on my lap, and I remember her being very hot.</span> <span id="s164">So, there were very, there were many physical things going on, so mentally, I don't remember too many sensations.</span> <span id="s165">I remember being uncomfortable, I remember trying to hold my doll, I remember my sister who was very hot, being placed on my lap, and not understanding why Charlotte wasn't coming with us.</span> <span id="s166">That was the middle sister that we couldn't find.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: What else did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: We had two suitcases.</span> <span id="s169">They were large in my eyes, but I learned later on that they weren't quite that big.</span> <span id="s170">They also started feeling very heavy later on.</span> <span id="s171">Anyway, the car went, you couldn't go, you could walk faster than you could ride because, as I said, everybody was running.</span> <span id="s172">And, what I didn't learn until later on, is that we were part of the refugees that blocked the roads which prevented the Allies, the Allies were the French and some of the British, from pulling back, or trying to get through on the roads.</span> <span id="s173">We, because I remember, this was after the war, I remember reading and learning about the roads being blocked by refugees, and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees.</span> <span id="s174">The car ran out of gas, there wasn't any to be gotten, so they just, the people left the car, so we left the car and then we were on our own.</span> <span id="s175">We slept in the fields, wherever you could just find a spot.</span> <span id="s176">With our suitcases.</span> <span id="s177">Or a barn somewhere, if a farmer allowed you to stay in there.</span> <span id="s178">And we did, we did make it to Calais(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, we did get a train for a short while, the train stopped in the middle of the road, people had to get off the trains.</span> <span id="s181">It took several days.</span> <span id="s182">Neither myself or my mom remembered precisely how many days, but it was several days.</span> <span id="s183">I remember being, we were in a railroad station, and this was in Calais(ph), but not near the port.</span> <span id="s184">And we were, our plan was at that point, mom decided, well, maybe we shouldn't just go to the port to try to get to Great Britain, maybe we should just try to get to Paris, maybe that would be safer.</span> <span id="s185">So, we were in the railroad station, and I remember being very tired and we had slept on our suitcases in the station and then we decided to just abandon one suitcase because mom had to carry my little sister who was four, and who, not quite, this was in May and she wasn't four until the following, the next month, June.</span> <span id="s186">What's happening to my English?</span> <span id="s187">It's funny, when I get emotional, I lose my ability to speak.</span> <span id="s188">We left one suitcase in the railroad station.</span> <span id="s189">I remember we hid it behind a corner because we were afraid someone would see us and run after us and tell us we left a suitcase.</span> <span id="s190">We thought that was illegal.</span> <span id="s191">We then went to the port and we, I sat on a suitcase, the one suitcase that we had left, with my little sister and my mother saw a big ship and they were loading soldiers on the ship.</span> <span id="s192">And she went over there and she spoke to someone.</span> <span id="s193">I didn't know who she spoke to, but she spoke to someone and when she came back she said, we're going to wait here, maybe they'll take us, they're going to go to England.</span> <span id="s194">It was a Red Cross ship.</span> <span id="s195">So, we sat.</span> <span id="s196">And we sat through the night and they kept loading wounded soldiers.</span> <span id="s197">By dawn, the man mom had spoken to walked over to us and he said, sorry, there's no room, it's full.</span> <span id="s198">And he couldn't take us.</span> <span id="s199">So, we tried to find a place to stay.</span> <span id="s200">As we were walking away, we saw people screaming, anybody want to go to England, there's a ship here, you can come, every, people just loaded onto a ship.</span> <span id="s201">I learned later that this was a ship that was abandoned and someone who knew how to steer just took the, just went in took the ship and invited people to come onto it.</span> <span id="s202">Because, I mean, it's incredible and it's difficult to describe, what things looked like.</span> <span id="s203">It was just, people were running and coming and going and nothing was the way nor...quote, normal.</span> <span id="s204">And we decided, great, we're going to go onto the ship.</span> <span id="s205">So, we came and we went on.</span> <span id="s206">Now, there were, it wasn't a very large ship, but it was still good size.</span> <span id="s207">And there were cabins, and we sat against a wall on the deck, on the floor, against a cabin, but facing the dock.</span> <span id="s208">Other people sat on the other side facing the water.</span> <span id="s209">And, I'm saying this for a reason, what happened, once the ship was full, suddenly the tide went down as it typically does towards evening, and the ship tilted.</span> <span id="s210">The people on the other side started sliding down because the ship kept tilting.</span> <span id="s211">We ended up sitting on the cabin wall.</span> <span id="s212">But, we were safe.</span> <span id="s213">And, of course, they did manage to save most of the people.</span> <span id="s214">They threw them ladders and we were all pulled up.</span> <span id="s215">From there we found a church, we gave up on going to England.</span> <span id="s216">We found a church and the Red Cross was giving out milk for children and things like that, so we got a little milk and then we went out to try to find a place to stay.</span> <span id="s217">As we were walking the street, the sirens came on and we ended up in a shelter, a bomb shelter.</span> <span id="s218">We stayed there for awhile, when the clear siren rang, mom said, you know what, you stay here with Betty, I'll go find us a place to stay.</span> <span id="s219">So, she left me in the shelter and I sat there by myself with my little sister.</span> <span id="s220">And I sat and I waited and I waited and I waited.</span> <span id="s221">And then after awhile I panicked.</span> <span id="s222">And I went out of the shelter with my little sister, meanwhile she kept crying, she was thirsty, and I had nothing to give her.</span> <span id="s223">So, the streets were deserted and they were fairly dark, and I walked screaming, mamma, mamma, mamma, all of a sudden I hear someone calling, Flora, Flora, Flora.</span> <span id="s224">Mom had forgotten where she had left us, because we didn't know Calais(ph).</span> <span id="s225">So, she was walking the streets hoping that I would have left the shelter maybe, and she kept calling and hoping that I would hear and I was calling, so we did find each other.</span> <span id="s226">At that point, we went, found another church, well, to make a long story short, because this was lengthy, we ended up in Bulangsumere(ph).</span> <span id="s227">In Bulangsumere(ph) we stayed put.</span> <span id="s228">By then the German Army had walked into Northern France, and we got stuck in Bulangsumere(ph), so we stayed there, we found a place to stay with a woman who had a bar and mom helped her so that we could eat.</span> <span id="s229">And we were there for, I would say, about five or six weeks.</span> <span id="s230">By then an order came out that anyone who was not a legal resident of France must return to their countries of origin.</span> <span id="s231">So, we decided to return to Belgium.</span> <span id="s232">We started walking back, transportation was a mess, you couldn't even get on trains, rails were bombed and everything.</span> <span id="s233">And we hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s234">As a matter of fact, with German soldiers, we did hitchhike.</span> <span id="s235">Anyway, we made it back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s236">Got to Antwerp...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: With German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah, right, we hitchhiked, the German Army.</span> <span id="s239">Well, the Germans, we're in Northern France.</span> <span id="s240">And we needed to get back to Belgium, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And they gave you a ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: They gave us a ride.</span> <span id="s243">Of course, they didn't know who we were, what we were, you know, but they didn't give us a ride all the way, just, you know, piecemeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: One question.</span> <span id="s245">I think I recall in an earlier interview you did, you talked about seeing a lot of looting and...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s247">Yeah.</span> <span id="s248">Okay, here's what happened.</span> <span id="s249">While mom was helping the woman working in the bar and everything else, my little sister and I, we wandered the streets.</span> <span id="s250">And every time you had sirens and you had the bombing, stores were bombed, stores were broken, and people, people broke windows.</span> <span id="s251">And we passed, it was a shoe store that we had, we kept pass, it was more than a shoe store, because they also had clothing.</span> <span id="s252">And there was a pair of white boots in the window [laughter], it was kind of a silly thing in the middle of a war, but anyway, it was a pair of white boots that I kept looking at.</span> <span id="s253">I just, oh, would I love to have those white boots!</span> <span id="s254">Anyway, this particular day, my sister and I were walking and we see a lot of people in front of this store.</span> <span id="s255">And we get there and we see people walking out with packages, the window was broken, it was an absolute mess.</span> <span id="s256">And I saw, so I went over, and I somehow, we made our way into the store and I see the white boots.</span> <span id="s257">And I grabbed the white boots and there was two rain coats, another kind of a coat, and I grabbed that and a pair of boots for my sister, and we ran out.</span> <span id="s258">I didn't even try them on.</span> <span id="s259">I just thought, approximately, I just grabbed them.</span> <span id="s260">Anyway, they did fit.</span> <span id="s261">And I loved them.</span> <span id="s262">And she loved hers.</span> <span id="s263">And we, and the rain coat.</span> <span id="s264">And we come back, I come to the bar, and the first thing my mother says is, what in the world is that?</span> <span id="s265">So, I told her, I says, everybody was taking, you know, the store was open, everybody was taking.</span> <span id="s266">So, she was, I learned later, at the time she just said, you're not supposed to take things you don't pay for them.</span> <span id="s267">But, she did not take them away from us.</span> <span id="s268">We kept them.</span> <span id="s269">Anyway, one day [laughter] I was, you know, in the middle of chaos, in the middle of such dramatic times, there were these moments that there is some humor to it in a way, but I didn't laugh at the time.</span> <span id="s270">One day, I'm walking on the street, and all of a sudden I feel somebody grabbing me by the back.</span> <span id="s271">It was the owner of the store.</span> <span id="s272">And he made me take off the boots and the rain coat, which I wore sunshine or rain or whatever, so that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s273">Is that what you were referring to?</span> <span id="s274">Well, I didn't steal for a long time, I was told later on that this was stealing.</span> <span id="s275">So my mother was in a dilemma at that time, too.</span> <span id="s276">You know?</span> <span id="s277">It wasn't a time where you taught children honesty or not, you know?</span> <span id="s278">You survived.</span> <span id="s279">Anyhow, we came back to Belgium eventually.</span> <span id="s280">There were a few incidents, like I would brag, you know, really, you want to get food, you know, if you were little, even adults would push you aside, okay, get away, get away.</span> <span id="s281">And they were stronger, so they would push you out of line, because they wanted the bread.</span> <span id="s282">But, anyway, we made it, we got back to Antwerp and one of the neighbors did have Charlotte.</span> <span id="s283">Charlotte, I don't know whether she ever speaks about it, as a matter of fact, she was just interviewed by the Spielberg(ph) project and I don't know if she ever, can you edit this out?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: We're not going to edit.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Oh, you're not going to edit.</span> <span id="s286">Well then, well anyway, I don't know if she ever forgave mom.</span> <span id="s287">I don't know if she's mentioned it even, but I must ask her, but I don't know if she ever forgave mom.</span> <span id="s288">I don't think she ever understood why mamma took off without her.</span> <span id="s289">And she asked a few times, and mom could not explain it.</span> <span id="s290">She kept saying, I thought I could save two children instead of losing three.</span> <span id="s291">That was her answer.</span> <span id="s292">And there were difficult decisions to be made.</span> <span id="s293">I felt sorry for mom, because that's, I know this was something that was always on her mind, it was always there.</span> <span id="s294">Anyway, we settled back in Antwerp, and, except for bombs, planes that we heard, seeing German soldiers in the streets, life took up a normal routine again.</span> <span id="s295">September, we went back to school.</span> <span id="s296">By October, however, Jews were supposed to register.</span> <span id="s297">Registering was that you had to go to the municipal building, _____________, administration and register.</span> <span id="s298">Now, the question comes up sometimes, well, what if you didn't register?</span> <span id="s299">You were known because in Europe, people carry identity cards.</span> <span id="s300">After the war when I turned 15, I received an identity card.</span> <span id="s301">As a matter of fact, I carry one, I still have it, it says, stranger.</span> <span id="s302">Born in Antwerp, Belgium, nationality, Rumanian.</span> <span id="s303">The Rumanians never recognized me as a Rumanian national, and the Belgians didn't recognize me as a Belgian national.</span> <span id="s304">It's something I always resented.</span> <span id="s305">And, so whether you wanted to or not, you were registered, but you had to officially register.</span> <span id="s306">So, mom registered, everybody did.</span> <span id="s307">The attitude was that, if you obey the law, you'll be fine.</span> <span id="s308">And, a little later on, men were called up for forced labor.</span> <span id="s309">My mother's youngest sister also lived in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s310">And she had a little boy who was born early in 1940, and her husband had escaped from Poland.</span> <span id="s311">He came from Poland around, oh somewheres around '38, just about that time when they got married.</span> <span id="s312">And my uncle was called up.</span> <span id="s313">He went.</span> <span id="s314">And he came back three months later.</span> <span id="s315">Many of the men went and they came back three months later.</span> <span id="s316">And, see?</span> <span id="s317">If we obey, if we do what we're supposed to do, it's no problem.</span> <span id="s318">Then, my uncle was called up again.</span> <span id="s319">My mother had almost like a sixth sense about things.</span> <span id="s320">She lived a lot by intuition, but it served her well.</span> <span id="s321">She said at one point, she said, Alex, I don't know.</span> <span id="s322">I don't think you should go.</span> <span id="s323">And he did listen, and he took his wife and child and they escaped to Brussels.</span> <span id="s324">In Brussels it was easier to get lost.</span> <span id="s325">It had a small, in Sashiel(ph), one of the suburbs, it had a Jewish community, but it wasn't quite as big or as defined as the one in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s326">Antwerp was almost, a good part of it was what you call almost like a Jewish town.</span> <span id="s327">So, in Brussels you could get lost a little bit more.</span> <span id="s328">Then, you know, as time went on, we wore the star, it wasn't any fun to go to school with the star, but we didn't have to worry about it too long because we were told you couldn't go to, in Antwerp, you couldn't go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s329">In Brussels, the Jewish children were still going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: What, what were you doing for money?</span> <span id="s331">For food, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Mom worked.</span> <span id="s333">Mom worked.</span> <span id="s334">She did some dressmaking and we each had a job.</span> <span id="s335">I did handwork, I hemmed.</span> <span id="s336">Because lace was hard to obtain, so you made little scallops on the bottom of slips, on top, we made women's slips, so I was in charge of the scallops.</span> <span id="s337">One of my sisters was in charge of turning, we made, mom made, of straps.</span> <span id="s338">You see, things are different today.</span> <span id="s339">To make straps, you made kind of a little tube and then you turned it inside out with a safety pin, and then you attached it to the slip, and one of my sisters was in charge of turning the straps inside out.</span> <span id="s340">And then one of us would deliver it, because they were piecemeal, they were made for someone and then we would deliver it, and, she also worked in a restaurant, because by her working in a restaurant we were able to go have dinner there, so it helped with the food.</span> <span id="s341">She was always a very hard worker, even when she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s342">She's a Rock of Gibraltar, four eleven but an incredible little lady.</span> <span id="s343">As a matter of fact, she was one of six sisters and the only one who lived after the war.</span> <span id="s344">The difference between her and her sisters, let me just make a comment.</span> <span id="s345">I was at a conference about two weeks ago where Lyle(ph) Hilberg(ph) and Yahuda(ph) Ballo(ph) were debating whether survival depended on pure luck or whether it was the personality of individuals that helped them to survive.</span> <span id="s346">And when I went home, I, that whole night I thought about that, and, of course, I related it to our own personal lives, and I realized that short of physically being taken and killed, a lot of it had to do with personality.</span> <span id="s347">Knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity and acting upon it without too much debate, without too much reflection.</span> <span id="s348">To move, to constantly move.</span> <span id="s349">Mom was like that, but she had been a rebel way back.</span> <span id="s350">She came from a very religious orthodox family in Romania.</span> <span id="s351">She was born in Siget(ph) which is Transylvania and lived in Romania.</span> <span id="s352">And she was the only one of six sisters who decided to leave and go to Belgium.</span> <span id="s353">So there was part of a rebel, not someone who is going to just sit still and let life lead her.</span> <span id="s354">She eventually brought her younger sister to Belgium.</span> <span id="s355">And the same thing happened during the war.</span> <span id="s356">I know you want me to talk chronologically, but let me jump ahead a little bit.</span> <span id="s357">At one point when we were going into hiding, the problem you ran into with that was that the people who would hide you, particularly there was an official, not an official, an organized network in Belgium that hid children, but they couldn't tell you where they would take the children to.</span> <span id="s358">Because if you were caught, what you didn't know you couldn't tell, should you be tortured.</span> <span id="s359">So, they didn't tell.</span> <span id="s360">My aunt wouldn't let her child go, she could not bring herself to let him go.</span> <span id="s361">My mom took the risk, we're alive, my little cousin is not.</span> <span id="s362">When my aunt and uncle were already in our clandestine apartment, which they never left in more than eight months, and my mother begged them to accompany her to another hiding place, my aunt's attitude was, there's no place to run, they'll find us, where are we gonna run?</span> <span id="s363">My aunt is not alive, she died at Auschwitz, and mom lived.</span> <span id="s364">Because mom, that does not mean that mom could not have gotten caught, but she still, she kept acting, she kept moving and trying.</span> <span id="s365">Anyway, going back...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: I wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the various restrictions placed upon Jews in Antwerp and how you felt about that, how it impacted you, your school, your play, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s368">We couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s369">At one point we couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s370">Actually, yeah, we were supposed to go to a, Jewish schools were still operating a little bit, but technically, we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s371">Then Jews had to give up their radios.</span> <span id="s372">Jews had to give up their bicycles.</span> <span id="s373">And there was this constant attitude, well, if we do what we're told to do, a bicycle is very important in Belgium.</span> <span id="s374">I mean, people practically lived on their bicycles.</span> <span id="s375">But that, okay, so you give up the bicycles, so you give up this.</span> <span id="s376">Then, but there was, you became upset, you became angry because you couldn't have your bicycles any more, because you couldn't have radios any more.</span> <span id="s377">Also, once we started wearing the star, we didn't risk as much going out of the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s378">We didn't live in an official ghetto, as they did in Warsaw and Lódz and places like that, in Poland, but for all practical purposes, once we wore the star we might as well have lived in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s379">Because, you didn't dare venture out too far from home.</span> <span id="s380">You didn't feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s381">If you, for example, when I was, just before I was told we couldn't go to school anymore, I would wear the star and I would go to school and I'd hold a book up sort of covering my star.</span> <span id="s382">And youngsters would walk over and pull away the book and say, don't you know it's a crime to cover up your star?</span> <span id="s383">Which was true.</span> <span id="s384">It was a crime, you weren't supposed to cover it up.</span> <span id="s385">But, even children were drawn into that situation, and children can be cruel.</span> <span id="s386">So, it did create a lot of discomfort.</span> <span id="s387">You couldn't go to the park anymore, it was forbidden to go there.</span> <span id="s388">You couldn't go to the movies, Jews weren't allowed in the movies.</span> <span id="s389">You couldn't go to an ice cream parlor or restaurants, there were signs, signs went up different places.</span> <span id="s390">So, you found yourself sort of retreating.</span> <span id="s391">The only saving grace, so to speak, that there was, was that you weren't alone.</span> <span id="s392">Other kids were in the same boat.</span> <span id="s393">Your neighbors were in the same situation.</span> <span id="s394">So, that kind, and you did, it was, the feelings were very strange.</span> <span id="s395">It was, you found yourself being very, at that point, I remember becoming very unhappy.</span> <span id="s396">And, not understanding why.</span> <span id="s397">I knew what was going on, but what I couldn't understand is the why.</span> <span id="s398">What did we do?</span> <span id="s399">Why us?</span> <span id="s400">I remembered before the war, we were happy, we went, we came, and then all of a sudden, everything changed, and that is where I had great difficulty, with that why.</span> <span id="s401">Then there was another element for us, personally, at that point, mom got upset with dad.</span> <span id="s402">He's in America, he's, why did he leave us, you know, somehow thinking that if he had been there, he would have been okay.</span> <span id="s403">We would have all been okay, which we wouldn't have been.</span> <span id="s404">It would have probably even been worse.</span> <span id="s405">For the simple reason, being alone, she made all the decisions, she didn't have to consult and there didn't have to be a discussion as to should we, shouldn't we.</span> <span id="s406">She decided, and we did.</span> <span id="s407">But, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s408">My little sisters had even greater difficulty with it.</span> <span id="s409">And I found myself constantly saying, don't worry, it'll be okay.</span> <span id="s410">It'll be okay.</span> <span id="s411">Because there was crying, why can't we go here, why can't we go there, and why can't we do this.</span> <span id="s412">And then food started being a problem because Jews, the rationing stamps were stopped for Jews.</span> <span id="s413">We couldn't have rationing stamps.</span> <span id="s414">Now, if you didn't have rationing stamps, you couldn't buy food.</span> <span id="s415">We still had a small advantage.</span> <span id="s416">Mom worked in the restaurant as a cook.</span> <span id="s417">So, we were able to go and have a meal there, but even that slowed down because the restaurants had to start using ration stamps, so then we couldn't have, and then mom lost her job.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Were you ever turned away from anything?</span> <span id="s419">You said that all of a sudden you couldn't do this, you couldn't do that...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s421">I went with my sisters, after we couldn't go to school anymore, I remember I went, remember I mentioned the park we always went to?</span> <span id="s422">It was at the end of our street, it's called the Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park, at the end of our street.</span> <span id="s423">I remember going with my sisters to the park, and there was a sign, no Jews allowed, and, but there was no gate.</span> <span id="s424">And we walked, I said come on, we walked in and all of a sudden a guard walked out of nowhere and he looked at us and he goes, like that.</span> <span id="s425">And I remember going... And I didn't say anything, I just remember going like this, so we had to turn around and go.</span> <span id="s426">And my little sisters were devastated, because we went there every day, it was like natural, it was our, quote, our park.</span> <span id="s427">You know, that's where we had picnics on the week-ends with the friends and neighbors, that's where we went after school, our park, and we couldn't go there.</span> <span id="s428">We used to go to the movies, and we couldn't go to the movies.</span> <span id="s429">We used to go get ice cream, and we couldn't get ice cream.</span> <span id="s430">So, there were a lot of things, and we started finding our way of life sort of narrowing.</span> <span id="s431">A friend of mine wrote her biography, autobiography, and she called the book, the Shrinking Circle.</span> <span id="s432">But that's exactly what it was, sort of your world started shrinking and getting smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s433">So, we found ourselves ending up just never really going far from the building we lived in and just playing there.</span> <span id="s434">But, again, there were other kids in the same boat.</span> <span id="s435">So, we ended up playing together and, you know, children have a way, though, of surviving.</span> <span id="s436">So, while this was all going on, as I said, my uncle and aunt had already left and they started coming and arresting people.</span> <span id="s437">Not many, one, two, and then later on they came with a van that was about the size of, you know, the small vans that we have?</span> <span id="s438">It would come around, it would stop, a siren would get off, four or five Gestapo men would just jump out, go into a building, pull out a couple of people, take off with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: What people?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, we assumed that it was people who had broken some kind of law, who hadn't obeyed a law, who must have done something, this was an assumption at first, must have done something wrong.</span> <span id="s441">But, it increased and increased.</span> <span id="s442">And then we realized that they started arresting people, also rumors started reaching us.</span> <span id="s443">You know, it was very interesting, they did things in such a way that, if somehow you had contact, managed to contact someone from another city and you would tell them, they would say, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s444">Nothing was done in a manner simultaneously in different cities or across an entire country.</span> <span id="s445">When they were arresting people in Brussels, they were still not arresting in, I mean, in Antwerp they were still not arresting in Brussels.</span> <span id="s446">Or in another part of the country.</span> <span id="s447">It was, they were, they were incredible psychologists.</span> <span id="s448">They were, the same way with my uncle I said going off for forced labor.</span> <span id="s449">You do what you're told to do, we won't touch your wife and child.</span> <span id="s450">And at first, that's exactly what they did.</span> <span id="s451">And then people started, like I said, being arrested and not coming back.</span> <span id="s452">By then, just about that time, all of a sudden, one day, Carl shows up, my father's friend.</span> <span id="s453">The Christian officer of the ship that he had been on.</span> <span id="s454">We had not heard from him from the time that dad had jumped ship.</span> <span id="s455">It seemed that he had been attached to the Commandant Tour in Antwerp, and, you know, I've been wracking my brain trying to remember his last name, and I can't.</span> <span id="s456">I had, just before my mom died in '92, I kept, the last few years, it didn't occur to me, I always thought of Carl, I never thought of his last name, and it wasn't until here, in the last few years just before mom died, that it all of a sudden occurred to me that I didn't know Carl's last name.</span> <span id="s457">And I asked her and she says, Oh, my God, I've forgotten.</span> <span id="s458">She could not recall his last name.</span> <span id="s459">So, this is something that escapes me to this day, is his last name.</span> <span id="s460">But anyway, he showed up one day, and mom, of course, is worried, she saw a uniform.</span> <span id="s461">Because by then we started getting very nervous if anybody in uniform came to visit.</span> <span id="s462">And he says, just relax, he says, how are you, how is David?</span> <span id="s463">Have you heard from him?</span> <span id="s464">So, she had to tell him that we hadn't.</span> <span id="s465">How are the children?</span> <span id="s466">He came around a few times and brought us food, but then some of neighbors are saying, what are you doing with this German?</span> <span id="s467">What are you doing with this Deutsche(ph)?</span> <span id="s468">So, she begged him, she says, don't come.</span> <span id="s469">She says, I'll manage.</span> <span id="s470">And he didn't.</span> <span id="s471">One day he did show up.</span> <span id="s472">Didn't stay, just came, very quickly, brusquely said, Fanny, take the kids, if you can get out of town, go.</span> <span id="s473">And she says, why?</span> <span id="s474">He says, just do what I tell you to do.</span> <span id="s475">Turns around and takes off.</span> <span id="s476">Didn't even wait to, I can't, looking at it now, thinking back, I think he, himself, probably was afraid, because he was Army.</span> <span id="s477">Although, mom seemed to remember and, see I remember him being Army, mom seemed to remember that he had a black uniform.</span> <span id="s478">Now, if indeed the uniform was black, then he was attached to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s479">So there, I have a little, there's a little cloud there.</span> <span id="s480">I'm not 100% sure whether he was or was not attached to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Did he suggest where you should go?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No.</span> <span id="s483">Nothing, he didn't even stay.</span> <span id="s484">And I remember that, I was there.</span> <span id="s485">He just didn't even stay.</span> <span id="s486">Just took off.</span> <span id="s487">Mom didn't hesitate, she immediately, she took off my star, she took off her star and she put a double layer of clothing on each of us, and we took off.</span> <span id="s488">We went to the train and we took a train, where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s489">We're going to go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s490">To, because somehow, through people, my aunt had let us know where she was.</span> <span id="s491">So we knew where to find her.</span> <span id="s492">And by then, people still weren't really going underground.</span> <span id="s493">The only ones at that point, that were really going underground, were people who were, like my uncle, who refused to go again for forced labor, who didn't show up, people like that.</span> <span id="s494">And, of course, unfortunately, those who disappeared or those who might have been _____________.</span> <span id="s495">We had a problem, mother's card by then, when we registered and we got the stars and everything, they stamped everyone's identity card in two languages.</span> <span id="s496">______________ in French and Yode(ph) in English.</span> <span id="s497">So, mom's card was stamped.</span> <span id="s498">And you could be stopped at any point, anytime, you could be stopped on the street, there were always checkpoints, no matter where you went, so we, basically, had to pray.</span> <span id="s499">We get a ticket, 40 minutes later you can get off in Brussels, it's very simple, very easy.</span> <span id="s500">However, trains can be stopped at any time, so if they stopped the train and they came in and they would ask for documents, we would be caught.</span> <span id="s501">By then there was already a lot of suspicion that people were being deported.</span> <span id="s502">There were rumors and, but people didn't know exactly, but you knew you were in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Approximately when...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: This was, you're going into spring, like winter, late winter, spring of '42.</span> <span id="s505">About this time.</span> <span id="s506">Well, by the previous December, December of '41, that's already school and everything was closed, we weren't allowed to go to school and that's when they already took people, but nothing massive yet.</span> <span id="s507">But that was getting into the spring, summer of '42.</span> <span id="s508">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s509">We did make it to Brussels, they didn't stop the train, and we get to Brussels.</span> <span id="s510">And we're ready to leave the station and there's a mob of people.</span> <span id="s511">We couldn't get, there's a staircase that you have to go down before you can exit.</span> <span id="s512">And there was a mob of people, there was a checkpoint at the bottom of the staircase.</span> <span id="s513">And, mom panicked.</span> <span id="s514">So, she looks at us and says, pick a fight.</span> <span id="s515">It's amazing, you know, we were young, but, there was this instant matter of being able to obey orders.</span> <span id="s516">You sensed, as young as you were, you may not have known the details, but you sensed that you were in danger.</span> <span id="s517">So, we picked a fight.</span> <span id="s518">And we started kicking and screaming, people started making way for us and we ended up down the stairs and one of the people at the checkpoint, I remember, said, in German, you know, get out of here with these brats, technically, and mom pretended she didn't understand him, although she did very well because Yiddish and German, the same language, they teach it here by the way, at our local universities through the German department.</span> <span id="s519">Not the Oriental department, the German department.</span> <span id="s520">So, he then said in broken French, _____________________, so we did, we left.</span> <span id="s521">And, amazingly enough, we made it out of the station.</span> <span id="s522">And we caught our breath about a block or two.</span> <span id="s523">We didn't, it was amazing, we didn't talk.</span> <span id="s524">We just walked, without rushing too quickly, although that's what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s525">And we did make it out and we made it to my aunt's, and we couldn't stay really where she stayed because it was a really tiny little place.</span> <span id="s526">And we found a place to stay and we took a neighbor into our confidence.</span> <span id="s527">At that point, we changed our name.</span> <span id="s528">So, we settled in and mom managed to get some work, which is, basically, most work at that point was done on the black market, so to speak.</span> <span id="s529">It wasn't legal work.</span> <span id="s530">Also, sewing she did.</span> <span id="s531">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Q: What did you change your name to?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Fiers, F-I-E-R-S.</span> <span id="s534">And, we didn't change our first names because they were Belgian enough and secular enough, so people who were named Sarah or Abraham, you know, they changed their names totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Did you get any kind of identification with these new names?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span> <span id="s537">Not at that point, not at that point.</span> <span id="s538">At that point, mom just enrolled us in school and I still can't understand, they took us in and I know you need birth certificates and things to enroll kids in school.</span> <span id="s539">Somehow, I have a feeling, I've thought about this recently, I have a feeling that the principal, when mom enrolled us, was already suspecting that we were Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s540">She never asked us for documents, mom just enrolled us.</span> <span id="s541">And, we didn't stay too long.</span> <span id="s542">We only stayed a few weeks.</span> <span id="s543">Uh, my middle sister ended up having an argument with another child and the, that particular child's brother, who was an adult, was part of the Blackshirts, Belgian Blackshirts, which was Belgian Nazis.</span> <span id="s544">We, as I said, we went for a few weeks and I remember just before we stopped going to the school, a man came into the class that I was in, handed out slips of paper to the kids wearing Jewish stars, kids were in that school with Jewish stars, the one condition that we had when mom enrolled us in the school, she enrolled us under that false name, Fiers, we couldn't tell anybody we were Jewish, even the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s545">And that was hard.</span> <span id="s546">That was hard.</span> <span id="s547">Because you kind of wanted to tell them, I'm like you, you know?</span> <span id="s548">But you couldn't, we couldn't, and we didn't.</span> <span id="s549">We didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: ________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">End of tape one.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Tape two</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: I want to just go back to Antwerp a minute and see if there's anything else you can remember about what life was like before you went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s554">You talked about the Germans coming and ____ taking people away, did you see any act of violence against the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I, let me give you a few incidences.</span> <span id="s556">For example, one day we were in the apartment, my two sisters and I, mom was at work.</span> <span id="s557">And I remember we were standing near the window, looking out, and we saw a group of Blackshirts, who were Belgian Nazis, coming into the street.</span> <span id="s558">Across the street from us there was a small book store, actually the store had Jewish books, _______, which were the prayer shawls, and all kinds of Judaica.</span> <span id="s559">The broke the window, they stormed into that shop and I remember them pulling out the old man who ran it.</span> <span id="s560">He had a long beard, they literally, they pulled at the beard and they pulled his side locks to the side and all that.</span> <span id="s561">And then they threw him down in the middle of the street and I remember they kicked him, they literally kicked him with their boots, and I remember we stood near the window holding each other and shaking, the three of us, we were just devastated.</span> <span id="s562">And we were frozen, but yet, we stood at the window, looking.</span> <span id="s563">It was one of the more difficult moments.</span> <span id="s564">The other time, I remember we had gone for a walk, because we still walked out and, you know, we didn't stay confined yet at that point, and I remember seeing a fire wagons at the big synagogue, and there was a crowd of people around it.</span> <span id="s565">And I looked and the synagogue was burning and the, they put the fire, they waited, they weren't putting the fire out and that's what I remember was bothering me.</span> <span id="s566">I didn't see the firemen, I remember seeing the firemen standing and not doing anything.</span> <span id="s567">And only after a while, I saw them go in and putting out the fire.</span> <span id="s568">I didn't learn until after the war that they had strict orders not to put the fire out until the fire threatened the adjoining buildings.</span> <span id="s569">But, at that time, I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s570">I just saw ___________.</span> <span id="s571">But, before the synagogue was burning, I was there just, I remember.</span> <span id="s572">I remember seeing, while the synagogue was burning, I remember also seeing a pile of books and Torah Scrolls laying messed up in front of the synagogue and I was told after, I also learned afterward, that they had been pulled out first and dumped in the street.</span> <span id="s573">So, but basically, what I saw was the crowd of people, the firemen doing nothing and the synagogue burning.</span> <span id="s574">And it wasn't until afterwards that I learned how the whole thing had proceeded.</span> <span id="s575">And I remember being scared.</span> <span id="s576">I remember being quite scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Now, you, it sounds like you and your sisters were on your own a bit, did your mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: We were on our own a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: ...leave instruction with you?</span> <span id="s580">Did she, did she kind of tell you what was going on and how to act differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: You were in charge of both of your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, yeah.</span> <span id="s584">Okay.</span> <span id="s585">Me, she told.</span> <span id="s586">She also let us know, all three of us, that if we didn't behave a certain way, that we could get hurt.</span> <span id="s587">Basically, that we could get hurt.</span> <span id="s588">Later on, we learned from my mother that if we didn't behave or act in a certain way, if we didn't remember our false name and things like that, that we could be taken away and killed.</span> <span id="s589">She didn't say by whom or how, but that, basically, was it.</span> <span id="s590">Me, she told me more, and she says that all the things that I had heard before the war were true.</span> <span id="s591">That was the first time I was, you know, by '41 or so, that I started learning that the things that she had said before the war that the people were exaggerating, that, of course, they weren't really exaggerating, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: When you say behave in a certain way, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s594">A, to be very, very good.</span> <span id="s595">To never draw attention to ourselves by anything that we did.</span> <span id="s596">And the biggest thing, once we ended up in Brussels, was to never forget our false name and to never forget that we were, quote, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s597">That we were Christians.</span> <span id="s598">And, as for me, if someone asked, I was supposed to say that I had already had my first communion.</span> <span id="s599">I didn't even know what it was, but, those are basically, you know, some of the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Were there things you had to learn at this point about being Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s602">Not yet.</span> <span id="s603">Not in Brussels.</span> <span id="s604">That was only if we were approached.</span> <span id="s605">But no one approached us.</span> <span id="s606">As long as we remembered our false name, at this point we were okay, because we were still living in a very secular world.</span> <span id="s607">But, we weren't really out, once we got to Brussels, except for the few weeks that we went to school and back to the apartment, and just going back, we didn't really move around too much.</span> <span id="s608">The only other place that we went was to a house that was across the street from the school where mom had gotten a job working as a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s609">Because by now things are getting very difficult.</span> <span id="s610">There was no place to really work any more.</span> <span id="s611">Don't forget, this wasn't Antwerp where she was sewing and working at the restaurant.</span> <span id="s612">Once we got to Brussels, she couldn't really work legally anymore.</span> <span id="s613">So, she cleaned the house for these people.</span> <span id="s614">And, but that, you know, things didn't last, it wasn't that, it only lasted a few weeks and then what happened is, after my, Charlotte, it was the middle one, it was always Charlotte for some reason.</span> <span id="s615">Charlotte had a fight with this child in school, we learned that, later on, that even the instructors at the school were worried about this child.</span> <span id="s616">Because when this child said some, I'll get my brother on you, there was good reason.</span> <span id="s617">Her brother was a Belgian Nazi.</span> <span id="s618">Everyone in school was afraid of her.</span> <span id="s619">The principal, one day, said to me, Flora, ask your mother to come to school.</span> <span id="s620">And by then I said the other kids had already had gotten these slips of papers and I later learned what it said.</span> <span id="s621">For example, they got them on a Friday and they were, the paper basically said, told the parents or whoever were the guardians, that on the Monday following this Friday, I have no date to give you here, you know, all I remember is it was a Friday, they were to report to another school.</span> <span id="s622">To the best of my knowledge, those children reported, but never came home.</span> <span id="s623">I have no documentation of that.</span> <span id="s624">That's word of mouth.</span> <span id="s625">That is what I learned.</span> <span id="s626">And when mom came to school, her first reaction was, and my reaction when the principal told me this, well, we didn't do anything, we were good, because they never called parents to school.</span> <span id="s627">See, there was no thing about parent-teachers association, you didn't have that over there.</span> <span id="s628">When a parent was called to school, it was because a child did not behave.</span> <span id="s629">So, my reaction was, well, we're good, my sisters are good, we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s630">And she says, no, I know you didn't do anything, I want to talk to mom.</span> <span id="s631">So, when, meanwhile, just prior to that, also, all that was happening within those same weeks, she realized that we didn't have really warm winter coats.</span> <span id="s632">So, she had made arrangements for us to receive a winter coat and also receive a glass of milk every day.</span> <span id="s633">That was like for poor children, but what we didn't know is that those winter coats and the milk came from an industrialist, Msr.</span> <span id="s634">Rausank(ph).</span> <span id="s635">He was the patron, we didn't have, as I said, parent-teacher associations, but what you had is patrons of the school.</span> <span id="s636">And which a rich industrialist or another wealthy individual would take a school under their patronage and give poor children clothing, vitamins, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s637">So Msr.</span> <span id="s638">Rausank(ph) happened to be the patron of the school, ______________, where we were going to.</span> <span id="s639">And when mom came to school, of course, her first reaction, too, when I told her the principal wanted to see her was, what did you do?</span> <span id="s640">I said, mamma, we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s641">And I answered for my two little children because they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s642">So, she did go to school and the principal said, Madame ____________, she called her, said Mrs. Fiers, I know you're Jewish and I'd like to help you.</span> <span id="s643">And mom denied up and down.</span> <span id="s644">And she says, look, let's not waste time arguing, I will put you in contact with Msr.</span> <span id="s645">Rausank(ph), and he, I think it's time for the children to be hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Now, before we go into that chapter, I just have a couple additional questions.</span> <span id="s647">When, after moving to Brussels, did you ever have occasion to go back to Antwerp, what was that...</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s649">I should have mentioned that earlier.</span> <span id="s650">Once we got to Brussels, at first, when Carl told us to leave, mom reacted, like I said, put a double layer of clothing on us, we took off, we ended up, and we made it safely to Brussels.</span> <span id="s651">Once we were settled in Brussels, it was, I don't even know, I think it was no more than about 48 hours later, or something like that.</span> <span id="s652">It was within a day or so.</span> <span id="s653">If even the same night, I don't remember the exact time period, at this point.</span> <span id="s654">I'm getting old and my memory is starting to go.</span> <span id="s655">That's why I'm glad we're doing this, in a way.</span> <span id="s656">She said, Florika(ph), you're going back to Antwerp, you're going to warn everybody.</span> <span id="s657">You're going to tell them that something's going to happen.</span> <span id="s658">And, I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s659">She says, my attitude was, why don't you go?</span> <span id="s660">She says, you're a child, you can go.</span> <span id="s661">You don't have an identity card.</span> <span id="s662">You see, children didn't walk around with identity cards unless they were Jewish and wore the star.</span> <span id="s663">She says, you'll go, you'll tell everybody that's something's going to happen and then you'll come back.</span> <span id="s664">So, the one thing, we always obeyed.</span> <span id="s665">My mother, we did not disobey my mother, ever.</span> <span id="s666">Of course, if we could help it, but, we did obey.</span> <span id="s667">And I went.</span> <span id="s668">I went.</span> <span id="s669">I took the train, I went back to Antwerp, and I was looking for someone to tell them.</span> <span id="s670">The streets in the neighborhood were extremely quiet.</span> <span id="s671">I didn't see anybody in the streets, the shops were quiet.</span> <span id="s672">I walked around, I saw nobody.</span> <span id="s673">And I started feeling very frightened.</span> <span id="s674">I wanted to leave and go back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s675">However, how could I go back to Brussels without telling somebody?</span> <span id="s676">I had to obey and fulfill what mom had told me to do.</span> <span id="s677">As I was walking on the street, there was one street that was called the, I believe it was the Laminerestratt(ph), I was walking, it was starting to get towards evening, and I was always very afraid of the dark.</span> <span id="s678">I still am.</span> <span id="s679">And I saw it getting between day and night and I said, I really want to go back, but I didn't do what I was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s680">And while I was walking and debating what to do, I hear a knock near the bottom of my feet.</span> <span id="s681">And I look down and I see a hand saying...it was someone who was related to us, like a distant cousins and relatives who were in, down near that, it was like a cellar window, like one of those little cellar windows.</span> <span id="s682">I knew how to get into that building.</span> <span id="s683">I went down two houses and went in and I made my way down to that cellar.</span> <span id="s684">There were several people holed up there.</span> <span id="s685">And they said, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s686">I thought you left.</span> <span id="s687">And I said, well, mamma sent me back to tell everybody to leave.</span> <span id="s688">That something's going to happen.</span> <span id="s689">She says, you're a little bit late.</span> <span id="s690">What had happened is, just shortly after we left, ________________ came in with trucks and they emptied several of the streets.</span> <span id="s691">That, there were people, there were still Jews in Antwerp, but that quarter, except for people that they missed, like those people that they missed.</span> <span id="s692">So, I said to them, well, you better come with me.</span> <span id="s693">And they said, no, we have food for several weeks.</span> <span id="s694">And there's no place to go.</span> <span id="s695">We'll just stay put.</span> <span id="s696">See, there was that, you know, you had sort of a mixed bag, you know, people say, why did Jews go like sheep to the slaughter?</span> <span id="s697">They didn't go like sheep to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s698">But there were people who did become paralyzed, that's the only way I can describe it.</span> <span id="s699">If they became paralyzed like, we can't, where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s700">There was, there was a panic that set in, that kind of paralyzed them.</span> <span id="s701">There was like a disbelief also.</span> <span id="s702">Because here you, don't forget, Belgium was a very free country.</span> <span id="s703">You were able to walk on the street and say, I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s704">I mean, very tolerant, the Belgian government paid for parochial schools be they Jewish, be they Christian, Catholic, Protestant, whatever.</span> <span id="s705">See, but in that country, even though you did have the fascists, you did have those components, but on the whole, the country was a comfortable place for people of any religion to live in.</span> <span id="s706">So, a lot of people did become sort of, like I said, paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And that was your sense at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: That was my sense at the time, right.</span> <span id="s709">I was frustrated, I remember being frustrated.</span> <span id="s710">Okay?</span> <span id="s711">I remember I said, no, mamma said you've got to come.</span> <span id="s712">You have to come.</span> <span id="s713">So, and I, like I felt like I couldn't leave, they were like, they were upsetting me, I was actually getting upset because I was supposed to tell them that they have to leave.</span> <span id="s714">And, they didn't, I left myself.</span> <span id="s715">Took the train, went back to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you have any sense at the time, either in Antwerp or Brussels, what the Christian response to all of this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s718">Not yet.</span> <span id="s719">No, no.</span> <span id="s720">That part was, don't forget, out of my realm.</span> <span id="s721">And there was, you know, there was not that kind of a contact.</span> <span id="s722">No.</span> <span id="s723">We lived in a narrow mentally, for us the world became very narrow.</span> <span id="s724">You know.</span> <span id="s725">If mom had a sense of what the Christian world's reaction was, except for the immediate people that you dealt with, I don't know if she even knew yet at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: You know, just for clarity, I wanted to date this time period.</span> <span id="s727">This was late spring of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: This was like very late spring, like toward the end of the school year.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: '42, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s732">So, why don't you continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s734">By August of that year, we, Msr.</span> <span id="s735">Rausonk(ph) had come, actually in June yet, Msr.</span> <span id="s736">Rausonk(ph) had come into the picture and he immediately made arrangements.</span> <span id="s737">A, he gave mom a job in the factory.</span> <span id="s738">He made false documents for mom.</span> <span id="s739">He took me into this home, my sister, one of them went to his brother's home, the third one went to his secretary, and he started making arrangements to hide us in a convent of the Franciscan nuns in Doel, D-O-E-L.</span> <span id="s740">The Flemish part of the country.</span> <span id="s741">He had a cousin who also this past spring received posthumously, the medal and the title, Just of the Nations from _______________ in Israel.</span> <span id="s742">So, he made arrangements with her to hide us.</span> <span id="s743">Doel was a very small town.</span> <span id="s744">It was, it's a one street town, in fact, I've gone back there and I've only afterwards, realized how small it really was.</span> <span id="s745">One single street and one cross street, that was about it.</span> <span id="s746">It was a convent of Franciscans, nuns, it had been a boarding school.</span> <span id="s747">But, there were no children now because of the war.</span> <span id="s748">And since it was right near the sea, sort of in the line of battle, there were no kids.</span> <span id="s749">There was also one outpost, one German outpost, one church.</span> <span id="s750">Msr.</span> <span id="s751">Rausonk(ph) took us there personally.</span> <span id="s752">Well, first, as I said, I stayed in his home and...</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s754">I want you to tell me about the trip there.</span> <span id="s755">Like, how much did you and your sisters know at this point about where you were going and what, you know, what was happening and...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: You know, it was almost like a fog.</span> <span id="s757">We knew we had to be hidden.</span> <span id="s758">We knew that somebody could take us away and kill us, although the word kill us was very vague.</span> <span id="s759">We knew that if we made the slightest mistake, if we disobeyed, if we made noise when we were supposed to be quiet, if we cried, we would not be taken care of.</span> <span id="s760">And then all these bad things can happen to us.</span> <span id="s761">And the words even bad things, was pretty, it was vague.</span> <span id="s762">Because, you know, when you're a child, even the work kill or taken away and bad things can, it's something that frightens you, but you don't have that clear concept.</span> <span id="s763">I had it and I didn't have it.</span> <span id="s764">I knew I had to protect my sisters from all these bad things.</span> <span id="s765">I had to make sure that they didn't betray themselves, that they didn't accidentally say their real name.</span> <span id="s766">Or say that they weren't Christian.</span> <span id="s767">But, it wasn't that, okay, the Gestapo will take me, they will take me to the camp, they will gas me, they will, you know, I didn't know, we just knew this global concept, we'll be taken away, we'll be killed, bad things will happen to us.</span> <span id="s768">But, nobody really knew yet.</span> <span id="s769">Yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Did you put up a fight at all about leaving your mother, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No, it was, you know, this is something we talk about, my sisters and I, to this day.</span> <span id="s772">The way, you know, because I look at my grandchildren, and my own children when they were raised, I mean, just to make, to get them to even eat or do homework sometimes, you know, is a little battle, when they want to watch TV and all.</span> <span id="s773">And, I look at them, and I say, I have a grandson who, one is married, one's this 13, he will celebrate his Bar Mitzvah January 1, and I look at them, and I say, I can't believe how young they are in comparison to how old we were at that time, without knowing precisely.</span> <span id="s774">No, we did not, even the little one, even the little one, was so well behaved.</span> <span id="s775">Although, I did have to pinch her a lot.</span> <span id="s776">To get her to behave.</span> <span id="s777">She had a habit of biting and I had to constantly tell her, don't bite someone because they're going to send us away.</span> <span id="s778">Don't scream, they're going to send us away.</span> <span id="s779">Don't cry, they're going to send us away.</span> <span id="s780">Don't ask for more food, they'll send us away.</span> <span id="s781">And we knew that we couldn't afford to be sent away.</span> <span id="s782">That was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: You had a lot of responsibility for an 11 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes, it's amazing I'm halfway normal.</span> <span id="s785">Sometimes I think about it and I say to myself, you know, I miss, the one thing that I do miss is having had some frivolous light years.</span> <span id="s786">I am younger today than I was then.</span> <span id="s787">Because when I came to the United States at 16, I was old.</span> <span id="s788">And I look at 16 year olds and I say, they're such babies.</span> <span id="s789">They're such babies.</span> <span id="s790">And I remembered I was handed a piece of paper to sign to vote for two people, which one do I like best?</span> <span id="s791">Frank Sinatra, Perry Como.</span> <span id="s792">I didn't even know who they were.</span> <span id="s793">And when I learned what it was the kids wanted me to sign, I said, what kind of stupidity, don't they know any better?</span> <span id="s794">They were babies, I was isolated.</span> <span id="s795">I was a very lonely teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: I want to get to that later, but I just, it must have been hard having responsibility for your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: It was!</span> <span id="s798">But, I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s799">I just knew this is what mom had told me to do.</span> <span id="s800">And I have to do it.</span> <span id="s801">And it was something that I had, was doing already, from the time that I was like seven and a half, eight.</span> <span id="s802">Because from my earliest recollections, what I heard constantly was, don't be such a child.</span> <span id="s803">Go take care of the children.</span> <span id="s804">Don't be such a child.</span> <span id="s805">Or don't be a child.</span> <span id="s806">So, I, I was not a child.</span> <span id="s807">It was my mom and me and the kids.</span> <span id="s808">And that's the way it went.</span> <span id="s809">And even as adults, it was mom and me and the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Any thoughts about your father at this point?</span> <span id="s811">Or he was really in the background?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: By now, we weren't really thinking about him.</span> <span id="s813">I mean, at first there was, and there was anger.</span> <span id="s814">We didn't, there was really no reason to be angry, but, you see, we didn't know that he was going to jump ship.</span> <span id="s815">The aunt here had talked him into doing this.</span> <span id="s816">He had no intention of not coming back.</span> <span id="s817">As it turned out, there was, for him it was the best thing, but he had no intention.</span> <span id="s818">But he was talked into it and the attitude was, well, you come and we'll immediately take Fanny and the kids.</span> <span id="s819">But, of course, by the time he realized that he couldn't get Fanny and the kids here, the war started and the rest is history.</span> <span id="s820">But, there was anger because I think we all have to lash out at somebody.</span> <span id="s821">So, whenever we did go, before we even went into hiding, when we were still together, I remember mamma getting upset many times.</span> <span id="s822">And, where she'd lash out, sure, he's safe, but you know, and, you know, we had, especially when she had some real difficult times, so, you know, yeah, there was anger.</span> <span id="s823">My anger lasted even after the war when I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: We'll get to that...so, I think you were beginning to tell me how you got to Doel?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Doel, right.</span> <span id="s826">We stayed no more than about two, two and a half months.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: How was the trip getting there, was that easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Okay, the trip getting there.</span> <span id="s829">Msr.</span> <span id="s830">Rausonk(ph) got a little flatbed truck and, it's amazing because later on we went to hiding places and we went openly by train, but I guess he must have been really frightened at this point, it was probably his first experience even doing this, although he was with the Resistance, so I'm sure he was involved in many other actions.</span> <span id="s831">He got a little flatbed truck, took some vegetable crates with, those wooden crates, fairly large, and put each of us under a crate.</span> <span id="s832">He then surrounded them and topped them with crates that were filled with vegetables and fruits.</span> <span id="s833">And when he was stopped at a checkpoint, well, because we had strict orders, not a sound, unless he stops the truck to let us go in the field, take care of our physical needs or to give us some food and a drink.</span> <span id="s834">At a checkpoint, he said especially when the truck stops, not a sound.</span> <span id="s835">And, I remember at one of the checkpoints, we had stopped and I heard him ask for documents which was standard procedure.</span> <span id="s836">No matter where you went, at any corner, any spot, you can be asked for documents.</span> <span id="s837">So, that was nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s838">He was asked for his documents and I know they were in order, and I remember hearing, what have you got there on the truck.</span> <span id="s839">He said, well, you can see, I've got vegetables, and I remember hearing like knocking on the crates, but we didn't make a sound.</span> <span id="s840">I always tell kids when I talk to them, the one thing I remember, and it's amazing the way you retain something.</span> <span id="s841">I had a tickle in my throat.</span> <span id="s842">And, I remember thinking that if I don't cough and clear my throat, that I was going to choke to death.</span> <span id="s843">But I also knew that if I cleared my throat and I made the slightest sound, Msr.</span> <span id="s844">Rausonk(ph) would be caught, then we would be caught.</span> <span id="s845">So I held out.</span> <span id="s846">I survived, apparently.</span> <span id="s847">I used to, when I taught, I used to make the kids do that in class.</span> <span id="s848">And I'd say, you know, see if you can hold out a minute.</span> <span id="s849">It's good exercise.</span> <span id="s850">But, anyway, that's how he drove us to Doel.</span> <span id="s851">And that's how he took us back to Brussels two and a half months later when the Mother Superior was afraid to keep us.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: So, describe your arrival at this convent, if you would.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s854">We got there, we were let into a parlor and we were left in the parlor with the nun and Msr.</span> <span id="s855">Rausonk(ph) took leave of us and he left.</span> <span id="s856">I had a feeling that he might have stayed to say goodbye to his cousin or something, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s857">But, he took leave of us and he left.</span> <span id="s858">And we're sitting in this parlor with the nun and all of a sudden Betty, the youngest, looks up at the wall and she sees a cross.</span> <span id="s859">And, which we had seen on churches, but we had strict orders we were never to walk into a church or anything.</span> <span id="s860">So, I knew really very little about Christianity.</span> <span id="s861">I knew there was a cross and that there someone by the name of Jesus Christ on the cross.</span> <span id="s862">Why, what, when, I knew absolutely nothing about.</span> <span id="s863">And, I knew that Christian children went to church on Sundays and Jewish children went to synagogue on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s864">But, I don't remember even thinking about the why's too much at that time because I associated mostly with the Jewish children, even though I knew some of the children in school, Christian children.</span> <span id="s865">So, she looks up and she says, what's that?</span> <span id="s866">And the nun looks kind of strangely at her and she says, of course, I'm Flemish, you know, why, that's our Lord on the cross, my little one.</span> <span id="s867">Sure you know, and do you have that at home?</span> <span id="s868">And she looks, and meanwhile, I started kicking, luckily there was a tablecloth, I started kicking her under the table.</span> <span id="s869">And she didn't make a move to listen to me.</span> <span id="s870">So then I pinched her and she says, stop hurting me!</span> <span id="s871">And, I'm like, dying.</span> <span id="s872">And I says, okay, we're lost.</span> <span id="s873">I didn't say it, I thought it.</span> <span id="s874">And Charlotte was just sitting quietly.</span> <span id="s875">Charlotte was very, very quiet.</span> <span id="s876">But, Betty was a rebel.</span> <span id="s877">That was the youngest.</span> <span id="s878">And, the nun says, well, I'm sure you have that at home.</span> <span id="s879">And she says, no, we don't.</span> <span id="s880">She says, well, what do you have?</span> <span id="s881">She says, I don't know what you call it, if you give me a pencil and paper, I'll show you.</span> <span id="s882">And she made the most beautiful Jewish star.</span> <span id="s883">Well, I thought, that's it, you know.</span> <span id="s884">The nun jumps out of her seat, runs out of the parlor, and, I mean, leaves the door wide open, two minutes later we see two nuns coming, I found out later one was Sister Adonia(ph), the other one was the Mother Superior, arguing loudly, chaos broke out.</span> <span id="s885">And, I learned later, of course, in retrospect, I learned later from Sister Adonia(ph), I didn't learn this until after the war, from Sister Adonia(ph), that she was the only one that knew we were Jewish children.</span> <span id="s886">She knew, but she told the Superior and Msr.</span> <span id="s887">Rausonk(ph) had, of course, I guess, instructed her to say something, that we were children of a prisoner of war whose mother had gotten ill, and who just needed a place to stay until our mother got well.</span> <span id="s888">But they were not told.</span> <span id="s889">She lied, actually, to her own Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s890">Which, you know, for a nun, so, I was, until 1993, I was under the impression that the reason we were sent away was because Betty betrayed us.</span> <span id="s891">In 1993, I found out differently.</span> <span id="s892">This little nun here told me.</span> <span id="s893">She, in 1993, I visited with her, I said to her, I said, Sister Roberta, I said, it's a shame we couldn't stay with you.</span> <span id="s894">If only Betty hadn't betrayed us.</span> <span id="s895">She said, Betty had nothing to do with it, it was you.</span> <span id="s896">I said, me?</span> <span id="s897">What did I do?</span> <span id="s898">She says, it was you.</span> <span id="s899">I said, so tell me.</span> <span id="s900">So, she told me.</span> <span id="s901">It seemed that, see, there was no chaplain, usually convents have a chaplain.</span> <span id="s902">There was no chaplain because of the war.</span> <span id="s903">The nuns went to the local church and the priest, on Sunday when he was preaching, said something to the effect of, it's a shame what's happening to the Jews, but, after all, they're paying for the sins of their father, and so forth, and so forth.</span> <span id="s904">And I would come back to the convent in a rage, and just go on and on, why does he keep saying that?</span> <span id="s905">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s906">My mother didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s907">We didn't kill anybody.</span> <span id="s908">We didn't hurt anybody.</span> <span id="s909">And the Mother Superior was afraid that someday, in my anger, I would say this to the wrong person and, so, we were returned to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: About two and a half months or so.</span> <span id="s912">Between two and a half months and three months.</span> <span id="s913">Even Sister Adonia(ph), after the war, wasn't sure if it was two and a half or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: During this two and a half months, or three months...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: It was great.</span> <span id="s916">They were so good to us.</span> <span id="s917">Sister Roberta and Sister Adonia(ph) took care of us.</span> <span id="s918">They crocheted little slippers for us because we wore the wooden clogs, and what you would usually do is, you would walk into them with the little, like a little slipper and then when you get to the front door, you just walk out into the house.</span> <span id="s919">You didn't walk in with the shoes.</span> <span id="s920">They, I remember her braiding my hair, I mean, they were just, really treated us wonderfully.</span> <span id="s921">There we were with all these nuns and, it was just nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Did they teach you any rudimentary Catholicism to just get you by?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Not much, well, we did learn who Jesus Christ was, and we learned what Mass was, and I also learned that I should have been, have had my communion and be able to go to communion, and I couldn't go because I wasn't baptized.</span> <span id="s924">So, I was told that if someone asked me, to say that my baptismal papers hadn't arrived, so they didn't feel they could let me go to communion.</span> <span id="s925">You know?</span> <span id="s926">So, but not really much there, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Learned a few prayers...?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s929">You know, just learned from the nuns, you know, Our Lord's Prayer, you know, but nothing really much at that point in time.</span> <span id="s930">By the end of the war, though, I knew catechism better than I knew Judaism, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Were you, were there certain rules you had to adhere to in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Not in that particular convent as much.</span> <span id="s933">You know, we had to obey, we had to really be good, but we were just basically the three of us with all those nuns, so, it, that place was kind of nice.</span> <span id="s934">Of course, we couldn't go where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s935">You know, we couldn't just walk out and go walking and things like that, or talk to any of the villagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: How did you spend your days?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: I did some crocheting, some knitting, we talked to the nuns.</span> <span id="s938">It's vague, it's pretty vague.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Do you remember ever having some sort of a contingency plan or a special hiding place if there was visitors?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Not in that particular convent.</span> <span id="s941">Later on, yes, but not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You never kept a diary during any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: What I did do, is I had written a few poems and a few things, some got lost, some had, I can't, there's one poem that I wrote in French and then I kind of polished it up, I don't have it with me.</span> <span id="s944">About, because what happened is, later on Charlotte was very, became enamored of catholicism and was talking in terms of she wanted to be baptized also, and I wrote this thing about my name being Jewish, and, one day I'll show you a copy.</span> <span id="s945">I should have maybe brought it, I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s946">It's somewhere is one of my drawers.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: You don't remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Not, well, basically, the sequence was that, you know, we were being pursued and why, and because my name is Jew, it's synonymous, I am you and you are me, and see, there was a girl in one of the later convents, course this was later on, one who did become baptized, and became Jewish again.</span> <span id="s949">That's a story in itself, and I said, you know, when they betrayed you, I didn't do, Charlotte almost did, I didn't do, you remained me and I remained you.</span> <span id="s950">My name is Jew.</span> <span id="s951">So, I still have it.</span> <span id="s952">I, actually, I submitted it in a French class when I went back to college, and it got an A, but that's not the issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Did you have any contact with your mother during this two month period?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Not, no, not during that time at all.</span> <span id="s955">The next time that we saw mother is when Msr.</span> <span id="s956">Rausonk(ph) took us back the same way that we came.</span> <span id="s957">And, so we did spend some time with mom again.</span> <span id="s958">And it was then that, apparently, Father Bruno came into the picture.</span> <span id="s959">Although, then I still did not know that he was in the picture.</span> <span id="s960">We were hidden after that, we were hidden in a, an orphanage in Etherbig(ph).</span> <span id="s961">Etherbig(ph) is a suburb of Brussels.</span> <span id="s962">A borough of Brussels.</span> <span id="s963">And, it was with the Sisters of St. Joseph.</span> <span id="s964">What I didn't know until after I was there for awhile is that some of the nuns were not really nuns, they were young Jewish women dressed as nuns.</span> <span id="s965">Who were also being hidden there.</span> <span id="s966">We were there for, I'm not sure if it was seven or eight months.</span> <span id="s967">There was a leak, how the leak took place or what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s968">All I know is that we, we did leave very suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Can you describe your arrival at the orphanage?</span> <span id="s970">What your impressions were...</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s972">The orphanage, there we were very unhappy.</span> <span id="s973">It was, things were very strict.</span> <span id="s974">The food was not enough and it was awful.</span> <span id="s975">There mom was able to come once in awhile.</span> <span id="s976">And she'd bring me some bread.</span> <span id="s977">The bread during the war was not really good, it was like, thick, heavy bread and the first day it almost tasted like clay.</span> <span id="s978">Cause I don't know, as the war progressed, they used all kinds of things to make bread go further.</span> <span id="s979">The second day it got a little chewier, the third day it started having mold on it, but we ate it anyway.</span> <span id="s980">And, we also, our bread there was also rationed in the, when I say rationed, we got a certain portion a day.</span> <span id="s981">And what I would do is, I would hold the bread for my sisters and myself to make sure that, because the little ones would eat up their bread right away and then they would cry they were hungry.</span> <span id="s982">And I wouldn't have anything to give them, so I held the bread and I gave them bits of it at a time.</span> <span id="s983">And there was a lot of stealing amongst the kids from each other of the bread and, I remember, like, at night, I would have the bread under my pillow but I couldn't sleep because somebody would always come and try to steal your bread from under your pillow.</span> <span id="s984">And I remember we also had terrible, we were packed with lice.</span> <span id="s985">And Betty, the youngest, had these big sores on her head because the lice got under her skin and caused infections.</span> <span id="s986">And, what I also had to do is, I was, I took the lice, as much as I could, and the little, they were like, I don't know if you call them nits or whatever, the little eggs that, they get stuck on, they get like stuck on the hair, and you have to actually, you can't just take them off, they, it's almost like they're cemented on, you have to literally hold the hair and pull them off.</span> <span id="s987">And then we'd crack them.</span> <span id="s988">And I took them out of my sister's head, but I couldn't really take my own out.</span> <span id="s989">So, I would pay a bite of bread, I would measure it, my thumb, from here to here, one piece of bread, for every ten lice they took out of my hair.</span> <span id="s990">But, they had to show them to me.</span> <span id="s991">Or ten, as I called them then, nits.</span> <span id="s992">Like little eggs.</span> <span id="s993">So, this is, there I worked, I had to help with peeling potatoes, I would steal some potato skins, you know, and I didn't know they had become a delicacy someplace, it was just, you know, sneak some away to eat, and I had to help with the younger kids.</span> <span id="s994">We bathed like in a tub they would fill with water.</span> <span id="s995">But like, we would stand in line and we'd each go in and wash and then step out and the next kid got into that same water.</span> <span id="s996">And I had a problem, Charlotte was always very fussy, that's the middle one.</span> <span id="s997">And I remember she didn't want to go in, and she got punished, so I forced her to go in because I didn't want her to get punished.</span> <span id="s998">And then, there were rats there.</span> <span id="s999">So, this was a very, it wasn't a great place.</span> <span id="s1000">I did go back because there was one nun, an older nun, who was trying to be as good to us as she could.</span> <span id="s1001">But, see, they had problems, too.</span> <span id="s1002">They couldn't get enough food.</span> <span id="s1003">I mean, war brings all kinds of problems, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: What about the other kids, I mean, did you make friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Okay, well, in that, see, there were mixed groups there.</span> <span id="s1006">There were Christians and Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1007">And it was an orphanage, but it was also an orphanage for difficult children.</span> <span id="s1008">So, there was a lot of punishing.</span> <span id="s1009">I remember a lot of punishing, a lot of kids who didn't behave, it wasn't a very, toilets were being, overflowing all the time, you had all that, you know, smelly water and, I remember there was a courtyard in the center of it and when I went back to see if my memory, I, everything I remembered, I went back to confirm that my memory served me well, and it did serve me better than I even had ever dreamed it would.</span> <span id="s1010">Not that I want to remember all of it.</span> <span id="s1011">There was a courtyard, there was an apple tree in that courtyard.</span> <span id="s1012">And I remember seeing the apples and I used to die for one.</span> <span id="s1013">So, we tried once in awhile to sneak in, but we had to climb a pretty big fence and it had these pointed posts, it was like a regular metal fence.</span> <span id="s1014">And we couldn't really, comfortably get over it.</span> <span id="s1015">One kid once got over and stole an apple and threw it over to us, but she couldn't get back over, so she was caught and we got punished.</span> <span id="s1016">It was difficult, but we were safe, that was the important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Now, were you distinguished as Jews?</span> <span id="s1018">Did anyone know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1020">We were not distinguished.</span> <span id="s1021">We were just all the kids.</span> <span id="s1022">Nobody said, you're Jewish, you're this.</span> <span id="s1023">No.</span> <span id="s1024">We were there, period.</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, whatever went on, went on for all the kids.</span> <span id="s1026">Not just for Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1027">Jewish or Christian.</span> <span id="s1028">I mean, we all, you know, suffered the same lot, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: But, the other kids didn't necessarily know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No.</span> <span id="s1031">No.</span> <span id="s1032">We had our false name, we were always, nobody told anybody.</span> <span id="s1033">As I said, I didn't even know that some nuns weren't really, weren't nuns, you know, until afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Did you have any fun there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No.</span> <span id="s1036">No.</span> <span id="s1037">The only thing is, Msr.</span> <span id="s1038">Rausonk(ph) came to see us once, and Father Bruno came.</span> <span id="s1039">That was the first time I had met Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1040">But, I didn't know he was Father Bruno then.</span> <span id="s1041">He wanted to know if we were being taken care of, are we being taken care of, are we okay, and I remember saying, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1042">He said do you have enough to eat?</span> <span id="s1043">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1044">I said yes to everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Anything else about this place?</span> <span id="s1046">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: There was a raid once, there were, I remember coming, it was shortly after that that we left, because I think there was a relationship between the, between that day and, there was something else, for the life of me, I can't recall it right now.</span> <span id="s1048">I just can't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: So, you really didn't, you didn't establish friendships, you took care of your sisters...</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Period.</span> <span id="s1051">Right.</span> <span id="s1052">As I say, we were with everybody, yet we were isolated.</span> <span id="s1053">If that makes any sense.</span> <span id="s1054">We didn't share.</span> <span id="s1055">You didn't confide.</span> <span id="s1056">You constantly were aware that you couldn't talk or tell anybody.</span> <span id="s1057">That was basically it.</span> <span id="s1058">You can't tell anybody who you are.</span> <span id="s1059">And make sure that your sisters never tell.</span> <span id="s1060">And that was another thing that kept me awake, is because I was always worried that maybe in their dream, if they woke up, they would accidentally give us away.</span> <span id="s1061">Well, with Betty I ran into some, I don't remember the exact time, but, I remember one time she said, I don't want to use this pretend name anymore.</span> <span id="s1062">Because we told her we were going to have a pretend name.</span> <span id="s1063">I don't want to use it, I want my name.</span> <span id="s1064">I said, well, you got your name, you got Betty.</span> <span id="s1065">No, I want my whole name.</span> <span id="s1066">And she says, I don't want to pretend anymore, I don't want to play pretend any more.</span> <span id="s1067">I says, well, if you don't play pretend, the boogie man's going to come and scratch your eyes out and tear your hair out and he's going to really hurt you, so you better keep playing pretend.</span> <span id="s1068">That was the only time that I recall that I ever had reprimand her for that.</span> <span id="s1069">The other things I ran into is mostly because she would get into trouble with adults.</span> <span id="s1070">Because if, she had a habit that if you got angry with her, remember I said she bit, she would bite, I guess it was her only defense, and she would always get punished.</span> <span id="s1071">So, I tried to prevent her from biting, so I sort of kept constantly watching her to make sure she behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: To your knowledge, were there any other Jewish children there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1074">I learned later on that there were several.</span> <span id="s1075">But, I don't know who they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Do you remember what you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Unless I look at Father Bruno's list.</span> <span id="s1078">You know, there were some names there, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking about or dreaming about at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No, I just kept worrying about my sisters.</span> <span id="s1083">That was it.</span> <span id="s1084">You see, you got to realize, I had a mandate.</span> <span id="s1085">Okay?</span> <span id="s1086">When I left, when we left to go into hiding, here was the mandate.</span> <span id="s1087">My mother said, make sure the kids don't betray themselves.</span> <span id="s1088">She never said, make sure you don't betray yourself.</span> <span id="s1089">Make sure the kids, which, of course, was inclusive, make sure the kids don't betray themselves.</span> <span id="s1090">Make sure they don't give themselves away.</span> <span id="s1091">Two, make sure they remember they're Jewish.</span> <span id="s1092">Three, if the Gestapo gets me and I don't come back after the war, find your father in America and take the children to him.</span> <span id="s1093">That was my mandate.</span> <span id="s1094">So, this is what I lived with.</span> <span id="s1095">In fact, I asked mom after the war, I said, you know, mamma, how could you put such a load on me?</span> <span id="s1096">I said, you know what it was like?</span> <span id="s1097">She says, Flora, did I have a choice?</span> <span id="s1098">She had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Did you worry about your mother, or miss her when you were away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1101">Very much.</span> <span id="s1102">I was very attached to her.</span> <span id="s1103">As a matter of fact, it was not until she died that I realized how much our psyche's were intertwined.</span> <span id="s1104">Because we lived through so much, in a way, together, even though we were separated at times.</span> <span id="s1105">That it was, let me put it this way, if that makes any sense, I felt responsible for my mother's happiness.</span> <span id="s1106">My mother ended up being the only survivor of her entire generation.</span> <span id="s1107">Of the, I'm talking family.</span> <span id="s1108">She, it was very difficult for her.</span> <span id="s1109">She had a, an ___________, which nobody else knew except me.</span> <span id="s1110">What she went through.</span> <span id="s1111">And, to her, to the day she died, I felt a tremendous responsibility of making her happy.</span> <span id="s1112">And in those days, making her happy, was to be good, to do what she asked, to make sure the children were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: So, when it was time to leave the orphanage, _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I came back to the secret apartment that we had and, by then, my uncle and my aunt were in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Actually, I just want to try to get a sense of the day...</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Okay, by the time we left there, was, it was either late July or early August, '43, by then.</span> <span id="s1117">Okay?</span> <span id="s1118">We went back to the apartment.</span> <span id="s1119">And, as I said, by then my mother's younger sister, her husband and the little one were already staying in our clandestine apartment.</span> <span id="s1120">By then, my mother had started sleeping in the factory.</span> <span id="s1121">Msr.</span> <span id="s1122">Rausonk's(ph) factory.</span> <span id="s1123">Actually, he was with the Resistance, also.</span> <span id="s1124">During the day they had to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1125">They make like little micro parts for, I don't know if it was for arms or what, but there was something that they produced, some kind of industrial object that the Germans needed.</span> <span id="s1126">But, at night, in the cellar, they worked for the Resistance.</span> <span id="s1127">They made, you know, secret arms and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1128">He was, besides hiding us, he had a couple of families that were hidden in attics of buildings that he owned.</span> <span id="s1129">One of the families was hidden upstairs in the building that housed, it was like across the street from the factory, that housed a cafeteria where his workers had their lunch.</span> <span id="s1130">And the people, during the day, could not make a sound because the workers downstairs, you know, came and ate at different hours and there were snacks during their breaks or whatever.</span> <span id="s1131">But then at night, once the factory was closed, they had the run of the house, the whole building.</span> <span id="s1132">So, he had a few families that he hid besides us.</span> <span id="s1133">Which is something I didn't know until after the war.</span> <span id="s1134">So, we stayed with my uncle there in the apartment and then, Father Bruno made the arrangements for us to be hidden in Werselater(ph).</span> <span id="s1135">Werselater(ph) was near Tielt(ph), which was not far from Bruesch(ph), which was like on the other side of the country.</span> <span id="s1136">Totally opposite side of where we had been til now.</span> <span id="s1137">Because Etebekke(ph) was right outside, was really part of Brussels, Etebekke(ph), Doel was north, but it was near the sea, this was closer going towards Holland, the Netherlands, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Now, did you meet Father Bruno at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: At that point, no.</span> <span id="s1140">At that point, the only time I had seen him was at, at ______________, of course, I didn't know that it was Father Bruno until later on.</span> <span id="s1141">I really became close to Father Bruno after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1142">That's when I really felt a relationship with Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1143">So, we were supposed to, the way we went to the last hiding place, and that was also, and my mother, again, begged my aunt to let the little one go, and she just couldn't bring herself to do it and by this time, the little one was already two years old.</span> <span id="s1144">So, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No, that's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: At this point, did you know much about what was going on with the war and the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: At this point I knew, because at this point already, people jumped trains and people who escaped, somehow managed to come back and tell and, it was like, there was like, an unofficial, there was a grapevine.</span> <span id="s1149">There was a grapevine.</span> <span id="s1150">People picked up and, the Resistance was a big conduit of that information, too.</span> <span id="s1151">Because there were Jews involved, too.</span> <span id="s1152">There were a lot of Jews who were with the Resistance in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1153">There was, in fact, there was a group called the Commite(ph) Defance(ph) De(ph) Schwif(ph), the Committee for the Defense of the Jews, which was a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s1154">As a matter of fact, I met one, the head of that group, Mrs. Strassberg(ph), just this spring in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1155">And they worked with the Resistance and with the group with Father Bruno and an attorney Vandenberg(ph).</span> <span id="s1156">As a matter of fact, Vandenberg(ph) was a Christian who died in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1157">He was arrested, not for hiding Jews, but for hiding people who hid because they didn't want to go for forced labor, because, you know, Christians also were taken for forced labor.</span> <span id="s1158">It wasn't just Jews.</span> <span id="s1159">So, he did die in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1160">You know, there were like a lot of, as I said, I just translated a book, I'm just about putting the polishing touches on it, on this network and these people who were helped.</span> <span id="s1161">It was an incredible operation.</span> <span id="s1162">So, but at that time, I wasn't aware of who was totally involved, except that the name, Father Bruno came up.</span> <span id="s1163">And not only that, until 1993, I didn't even know the name of the person who took us to the last hiding place.</span> <span id="s1164">Because here's what happened.</span> <span id="s1165">We were supposed to go to the railroad station and meet a woman dressed in a certain manner, no name given, nothing.</span> <span id="s1166">We were just supposed to kind of make eye contact with the woman and so, actually, mom did and her.</span> <span id="s1167">Although, and we had to stand apart from, our mom stood in one spot, we stood in another spot, the woman stood in another spot.</span> <span id="s1168">Although, we saw each other, and our instructions were that, when the train pulled in and this particular woman went into the train, that we were to follow her, sit down where she sat down, but not to address her.</span> <span id="s1169">But, you know, when I think about it, as I'm saying, it's amazing that we were able to carry all this out.</span> <span id="s1170">And we did.</span> <span id="s1171">We did.</span> <span id="s1172">We did exactly as we were told.</span> <span id="s1173">At that time, and when I think back, one of the hardest things that I personally ever did, and I talked to my sisters, and for them, too, was not to say goodbye to my mother.</span> <span id="s1174">Not to hug her.</span> <span id="s1175">You know, you go off on a train, still, we were still kids, by then, when we left the apartment it was early September, '43, by then, I was 13, Charlotte was 10 and Betty was seven.</span> <span id="s1176">So, we, and also, I said, rumors had started coming back because one of the people that had jumped a train, as a matter of fact, was a friend of mom's, who was one of the refugees in 1938 who had stayed in our apartment.</span> <span id="s1177">Because there was a Mr. and Mrs. Gross(ph) who had stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1178">And Mr. Gross(ph) had jumped a train.</span> <span id="s1179">And found mom, because he knew her, because, you know, through the grapevine, you kind of let each other know where you are.</span> <span id="s1180">And, he had given information.</span> <span id="s1181">Then, there was another person who had jumped a train and had come, that we knew.</span> <span id="s1182">And, there was no, not only was there no room, space, but also being the Gestapo was, I guess, must have been searching for him, mom hid him.</span> <span id="s1183">See, she had these false papers, so she was able to move around.</span> <span id="s1184">She hid him in a bombed out building.</span> <span id="s1185">Gave him blankets, whatever we had and everything.</span> <span id="s1186">And she took food to him.</span> <span id="s1187">And then one day, he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1188">Because he, he was pretty badly wounded, he could barely, he had great difficulty walking at that point, because from the jumping, that, I don't know what happened to him to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: We're almost out of tape, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: ...just sum up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Well, no, I think, let's stop the tape so you can start on a new tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">End of tape two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Tape three</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: No matter what the circumstances are, there's a natural way of parting from a parent.</span> <span id="s1195">You give them a hug, you kiss them, you say goodbye, you look back at them.</span> <span id="s1196">We weren't allowed to do any of those things.</span> <span id="s1197">We just literally had to ignore her and pretend that she was a stranger.</span> <span id="s1198">And I remember it being very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1199">It went totally against my being because we were a touching family.</span> <span id="s1200">We always hugged, we touched and here we couldn't even, not only not touch her, we couldn't even look at her and say goodbye.</span> <span id="s1201">Or even from the train, wave goodbye.</span> <span id="s1202">Or anything.</span> <span id="s1203">And we didn't.</span> <span id="s1204">We didn't.</span> <span id="s1205">We went into the train, we followed the lady who, as I said, in 1993 I learned her name, it was Mrs. Vandervagen(ph).</span> <span id="s1206">And she was a Christian woman, poor woman, who did this.</span> <span id="s1207">And the only thing she asked for in return was reimbursement for a little lunch that she bought.</span> <span id="s1208">Unfortunately, I didn't find her alive, so I could thank her personally.</span> <span id="s1209">She, when the train stopped, which I know now to be Werselater(ph), we followed her out of the train and, not until we were quite a bit of a distance from the train station, did she stop, turn around, sort of spread her arms out around us, say, I'm taking you to a safe place.</span> <span id="s1210">And she took us to the convent of Werselater(ph).</span> <span id="s1211">Werselater(ph) was a boarding school, it also had an orchard, it had a farm.</span> <span id="s1212">During the war, however, in addition to the regular boarding school, they added one of the wings of the, they took one of the wings of the convent rather, and turned it into a Fresh Air camp for poor children, children whose fathers were prisoners of war, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1213">And every three months a new group of children came.</span> <span id="s1214">They left, they never came back.</span> <span id="s1215">They had no visitors during the three months that they were there.</span> <span id="s1216">In the boarding school, the children had visitors every weekend.</span> <span id="s1217">They went home for holidays, they came back.</span> <span id="s1218">Even the physical facilities were very different.</span> <span id="s1219">In the boarding school, the children's dormitory was divided up into little cubbyholes, each child had sort of an alcove, a bed, a nightstand, small closet for their clothing, and a curtain so they could have a little privacy.</span> <span id="s1220">Their dining room had small tables, tablecloth, flowers, and it was a beautiful room with large windows and everything else.</span> <span id="s1221">Being the other set-up was a temporary set-up, the dormitory was a large room and metal beds, one next to the other.</span> <span id="s1222">Just divided by a little nightstand.</span> <span id="s1223">And in the dining room were long tables, set up where children sat one next to the other.</span> <span id="s1224">There was, to me, that was a very important distinction.</span> <span id="s1225">In addition to that, in the colony, as it was called, there was one teacher for all the grades, and she did, basically what she did was babysit and not really teach much.</span> <span id="s1226">She disciplined.</span> <span id="s1227">She was not a nun, she was a secular teacher who had been brought in.</span> <span id="s1228">And the older children helped with darning socks.</span> <span id="s1229">I learned how to do beautiful darning work.</span> <span id="s1230">I can still darn nicely to this day.</span> <span id="s1231">And, we helped kind of watch the little ones and all that and being I was one of the older ones, by then I was in charge, in addition to being in charge.</span> <span id="s1232">I wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s1233">I wanted to go to the boarding school and I remember asking the Mother Superior, why can't I go to the boarding school?</span> <span id="s1234">And she said, for security reasons.</span> <span id="s1235">She said, here there are no visitors, no one is asking questions as to why I don't go to communion.</span> <span id="s1236">The children leave, they never come back.</span> <span id="s1237">In the boarding school she felt that, at some point, somebody would ask questions.</span> <span id="s1238">So, she says, unless, if you had been baptized, she says, I could let you go to the boarding school.</span> <span id="s1239">That was the only, if you could call it mention, of my, perhaps, becoming baptized.</span> <span id="s1240">Otherwise, outside of that, never was there any pressure or anything.</span> <span id="s1241">The other girl that was there, there were two girls, actually, we were five, to the best of my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1242">One of them did not stay too long.</span> <span id="s1243">She did an awful lot of crying.</span> <span id="s1244">She, one day, just vanished.</span> <span id="s1245">And my assumption was, that, because she couldn't control her emotions, they couldn't afford to keep her.</span> <span id="s1246">Because the one thing, and not only from my own experiences, but from speaking to other children who have been hidden, you had to be, quote, a good child.</span> <span id="s1247">And when I say good, as I said, you had to be able to obey, you had to be able to be quiet when you were told to be quiet.</span> <span id="s1248">You had to not cry.</span> <span id="s1249">In other words, you had to almost be invisible.</span> <span id="s1250">To be kept.</span> <span id="s1251">So, and the other girl that was there, eventually, was baptized and went to, the one was sent away, the other one was baptized and went to the boarding school.</span> <span id="s1252">As a matter of fact, I did meet her again here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1253">She's Jewish today.</span> <span id="s1254">She felt that there was pressure put on her to be baptized.</span> <span id="s1255">My experience, having been in the same place, was that there was no pressure put on us.</span> <span id="s1256">Never did anyone, any of the nuns, say to me, you have to be baptized, I heard them say, or you'll go to hell, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1257">Never.</span> <span id="s1258">We did learn catechism, we had to everything the other children did, short of going to communion.</span> <span id="s1259">We went to church, prayed and studied catechism.</span> <span id="s1260">That, she did teach us, that teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Did the other children know you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: No.</span> <span id="s1263">Nobody knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1264">The, as a matter of fact, when, at the end, they were packing to go home, they said, so I guess, we're all going home today.</span> <span id="s1265">I said, yes, we're all going home today.</span> <span id="s1266">Except, that they went home and we stayed.</span> <span id="s1267">Eventually, we were there for 13 months.</span> <span id="s1268">When Belgium was liberated, we stayed awhile, back, later.</span> <span id="s1269">In April of 1944, my, one day, mom, I'm going to go back to Brussels on this.</span> <span id="s1270">But, of course, this I don't know from personal experience.</span> <span id="s1271">I only know this through mom.</span> <span id="s1272">Mom, as I said, was sleeping the ___________ factory, and taking food to my aunt and uncle that he had brought into the factory.</span> <span id="s1273">She came one evening with the food and there was a Gestapo seal on the door.</span> <span id="s1274">Now, what is a Gestapo seal?</span> <span id="s1275">Whenever the Gestapo would empty a residence of the inhabitants and take them away to concentration camps, they would seal the door with a seal, a Gestapo seal, which was easily removable, we're not talking about anything that, it was a sort of a cardboard, paper kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1276">Like a sticker.</span> <span id="s1277">Which meant no trespassing.</span> <span id="s1278">A few days later they would come back with a truck and empty the contents of the residence.</span> <span id="s1279">From us, they didn't get that much.</span> <span id="s1280">Because, don't forget, this was already late, you know, when we ran and everything, so, basically, the few things that we assembled weren't of any great value.</span> <span id="s1281">But in many residences, they did get great value.</span> <span id="s1282">They'd come back and they'd empty the place.</span> <span id="s1283">And it was called mublakseum(ph).</span> <span id="s1284">And what they did is they took the possessions back to Germany or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1285">And, as I said, I know people are still claiming artwork that they took.</span> <span id="s1286">She came, there was a Gestapo seal, she knew immediately what had happened.</span> <span id="s1287">But, she was, she had enough sofwau(ph), as they say, I don't know, how do you say, I mean, she was cool enough, calm enough, because she was, she had an incredible strength.</span> <span id="s1288">Opened the seal, went into the apartment, took the albums out, she had this obsession, the albums.</span> <span id="s1289">And it was after that that the albums went to a Christian family.</span> <span id="s1290">And she took a cover for herself, so she could be a little warmer.</span> <span id="s1291">And that's it.</span> <span id="s1292">And took off.</span> <span id="s1293">I mean, if they had caught her, I don't even think they would have taken her to a concentration camp, they would have probably killed her immediately.</span> <span id="s1294">I get a letter, now here's the thing, when we were hidden, and this held true for other children, also.</span> <span id="s1295">We were receiving mail.</span> <span id="s1296">Not by official post, but by couriers.</span> <span id="s1297">And I would, I got mail, it wasn't a weekly thing or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1298">But, I did get mail from mom and I was able to respond.</span> <span id="s1299">Mother Superior calls me into her office, I didn't know that my aunt and uncle were taken, and the baby, of course.</span> <span id="s1300">Mother Superior calls me into her office one day, and says to me, Flora, read this letter from mamma.</span> <span id="s1301">And I read the letter and she says, what's your mother saying?</span> <span id="s1302">I said, I think my mother is saying that my aunt and uncle and Nunu(ph), we used to call my cousin that, were taken by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1303">She says, exactly what I think.</span> <span id="s1304">Cause see, my aunt, my mother wrote in code.</span> <span id="s1305">She said, dearest Flora, your aunt and uncle and your little cousin went away on vacation to visit the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1306">I don't know when they'll be back and I don't, something to the effect, I don't know what to do in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1307">So, she, the Mother Superior picked up on that and I immediately knew what it meant, because nobody went on vacation, you know, if you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1308">You know, but then, see, by that point in the war, I already knew, there were enough rumors coming back, that we kind of knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s1309">We didn't know about gas chambers, we just knew people were being deported and somewhere they were being killed, they vanished, that's what we knew.</span> <span id="s1310">She told me to send my mom a letter.</span> <span id="s1311">Dear mamma, why don't you come visit us while Aunt Leah(ph) and Uncle Alex(ph) are on vacation?</span> <span id="s1312">And my mother came.</span> <span id="s1313">She, by then, even with false papers, it was getting dangerous.</span> <span id="s1314">So, what she did is, she walked the railroad track at night, slept under bushes during the day, and when she ran out of food that she had, she took from the fields.</span> <span id="s1315">It's a very fertile country, there are always things growing.</span> <span id="s1316">And, she came, by this, by that time already, of course, it was May of '44.</span> <span id="s1317">And she stayed in the convent.</span> <span id="s1318">We couldn't, Mother Superior gave her a room, a small room, under the staircase, I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s1319">She helped out in the orchard, by her own free will because she didn't want to eat for nothing.</span> <span id="s1320">And, once a week, we were allowed to see her.</span> <span id="s1321">Outside of that once a week when the Mother Superior would come and take us for a half hour visit, we were not allowed to see her.</span> <span id="s1322">If we did see her somewheres in the courtyard or in one of the hallways, we had to pretend we didn't know her.</span> <span id="s1323">It was not that easy, the other girl knew it was my mother, but, the day of her birthday, her birthday was, this was at the end of June, her birthday was in June, June 29th to be precise.</span> <span id="s1324">We were allowed to see her on her birthday.</span> <span id="s1325">And the Mother Superior, the first cherries had just been coming out, they were very early, but these were very early cherries, unless she got them somewhere else that I don't know about.</span> <span id="s1326">There was a box of cherries, a metal box of cherries that she gave mom for her birthday.</span> <span id="s1327">And then there was an envelope with some money.</span> <span id="s1328">And I remember mom protesting about the money.</span> <span id="s1329">And she said, this might have been past her birthday, this was on one of the visits to her room, with the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s1330">It could have even been later, because I distinctly remember it being cherries.</span> <span id="s1331">Because mom loved cherries.</span> <span id="s1332">And she, mom said, you're hiding me, you're hiding my children, you're feeding me, why are you giving me money?</span> <span id="s1333">She says, hopefully, the war will be over soon, you'll need it.</span> <span id="s1334">And she insisted.</span> <span id="s1335">I think it was something like two hundred fifty or three hundred franks in there, which wasn't much, but, it was just, even symbolically, it was just a beautiful gesture.</span> <span id="s1336">And, mom had to endure quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1337">There were a couple of people, adults, who were also residing in the convent.</span> <span id="s1338">And there was one couple who was living there, an elderly couple, and, this woman, the woman kept saying to mom, gee, it's so good, it's great to get rid of all these Jews, and mom had to endure this.</span> <span id="s1339">And couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1340">And one of the first, and all kinds of remarks and everything, and one of the first things my mom did after the liberation, was go over to her, she says, what do you think of me?</span> <span id="s1341">She says, oh, but, you're such a wonderful lady, Mrs. Fiers, I always enjoyed talking to you and everything, you know, you're great.</span> <span id="s1342">Mom says, you know something?</span> <span id="s1343">I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s1344">Well, the woman's face dropped, needless to say, because all these things that she said about the Jews and how wonderful it is to finally get rid of them, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1345">Anyway, after liberation, the Mother Superior suggested that the two little ones stay in the convent and that just mom and I went back, go back to Brussels to see what we can do to get settled again.</span> <span id="s1346">So, she and I went back.</span> <span id="s1347">It was, you know, even that time was chaotic because we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1348">And, I'll never forget the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s1349">And the first tank rolled past, and everybody ran out of the cellars and everything, they were standing and they were waving and all that.</span> <span id="s1350">I remember soldiers sitting on the tank.</span> <span id="s1351">By the way, we were liberated, interestingly enough, by a Polish unit.</span> <span id="s1352">And everybody said, no, there were no Polish units in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1353">I was there this past spring, for the umpteenth time, I wanted to verify that, and I asked.</span> <span id="s1354">I said, everybody says that we couldn't have been liberated by a Polish unit, yet I remember that.</span> <span id="s1355">The nun said, yes, you are right.</span> <span id="s1356">We were liberated by Polish units.</span> <span id="s1357">These were Poles in exile who were supposed to go into Holland, but there was a problem for some reason, that they, and this was disputes between the liberating forces that, instead of going into Holland, there was a change made and they came into Belgium to liberate.</span> <span id="s1358">See, politics play, always play into it.</span> <span id="s1359">So, it was a Polish unit.</span> <span id="s1360">Anyway, the tank goes by, we're waving to the soldier, when he gets up to the church, which was at the end of the street, which had a white flag hanging out, from the tower, because some Germans were holding up in there.</span> <span id="s1361">Something got thrown out of the tower, there was an explosion, the tank swiveled around, the other tank slowed down, came back, the same soldier that we were just waving to, was laying on the tank, all bloody.</span> <span id="s1362">I'll never, never forget that sight.</span> <span id="s1363">It would put such a damper, people say, oh, liberation, it was great, you know.</span> <span id="s1364">It was, and, and then fighting still broke out, even when we got back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1365">That when first, the V2's started coming.</span> <span id="s1366">They were the unmanned rockets that Germany was sending out.</span> <span id="s1367">That was when the Battle of the Bulge was started taking place.</span> <span id="s1368">I mean, it just as everybody thought things, this is it, finished.</span> <span id="s1369">It wasn't.</span> <span id="s1370">So, the little ones were in the convent and mom...</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: This was in September, October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: This was beginning October.</span> <span id="s1373">Middle October.</span> <span id="s1374">And I went back, we found a place to live and I went back to get the little ones.</span> <span id="s1375">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Any, I'm just wondering, is there anything else you can tell me about this last convent?</span> <span id="s1377">You were there for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1378">In terms of your daily life or the way you had to live or the way you had to kind of adjust yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1380">Alright, well, discipline was strict.</span> <span id="s1381">That time was starting to be lengthy.</span> <span id="s1382">There started to be this feeling, when will this be over?</span> <span id="s1383">It was starting to be lengthy.</span> <span id="s1384">But, it was, almost had adjusted to this way of life.</span> <span id="s1385">I had a small personal problem, because the other girl who was baptized, was transferred to the boarding school.</span> <span id="s1386">And, I'll never forget, I met her once in the garden.</span> <span id="s1387">So, of course, we didn't really interact that much any more, I met her once in the garden.</span> <span id="s1388">And she kneeled down and crossed herself in front of a statue.</span> <span id="s1389">I said, Renee(ph), you don't have to do that now, there's nobody here to see you.</span> <span id="s1390">You know, we had never said, I'm Jewish, you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s1391">We just knew.</span> <span id="s1392">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1393">Not with everybody, we just knew.</span> <span id="s1394">And she says, she threatened she was going to tell the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s1395">But the Mother Superior knew that I had, that I could not accept, I did ask questions.</span> <span id="s1396">And I was tempted.</span> <span id="s1397">There was something very beautiful about the church, the chapel, the mass.</span> <span id="s1398">And, I started feeling very secure.</span> <span id="s1399">So, there was a temptation of becoming Christian, but it was, but there was always my mother's words behind me, you know, don't forget, make sure the children remain Jewish.</span> <span id="s1400">Don't forget.</span> <span id="s1401">So, that held true for me, too.</span> <span id="s1402">But, we did have one problem.</span> <span id="s1403">I mean, it wasn't one problem, there were several.</span> <span id="s1404">Once in awhile, there were checks.</span> <span id="s1405">The door would ring, men in uniform, they came looking.</span> <span id="s1406">They came looking for political dissidents, they came looking for German soldiers who had gone AWOL, which, at that point of the war, there was a lot of it.</span> <span id="s1407">A lot of German soldiers were leaving their units.</span> <span id="s1408">And, they were also looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s1409">And, I remember one specific incident, it was several times where we sort of had to run and hide.</span> <span id="s1410">But, one specific one I remember, because I remember being very, very frightened.</span> <span id="s1411">The doorbell rang, there were sort of, there was a sort of plan, that was set into motion immediately, as soon as someone in uniform would come to the front door.</span> <span id="s1412">There was a chain of command, so speak.</span> <span id="s1413">Anyway, we knew exactly where to go, a nun came with us.</span> <span id="s1414">And we ran into, remember I told you it was a farm, and they had potatoes.</span> <span id="s1415">Of course, they had to share it with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1416">They were raised, you know, quotas that they had to take.</span> <span id="s1417">We ran down to the cellar and the nun and the three of us ran behind a big pile of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1418">I mean, I talk, you know, a big pile.</span> <span id="s1419">So, we ran behind it, we sat down and we stayed put, quietly.</span> <span id="s1420">All of a sudden, the door to the cellar, I didn't see it, I heard it, open up, I hear footsteps coming down, several people, and I remember hearing in German, ________________?</span> <span id="s1421">Rouse(ph)!</span> <span id="s1422">Rouse(ph)!</span> <span id="s1423">__________________?</span> <span id="s1424">Rouse(ph)!</span> <span id="s1425">And we're sitting there, I remember shaking, I remember getting so cold.</span> <span id="s1426">And I held my little, the little one, and the nun kind of had her arm around Charlotte.</span> <span id="s1427">And, we were sitting there, not moving.</span> <span id="s1428">And then we, every once in awhile the command would, we knew they were there because we hadn't heard the door close.</span> <span id="s1429">And it would be quiet for a minute, and then, we heard potatoes rolling.</span> <span id="s1430">So, I felt like, somebody was disturbing the potato pile behind which we were sitting.</span> <span id="s1431">We heard potatoes rolling and I hear someone say, ___________________, or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s1432">And then they left.</span> <span id="s1433">And we just stayed put for awhile yet.</span> <span id="s1434">We didn't dare come out.</span> <span id="s1435">And then, after a certain amount of time, we finally did come out.</span> <span id="s1436">We were safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Did you have any contact with the local population in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: There was, not exactly contact.</span> <span id="s1439">My sister, Charlotte, somehow befriended one of the kids that was coming to the convent, there was also, see the convent, it was a large convent.</span> <span id="s1440">Like a hundred and twenty nuns or something at the time.</span> <span id="s1441">Now, they've, they've dwindled down to a very few.</span> <span id="s1442">There were, the nuns also ran the public school.</span> <span id="s1443">And, I say the public school, I mean the village school.</span> <span id="s1444">So, you had the children that came for the three months, you had the boarding school, which were like the wealthy kids, and then you had the regular school.</span> <span id="s1445">The kids that came every day and then went home every night.</span> <span id="s1446">Charlotte, somehow, had met one of the little girls and became friendly with one of them.</span> <span id="s1447">And I remember being very nervous about that.</span> <span id="s1448">And once or twice, she would go to that child's house.</span> <span id="s1449">And when the nuns learned about it, they stopped it.</span> <span id="s1450">It was the custer(ph), the custer is, you know, like the man that takes care of the church, not, who kind of keeps it clean and orderly and all that, I don't know the word in English.</span> <span id="s1451">But, outside of that, we didn't really have any contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s1452">I did, occasionally, sneak out of the building.</span> <span id="s1453">And, I snuck out because I just needed, even though there was a courtyard, and I was able to get fresh air within, once in awhile, I just felt like I needed to get out.</span> <span id="s1454">And, I remember, I snuck out, and I'd go into the fields.</span> <span id="s1455">And the wheat was growing high, and I would just go in and kind of sit down by myself and just, just sit.</span> <span id="s1456">Literally, just sit and look up at the sky for little periods of time, and then sneak back into the convent.</span> <span id="s1457">And it was forbidden, I wasn't allowed, for obvious reasons.</span> <span id="s1458">The other thing I did one day, they had a little room in the courtyard, where every, where a nun died, or someone, she would be laid out in that little, like a little, tiny thing, two by four, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1459">They, until burial time.</span> <span id="s1460">And, I remember, being very curious as to what happened to her in that little room, and I one day I snuck in there and I kind of felt her toes, and she didn't move [laughter].</span> <span id="s1461">I mean, little things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1462">And, that's where, also, I, well, never mind, this isn't important.</span> <span id="s1463">___________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: So, you and your mother returned to Brussels...</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: You came back to retrieve your sisters.</span> <span id="s1467">What was, and this is October, '44, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: '44, late October, '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: What was going on in Brussels?</span> <span id="s1470">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1472">Things were still chaotic in Brussels, at that time.</span> <span id="s1473">You had British troops, you had American troops.</span> <span id="s1474">People, at that point, there were no refugees coming back, yet, but you still had to keep running down into shelters because, as I said, the V2's were flying over.</span> <span id="s1475">See, the war didn't end til '45.</span> <span id="s1476">So, there was a lot of, there was bombings, there was shootings, there were all kinds of things still happening.</span> <span id="s1477">Food was hard to come by, but the Jewish organization was already setting into place, and was the joint, as you say, Jewish immigrant, Hebrew immigrant society.</span> <span id="s1478">And they started to help Jews who were returning either from hiding places and then later on, of course, those who were coming back from the camps.</span> <span id="s1479">And, we also, one day mom was on a trolley car and a British soldier walked over to her, I guess there must have been something about her, and he said to her, Yiddish?</span> <span id="s1480">And she says, yeah.</span> <span id="s1481">And, so he was like so excited that he saw a live Jew.</span> <span id="s1482">Came and brought her some food and all.</span> <span id="s1483">Eventually, and then, of course, Father Bruno, mom, now, I don't know how Father Bruno knew where we were living.</span> <span id="s1484">I think, probably, through the Mother Superior, somehow the contact was made, mamma, Father Bruno came to the house.</span> <span id="s1485">You know, there are questions that, even though mom and I talked a lot, there are some questions that somehow never came up.</span> <span id="s1486">Because I, myself, didn't talk about this until about 1980.</span> <span id="s1487">I did go back to visit and everything, but I didn't talk.</span> <span id="s1488">I did not consider myself a survivor.</span> <span id="s1489">Because I had not been in a camp.</span> <span id="s1490">So, I deferred to, to me, survivors were those who survived the camps.</span> <span id="s1491">And, not until 1980, when in, it was either '80 or '81, I was teaching at Einstein High School in Kensington, and a Social Studies teacher and I were in the office, and he pulled out a pamphlet, something from his mailbox, and, as we were walking down the hallway, my eye fell on that pamphlet, and I say, let me take a look at that.</span> <span id="s1492">It was one of the first pamphlets that I had seen by, we call them the _____________, revisionists, Alfred Butz(ph), out of Northwestern, when he had written a book, the hundred and twenty questions about the Holocaust that have never been answered, the Hoax of the Twentieth Century.</span> <span id="s1493">Well, there was this anger that came up.</span> <span id="s1494">And, I say, sure, it never happened.</span> <span id="s1495">So, where is everybody?</span> <span id="s1496">And that same day, I put a note in every teacher's mailbox in my school, identifying myself as a survivor for the first time.</span> <span id="s1497">And saying I'd be glad to come talk to their students.</span> <span id="s1498">And then later on, one of the teachers to whose class I had spoken to, and who had done, then, a little unit on the Holocaust, had a swastika painted on her door.</span> <span id="s1499">So, she and I and a Social Studies teacher from Richard Montgomery, got together and decided, because they were both Social Studies.</span> <span id="s1500">I taught foreign language, I taught French and some German at the time.</span> <span id="s1501">So, their frustration was that, at that time, there was nothing on the Holocaust that you could use to teach in the textbooks.</span> <span id="s1502">There were maybe two lines.</span> <span id="s1503">So, they were frustrated and I was.</span> <span id="s1504">So, the three of us got together and we created a course.</span> <span id="s1505">We've been teaching for 11 years, the teachers.</span> <span id="s1506">We do teacher training.</span> <span id="s1507">So, that came out of this anger.</span> <span id="s1508">So, that's when, for the first time, I identified myself as a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Let's just go back to right after the war in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1511">Father Bruno came to visit.</span> <span id="s1512">I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1513">Mom and me had to try to find some work.</span> <span id="s1514">I had to go to work, I found some work, we again did some sewing in the house, with mamma.</span> <span id="s1515">Also, I found a job filling boxes with soap powder.</span> <span id="s1516">And, being the youngest, had to scrub the stairs in the building, and I worked, I came home.</span> <span id="s1517">Then mom felt that, if I could work with my hands, I could earn my bread anywheres in the world.</span> <span id="s1518">So, she, there was a dressmaker in the building we lived in.</span> <span id="s1519">So, she asked her to take me on as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s1520">She did.</span> <span id="s1521">And then I went and took some evening courses, learning how to make patterns, clothing patterns.</span> <span id="s1522">To design them, cut and all that.</span> <span id="s1523">________________, waste paper to make them this big, you can't do anything with them.</span> <span id="s1524">But, anyway, it was around that time that Father Bruno came to visit.</span> <span id="s1525">And he was also honored, I went to a Hannuka(ph) party where he was honored.</span> <span id="s1526">Just before he left, because he eventually went to Rome and to Paris.</span> <span id="s1527">He worked in Paris in the red light district, with prostitutes, to bring them back to the faith.</span> <span id="s1528">But, anyway, he came to visit, he brought food.</span> <span id="s1529">I went back to the convent several times.</span> <span id="s1530">The Mother Superior gave me food to take back to Brussels for us.</span> <span id="s1531">Because, remember I told you, they were a farm.</span> <span id="s1532">And Father Bruno, at that time, when he visited, said to me, so, what are you doing, Little Flora?</span> <span id="s1533">And I told him that I'm working, learning with the dressmaker and all.</span> <span id="s1534">He said, wouldn't you rather go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">I said, yeah, but I have to help mamma feed the kids.</span> <span id="s1536">So, he said, I'll talk to mamma.</span> <span id="s1537">So, I hear them arguing in the other room, the apartment was so tiny, you couldn't help hearing one another.</span> <span id="s1538">And, I hear mamma saying, look, Father Bruno, you've saved their lives, that's enough, I'm taking over now.</span> <span id="s1539">I'll handle it.</span> <span id="s1540">We'll be fine.</span> <span id="s1541">But, he did convince her, and he enrolled me in a catholic school on the _________________, in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1542">I went back there this spring, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1543">But, I didn't know at the time, but I just learned now, is that his sister, the school belongs to the same order where his sister is a nun.</span> <span id="s1544">And she's still alive.</span> <span id="s1545">I saw her this spring.</span> <span id="s1546">I visited her.</span> <span id="s1547">I visited Father Bruno's brother, he has two siblings that are still alive.</span> <span id="s1548">And, he sent me to school.</span> <span id="s1549">I learned how to type.</span> <span id="s1550">Then I finally took, after I finished the pattern course, I went at night and learned how to do bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1551">I was always trying to juggle and learn and things like that.</span> <span id="s1552">But, anyway, not only did I learn how to type, that was extracurricular, he had one of the nuns give me piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1553">I didn't have a piano, because he knew I loved music, but I didn't have a piano, so the convent, the school was on one side of the street, it's still there, but it's a different, they do something different, it's not exactly the same type of school.</span> <span id="s1554">Then, it was a regular, you know, you know, school.</span> <span id="s1555">The convent on one side, school on the other side.</span> <span id="s1556">And, in the morning before classes, they would leave the convent door open and the parlor door open, and I would go in and practice on their piano.</span> <span id="s1557">Then I would go across the street and go to classes.</span> <span id="s1558">And then, of course, after school, immediately after school, there was typing and drawing lessons, which were extracurricular.</span> <span id="s1559">And I loved it, just absolutely loved it.</span> <span id="s1560">There was a slight problem, though.</span> <span id="s1561">Because, you see, we came from the Flemish part of the country, I had been at Etervig(ph), but I didn't exactly learn how to read and write in French.</span> <span id="s1562">I learned how to speak French.</span> <span id="s1563">And I didn't speak French until, learn French until we came, after we were in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1564">So, that was another thing we dealt with.</span> <span id="s1565">Then we went back, Werselater(ph) was in the Flemish part of the country.</span> <span id="s1566">So, then, by the time I came back to Brussels, most of the French was gone again, except for speaking a little bit.</span> <span id="s1567">So, I really had to learn how to read and write French.</span> <span id="s1568">So, at first, I just sat in class and then, slowly, anyway, to make a long story short, he did visit a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1569">And then, of course, he left.</span> <span id="s1570">And then I didn't see him again.</span> <span id="s1571">But I corresponded with him.</span> <span id="s1572">And, I did visit him a few times before he left Belgium.</span> <span id="s1573">I visited him a few times where he lived.</span> <span id="s1574">He was sort of like a surrogate father.</span> <span id="s1575">There was something, how can I explain, very, very special about the man.</span> <span id="s1576">He had these twinkling eyes and, you know something, everybody who knew or met Father Bruno, people who had been hidden by him and everything, tell me, when I say he had these twinkly eyes, they say, that was exactly it, that was Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1577">I mean, it just, there was something about his face.</span> <span id="s1578">It was like goodness itself.</span> <span id="s1579">And I always asked him, you know, Father Bruno, you took such, you see, Father Bruno was betrayed.</span> <span id="s1580">Father Bruno had to get out of his habit and wear civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1581">And yet, he continued doing what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1582">He his over 300 children.</span> <span id="s1583">And, he and Father Andre(ph), another priest, they stole virgin identity cards, and they stole municipal stamps and filled them in with the children's false names.</span> <span id="s1584">And then he had to go and get ration stamps with that.</span> <span id="s1585">And he had a collaborator there.</span> <span id="s1586">I mean, it was amazing the things he did.</span> <span id="s1587">So, I went to school there and, eventually, I dropped out of the school because mamma felt that the schooling wouldn't really do much for me.</span> <span id="s1588">That I really needed to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s1589">So, I became, I really learned how to be a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s1590">And, then through a soldier, we, who helped us, he, a British soldier, he helped find my father.</span> <span id="s1591">And one day, it was Christmas morning, I didn't know it at the time, of course, you know?</span> <span id="s1592">The doorbell rang and I, mamma said, run open the door, and I went to open the door, and there was an American soldier at the door.</span> <span id="s1593">And he said, Mendelowitz(ph)?</span> <span id="s1594">I say, yes, oui.</span> <span id="s1595">And he says, Merry Christmas!</span> <span id="s1596">I didn't know what that meant.</span> <span id="s1597">I knew Noel at that point.</span> <span id="s1598">So, and he hands me a box.</span> <span id="s1599">And he leaves.</span> <span id="s1600">There was a letter taped to the top.</span> <span id="s1601">And, I'm standing there and all of a sudden I'm starting to yell out, mamma, mamma!</span> <span id="s1602">There was soldier here and he gave me a box.</span> <span id="s1603">And I run up with the box, because we lived on the second floor, and, nobody even looked at the letter, we opened the box.</span> <span id="s1604">A box.</span> <span id="s1605">It was filled with food.</span> <span id="s1606">Spam and everything else.</span> <span id="s1607">At that point, we ate everything.</span> <span id="s1608">Today I don't eat pork, but then, as long as we had food, who cared what we ate?</span> <span id="s1609">And, then when we were full, we ended up being sick for several days, we overate.</span> <span id="s1610">But that was another story.</span> <span id="s1611">And, we read the letter and it was a letter from the American Headquarters in Brussels asking mom to come by on a certain day, that day.</span> <span id="s1612">Her husband was an American veteran and, eventually, the Army brought us to the States.</span> <span id="s1613">In 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: When you were living in Brussels, after the war, were there other Jewish people who had come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1616">Okay.</span> <span id="s1617">People were coming back, started coming back from the camps after '45.</span> <span id="s1618">And, I cannot describe to you, what some of them looked like.</span> <span id="s1619">It, most of them didn't, couldn't talk about, you know, you'd ask, say, well, what happened?</span> <span id="s1620">They couldn't even tell you.</span> <span id="s1621">And, you waited, mamma waited for my aunt to come back.</span> <span id="s1622">And my uncle, and the baby and other members of the family.</span> <span id="s1623">And, they never came back.</span> <span id="s1624">And there were many who waited and they didn't come back.</span> <span id="s1625">Basically, it became a waiting game.</span> <span id="s1626">So, you know, simultaneously, while all this was going on that I was telling you about, at that same time what you did is, you waited.</span> <span id="s1627">And if some people came, came and they needed a place to stay, you had, at one point, we had several people, again, living with us.</span> <span id="s1628">We had several young girls who had managed to come back.</span> <span id="s1629">And, in fact, a couple of them did tell mamma some things.</span> <span id="s1630">And I asked mamma, because I'd overheard a work here and there, but not everything.</span> <span id="s1631">She'd say, not for you, Sweetheart, you're too young.</span> <span id="s1632">You're too young.</span> <span id="s1633">And, it was hard.</span> <span id="s1634">And many, there was one person I'm still looking for.</span> <span id="s1635">He was a little boy who we're indirectly related to through marriage, who was born in '39.</span> <span id="s1636">And, after liberation his family, his parents, his 17 year old brother, all of them were taken and they didn't come back.</span> <span id="s1637">And, the convent that he was in, because mom knew where he was, allowed us to take him home, like for the weekend.</span> <span id="s1638">So, I would bring him home, I remember him being full of sores and mamma got nauseous when she had to take care of him, so she made me take care of the sores.</span> <span id="s1639">I took care of his sores.</span> <span id="s1640">Then when we were trying to leave for the United States, we were trying to take him with us because his family, there was nobody.</span> <span id="s1641">But, the convent wouldn't release him to us because we weren't his, mamma wasn't his parent.</span> <span id="s1642">So, mamma got in touch with the Jewish community and then left him in their hands.</span> <span id="s1643">What happened was, in 1980, '83, there was a gathering in Washington and I met a woman and I told her the story.</span> <span id="s1644">So, she says, you know, there was a group of young children that were given to an orphanage, the Jewish orphanage, after liberation, and then, Pittsburgh, a whole group of kids were adopted sight unseen.</span> <span id="s1645">Maybe he was amongst them.</span> <span id="s1646">Sends me a photograph, I'll recognize him on the photograph.</span> <span id="s1647">I haven't found him yet.</span> <span id="s1648">See, I don't think he remembers his name or who he really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: How long after you were liberated, did you, did it take you to observe the Jewish religion again?</span> <span id="s1650">Was there any ambivalence about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1652">Mom, as soon as, picked right up again, tried to find candles, and we lit them, anything that she could find.</span> <span id="s1653">There was a piece of metal, so it shouldn't burn.</span> <span id="s1654">But, at the same time, simultaneously, declared there is no God.</span> <span id="s1655">And God does not exist, because if he had existed, he wouldn't do what he did.</span> <span id="s1656">Because she was also trying to find out about the rest of the family and all then.</span> <span id="s1657">Of course, nobody came back.</span> <span id="s1658">She died a religious woman.</span> <span id="s1659">Her faith came back to her, later, much later.</span> <span id="s1660">But, she always immediately started observing the rituals and always did.</span> <span id="s1661">So, she lived a very Jewish life while claiming and asking, where is God?</span> <span id="s1662">So, I think there was that ambivalence within her.</span> <span id="s1663">But, as I said, towards later years, her belief in God returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Anything else you can tell me about Father Bruno or how, or your sense of how much of an organization there was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1666">I did not even know how much of an organization there was until 1991.</span> <span id="s1667">Of the extent.</span> <span id="s1668">I didn't know until 1991 that there was anyone in the United States, outside of my two sisters, myself and these two people of which the one girl was in the convent, were saved by Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1669">It was in 1991, after a gathering of hidden children in New York, that I learned of others in the United States who were saved by Father Bruno and I learned that there was a book out that was assembled on Father Bruno and that Father Bruno's nephew, Michelle(ph) Rainers(ph), who helped him through the war, lived in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s1670">So, through all this I was in the dark, but I wrote to Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1671">In 1948 I received my last New Year's card from Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1672">As a matter of fact, it's in the book that I received it.</span> <span id="s1673">I just translated anonymously because they couldn't make out who had written this letter to Father Bruno and I'm reading it, when I started translating, but I said, My God, that's my letter!</span> <span id="s1674">And after that, I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s1675">In 1966, I went back to Belgium and I searched for Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1676">I had forgotten the address in Brussels that his family lived at, but I have been there since.</span> <span id="s1677">But, I remembered the apartment that he had taken, where I had visited him, and he wasn't there, nobody knew about him.</span> <span id="s1678">I knew his Abbey was in Leufair(ph).</span> <span id="s1679">I went to Leufair(ph) and I was told they didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s1680">But that part, of course, now I know where he was, they didn't tell me where.</span> <span id="s1681">And I was sort of lost.</span> <span id="s1682">And, how, you can't, you can only, my time was limited in Europe, I had to come back and go back to my job, and I never found him again, to my, so, I was not able to see him again.</span> <span id="s1683">And especially in his later years, I would have loved to have been able to go see him because he died, unfortunately, a very sad death, he had Parkinson's.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: At the time, you didn't have a sense that there were, that there was a network of people trying to hide children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: No.</span> <span id="s1686">I did not know that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Now, this Msr.</span> <span id="s1688">Rausonk(ph)...</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Now, Msr.</span> <span id="s1690">Rausonk(ph) I remained very close contact with.</span> <span id="s1691">We saw him when I went back to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: What, what motivated him?</span> <span id="s1693">How did...</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Msr.</span> <span id="s1695">Rausonk(ph), let me tell you something, I asked the same question of every person who was responsible in our rescue, and of anyone, I, who did any rescue work, even when at the premier of Shindler's List, I had the opportunity to speak to Mrs. Shindler because what happened is, I was sitting with her and talking and a lady walked over and said, will you still talk to me after the film?</span> <span id="s1696">And, I, Mrs. Shindler looked, I said, she didn't understand a word she was saying.</span> <span id="s1697">So, I said to her, if you tell me, I said to Mrs. Shindler, sprekensie(ph) kine(ph) English?</span> <span id="s1698">She said, neutsche(ph), spreke noi(ph) Deutsche and Spanish.</span> <span id="s1699">So, I don't really, I mean, I can survive in Spanish, but I don't really speak it, but in German I can manage.</span> <span id="s1700">So, I said to the lady, I said, who, if you'll tell me who you are, I'll be glad to interpret for you.</span> <span id="s1701">So, she says, I'm the actress who's playing Mrs. Shindler in the film.</span> <span id="s1702">That was before, there was a reception before the film.</span> <span id="s1703">And, so I interpreted and then I turned to Mrs. Shindler after she had left, I said, you know, Frau Shindler, tell me, if you, because, you know, they minimize her role, and it was much larger than the people know.</span> <span id="s1704">If you had to do today, if you were young today, and you had to do what you did, could you, would you, do it again?</span> <span id="s1705">She, I remember, she went like this, what else is there to do?</span> <span id="s1706">If one person can't help another, what's life all about?</span> <span id="s1707">Just like that, very simple.</span> <span id="s1708">I wanted to see what someone else said, because the answers I got were also simple.</span> <span id="s1709">Sister Adonia(ph), I remember, I asked her, and she said, Flora, what do you mean, why I did it?</span> <span id="s1710">For the love of God, they're innocent children.</span> <span id="s1711">Period.</span> <span id="s1712">No great heroism there, right?</span> <span id="s1713">Mother Superior, what else was one supposed to do?</span> <span id="s1714">Father Bruno, he said, Flora, why do you keep asking that question?</span> <span id="s1715">I only did what I should do.</span> <span id="s1716">Msr.</span> <span id="s1717">Rausonk(ph), you read the card.</span> <span id="s1718">He thanked me.</span> <span id="s1719">Instead of we thanked him, he couldn't understand why we're thanking him.</span> <span id="s1720">We thanked him, and when, he wrote me this card in 1967, after we had given him a gift of a watch from all three of us.</span> <span id="s1721">And, I receive a card from him saying, I'm overwhelmed with all this gratefulness you're showing me.</span> <span id="s1722">It is for me to thank you.</span> <span id="s1723">And he goes on and on and on.</span> <span id="s1724">And then I called him from the United States and I said, Msr.</span> <span id="s1725">Rausonk(ph), what kind of nonsense are you writing me in your card?</span> <span id="s1726">What is this business of you should thank us, you saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1727">He says, but you don't understand, Flora, you gave me a chance to find out what I was made of.</span> <span id="s1728">That's how simple it was.</span> <span id="s1729">For them.</span> <span id="s1730">It wasn't simple, but these are people who couldn't see another direction.</span> <span id="s1731">There was no hesitation, this is what was, there was a need, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Yeah, I mean, he, on one hand you have people who were very pious, here you have this rich industrialist who actually shepherded you to your hiding places.</span> <span id="s1733">He could have paid people to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No, he did it himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: He took the risks himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: And yet, from a Catholic point of view, he wasn't the most moral of people.</span> <span id="s1737">He had a mistress.</span> <span id="s1738">In fact, after the war, he was, he and his wife are both devout Catholics, and, you don't have to tape this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: The tape is rolling and I don't want to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Anyway, they were devout Catholics and so they never got divorced.</span> <span id="s1741">But, when he was older and ill, he went home and his wife cared for him until he died.</span> <span id="s1742">That had nothing to do, you know, with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: In all these experiences, did you ever have a sense that people were either frightened to or resistant to helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: In my personal experience, okay?</span> <span id="s1745">With the exception of Msr.</span> <span id="s1746">Rausonk(ph)'s wife, and now, who feared for herself and her children, there was an incident.</span> <span id="s1747">I don't know if I mentioned it already on the tape or not, whereby I was in Msr.</span> <span id="s1748">Rausonk(ph)'s home, and I was put to bed, and I heard Msr.</span> <span id="s1749">Rausonk(ph) and Madame Rausonk(ph) arguing in the next room.</span> <span id="s1750">And I heard her saying, _____________, you want to risk your life?</span> <span id="s1751">You can do whatever you want, but you don't have the right to risk my life and my children's lives for a couple of Jews.</span> <span id="s1752">And I remember jumping out of bed and running into the other room and saying, Msr.</span> <span id="s1753">Rausonk(ph), please I don't want you and Mrs. Rausonk(ph), and I was sobbing, to fight over me, please take me back to my mother, please take me back to my mother, I don't want you to fight with Mrs. Rausonk(ph) for me.</span> <span id="s1754">And he pointed his finger at me, and went, you, get back to bed!</span> <span id="s1755">This is none of your business!</span> <span id="s1756">The voice was so powerful, so authoritarian, I mean, I just ran, jumped back into bed, put the covers over me and just laid there shaking.</span> <span id="s1757">And never said another word.</span> <span id="s1758">But, that was the only time that I actually heard in words, someone say, and, you know, I'm a mother and I'm a grandmother, and I pray, and I always said to myself, God forbid, if there were ever a need, if someone knocked on my door and said, I'm being pursued, help me, that I would have the courage.</span> <span id="s1759">I would like to believe that I would have the courage to help, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1760">Until that moment of truth, so to speak, I don't think any of us really know.</span> <span id="s1761">But, had there been more of that, you would have had more people living.</span> <span id="s1762">Because, also, when people protested as a mass, the Nazi's backed off.</span> <span id="s1763">They were only able to carry through, I firmly believe what they did, is because people did not protest enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Let's just, for a few minutes, finish this circle.</span> <span id="s1765">Your father sent for you, or the American Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: The Army brought us to the United States.</span> <span id="s1767">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: And in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: 1946.</span> <span id="s1770">May 29th, we docked in New York, I'll never forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1772">I want you to tell me a little bit about your impressions upon arrival, who was there to meet you?</span> <span id="s1773">Also, it must have been fairly powerful, or maybe even strange, to see your father again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1775">We hadn't seen him for eight and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: So, why don't you tell me about your trip to the United States, your arrival here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Okay, when we arrived, we were met by two men.</span> <span id="s1778">At the Port of New York.</span> <span id="s1779">One was very tall, and one was, looked extremely small to me, much smaller than I had vaguely remembered, from what I had remembered, the little one was my father.</span> <span id="s1780">And I kept looking at him and saying, that's my father, that's my father, but I didn't feel that that was my father.</span> <span id="s1781">There wasn't any elation, I remember.</span> <span id="s1782">We were all so, don't forget, we were all so very tired from the journey.</span> <span id="s1783">And we, there wasn't a lull where there was sort of a period of time where we relaxed, were happy, all that.</span> <span id="s1784">Because there was a struggle and all that because we also had to go from Brussels all the way to Ovra(ph), and things weren't that comfortable either.</span> <span id="s1785">We got stuck in Paris, and there was a problem with me, I couldn't go onto my mother's passport.</span> <span id="s1786">And the Army was also, there was a question as to where could I be brought as a dependant, because I was past 14, somehow, at that time, for some reason, 14 was the cut-off date.</span> <span id="s1787">So, it was always, well, we'll let her go this far, and if they'll let her, pass her, fine, and it was all the way into New York, that it was, okay, she can go on the ship, I don't know if they'll let her off the ship.</span> <span id="s1788">Okay?</span> <span id="s1789">But, anyway, I looked at him and it was very strange.</span> <span id="s1790">We then came out in New York, New York was very dirty at that time, around the port was a lot of garbage and everything, I remember, we didn't think we liked it.</span> <span id="s1791">He hugged each one of us, but I don't remember feeling the sense of family.</span> <span id="s1792">And then, I remember being angry.</span> <span id="s1793">I was angry.</span> <span id="s1794">Because I felt that, well, I had sort of absorbed my mother's anger, I think, you know.</span> <span id="s1795">Then we came, we were a large, see, dad had nothing when we got here.</span> <span id="s1796">Because he was so sure that his wife and children were killed.</span> <span id="s1797">That he didn't really prepare.</span> <span id="s1798">I guess he had formed sort of, I guess you can call that a depression or something, but, like, well, who should I really work for, kind of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1799">So, we moved into a fourth floor apartment, no elevator, one toilet on the whole way for four apartments.</span> <span id="s1800">And, we had hot water, but our bathtub was our kitchen counter with a cover.</span> <span id="s1801">Take the cover off.</span> <span id="s1802">But, anyway, we settled in and, the children, the two children took to my dad pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s1803">Because they were still young and they were sent to school.</span> <span id="s1804">And I went to work.</span> <span id="s1805">I went to work in a sweatshop.</span> <span id="s1806">They called it a sweatshop, it was actually, you know, they make the blazers.</span> <span id="s1807">And at night, I went to a school called the Eron(ph) School.</span> <span id="s1808">For business.</span> <span id="s1809">I think it still exists, on 14th Street in New York.</span> <span id="s1810">And, I took English stenography.</span> <span id="s1811">I didn't really know English, but I took English stenography.</span> <span id="s1812">Because I figured, I knew by then French stenography, because that's another thing I had studied, I knew how to type.</span> <span id="s1813">I knew some bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1814">So I took English stenography.</span> <span id="s1815">And I tried to kind of adjust into life.</span> <span id="s1816">Mom went to work.</span> <span id="s1817">She went and presented herself as a furrier, they fired her two days later, she was no furrier.</span> <span id="s1818">Because she heard you could earn good money.</span> <span id="s1819">She learned something, she then got a job somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1820">She got fired a week later, she learned something.</span> <span id="s1821">Within six months, mom was a furrier.</span> <span id="s1822">She then learned she can join the union, and you can earn more money that way, so she went, they said, yes, but you gotta picket a certain amount of time.</span> <span id="s1823">Guess who got elected to picket?</span> <span id="s1824">Me.</span> <span id="s1825">I picketed.</span> <span id="s1826">She joined the union.</span> <span id="s1827">She started earning good money.</span> <span id="s1828">And, we children were very unhappy living where we were living.</span> <span id="s1829">Even with the war and everything else, there was just, also, we had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1830">It was, they were difficult times.</span> <span id="s1831">And, she says, kids, don't worry.</span> <span id="s1832">Because I wanted to go back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1833">I wanted, at that point, I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1834">And, she says, don't worry, I'll have you out of here.</span> <span id="s1835">You'll be out of here within two years.</span> <span id="s1836">Within two years, mom had learned enough English to learn that, and dad, of course, they both worked and they were trying to save a little.</span> <span id="s1837">And learned that if you're a veteran, you can buy a home without a down payment, within two years we were established in a townhouse in Queens, New York.</span> <span id="s1838">That was mamma.</span> <span id="s1839">Of course, with papa's help, but she was really the big push.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: _________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1842">This is the four of us,

were in New York, you moved to Queens...</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: We moved to Queens...</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: I guess my question here is, even though you are now free, you're in the United States, you're, you've been able to, I guess, re-establish yourself, I'm sure there were a lot of adjustments you all had to go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Well, there were, there's no question.</span> <span id="s1866">We came, we didn't really know the language.</span> <span id="s1867">I had the privilege of having had five English lessons before we left.</span> <span id="s1868">Because we needed one person who could ask a few questions.</span> <span id="s1869">So, we, I had five English lessons, so I was elected to ask the questions, where is this and where is that.</span> <span id="s1870">So, that was the extent of my knowledge of English.</span> <span id="s1871">When we, we settled in in New York, as I said, within a week, mom was out looking for work.</span> <span id="s1872">And, so was I.</span> <span id="s1873">We both got jobs.</span> <span id="s1874">Mom and I then talked and she says, you know what, it would be a good idea if you could learn again, maybe finish up learning how to make patterns and things like that.</span> <span id="s1875">So, I found out, with my five words of English, that there is a school called the High School for Fashion Industries, or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s1876">I believe around 23rd Street in New York.</span> <span id="s1877">I make my way there and I enroll myself in this high school.</span> <span id="s1878">And, as far, when it came to the dressmaking and those parts, I knew everything.</span> <span id="s1879">However, in the other classes, it was another story.</span> <span id="s1880">I didn't know the language, and I remember sitting in a class, and one day I was asked a question, and I couldn't, I tried to answer it and, of course, I had this deep accent, and my English, of course, was very poor, and I remember everybody laughing and I got very upset that one day.</span> <span id="s1881">And I just bust out crying and ran out.</span> <span id="s1882">The teacher came after me and, you know, brought me back into class.</span> <span id="s1883">And then, time went on, I did very, I got several high school credits from the things that I did know.</span> <span id="s1884">And then the principal called me in to her office and she said that I could get a scholarship to the Fashion Institute of New York.</span> <span id="s1885">I didn't know what a scholarship was.</span> <span id="s1886">I thought it had something to do with being a scholar, but I didn't feel like a scholar.</span> <span id="s1887">But, I didn't know what a scholar, I didn't know that a scholarship was, as I said in French, _________________, which was money to attend a school.</span> <span id="s1888">And, I went home and I told my mother and father that the principal said I could get a scholarship.</span> <span id="s1889">My father knew what a scholarship was.</span> <span id="s1890">But, he says, I'm a girl and a girl doesn't need that much education.</span> <span id="s1891">Then they discussed it, of course, with uncle and the uncle who sent his two daughters to college, didn't think that I needed it.</span> <span id="s1892">And, I was then pulled out of school and I went to work.</span> <span id="s1893">Period.</span> <span id="s1894">But I went back to the Eron(ph) School and took some more bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1895">That I could do at night.</span> <span id="s1896">Then, I decided once I knew stenography, I would get a job and I applied for a job with an attorney.</span> <span id="s1897">Because I then learned that in the United States, it isn't very elegant to work in a shop, that you have to work in an office, to be, quote, something.</span> <span id="s1898">So, I applied to this attorney, I know stenography in French, I know stenography in English and I know how to type and I know bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s1899">And he dictates his first letter and I type up the letter, I was there for three days by then, and I wrote the word subpoena, S-A-B-E-N-A.</span> <span id="s1900">That's the only subpoena I knew.</span> <span id="s1901">Whatever, that's the end of that job.</span> <span id="s1902">I then got another job.</span> <span id="s1903">And another job.</span> <span id="s1904">After awhile, my English improved because what happened is, I, as I said, I found teenagers very frivolous here.</span> <span id="s1905">So, I wasn't comfortable with them.</span> <span id="s1906">Adults really didn't want any part of me.</span> <span id="s1907">I wasn't considered an adult.</span> <span id="s1908">So, I isolated myself.</span> <span id="s1909">I worked and then in my free time, I went to the library and with a dictionary and books that I had asked the librarian to tell me what I should read, I taught myself English.</span> <span id="s1910">I didn't know a verb from and adjective for, or a topic sentence or anything like that, but I taught myself how to read English.</span> <span id="s1911">And I literally photographed linguistic structure.</span> <span id="s1912">Not realizing that it would come in handy later on.</span> <span id="s1913">And, eventually, I presented myself to M. Lowenstein(ph) &amp; Sons.</span> <span id="s1914">I believe the company still exists.</span> <span id="s1915">As a bilingual secretary.</span> <span id="s1916">And, when I was asked if I had a high school diploma, I said, of course.</span> <span id="s1917">And, I got the job, and I realized that I really didn't know a lot, so what I did is, nobody else in my office knew French, so I told my boss, I need a dictionary.</span> <span id="s1918">He brought me a dictionary and I took the work home.</span> <span id="s1919">I pretended to do it in the office, I took the work home, I worked at night, brought the work back, and learned.</span> <span id="s1920">I ended up staying there until after I was married and I didn't leave until I was expecting my son.</span> <span id="s1921">I became a good bilingual secretary.</span> <span id="s1922">Of course, I felt bad I had lied by then, you know, but you had, the thing is, I did my work, I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1923">Then after that, I just kept, basically, I worked.</span> <span id="s1924">I mean, literally, that was my life.</span> <span id="s1925">My home, my family and work.</span> <span id="s1926">Then for awhile there, my second child, my husband was promoted and I could be a homemaker for awhile, so I was a homemaker, but I wanted certain things, like music lessons with the best of teachers and everything that was good for my children, so I started using my dressmaking skills because I didn't want to leave the children because I didn't have parents at home and I felt that my children should have a mother at home.</span> <span id="s1927">But I wanted money.</span> <span id="s1928">So, I became a dressmaker again at home.</span> <span id="s1929">And when the children were in school, I worked as a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s1930">Meanwhile, I became active in the community.</span> <span id="s1931">We lived outside of Philadelphia and there was no library in my children's elementary school, so I volunteered to set one up.</span> <span id="s1932">I set up a library.</span> <span id="s1933">My husband had a decent job, but, I wanted more.</span> <span id="s1934">And I told him to leave his job and go and try out for another one.</span> <span id="s1935">And his father said, no, you have a job, you stay put, you don't go chasing after birds in the sky.</span> <span id="s1936">And I said there's only one way, I said, we're young, we can do it, well anyway, time went on and we made it.</span> <span id="s1937">And then, but meanwhile, I never had a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1938">When my son was, there were two incidents that drove me to improve myself in other areas.</span> <span id="s1939">One of them was, I still had a fairly deep accent and I didn't realize to what degree because my husband never said anything.</span> <span id="s1940">Once in awhile people would kind of make fun, but by that time, it didn't bother me that much.</span> <span id="s1941">One day my little one came home from first grade crying.</span> <span id="s1942">And I thought somebody had beaten him up, and he said, please, mommy, when you come to school, don't talk.</span> <span id="s1943">Everybody says you talk funny.</span> <span id="s1944">So, my child wasn't going to be an outsider, so I started working with my husband and improving my accent, that's why I have a New York accent.</span> <span id="s1945">And fighting my accent, that was one thing.</span> <span id="s1946">Then one day, I realized that someday the children are going to ask me if I have, if mamma has a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1947">And I didn't want to have to lie to my children.</span> <span id="s1948">So, I went to see my, but, you know, there was one element in all this, is that I, basically, I was very much of a loner.</span> <span id="s1949">I did things.</span> <span id="s1950">Like, I, as I said, I became part of the community, I worked at the school as a volunteer at the library, I, at the synagogue I volunteered, I became a den mother and all that, but, yet, I was a loner.</span> <span id="s1951">I had no time for friendships.</span> <span id="s1952">But, I think it wasn't so much that I had no time, I think I had become so comfortable going my own way, going all the way back when the children laughed at me after school and I isolated myself.</span> <span id="s1953">I worked and started teaching myself English.</span> <span id="s1954">That it became a pattern.</span> <span id="s1955">In fact, I'm still accused of being a workaholic.</span> <span id="s1956">I'm supposed to be retired, but I work all the time.</span> <span id="s1957">And I think you develop a pattern.</span> <span id="s1958">But, anyway, I went to see my little girl's kindergarten teacher and I said, look, this is between us, I want to tell you something, maybe you can help me.</span> <span id="s1959">See, because I had talked to my husband, my husband kept saying, Flora, you're a smart girl, you don't have to prove anything to anybody, you don't need it.</span> <span id="s1960">But, I wanted it.</span> <span id="s1961">So, she says, you can get a high school diploma two ways.</span> <span id="s1962">She says, I know they are giving some exams at Temple University to veterans.</span> <span id="s1963">You can get what they call a General Education Diploma.</span> <span id="s1964">Or, she says, you can take classes.</span> <span id="s1965">She says, but, you know what, why don't you take the test, if you fail it, you'll take classes.</span> <span id="s1966">So, I went and I took the exam and, it was, after that, it was a series of exams.</span> <span id="s1967">And I took them and then I was supposed to come back to find out the results and, I get a diploma.</span> <span id="s1968">And I'll never forget, the man who handed it to me says, well, Mrs. Singer, what are you going to do with this?</span> <span id="s1969">What am I going to do with this?</span> <span id="s1970">Who's going to be my equal?</span> <span id="s1971">I've got a high school diploma!</span> <span id="s1972">You know?</span> <span id="s1973">So, by then my husband was more successful, we were able to live in our own home already, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s1974">So, that, that's it.</span> <span id="s1975">We went out to dinner, he was so proud of me and all that.</span> <span id="s1976">Anyway, time goes by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: You have how many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: I have two children and four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1979">Time went by.</span> <span id="s1980">We, eventually, my husband went into his own business and when my son was in his first year of college, it was either the last year of high school or the first year of college.</span> <span id="s1981">One day we were talking about courses and credits and things like that and he says, you know, mom, he says, how come you never went back to school?</span> <span id="s1982">He says, you're always pushing education.</span> <span id="s1983">How come you never went back to school?</span> <span id="s1984">I said, me, at my age?</span> <span id="s1985">I'm old.</span> <span id="s1986">I was only 39.</span> <span id="s1987">I don't even know if I was quite 39 at that point, but I felt old.</span> <span id="s1988">I said, I'm old, I said.</span> <span id="s1989">Sure, he says, schooling, everybody's gotta go to school, you gotta, learning never stops except for you, right?</span> <span id="s1990">Well, I didn't sleep all night, the next day I presented myself at American U, because by then we lived here.</span> <span id="s1991">And, I said I need to speak to someone who could advise me on college.</span> <span id="s1992">And I kind of give a little background and the counselor says, well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a stack of books.</span> <span id="s1993">Take them home, read them, come back, we'll discuss them and I'll tell you if you're college material.</span> <span id="s1994">I did.</span> <span id="s1995">Came back.</span> <span id="s1996">Meanwhile, I had built, helped my husband build a business, we had a bagel bakery and all that, you know?</span> <span id="s1997">And, I read the books.</span> <span id="s1998">I had read every one of them.</span> <span id="s1999">Those were the books I had read during my hours in the library.</span> <span id="s2000">But I re-read them to make sure that I knew what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s2001">I came back, we talked, no question, you can make it.</span> <span id="s2002">I said, well, how would I go about it.</span> <span id="s2003">She says, well, you can come in as a special student, if you do C or better, you can matriculate.</span> <span id="s2004">So, I went home and I told my husband, I want to go to college.</span> <span id="s2005">And he says, Flora, why are you always trying to prove things?</span> <span id="s2006">And I said, no, I just, I want to do this, I said, I want to give an example to the children.</span> <span id="s2007">So, but financially, it was more convenient for me to go to Montgomery College.</span> <span id="s2008">So, I enrolled in Montgomery College and I finished up there and then there was a scholarship for women.</span> <span id="s2009">It was right after that that Horizons for Women came out, remember?</span> <span id="s2010">Started going back to school.</span> <span id="s2011">But, I had started it just a little before.</span> <span id="s2012">To make a long story short, they had a scholarship to Maryland that was offered to women.</span> <span id="s2013">And I was one of the candidates.</span> <span id="s2014">But, then it was based on need and, fortunately, by then, I didn't have a need.</span> <span id="s2015">So, another woman got it.</span> <span id="s2016">A minority woman.</span> <span id="s2017">So, I went to Maryland anyway.</span> <span id="s2018">And I finished up my degree, finished Magna Cum Laude, believe it, I still can't believe it.</span> <span id="s2019">And, now, again, I get a surprise party.</span> <span id="s2020">My professors are invited and all that.</span> <span id="s2021">And at that point, I added my maiden name again as a middle name, because I felt that my father would have wanted that.</span> <span id="s2022">Because there's no one else to carry his name.</span> <span id="s2023">But, that was the end of it, you know?</span> <span id="s2024">Again...</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: So, do you think your husband was right, that you had this compelling need to prove yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2027">It's a good question.</span> <span id="s2028">Because what happened, what's interesting, my husband is the one who changed, not me.</span> <span id="s2029">What happened was, after the surprise party, I didn't know, but he had gotten some tickets to take me on a vacation.</span> <span id="s2030">And, being I had been so busy between helping him and going to school and studying, and all, and taking care of the children still, even though they were adolescents now, he kept complaining.</span> <span id="s2031">See, the thing is, he kept complaining throughout the years that I was going to college, we couldn't go out because I had to study for tests or write a paper or whatever.</span> <span id="s2032">But, anyway, this was it.</span> <span id="s2033">I'm in the house, I had gone out shopping to get a few clothes for my vacation.</span> <span id="s2034">And I get a phone call and it was Jack, and he says, my husband, he says, Flora, are you standing or sitting down?</span> <span id="s2035">I says, why, who died, who got hurt?</span> <span id="s2036">Anyone got hurt?</span> <span id="s2037">Anyone sick?</span> <span id="s2038">He says, why does it always have to be bad news?</span> <span id="s2039">He says, no, sit down if you're standing.</span> <span id="s2040">And, so I sat down, he says, how would you like to go to graduate school and teach at the University of Maryland?</span> <span id="s2041">I said, what?</span> <span id="s2042">He says, yes, they waived the GRE's and you can go to graduate school, not only aren't you going to have to pay, they're going to pay you, and you'll teach.</span> <span id="s2043">I said, well, I can't do that to you, I said, you know, it's not fair.</span> <span id="s2044">He says, how can you refuse it?</span> <span id="s2045">Meanwhile, that same week what had happened is, a friend of mine had bought out a, actually, no, she hadn't bought it out yet, she had gotten a job as a guide, a tour guide.</span> <span id="s2046">And they offered me a job also, because of my linguistic skills.</span> <span id="s2047">And I had accepted it, but I hadn't gone down yet to get fingerprinted for the license and all that, and I said, and not only that, I said, I already promised to take this job.</span> <span id="s2048">He says, Flora, how can you compare the two?</span> <span id="s2049">How can you, you can't turn it down.</span> <span id="s2050">I says, but, Jack, do you know what that means?</span> <span id="s2051">That means again, homework, and papers and all that, I says, I won't be able to go out.</span> <span id="s2052">He said, so what?</span> <span id="s2053">So, anyway, I went back to graduate school, I taught at Maryland three years.</span> <span id="s2054">And then they offered me a job in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2055">And, I took it and then my husband talked me out of it because he felt it was just such a big trip to go to Baltimore all the time.</span> <span id="s2056">And, I sent a vitae to the local colleges, but then, a friend of my husband who works in the county, they needed a French teacher at Einstein High School, called, said they had an opening, would I take it?</span> <span id="s2057">I said, me teach high school?</span> <span id="s2058">My husband says, look I know you, come September you're going to be unhappy if you don't do anything, he says.</span> <span id="s2059">So, I took the job and a few days after I had, after I had signed the contract, I got an offer, there was a position at Georgetown, part-time.</span> <span id="s2060">But, of course, I had signed the contract.</span> <span id="s2061">And I loved working with the high school kids.</span> <span id="s2062">It was like, literally, a fish going into water.</span> <span id="s2063">I just loved working with the kids, and I stayed.</span> <span id="s2064">Stayed with Britannia and ended up retiring from Walt Whitman High School.</span> <span id="s2065">And some nice things happened to me, too.</span> <span id="s2066">I ended up going back to Maryland as what they call a master learner, there was a special program.</span> <span id="s2067">And I just went to a wedding of one of my former students.</span> <span id="s2068">From Maryland.</span> <span id="s2069">I ended up going to Japan on their program that I was selected for on a grant because of something I had written, comparative study of Shakespeare and French literature.</span> <span id="s2070">So, some real nice things happened.</span> <span id="s2071">Did they just happen?</span> <span id="s2072">Did I need to prove?</span> <span id="s2073">I don't know if I needed to prove myself.</span> <span id="s2074">I don't remember thinking, ever, that I needed to prove myself.</span> <span id="s2075">There isn't, I don't remember there being an ego.</span> <span id="s2076">There is ego now, because I say, yeah, I really did all these things.</span> <span id="s2077">But, I don't remember thinking about needing to prove.</span> <span id="s2078">It was always for the children, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Maybe tried to make up for the fact that your education was interrupted in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Perhaps.</span> <span id="s2081">It was basically, the feeling of, I've got to give an example, how can I let my children, in other words, mamma had to be an example for the children.</span> <span id="s2082">And it started with mamma not having her high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Let me ask you a couple of other questions.</span> <span id="s2084">If you don't mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: Do you guys have bedrooms here to sleep in?</span> <span id="s2086">Because I'm afraid at the rate she's going...[laughter].</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: You expressed that you had to really grow up very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s2088">That when you were age 11, you were, I think you said, that you felt older then than you do now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Were you ever resentful of that, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Well, there are moments where I would, I miss being light hearted.</span> <span id="s2092">I have never really even today, I've never been able to be totally light hearted.</span> <span id="s2093">Because even today, I feel I've got to justify my life.</span> <span id="s2094">Being alive, let's put it this way, and I do a lot of work relating to Holocaust work, you know.</span> <span id="s2095">I, as I said, I teach the course.</span> <span id="s2096">I do a lot of public speaking.</span> <span id="s2097">I'm on the, I speak, a member of the Speaker's Bureau at the museum.</span> <span id="s2098">I sit as president, co-president now, because we're getting older so we decided, we recycle each other because we're not that many, of the survivor's group, and these are responsibilities.</span> <span id="s2099">I feel, I don't really stop and really think about it, but I think I must feel a sense of meriting, earning my life, the fact that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s2100">And I think sometimes of, I'll give you a parallel of someone most kids are familiar with.</span> <span id="s2101">Kids read Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s2102">Now, Anne Frank would have been a year older than I am today, had she lived.</span> <span id="s2103">Anne Frank was hidden.</span> <span id="s2104">Not even three hours from where I was hidden.</span> <span id="s2105">And yet, I was given the chance to have this beautiful productive life.</span> <span id="s2106">I have children that I'm proud of.</span> <span id="s2107">I have grandchildren that I adore and find a lot of joy in.</span> <span id="s2108">I have a wonderful man that I'm married to.</span> <span id="s2109">So, I do have a feeling that I do have to earn that, perhaps, yeah.</span> <span id="s2110">That, if I'm alive, I can't waste that life, if that makes any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: What, are there other long term effects that you can cite in terms of how these early experiences impacted on your later life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2113">Let me give you, let me tell you, yeah, I know exactly.</span> <span id="s2114">I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but let me tell you, where I do have it.</span> <span id="s2115">I, on my passport, is always renewed at least a year before it expires.</span> <span id="s2116">I will not risk getting stuck.</span> <span id="s2117">And I have a little cash, enough to buy a train ticket somewheres.</span> <span id="s2118">I have urged my children to do that.</span> <span id="s2119">I've urged my husband to do that.</span> <span id="s2120">My husband's, I renew for him.</span> <span id="s2121">But, which is stupid, because he's an American you know, and I'm an American today, too.</span> <span id="s2122">My citizenship is my most precious possession.</span> <span id="s2123">Because, you know, I don't agree with everything the government says, but I bless this land every time I come home from somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2124">That is an obsession and I have not been able to convince my children because they feel so comfortable and so free, that they can't, as I say, they think I'm still obsessed.</span> <span id="s2125">Maybe it is a foolish obsession, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: So, you still don't feel entirely safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: No, I never feel entirely safe.</span> <span id="s2128">I don't.</span> <span id="s2129">I really don't.</span> <span id="s2130">In fact, my neighbors tell me that I have the most locked up fortress, why I'm always locking.</span> <span id="s2131">I didn't many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s2132">I do.</span> <span id="s2133">There's one thing that never has gone away.</span> <span id="s2134">If I am stopped by a policeman, even though I know, I've worked with policeman community relations, the department, you know, come to my classes, and I've dealt with them and they're wonderful people.</span> <span id="s2135">But, there is still, in an official capacity, if I am stopped by a policeman, my whole insides shake.</span> <span id="s2136">Literally, shake.</span> <span id="s2137">There's just something, I got stopped, I didn't get a ticket, but I got stopped by a policeman once, and his voice was a little louder than it should have been.</span> <span id="s2138">And I could not come up with a voiced answer.</span> <span id="s2139">I finally did, but I was shaking.</span> <span id="s2140">So, there are these things, alright?</span> <span id="s2141">If I see a pair of boots, I still get affected.</span> <span id="s2142">We had an incident.</span> <span id="s2143">This goes back at least, oh, God, at least maybe 18 years ago.</span> <span id="s2144">So, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s2145">My husband and I had a free day and we had gone into, it was one of these perfect days.</span> <span id="s2146">We had gone into the city, we visited a couple of the museums, we ate at the National Art Gallery, the little cafe they have there.</span> <span id="s2147">And it was one of these perfect days, but whenever I had a perfect day like that, it frightens me, you know?</span> <span id="s2148">Kind of, nothing can be that perfect.</span> <span id="s2149">But anyway, we're driving back on 16th Street, and all of a sudden, my body started to shake.</span> <span id="s2150">My husband must have noticed it, he was driving, pulls the car over, he said, what's the matter?</span> <span id="s2151">I could not talk.</span> <span id="s2152">I was literally, my teeth were chattering.</span> <span id="s2153">And I couldn't even tell him what's wrong.</span> <span id="s2154">Finally, I calmed down, there were several men on K and 16th Street, with a swastika on their arm handing out leaflets.</span> <span id="s2155">Now, I know I'm safe, I'm in the United States, there's something that that triggered in me.</span> <span id="s2156">Or sometimes, I'll forget myself and I'll listen to a lecture.</span> <span id="s2157">I'm fine as long as I'm on guard and I know exactly what's happening, but I can't be caught by surprise.</span> <span id="s2158">And, as a matter of fact, I was at the museum, and I do very well, you know, I'm strong and I, I was at the museum at a lecture, and a friend, one of my neighbors introduced one of the speakers and he happened to be a, he's a psychiatrist, he came up and I was shaking.</span> <span id="s2159">And I said, you know, Richard, I don't understand this.</span> <span id="s2160">My mind is calm, I know where I am, I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I said, why is my body reacting?</span> <span id="s2161">He says, because the mind may not forget, but the mind can repress, but the body remembers.</span> <span id="s2162">He says, there is physical remembrance, which I was not aware of.</span> <span id="s2163">Not being a psychiatrist, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: I'm sure there must be, I mean, in light of what you're talking about, there must be certain sounds, certain smells, certain sights that trigger...</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: It does.</span> <span id="s2166">Well, I do fear whenever you have, like when Farakan(ph) spoke ___________________.</span> <span id="s2167">I knew I was safe and all that, but such fear that someone who could mobilize people can take another people, perhaps, and mobilize this mass against others.</span> <span id="s2168">And that's a fear that's never gone away.</span> <span id="s2169">Because even with Hitler, there are many things, even I sometimes tend to want to say, yeah, I'd like a little more order.</span> <span id="s2170">I'd like less violence.</span> <span id="s2171">Let's, you know, ________________, and then I say, no, we can't, you know.</span> <span id="s2172">Because there's always seemingly something good in an authoritarian kind of a setting.</span> <span id="s2173">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: One other question, there's only a couple of minutes left on this tape.</span> <span id="s2175">We can always put in another one, but, I'm sure _____________________.</span> <span id="s2176">Just sort of your thoughts on the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s2177">I mean, here you, basically learned it, it harbored you, and yet you are an observant Jew today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: But, I respect those who believe in Catholicism or any other religion.</span> <span id="s2179">And, as I say to youngsters, when I speak to them, I say, had I been born a Catholic, I would've been proud to be a Catholic.</span> <span id="s2180">Had I been born a Hindu, I would have been proud to be a Hindu.</span> <span id="s2181">Because each religion does teach some good things.</span> <span id="s2182">It's the way we twist those things.</span> <span id="s2183">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: But you must have some feeling about Catholicism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2186">Let me, I used to question, there are some things I can't accept because I have been so strongly Jewish before I ever went into the convents.</span> <span id="s2187">So, even though there was this attraction, the Mother Superior has said I have promised to come back and become a nun, and I'm still sometimes accused of, for a nice Jewish girl, being a, I could easily be a nun.</span> <span id="s2188">Not, why I don't know, that's another, you know, thing.</span> <span id="s2189">But, I did question the Mother Superior a lot and one day, I'll never forget this, she said to me, she says, Flora, faith is beyond us.</span> <span id="s2190">It's above our heads, let's just pray to God to be able to believe, she says, but don't worry about it, she says, there's one God in Heaven and different ladders to reach him.</span> <span id="s2191">And each religion is one of those ladders.</span> <span id="s2192">Now, this coming from a nun.</span> <span id="s2193">Father Bruno, when he gave a child into hiding, said, this child is not to be converted.</span> <span id="s2194">That doesn't mean that some overzealous people didn't try, but he said, this child is not to be converted.</span> <span id="s2195">Our job is to save their lives, we don't, you know, their soul doesn't belong to us.</span> <span id="s2196">A true Christian, to me, is the one who practices religion, who does what you're supposed to do, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: When you were in the convent, did you say Jewish prayers to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: I did try to think if the _________________________ quietly.</span> <span id="s2199">But I didn't dare tell the little kids, my sisters, to do it, because I was afraid they would do it loudly.</span> <span id="s2200">But, after awhile I really didn't, but once in awhile I would sort of think the ______________ in my heart, you know?</span> <span id="s2201">Just remind myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: We have, I think, probably less than one minute on this tape.</span> <span id="s2203">Is there anything else you want to quickly say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: If my tape will, this story will help people to reduce prejudice and if we could just learn to respect one another, in spite of all of our difference, I'll feel like I've accomplished something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0356 PAGE
