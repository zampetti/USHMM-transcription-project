be sharing with us today?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: In the story they called me Mietek, it was a Polish name, it was a first name from Mietek, but Gruber.</span> <span id="s20">Mietek Gruber.</span> <span id="s21">But before the war they called me Munyo.</span> <span id="s22">I was known – in my town I was called – named Munyo Gruber.</span> <span id="s23">They called me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And which town was that, that you–?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My town is a small town in Galicia, named Podhajce, not far from Lemberg.</span> <span id="s26">I went to school public there.</span> <span id="s27">Had my family, five people in the family, with my mother and father was seven.</span> <span id="s28">We – one of my sisters in 1928 married an American – came from America – American, and she come over to America with him and she was here.</span> <span id="s29">And I remembered her – his number here, address and being in a – as a prisoner of war, I wrote to her and she wrote to me and we contacted each other.</span> <span id="s30">She was here in America.</span> <span id="s31">The rest of the family disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s33">Let's go back then to the period of time before the war.</span> <span id="s34">Tell us a little about what life was like in the town in which you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Podhajce was a small town.</span> <span id="s36">It was maybe 4,000 Jews and around, around the town were Polish people, Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s37">There was a difference from the Pollacks.</span> <span id="s38">And I went to school there, to the public school, for seven years we went.</span> <span id="s39">And the town was a very, very nice town.</span> <span id="s40">It was Podhajce – that mean, they had a lot of trees and water and people came from all over Poland almost for like a recreation.</span> <span id="s41">It was a very nice place.</span> <span id="s42">And I don't remember poor people there because usually in the towns, in the shtetel you call, there was a lot of poor people.</span> <span id="s43">I don't remember poor people there.</span> <span id="s44">Everybody had some kind of store or a business, a small one.</span> <span id="s45">My father was a builder.</span> <span id="s46">He came from another town and he was building in Podhajce, and he met my mother.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was a farmer's daughter, they had land, and he married her and I'm – all my life I was till 26 years, the war start – I was with my mother's family.</span> <span id="s48">I hardly knew my father's family.</span> <span id="s49">They were in another town, so it wasn't so easy to go from town to town like it is today.</span> <span id="s50">But still when I was 14 years old, I went away to Lemberg – Lwów, they called it – to a bigger town, and I went to high school there and I finished school.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">01:03:38</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And after you finished high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Oh, I came back.</span> <span id="s54">Not directly.</span> <span id="s55">I came maybe one or two years later because I had a job in Lemberg.</span> <span id="s56">I got some – I helped out some with teaching little bit, I did odd jobs.</span> <span id="s57">And then I came back to Podhajce, to my family.</span> <span id="s58">And I had a job, was a bookkeeper, I worked in a big company from a farmer’s equipment and bicycles, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s59">I was a bookkeeper, there.</span> <span id="s60">I worked – till the war started, I worked there.</span> <span id="s61">I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s62">I went out with her for years before the war.</span> <span id="s63">And in 19– I was a soldier before, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s65">In what way were you a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: They took – they drafted.</span> <span id="s67">After 18 years – 19 years, they drafted, and you had to go.</span> <span id="s68">And I was physically fit and they took me.</span> <span id="s69">Usually they didn't took Jews.</span> <span id="s70">Very, few Jews they took to the army, but I was fitting and I had school, and they took me to the army.</span> <span id="s71">And I was one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home again and I was working back again in the job.</span> <span id="s72">And in ‘39 before the war started, maybe a month, the town was small and we knew each other.</span> <span id="s73">A lot of friends.</span> <span id="s74">We were always talking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in ‘33 and we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s75">The Pollacks were already showing their faces too.</span> <span id="s76">They didn't – so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there.</span> <span id="s77">But the Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are – we had fights with them.</span> <span id="s78">Not big ones, not killings, but fists fights and all kind of – I remember one Purim where we made some kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this.</span> <span id="s79">And I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me because he was very big.</span> <span id="s80">I didn't give him an inch, I just gave him back.</span> <span id="s81">But he never forgot me this guy.</span> <span id="s82">He came after a few days after me.</span> <span id="s83">He almost killed me.</span> <span id="s84">Around the house he was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s85">At least, we had our share with this antisemitism.</span> <span id="s86">We did not feel so much in with Podhajce, like we felt in Lemberg.</span> <span id="s87">We felt it more in the bigger towns.</span> <span id="s88">They were they called it Endeks.</span> <span id="s89">There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against the Jews and they were even killing before the war break.</span> <span id="s90">We had a big fight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever – it was a street like in Akademicka.</span> <span id="s91">That remind me today somebody.</span> <span id="s92">Jews couldn't walk there.</span> <span id="s93">And there was the biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy – Stricher(ph) was his name – he had this biggest house like on Akademicka street.</span> <span id="s94">He couldn't even collect the rent there.</span> <span id="s95">He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't – they were almost sitting in the streets daring, waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up.</span> <span id="s96">The situation before the war was already ripe for this, but like a like – the churchman said in Poland, “Boycotting is all right, the Jews.</span> <span id="s97">Beating them up, is alright.</span> <span id="s98">But not killing.</span> <span id="s99">Killing is not our aim,” the Catholic church.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: When we get back to the story that you're telling us about your completing the army activity, returning to work, the war began, where were you when the war began?</span> <span id="s101">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">01:07:44</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s104">Before the war, they called me over on the reserves.</span> <span id="s105">Maybe two or three weeks before the war started.</span> <span id="s106">They called me to Nowy Sacz, a town not far from the borders of Germany.</span> <span id="s107">It is not far from Przemysl and Tarnów.</span> <span id="s108">And they – I went to the army.</span> <span id="s109">They, they put us in uniforms and we started to exercise.</span> <span id="s110">And maybe two weeks after, nobody new about this.</span> <span id="s111">Nobody – the people around there was surrounded there.</span> <span id="s112">Zakopane was a place where people came there for a cure.</span> <span id="s113">And nobody knew that the war started and all of a sudden during the night they starting shooting and they left us behind, the Germans, and they moved in.</span> <span id="s114">It was a Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s115">They moved in before we even knew what happen.</span> <span id="s116">We were in the army.</span> <span id="s117">We were sitting in the mountains because there was a lot of mountains, the Carpathian Mountains.</span> <span id="s118">And we were sitting there and waiting for the Germans and they were around us already, deep in, in Poland and we didn't know they were around us.</span> <span id="s119">But after a time they started with us too because they did it in pockets like, and they start fighting with us and I was wounded in my right arm.</span> <span id="s120">I was shot and I fell, and but they didn't see me, and I walked over to a house there to a Polish woman and I begged her to let me in because I was bleeding and she saw me and she was crying.</span> <span id="s121">She was afraid, but she took me in and she start helping me and she bandaged my wound and I was laying – when I was laying there for five minutes the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s122">And screaming and looking, and the one with the pistol came over to me and I spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s123">I told him, “I'm a soldier and I, I'm wounded.”</span> <span id="s124">He said, "Okay, don't worry.</span> <span id="s125">We will take you back to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s126">And they gave me something to eat even there because they took from the farm woman and gave it to me and they brought me back to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So you were a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: And I became a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s129">But I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s130">I didn't feel it so much because I was still a prisoner of war, a Polish prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s131">Nobody bothered me specially as a Jew.</span> <span id="s132">Nobody said nothing to me.</span> <span id="s133">But the Polish people and the woman that worked there, they knew about it that I am Jewish, but they didn't make a special–</span></p> <p><span id="s134">01:10:49</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Face and the, the manners.</span> <span id="s137">They knew a Jew.</span> <span id="s138">They recognize.</span> <span id="s139">Pollacks recognize a Jew even we didn't look like one.</span> <span id="s140">They knew.</span> <span id="s141">And I was lying there maybe a month in the hospital until I could move my right hand.</span> <span id="s142">I couldn't move it, but they helped me out a little bit and I'm, I'm moving it.</span> <span id="s143">I still till today is – I cannot pick my hand that's all.</span> <span id="s144">And after a month and a half, they took us, whoever was in the hospital left, and they took us to Germany.</span> <span id="s145">In a train, they brought me over to Germany.</span> <span id="s146">And they brought me into Stalag 13 – in the film you will see, Stalag 13 – as a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s147">The second day I came in, they put us in a line up, all the Polish prisoners and they asked, “Juden raustreten.”</span> <span id="s148">"Jews report.”</span> <span id="s149">I was hesitating for a minute, I admit and two friends of mine, Pollacks, they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me out and they said, "Here is a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Must have been nice friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Two friends of mine.</span> <span id="s152">A day before we, we shared bread because on the way we came, they throw bread to us to the, to the train.</span> <span id="s153">And I always – they always give me I should divide it and I was, I was always a leader between them.</span> <span id="s154">And all of a sudden, they decided, “here's a Jew.”</span> <span id="s155">Then I came out.</span> <span id="s156">I had no, no choice, and they put a separate barracks but to the same place they kept us.</span> <span id="s157">They took us to all kinds of work, heavy work during this.</span> <span id="s158">We were cleaning after even Hitler when he spoke in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s159">That was – I was around Nur—Langwasser, Stalag 13 was there.</span> <span id="s160">Nuremberg, we were cleaning after Hitler.</span> <span id="s161">He spoke once.</span> <span id="s162">And I was a little bit more home in the barracks because I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans.</span> <span id="s163">They had their report.</span> <span id="s164">And in fact, the Red Cross came to us and my number's 30,189.</span> <span id="s165">I still remember.</span> <span id="s166">And they have the record of me when I was born, where I was born, and where I fell – the 8th of October I think, and when I was in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:13:34</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: This is a good chance to go back for a moment to think about your family.</span> <span id="s169">You have told us about the war beginning, your involvement in the war.</span> <span id="s170">Where was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: That's a very interesting.</span> <span id="s172">My family was on the other side of the border.</span> <span id="s173">The Russians took over one side of Poland.</span> <span id="s174">The Germans took over the other.</span> <span id="s175">They had made pact, Ribbentrop and Molotov, and they divided Poland.</span> <span id="s176">My family was in Galicia, and then belonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the Russians.</span> <span id="s177">So 1941 they were under the Russian.</span> <span id="s178">It wasn't too good, but still my father was working.</span> <span id="s179">He was a builder and he built houses for them, and he built this.</span> <span id="s180">And he – they made a living.</span> <span id="s181">Nobody killed him there.</span> <span id="s182">They knew what is going on the other side, because I was corresponding with them.</span> <span id="s183">As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write – to send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me.</span> <span id="s184">And one was an interesting that I sent a letter that went from one camp to the other when they took me.</span> <span id="s185">I was in a few camps.</span> <span id="s186">But they cut my hair.</span> <span id="s187">I had very nice bushy hair and I didn't like it that they cut my hair.</span> <span id="s188">I looked like a muselman.</span> <span id="s189">I looked very bad.</span> <span id="s190">Then I wrote to my parents that they cut my hair again and my sister answers me, "Watch that they shouldn't cut your head.</span> <span id="s191">The hair will grow back.”</span> <span id="s192">And that was the truth.</span> <span id="s193">I had to watch my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So during this time while you were prisoner of war, you did keep contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I kept contact with my family and I kept contact even with my sister in America.</span> <span id="s196">I was sending her letters, and she even sent me a package – she was sending me a package.</span> <span id="s197">I had this sweater – I can never forget – a green sweater.</span> <span id="s198">She sent me and I put it on, and when I run away to the, to the woods, I had this sweater on.</span> <span id="s199">And after a time, there were so many insects in this that when I took it over, the sweater walked away by itself.</span> <span id="s200">That's a joke, that's the truth.</span> <span id="s201">That's the way it was.</span> <span id="s202">I mean I had contact with my sister and I had contact with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">01:16:07</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s205">Now, let's get back to where you were.</span> <span id="s206">You were taken into Stalag and you were given a particular work assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I was assigned to the kitchen more or less because in the beginning, they did some other works and later on they put me in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s208">In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I was making lunch.</span> <span id="s209">And I once I made coffee and I didn't know what sugar is.</span> <span id="s210">They gave me the salt and sugar was for me the same.</span> <span id="s211">I never saw it before.</span> <span id="s212">And you had to – sugar was in lumps not loose.</span> <span id="s213">And I put in .</span> <span id="s214">.</span> <span id="s215">instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the morning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen.</span> <span id="s216">They wanted to kill me because the coffee was salted and they figured – they called me in the Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when – if I would be under the SS, I wouldn't live.</span> <span id="s217">They would kill me.</span> <span id="s218">But this was Wehrmacht there.</span> <span id="s219">And some of them are still people today you could talk to.</span> <span id="s220">And I understand.</span> <span id="s221">told him this story that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt.</span> <span id="s222">And he let me go.</span> <span id="s223">But he gave me a lesson.</span> <span id="s224">I think he took me, he put me to work, but he was somehow lenient to me because I helped him out after a time in his office too.</span> <span id="s225">I write German fluently, and I was helping in the office to write it.</span> <span id="s226">And from – this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes.</span> <span id="s227">I was in Nuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name?</span> <span id="s228">Münzinger.</span> <span id="s229">They were taking us from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s230">And then Münzinger, all of a sudden they decided or it's not – they, I mean, the headquarters – decided that all Jews have to be sent back to Poland.</span> <span id="s231">How?</span> <span id="s232">They said they don't want prisoners now.</span> <span id="s233">The Pollacks – the Polish war was finished.</span> <span id="s234">Why should they keep prisoners?</span> <span id="s235">“You are Jews, and no, no prisoners and we send you home.”</span> <span id="s236">And they suppose to change, to change us over with the Russians.</span> <span id="s237">That was in ‘41, and after a time they took us – they put us in trains and they brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz, they brought us to Lublin in a camp Lipowa Seven.</span> <span id="s238">There was from horses from a camp before.</span> <span id="s239">And this Lipowa, right away by the train, when they took us over, they showed us, right away, who they are.</span> <span id="s240">They were SS.</span> <span id="s241">They came with, with the dogs, peitsches, sticks and all kinds of this, and they were beating us right all the way to the camp.</span> <span id="s242">And they told, "You are no more prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s243">You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.”</span> <span id="s244">But still they kept us separate.</span> <span id="s245">They didn't put us together with the ghetto.</span> <span id="s246">There was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s247">In Lublin there was a ghetto already then.</span> <span id="s248">And they did not put us in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">01:19:35 But there was an interesting story.</span> <span id="s250">Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners.</span> <span id="s251">They were all Jews also, what came and they – the Germans brought them over to the Jews from the ghetto and they told them, "You feed them.</span> <span id="s252">That's your Jews.</span> <span id="s253">You feed them.”</span> <span id="s254">And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin.</span> <span id="s255">The people, the population was very bad for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">And they said, "We don't have food.”</span> <span id="s257">They said, "Good.”</span> <span id="s258">They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand.</span> <span id="s259">Maybe – maybe a tenth was left over by the end.</span> <span id="s260">They brought them on the way to Lubartów, a small town, and then to Parczew.</span> <span id="s261">Maybe there was left maybe 10, maybe 20.</span> <span id="s262">I don't – I cannot tell exactly and there the people – the population, the Jewish population put them in right away and gave them food and they kept.</span> <span id="s263">I came after this and they felt that the Jews – they felt they had to do something.</span> <span id="s264">They made a kitchen for us in the camp.</span> <span id="s265">They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there.</span> <span id="s266">The leadership there was from the SS.</span> <span id="s267">There was Riedel was the leader, and there was Dolp was a small officer.</span> <span id="s268">He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland.</span> <span id="s269">Dolp was known all over.</span> <span id="s270">Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw somebody laying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right on the spot.</span> <span id="s271">And we had a lot of problems there in the camp.</span> <span id="s272">I was still on the, on the care of this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had from the Germans that I cannot work so hard.</span> <span id="s273">Others were working out and in the beginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek concentration camp.</span> <span id="s274">They built from the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s275">We built it.</span> <span id="s276">And after this was ready, we were still there.</span> <span id="s277">They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia.</span> <span id="s278">The war with Russia started in 1941.</span> <span id="s279">I think in July, June.</span> <span id="s280">I don't remember exactly the date.</span> <span id="s281">And when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they said – the Germans said that they are not Russians – just prisoners, but they are commissars.</span> <span id="s282">They are officers something like communists real, and they have to die.</span> <span id="s283">And they were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s284">I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave them, they were dying.</span> <span id="s285">They had typhus there and they were dying.</span> <span id="s286">And we got – we caught from them typhus from the Russians.</span> <span id="s287">Me too.</span> <span id="s288">I got sick.</span> <span id="s289">I got the typhus.</span> <span id="s290">And they brought – they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will – they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s291">In the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover.</span> <span id="s292">Nothing.</span> <span id="s293">We just stayed there.</span> <span id="s294">We were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died.</span> <span id="s295">And the strongest one, somehow – I cannot believe it, but the stronger ones died.</span> <span id="s296">And I had some help from the town somehow.</span> <span id="s297">A doctor came in once, and he knew me from before.</span> <span id="s298">And he gave me a needle and he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help for everybody.</span> <span id="s299">And he gave me a needle and somehow it helped me, and I lived too.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">01:23:31</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Mr. Gruber?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You mentioned before that you were taken into a synagogue?</span> <span id="s304">Could you describe what that synagogue looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: The synagogue was a very, very big building.</span> <span id="s306">It was the biggest synagogue in Lublin.</span> <span id="s307">Lublin was a very known town from Jews.</span> <span id="s308">The Jews lived there for hundreds of years, historical.</span> <span id="s309">The biggest Rabbi for the yeshiva there was in Lublin, and they had the biggest synagogue was there in Lublin, too.</span> <span id="s310">And they took out everything.</span> <span id="s311">It was bare walls there, and we were, were laying there 400 people on the floor.</span> <span id="s312">Plain on the floor.</span> <span id="s313">Nobody was taking care of us.</span> <span id="s314">Nobody talked to us.</span> <span id="s315">Nothing!</span> <span id="s316">But the people of Lublin once in awhile were daring.</span> <span id="s317">They came in and they brought us food a little bit.</span> <span id="s318">They helped us out a little bit in that synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: These people from Lublin they were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And they managed to get out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No.</span> <span id="s323">No.</span> <span id="s324">The synagogue was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s325">This was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: They didn't have to go out.</span> <span id="s328">They came there.</span> <span id="s329">They came women and the ladies.</span> <span id="s330">I had a girlfriend there what I knew and she came to help me out and had friends they came in to me to see me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So you were actually able to see what was going on in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s333">Lots of times.</span> <span id="s334">Because I was working so hard in the outside, then I was inside working for self help.</span> <span id="s335">People when they went out they were getting some foods, some bread.</span> <span id="s336">They brought it into the camp and they were bringing it over to me and I concentrated and I was going over there.</span> <span id="s337">There was a hospital.</span> <span id="s338">I would bring over food for them.</span> <span id="s339">I was given out for people what ever was poor.</span> <span id="s340">They couldn't work.</span> <span id="s341">I was giving out bread.</span> <span id="s342">It was self help.</span> <span id="s343">I was working with another one.</span> <span id="s344">Goldberg(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s345">We both worked in this in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: How did it come to pass that you were doing these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s348">I was maybe brought up like this from home.</span> <span id="s349">I was always in the organizations.</span> <span id="s350">I was belonged to Shomer ha-Za’ir when I was a youngster for the – for the organization for Israel.</span> <span id="s351">In fact, before the war I went also to a Hachshara.</span> <span id="s352">I was preparing to go to Israel and I was maybe a year and a half in that Hachshara working.</span> <span id="s353">And I was always on the side of the poor.</span> <span id="s354">I don't know – .</span> <span id="s355">somehow I – that was my nature.</span> <span id="s356">And I liked to do it, and I – I was helping people.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">01:26:31</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: But you were more than helping?</span> <span id="s359">You were the leader of these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I've always – somehow they – they gave me the leadership.</span> <span id="s361">Always as I remember there was a moment in the camp.</span> <span id="s362">There was a lot of doctors, intelligentsia was there.</span> <span id="s363">He came into the camp already when it was Jew.</span> <span id="s364">And one of the doctor, the Germans wanted him to be the leader of the camps, he came over to me and he said, "Gruber, you are the man for us.</span> <span id="s365">We want – I want you to do it.”</span> <span id="s366">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s367">Not for the Germans I wouldn't do it.”</span> <span id="s368">And I didn't want to take it.</span> <span id="s369">Another guy took it.</span> <span id="s370">But still they felt something from him that I was doing the right thing and they always gave me the leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: How did you feel about taking the leadership?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I was brought up like that because when I was in the organizations I was always there.</span> <span id="s373">I was talking to people.</span> <span id="s374">I had speeches.</span> <span id="s375">But my main subject was antisemitism.</span> <span id="s376">I remember today that I was always digging in into this, why there is antisemitism all around.</span> <span id="s377">Why the church?</span> <span id="s378">Why this?</span> <span id="s379">Why they're doing this?</span> <span id="s380">And I was always working on this.</span> <span id="s381">And people were asking me always the questions about this.</span> <span id="s382">Why there is antisemitism?</span> <span id="s383">And I told once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story.</span> <span id="s384">I was reading it or something that men – a priest asked a man to come into his church.</span> <span id="s385">He didn't see him a long time in the church.</span> <span id="s386">He said, "Why should I go to the church.</span> <span id="s387">You always talk nonsense?"</span> <span id="s388">He said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s389">Come over.</span> <span id="s390">I will have a very nice sermon.</span> <span id="s391">Come over.”</span> <span id="s392">The man came out.</span> <span id="s393">The churchman talks as a sermon about Jews.</span> <span id="s394">He said that the Jews killed Christ.</span> <span id="s395">The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes from the Jews.</span> <span id="s396">He heard a sermon against the Jews.</span> <span id="s397">The Pollack walked out and he grabbed a Jew on the street.</span> <span id="s398">They start beating him up.</span> <span id="s399">Then the church man came out, the priest came out and said, "Why do you beat this Jew?"</span> <span id="s400">He said, "What do you mean why I am beating?"</span> <span id="s401">You just told me what the Jews did.</span> <span id="s402">They killed Christ and, and all kinds of things.”</span> <span id="s403">He said, "Wait a second.</span> <span id="s404">That was 2000 years ago.</span> <span id="s405">That was a long time ago.”</span> <span id="s406">He said, "No, " to the priest.</span> <span id="s407">"You told it to me today and while you talking about this, we are listening.”</span> <span id="s408">And that's what it was.</span> <span id="s409">They were listening to the priest.</span> <span id="s410">The priest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace.</span> <span id="s411">“The Jews killed Christ.”</span> <span id="s412">But they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself.</span> <span id="s413">In Poland if you would tell a Pollack that Jesus was a Jew, he would kill you it.</span> <span id="s414">Because how can it be?</span> <span id="s415">He was God.</span> <span id="s416">And that came from the churches.</span> <span id="s417">It came this hate for the Jews.</span> <span id="s418">Next the economic situation in Poland was so that Jews were working for the big farmers.</span> <span id="s419">Jews were working for the kings.</span> <span id="s420">Jews were working, collecting taxes.</span> <span id="s421">That was their function.</span> <span id="s422">And by doing this they came in contact with the nation, with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">01:30:04</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: You had a lot of this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Experience.</span> <span id="s426">Built up in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Let's come back then to where you were when you were put into the synagogue with these 400 people, sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: These were all Jews, all workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s431">All Jews.</span> <span id="s432">Workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And this had been men who had been working on the Majdanek Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s436">And you were lying there and the doctor gave you an injection?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And then he left?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s440">And the others like I told you, 300 of them died.</span> <span id="s441">The rest of them was brought back to the camp, to the camp to….</span> <span id="s442">When I came back also, and I was a little – felt a little better, I still sit down and didn't work.</span> <span id="s443">And I had a friend of mine, his name was Henryk Szengut.</span> <span id="s444">He was a very good friend of me, and he was always with me and he was watching me all the time.</span> <span id="s445">And after a time was the leader of the camp was a Jewish fellow was named Fiszer.</span> <span id="s446">We had the whole camp.</span> <span id="s447">There was 12 camps – like 12 camps – like 12, and I was in the sixth.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s449">Let's think about the camp itself.</span> <span id="s450">You say there are 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Twelve camps and there was barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Could you describe them?</span> <span id="s453">Twelve barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, that's what I want to tell.</span> <span id="s455">Barracks were there.</span> <span id="s456">And in every barrack were maybe 100 – 120 Jews there, and every barrack had his own leader there was watching, and he was reporting to the main leader, to the Jewish official.</span> <span id="s457">Official is the leader for the camp.</span> <span id="s458">And there was two Jews there, Germans, Kapos.</span> <span id="s459">They were working for the Germans and one was Simon and the other one is – I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s460">And they were German Jews, and they were doing whatever the Germans told them.</span> <span id="s461">And the Germans – they came to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And all of the others were Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And essentially all former prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Essentially former the prisoners, essentially from the side of the Russian side because the ones what were on the side where the Germans took over, they let them go home.</span> <span id="s466">They let them go home and they wind up in ghettos and camps and all this.</span> <span id="s467">But the group that remained there in this was from the Russian side because they don’t – they didn't have where to go.</span> <span id="s468">We supposed to be changed for prisoner of wars from Russia to Germany, but the war broke out and it stopped it.</span> <span id="s469">They were changing some in the beginning, but then it stopped and we were stuck in Lublin in Lipowa Seven.</span> <span id="s470">Now, I saw what's going on there and –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">01:32:59</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What was going on there that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I mean they were killing people for the – for the smallest thing.</span> <span id="s474">They were – a lot of those people went out to work.</span> <span id="s475">When they came back, they brought a piece of bread or they brought some shoes sometimes.</span> <span id="s476">Some a piece of clothing or something from the Pollacks.</span> <span id="s477">They were – they were dealing in – with them.</span> <span id="s478">They give money what they had – dealing with them.</span> <span id="s479">And when they caught them – the Germans, they were watching by the entrance –they caught them, they were hanging, killing.</span> <span id="s480">Just for a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Who were they hanging and killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: The prisoners – us.</span> <span id="s483">The prisoners.</span> <span id="s484">When they came from work and they had a piece of bread and they found it and they killed you for this.</span> <span id="s485">They just – they had a hanging place and they were hanging.</span> <span id="s486">Especially they were killing if somebody run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What happened if somebody run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: If somebody run away, they caught him.</span> <span id="s489">Usually they caught.</span> <span id="s490">They caught two of them and they took out the whole camp there one night and they were hanging him publicly like everybody should see.</span> <span id="s491">They woke us up in the middle of the night and everybody came out naked almost and it wasn't even – they told them to take off.</span> <span id="s492">Everybody was half naked outside and was February, I think – the beginning of March cold.</span> <span id="s493">Terribly.</span> <span id="s494">And a lot of us got pneumonia.</span> <span id="s495">We caught cold.</span> <span id="s496">And on top of this when they told us to go back to the barrack, they was standing in the door and whoever walked in they beat them how much they could.</span> <span id="s497">Every one of us, we all got beating.</span> <span id="s498">I was just behind a man who start crying, "Don't hit me.</span> <span id="s499">I have – I have home children, a wife.</span> <span id="s500">Don't hit me.”</span> <span id="s501">The Germans said, "Yes, I have a child – wife and children too, and I have to stay here with you and watch you, you stinking Jew.”</span> <span id="s502">And he hit him more even.</span> <span id="s503">When he hit him the more, I jumped over and he didn't touch me.</span> <span id="s504">He came in and I went in first.</span> <span id="s505">But my luck was that they send me over to work in a special hospital.</span> <span id="s506">In a hospital, they had there a barrack from the prisoners of war, about 20 of us or 24 – I don't remember.</span> <span id="s507">And we were working for the Germans, not SS, for the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s508">And usually every night we went to the – back to the barracks normal but then they built for us barracks and we was sleeping there and getting food there and we were working there.</span> <span id="s509">And I worked in a magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Go back to a point you made.</span> <span id="s511">You said, "My luck.”</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: My luck was I meant the Fisher remember me.</span> <span id="s513">He knew that I am – that I cannot work hard.</span> <span id="s514">And he sent me out there, there I was sitting like a office, and I was writing down – if somebody came from the front, Germans came from the front and they needed or they have to give back uniforms, rifles, pistols, everything – I was registering this.</span> <span id="s515">Everything!</span> <span id="s516">And I had maybe 10 of my prisoners of war prisoners.</span> <span id="s517">They took it away from me and they were sorting it and keeping it.</span> <span id="s518">When the people went back to the front, they gave it back.</span> <span id="s519">But most of them didn't.</span> <span id="s520">And while they had their pistols and rifles, I start stealing rifles and pistols there from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">01:36:45</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: How is it possible that you were able to steal rifles?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I was more or less left alone in the office.</span> <span id="s524">I don't know if he had some kind of confidences.</span> <span id="s525">German was the head of this.</span> <span id="s526">He was like a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s527">He spoke Polish and he spoke German, and I think he was doing – and now as I think, I'm sure he was dealing with my people, not with me.</span> <span id="s528">Me, he told I should write down that I gave out to the Germans more than they took.</span> <span id="s529">Let's say I gave them a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s530">I put I gave the man shoes and pants and a jacket and all this.</span> <span id="s531">And he took away the difference what I wrote down.</span> <span id="s532">I gave out shoes.</span> <span id="s533">I put down the shoes, and the difference he took away the jacket and the pants and he was dealing with – with my people and they were selling them to the population somehow.</span> <span id="s534">Because being in the hospital the Pollacks had entrance to us more.</span> <span id="s535">We were not in a ghetto no more.</span> <span id="s536">We had open doors there.</span> <span id="s537">We could go in and out.</span> <span id="s538">Then they were dealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You could go in and out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Of the hospital.</span> <span id="s541">Yes.</span> <span id="s542">We were watched more or less, but it's – it was easier.</span> <span id="s543">In fact, every day I went back to the camp to collect food for the group because I was like the leader of the group there.</span> <span id="s544">I remained like a leader.</span> <span id="s545">I was, I was going for food.</span> <span id="s546">I went to the camp with a German with a wagon.</span> <span id="s547">He brought me over there.</span> <span id="s548">We collected food for the people.</span> <span id="s549">We didn't need it.</span> <span id="s550">In fact, once I gave it away.</span> <span id="s551">To the camp I left it.</span> <span id="s552">And one of the Germans saw it, and he called me over to the head of the camp there, was Mohwinkel He said, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s553">You stealing bread from your comrades and you give it away to the others.”</span> <span id="s554">And he beat me up over the head with peitsche.</span> <span id="s555">This guy Fisher saw – came just then, and he saw that he is beating me, and he said, "Leave him alone.</span> <span id="s556">I will take care of it.</span> <span id="s557">I will give him a beating.</span> <span id="s558">You leave him alone.”</span> <span id="s559">And Fisher just kicked me and threw me away you know and he said, “Just go back to the camp.”</span> <span id="s560">He did that special, you know, to this.</span> <span id="s561">And in the camp I had contact with Pollacks.</span> <span id="s562">I worked with Polish prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s563">I worked with the Germans there.</span> <span id="s564">I worked with women there.</span> <span id="s565">It was a big hospital there.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What do you mean when you say you worked with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Let say, I worked there and they – they worked – they – they and let's say something was ripped or something, they were sewing or they were in the kitchen working.</span> <span id="s568">They was an administration there from Polish people and the Germans.</span> <span id="s569">The Germans were on top and the Pollacks were working there.</span> <span id="s570">And I was talking to them.</span> <span id="s571">We were more free there.</span> <span id="s572">Inside we were talking.</span> <span id="s573">And then came over to me a man.</span> <span id="s574">His name was Paul.</span> <span id="s575">Paul.</span> <span id="s576">I don't remember the second name, and he said to me, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s577">," he said, “Why don't you run away?"</span></p> <p><span id="s578">01:40:02</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What kind of a man was this Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s581">I didn't – I was afraid of the Pollacks altogether, you know, and especially a man comes over to me and tells me a story I should run away and he knew when I will run away that they will kill 20 people.</span> <span id="s582">The whole group will be killed because for that l man – they told the Germans that.</span> <span id="s583">“If one man runs away, we kill 20, we kill 50 whatever we feel like we will kill because one man runs away.”</span> <span id="s584">And I told them the story.</span> <span id="s585">Said, "Listen, they will kill a lot of people if I run away.”</span> <span id="s586">He said, "Try to get out how many you can because everyone of you will be killed.</span> <span id="s587">In the camp, in the ghettos they will kill everybody.”</span> <span id="s588">I said, "How do you know it?"</span> <span id="s589">He said, "I am a partisan.</span> <span id="s590">I'm a fighter.”</span> <span id="s591">"I sit here," he said, "to work, but I have connection with the woods.</span> <span id="s592">I know a lot of people already out in the woods and they're fighting the Germans and I know some Jews and even from your camps, they run away.</span> <span id="s593">And I knew that's two or three run away, and they are in the woods.</span> <span id="s594">They have horses already there.</span> <span id="s595">They have rifles.”</span> <span id="s596">He said, "There is a army," he said.</span> <span id="s597">I couldn't believe it in the beginning and I decided to stay, but still it was very important.</span> <span id="s598">And like I told you before, I was a believer.</span> <span id="s599">I believed that Hitler will kill everybody.</span> <span id="s600">I believed.</span> <span id="s601">I was reading before the war even what he was doing to people, and I believed that he will kill.</span> <span id="s602">And I went out.</span> <span id="s603">When I came every Saturday or Sunday – I can't remember when I went for the food – I connect myself with the people, the people whom I knew and I was talking to them, "People, Let's run away.</span> <span id="s604">They will kill us, all of us.”</span> <span id="s605">A lot of them were listening to me.</span> <span id="s606">And a lot of them said, "Forget it.</span> <span id="s607">Who?</span> <span id="s608">The Germans?</span> <span id="s609">People like the Germans.</span> <span id="s610">They are cultural people.</span> <span id="s611">The biggest culture in the world.</span> <span id="s612">They will kill people – prisoners of war, especially.</span> <span id="s613">Forget it?</span> <span id="s614">Anyway, where will you go?</span> <span id="s615">In the woods there.</span> <span id="s616">The Pollacks are not so keen to see us, and here is at least they give us some food.</span> <span id="s617">They gave us some cover to sleep in the night.</span> <span id="s618">We will live through the war like this.”</span> <span id="s619">And I was very sorry for one man specially.</span> <span id="s620">He was a very good friend.</span> <span id="s621">He was a lawyer and I was begging him, plain begging him, "Come with me.</span> <span id="s622">Run away.”</span> <span id="s623">He said, “No, no, no.</span> <span id="s624">I can't.”</span> <span id="s625">But I persuaded 22 people and told them that I am running away, and I came over to this Pollack and – after a few months.</span> <span id="s626">It wasn't right away.</span> <span id="s627">I was finding out if he tells the truth and how he behaves and all this.</span> <span id="s628">I was watching very carefully.</span> <span id="s629">And we made a meeting in town.</span> <span id="s630">I had a meeting with him and two real partisans.</span> <span id="s631">People from the woods came over and in a restaurant, a Jewish restaurant – it was still a Jewish restaurant in the ghetto, and he gave me a compass.</span> <span id="s632">He gave me a map, and he gave me directions and where to run and how to run and where to meet.</span> <span id="s633">And we run away on October the 28th, 1942.</span> <span id="s634">We decided to run away.</span> <span id="s635">We talked to these 22 people.</span> <span id="s636">Everyone of them knew their locations, where he was to go.</span> <span id="s637">In separate places there everybody had to go.</span> <span id="s638">The going was still good.</span> <span id="s639">That means we could get out somehow.</span> <span id="s640">We could persuade the Germans we have to go out because later on I know after this nobody could get out.</span> <span id="s641">But it was still a possibility to get out of at least to town you know, to–</span></p> <p><span id="s642">01:44:12</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Well, let's take for example how you got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: That's what I mean.</span> <span id="s645">I still – I went out.</span> <span id="s646">I said, “I'm going to camp for food.”</span> <span id="s647">I told the German I am going to the camp.</span> <span id="s648">And I was the leader and I had the right to go.</span> <span id="s649">I had a white band, band there, I was Kolonneführer and I had the right to go out.</span> <span id="s650">And instead to go over there to the camp I – I started to go in the direction where he told me to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: That was walking where?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Walking through Lublin to the town and on the outskirts of Lublin, and one thing I didn't mention in my book that I – when I walked came in two gendarmes, two police on horses, and I saluted them and they didn't say nothing to me and I was shaking like a leaf.</span> <span id="s653">I was sure this is it.</span> <span id="s654">And somehow they let – they let me through and I – I went through town and walked straight by myself to the woods where I knew my two people were waiting for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s656">Let's slow down again.</span> <span id="s657">I'd like to go back for a minute to something you said earlier.</span> <span id="s658">You said that while you were in the hospital, you were taking rifles and guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you were doing with these rifles and guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Right.</span> <span id="s662">We had there a man, today he is in Israel, his name is Weingarten.</span> <span id="s663">He had some kind of connection outside with Jewish people, with Pollacks.</span> <span id="s664">He was selling.</span> <span id="s665">I don't know really.</span> <span id="s666">I was always giving him the rifles.</span> <span id="s667">I myself kept one pistol and ammunition.</span> <span id="s668">I kept myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Where did you keep it?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I kept it behind my bed.</span> <span id="s671">I kept it – I didn't keep it a long time, but almost by the end.</span> <span id="s672">About three, four days before, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: What did you think was happening with all of these rifles?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: They wind up in the hands of the Polish partisans.</span> <span id="s675">They came there.</span> <span id="s676">But I – I don't know.</span> <span id="s677">He told me he made some money on this too I think through this Weingarten.</span> <span id="s678">He gave away a few pistols and rifles.</span> <span id="s679">But I myself before I went away – came to me – I had one man, Jegier.</span> <span id="s680">He was later the leader and he said to me, "We wanted to buy by the Pollacks some rifles and ammunition to buy and we had money for this.”</span> <span id="s681">And the last minute they refused and we don't have.</span> <span id="s682">Not one rifle, not one pistol, nothing.</span> <span id="s683">And they took our money too.</span> <span id="s684">And he said, this Jegier said, "What shall we do now?</span> <span id="s685">I don't think I will run away now.</span> <span id="s686">Without nothing, what will we do now in the woods without.”</span> <span id="s687">I said, "Jegier, you do whatever what you want.</span> <span id="s688">I am going.</span> <span id="s689">I decided and you please tell your people they should go because I am going.”</span> <span id="s690">And somehow Jegier and 22 of them, they all came on time.</span> <span id="s691">Six o'clock, like a clock or was it seven o'clock because it was darkness already on October the 28th, and we met all of us we met by the two Pollacks and there start a new other odyssey, started new chapter in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">01:47:57</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s694">Let's take a minute before we go onto the new chapter to think about another aspect of your life in the camp for you.</span> <span id="s695">You were maintaining your contact with your family all through this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Right up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: How – did you have any thoughts about where you're going to be a, a year from then, a month from then?</span> <span id="s700">Did you have any thoughts about your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Who could think about a future there?</span> <span id="s702">You lived day by day.</span> <span id="s703">We saw what is going on, and every one of us was feeling that after tomorrow he will not be there.</span> <span id="s704">Nobody could think.</span> <span id="s705">But I remember one thing what I did.</span> <span id="s706">It was not legal.</span> <span id="s707">I sent a letter through a girl there.</span> <span id="s708">All the mail what we sent home or wherever went through a censor and my letter I gave to a Polish girl and she took it with her, and somehow, they caught the Polish girl with my letter.</span> <span id="s709">In this letter – I remember like today – I said, "I'm running away,” and I told my family, "Run away.</span> <span id="s710">Nobody will live.</span> <span id="s711">Run, because the Germans will kill everybody.”</span> <span id="s712">And the Germans caught this letter and I'm lucky, lucky it was a Wehrmacht, not SS, and this guy beat me up and beat up this girl and didn't gave the letter to the SS.</span> <span id="s713">Otherwise I wouldn't live till then to run away.</span> <span id="s714">This was – that – and that's the circumstances we were living.</span> <span id="s715">Day by day we didn't know if today is one killed or another.</span> <span id="s716">But it was an interesting story there.</span> <span id="s717">When we were building the Majdanek, that this Dolp.</span> <span id="s718">I said, in the beginning, the officer, he was supervising the work there, and one of our Jewish boys – .</span> <span id="s719">he was from Tarnopol, I don't remember his name, and he didn't like his work.</span> <span id="s720">The – Dolp didn't like how he worked and they started beating him up.</span> <span id="s721">This Jewish boy threw himself on this Dolp and start fighting with him, fist fighting.</span> <span id="s722">He fought with him, but he had a pistol or something and he hit him, the Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s723">And he started bleeding and they took him, and interesting, they didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s724">They took him away to a hospital, and they kept him there.</span> <span id="s725">The Germans kept him there for a long time until he healed.</span> <span id="s726">When he was healed, they took him out and Dolp said, "He's mine.”</span> <span id="s727">He told him, "Run away now in the field.”</span> <span id="s728">He told him, "Run.”</span> <span id="s729">He ran and, and he killed him.</span> <span id="s730">That was this, but he was a hero this guy.</span> <span id="s731">He fought with him.</span> <span id="s732">In the beginning, he was really fighting.</span> <span id="s733">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s734">I'm sorry I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: It's not usual for prisoners –</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: It was impossible.</span> <span id="s737">Not prisoners – nobody, nobody dared to, to fight with the German because they were killing.</span> <span id="s738">Right away, before you even start – before – but somehow he was fighting him.</span> <span id="s739">He didn't kill him right away.</span> <span id="s740">But then he hit him.</span> <span id="s741">He didn't shoot him.</span> <span id="s742">He hit him hard.</span> <span id="s743">That was interesting.</span> <span id="s744">But then he shot him when he told him to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">01:51:37</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You mentioned partisans before.</span> <span id="s747">How did you learn about partisan activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Partisan activities I told you this man – this Pole told me what is going on.</span> <span id="s749">They're running away.</span> <span id="s750">Pollacks and Jews are running away and they form an army.</span> <span id="s751">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s752">In, in my mind, it was a army again because I was in the army before I was in Hachshara.</span> <span id="s753">I was always like in a scout and this was in my mind, it will be like the army.</span> <span id="s754">It is not a partisans, I have no idea what it is.</span> <span id="s755">And when we came these two guys start leading us, starting showing us what to do, how to do.</span> <span id="s756">And the first thing we went through a water.</span> <span id="s757">We had to _______, a small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us how to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side.</span> <span id="s758">And then they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said – there was not far a river – and he said, "Here we will make a camp.</span> <span id="s759">In the night – we will go every night,” we were 22 people, “On – 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going with…,” Kaganowicz was the other guy – he was a leader too.</span> <span id="s760">“We will go – 11 people we will go into the farmers in the night.”</span> <span id="s761">I had the map, I had the compass and every night we went to another village there around the woods.</span> <span id="s762">Not far.</span> <span id="s763">And we walked in, and the Pollack went with us, one of them and one went with the other.</span> <span id="s764">And they knocked on the window in the night and they said, "We are fighters for Poland," into the windows because people were scared.</span> <span id="s765">They woke up in the middle of the night and there's people with – with rifles or whatever.</span> <span id="s766">Nobody had a rifle.</span> <span id="s767">Nobody nothing.</span> <span id="s768">You know what we did.</span> <span id="s769">We took some wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol.</span> <span id="s770">And I speak very good Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said – because most of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish.</span> <span id="s771">They spoke Yiddish most of them and half Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school.</span> <span id="s772">And I came over and I said, "I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom.</span> <span id="s773">We don't want nothing from you.</span> <span id="s774">Just give us some food and we will go away.</span> <span id="s775">Some milk, bread.”</span> <span id="s776">We were always taking some bread for the people for another 11 people back.</span> <span id="s777">And that was happening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already around this, we said, "Let's go somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s778">And we start moving.</span> <span id="s779">And then Pollacks then too said, "Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you.</span> <span id="s780">They will kill us.</span> <span id="s781">Any day the – the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us all.”</span> <span id="s782">"Give us – you have some money.</span> <span id="s783">You have some money or something?</span> <span id="s784">Give it to me and we will go out back to Lublin and we will buy some rifles or get some pistols or whatever.”</span> <span id="s785">And they walked – they took everything what we had and they walked away from us.</span> <span id="s786">And I don't see them till today.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know what really happened.</span> <span id="s788">If they were caught or something like that, but we never heard from them.</span> <span id="s789">And then we were on our own.</span> <span id="s790">And then we start moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">01:55:29</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Okay, before we start moving on again, we're going to take a minute now and relax and change the tape and start up again.</span> <span id="s793">So you've done beautifully.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: So far, alright?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So far, better than alright.</span> <span id="s798">My camera man is just fascinated.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: What does he say?</span> <span id="s800">Interesting or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">01:55:53 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s803">01:59:53</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the point where there were 22 of you, who had gone into the forest with the two Polish partisans.</span> <span id="s805">You told us that the partisans then took your money, your belongings, left, went back into the city and – never to be seen again.</span> <span id="s806">This left you with 21 other men.</span> <span id="s807">Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you saw yourself there with 22 – 21 other men, facing an unknown situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: It was a very, very hard situation, we – also we were already on the last few days in the woods.</span> <span id="s809">But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to the farmers, they helped with this.</span> <span id="s810">Because the farmers, we knew, didn’t like Jews specifically.</span> <span id="s811">That’s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish – Mieczyslaw and short is Mietek.</span> <span id="s812">And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they shouldn’t – also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group, almost everybody knew, but we didn’t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers to say that Jews.</span> <span id="s813">And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew doesn’t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn’t – he’s different than all of them.</span> <span id="s814">The difference what meant a lot, that they, they – some of them they didn’t see a Jew, but they told them the story about this.</span> <span id="s815">Then, this reminds me when I was in Germany.</span> <span id="s816">One day they took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took me home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl.</span> <span id="s817">And I was talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me, she’s talks to me.</span> <span id="s818">Then she starts talking about Jews, “Because of the Jews the war broke out.</span> <span id="s819">Because of the Jews the – this, this, this.”</span> <span id="s820">I asked her a plain question, “Did you ever saw a Jew?”</span> <span id="s821">She said, “No, I never saw.”</span> <span id="s822">I said, “How you know what it is?”</span> <span id="s823">She said “Hitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this.</span> <span id="s824">And they have horns,” she said, “they have horns.</span> <span id="s825">Jews have horns.”</span> <span id="s826">I said, “Listen darling, I am a Jews and I have no horns.”</span> <span id="s827">She almost died.</span> <span id="s828">I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and she – she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this – and she came back and said, "You are lying to me.</span> <span id="s829">That's impossible," she said.</span> <span id="s830">“You couldn't be it.”</span> <span id="s831">I was a good looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s832">And that was the, the image of the Jews.</span> <span id="s833">It was only – they didn't know even, who a Jew is.</span> <span id="s834">But the image of a Jew was, for them, something that – terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a Jew is not a normal person.</span> <span id="s835">That is what they –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">02:03:54</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: That's a interesting story.</span> <span id="s838">We will get to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: That's why I came to the farmers when we came.</span> <span id="s840">The Pollacks helped us out and they, they were the front, and now we had to be the front and I was the front always because I spoke very good Polish and I always came in and like I told before, I was introducing myself and I told them why I was here.</span> <span id="s841">Then, when we exhausted the neighborhood, we started moving away from there.</span> <span id="s842">But before we moved, we had a problem.</span> <span id="s843">We had a boy with us from Majdanek, and this boy run away from Majdanek in a special way.</span> <span id="s844">He jumped in – they took out the, the – I don't know how to tell it in English, from the, from the horses, the, the–</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Manure.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Manure.</span> <span id="s847">And he jumped in into this.</span> <span id="s848">And the farmer didn't see him and he was almost choked to death there but he – he came out from there with a horse manure from Majdanek.</span> <span id="s849">It was almost impossible to get out from that.</span> <span id="s850">He came out from there.</span> <span id="s851">And somehow the Pollacks from the Underground, they brought him over to me.</span> <span id="s852">And he got typhus.</span> <span id="s853">He became sick in the woods.</span> <span id="s854">We put him in, in our – in a hole somewhere.</span> <span id="s855">They covered him up because it was cold already in October.</span> <span id="s856">And we kept him like this and from himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better.</span> <span id="s857">In meantime, we were 22 people, and three of our people said, "That's enough.”</span> <span id="s858">They don't want to go run like this.</span> <span id="s859">“It is no use.</span> <span id="s860">They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life.</span> <span id="s861">I'd rather go in a camp where I have a soup and they gave me some work to do.</span> <span id="s862">The Germans will not kill.”</span> <span id="s863">And three of our people went back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">02:05:56</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: How do you feel about their leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: It was a terrible shock to me.</span> <span id="s867">I couldn't believe it because we went through so much by running away, and they jeopardized other people and all this, and they, they knew about this, but you can't judge people.</span> <span id="s868">You don't know.</span> <span id="s869">Everybody has his own mind, and it was very hard.</span> <span id="s870">The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s871">I was really scared.</span> <span id="s872">I didn't know where I am.</span> <span id="s873">When I came in, I saw the woods.</span> <span id="s874">It, it was a special wind blowing from the woods with a noise, the Pollack said, "Here, this will be your home now.”</span> <span id="s875">To walk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the woods and in the woods, it was – the animals were making a lot of noise and it – and I came from a, from a town, nothing – a village and it was scary.</span> <span id="s876">And one of them trees was something broken.</span> <span id="s877">It made so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like that or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he cut it off and he showed that was only a tree making the noise.</span> <span id="s878">But we were really scared.</span> <span id="s879">We didn't know what, what to expect there.</span> <span id="s880">You don't know where you are.</span> <span id="s881">In fact, we really didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were Germans living.</span> <span id="s882">There they had a garrison.</span> <span id="s883">They lived there, and they were watching their mill.</span> <span id="s884">There was there a big one.</span> <span id="s885">But we didn't know.</span> <span id="s886">We didn't know for nothing.</span> <span id="s887">We were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back and forth.</span> <span id="s888">And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and the Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">02:08:03 Then we went away and after a night, or two nights– I don't remember exactly how it was – by walking from one place to the other, only by map.</span> <span id="s890">Only by a compass and a map.</span> <span id="s891">We didn't ask nobody.</span> <span id="s892">In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the woods and we stopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices.</span> <span id="s893">We heard something like Yiddish, spoken and I said, "This is something.”</span> <span id="s894">And we over near one or two of us, the rest was standing on the side, and we start screaming, "amkha."</span> <span id="s895">Means “your people.”</span> <span id="s896">And right away from the other side answered voice, "amkha.”</span> <span id="s897">And to our amazing we found a whole group of people who had run away from a village.</span> <span id="s898">This was maybe – they called a town Markuszow, what they called it, a village Markuszow.</span> <span id="s899">The whole town of there was maybe 100 people or whatever run away from this camp.</span> <span id="s900">And they all came to the woods.</span> <span id="s901">And there were ladies and men and children, a camp.</span> <span id="s902">And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp, from a prisoners of war camp.</span> <span id="s903">They run away from a Russian camp.</span> <span id="s904">They run away.</span> <span id="s905">One was Kolka – one was Mikoi – Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two men there.</span> <span id="s906">One was a officer and the other was a sergeant or something from the Russian army.</span> <span id="s907">And when they saw us– we came in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war – oh, he got so excited and he – they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw they were building bunkers.</span> <span id="s908">You know what a bunker is?</span> <span id="s909">They were building in the land – they were building some hiding places there, and they put up trees or grass.</span> <span id="s910">They covered everything and they were living down in this hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">02:10:18</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Why don't you take a minute and tell us about what these bunkers really did look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: They are bunker, bunker was interesting this.</span> <span id="s914">I, I can't shake it from me because I hated the bunkers, as to me it looked like a grave.</span> <span id="s915">You go in a graveyard right there, cause they had a door in the front where you walked in from the side, and the top it was like grass.</span> <span id="s916">You didn't see nothing on top.</span> <span id="s917">It was woods there around and trees and everything and dug.</span> <span id="s918">They dig into the, into the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: How far down did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Far.</span> <span id="s921">There was for a 20 people here.</span> <span id="s922">And one, one bunker was for 40 people.</span> <span id="s923">Far, big and it was two entrances.</span> <span id="s924">One for them to walk in and one to walk out.</span> <span id="s925">Far away to walk out.</span> <span id="s926">Took a long, long time and when they built, they built it open you know.</span> <span id="s927">Then they take woods.</span> <span id="s928">They put on top and they covered it.</span> <span id="s929">And when it was raining, rain came in – still not all the way, but it came in still someway.</span> <span id="s930">When I saw this, I said, "No, not for me.</span> <span id="s931">I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in – then the Germans will come in, and it's very easy to get all of us.”</span> <span id="s932">And I said, "No.</span> <span id="s933">I will not stay here.”</span> <span id="s934">And I told this Tolka and said, "It's not for me.”</span> <span id="s935">He said, "If you want to stay.”</span> <span id="s936">He said, "I have children and I have women.</span> <span id="s937">I have people.</span> <span id="s938">Where will – what will I do with them?"</span> <span id="s939">They have to be placed somewhere and hidden.</span> <span id="s940">They said, "Okay, we will be around you and we will work with you.”</span> <span id="s941">But then he says, "Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he knows because all of them come from towns and they're children and they don't know what army is, what soldiers is, what it is.</span> <span id="s942">Give me a few people of yours.”</span> <span id="s943">And they will teach, start learning them the skill of the army.</span> <span id="s944">And I said, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s945">And I left Jegier, Cygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left with Tolka.</span> <span id="s946">And they were, they were starting working with him.</span> <span id="s947">I went away.</span> <span id="s948">But we kept contact all the time.</span> <span id="s949">We – through other farmers – how it happened, Tolka had already connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">02:12:57 He came to a town, Garbów and in this town was a man.</span> <span id="s951">His name was Kaminski, Genek Kaminski.</span> <span id="s952">This was a known and this Genek was something what we have to thank a lot.</span> <span id="s953">He was – I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know what – and he belonged to a group of people and he had some people there working against the Germans.</span> <span id="s954">And this Tolka brought me over to him.</span> <span id="s955">He introduced me to him.</span> <span id="s956">And we start working from this, this was our like headquarters.</span> <span id="s957">This Tolka had connections with the real partisans – not partisans special, but with the heads of the partisans.</span> <span id="s958">He had connections with the A.L..</span> <span id="s959">This was army in Armia Ludowa.</span> <span id="s960">There was a Gomulka and there was a Moczar, and there was Zymierski and there were all the heads of Poland which were later on the Polish government, and he had some connections with these people.</span> <span id="s961">And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of them, too.</span> <span id="s962">But we lost – we became appointed with Genek.</span> <span id="s963">In the nights we came to him, and he was taking care of us now.</span> <span id="s964">He was sending us out for special work.</span> <span id="s965">He told us which farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, "Go to this farmer and tell him he should give you a rifle.</span> <span id="s966">If he doesn't, you do whatever you feel like because he has it.”</span> <span id="s967">And we did.</span> <span id="s968">And with the help –</span></p> <p><span id="s969">02:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: When you say, you did – could you describe one such action?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: We came, we came – first of all, we needed always help now from this Markuszow people.</span> <span id="s972">We were in touch with them.</span> <span id="s973">They had Jegier with them and he was teaching.</span> <span id="s974">And we were taking out some of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they were going with us also.</span> <span id="s975">First of all, they knew the terrain.</span> <span id="s976">They know where to go.</span> <span id="s977">And we were strangers.</span> <span id="s978">We were not from this neighborhood, and this was very, very important.</span> <span id="s979">They knew every piece, every house, every farmer, every – they, they knew everything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us.</span> <span id="s980">Especially was one of them guys a young fellow was Franek Bleichman.</span> <span id="s981">He came from another town.</span> <span id="s982">We met also.</span> <span id="s983">He wasn't from this town from– what's name – Markuszow.</span> <span id="s984">He was from Kamionka, a small town.</span> <span id="s985">And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish people– young, youngsters.</span> <span id="s986">He was maybe 18, 19 years.</span> <span id="s987">He wasn't a army man too, but he was very shrewd and he was – he knew the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s988">His father, I think, was dealing with farmers or something and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s989">And this Bleichman became very handy to us and he was always helping us, going when we needed in the night for a – certain things.</span> <span id="s990">Because this Tolka – no, Genek Kaminski, he gave us orders now already.</span> <span id="s991">He told us, "Go in this and this place and there is – a train going through.”</span> <span id="s992">And we took axes and very primitive things, shovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail.</span> <span id="s993">A train will come.</span> <span id="s994">It will fell off from this.</span> <span id="s995">And the first action was – the train was right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s996">And we came off – I remember I had a very strong man.</span> <span id="s997">Zelazny was his name, zelazny means iron.</span> <span id="s998">And we called him “Zelazny,” because he was so strong, and he, he ripped out with those – almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still – he ripped it out but it was staying still.</span> <span id="s999">He didn't – he didn't take it away.</span> <span id="s1000">And with axes, we were working there for hours until we heard a train coming.</span> <span id="s1001">A train coming, and we stay away and the train stopped.</span> <span id="s1002">It stopped there because when the train saw that something was missing or something later, the train stopped.</span> <span id="s1003">But it disrupt already maybe a whole night and a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what – some ammunition to the front.</span> <span id="s1004">It was on the way from Lublin to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1005">This, this was the spot.</span> <span id="s1006">And we disrupted already this.</span> <span id="s1007">Its – but we couldn't stay there too long, because we were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this and this.</span> <span id="s1008">He was very happy, and this gave us some kind of a lift.</span> <span id="s1009">“Oh, we can do things!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">02:18:32 Then he sent us out on the highways.</span> <span id="s1011">We put up a metal string to the highways.</span> <span id="s1012">When a car came, it had to stop.</span> <span id="s1013">We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them.</span> <span id="s1014">We had a few rifles already from the farmers what we took.</span> <span id="s1015">But interesting was this.</span> <span id="s1016">One of our man – his name was Finkel – went back to the camp where I was working and there was another hospital too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were – what's the name – other things, what do you need?</span> <span id="s1017">Coats, because when I ran out I couldn't take nothing with me.</span> <span id="s1018">It was still warm.</span> <span id="s1019">Nobody has a – nobody had a coat with him.</span> <span id="s1020">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1021">It start to be cold, so we were shivering cold.</span> <span id="s1022">And we sent out this Finkel.</span> <span id="s1023">He did – didn't look like a Jew completely.</span> <span id="s1024">He was looking like a Pollack.</span> <span id="s1025">And he went back to the camp and he organized there another 20 people.</span> <span id="s1026">But this time they took a German and they told him – they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were help – dealing with them Germans there.</span> <span id="s1027">They told him, "You see and look.</span> <span id="s1028">Don't say nothing.”</span> <span id="s1029">And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name – covers and bed spreads and all kinds of things, a full truck, and he was dealing with them before – robbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had – Finkel knew where we will be there in the woods.</span> <span id="s1030">He made a an appointment with him, and he brought over the whole truck with maybe about 20 rifles.</span> <span id="s1031">New ones, German ones.</span> <span id="s1032">Completely new ones!</span> <span id="s1033">And he brought it over to us on the spot.</span> <span id="s1034">The German, that was one of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name.</span> <span id="s1035">He said to the German, "You go back and shut up.</span> <span id="s1036">Don't say one word, you know us.</span> <span id="s1037">You saw nothing, because they will kill you, or we will kill you.</span> <span id="s1038">Then just don't say nothing.”</span> <span id="s1039">"No, I will not say nothing," and let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">02:20:54</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: That's an incredible story.</span> <span id="s1042">How, in fact, did Finkel arrange to–</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Finkel went back too, because he knew the place.</span> <span id="s1044">He was living there before, and he knew how to get in.</span> <span id="s1045">And he walked into the people there in the hospital there and he contacted himself with this group, and the people Dworecki was there like a Mikoi the whole group, about 20 people.</span> <span id="s1046">And he talked to them.</span> <span id="s1047">He was there two, three days.</span> <span id="s1048">We knew what is it – we will be like this two, three days and we had a appointment with him to come back on this and this spot.</span> <span id="s1049">And he – they knew – he knew that they are dealing with this German too.</span> <span id="s1050">He knew always, of course, because he was dealing with this German, too.</span> <span id="s1051">And they took out whatever they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: But to deal, you needed money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: No.</span> <span id="s1054">You needed money if you would buy it, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s1055">They told them – they took out a pistol from the – and they said to this German, "You go back.</span> <span id="s1056">No money for you.</span> <span id="s1057">You just thank God for your life and get back and don't say nothing to nobody.”</span> <span id="s1058">And he went back and we had the rifles.</span> <span id="s1059">I received – I remember a German coat I put on and a hat – the German I put on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: And I felt, I felt in two ways.</span> <span id="s1062">First of all, I got warmer because it was very, very cold, but I felt very bad that I have to wear a uniform from a German.</span> <span id="s1063">That was always inconceivable.</span> <span id="s1064">This was something what – goodness!</span> <span id="s1065">But we felt proud for the whole situation what we did because this was nobody could accomplish a thing like this.</span> <span id="s1066">This was a big accomplishment to bring 20 rifles, new ones, on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">02:22:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Now, you had a small army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: We had a small army.</span> <span id="s1070">We had already this and we told this Tolka all of them.</span> <span id="s1071">We told them what we have now and what is.</span> <span id="s1072">Everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s1073">We start doing real work.</span> <span id="s1074">We start going out for the Germans on the highways.</span> <span id="s1075">Then we start the towns.</span> <span id="s1076">Every town had a town house, and in this town house they were registering everybody and when you were registering the people, the Germans were using it.</span> <span id="s1077">One second, I have to drink.</span> <span id="s1078">The Germans registered almost every young Pollack.</span> <span id="s1079">They registered even the Jews, whatever the registration in the – in the town house.</span> <span id="s1080">We got our order to recover this, to fight and to burn it out, ruin it that they shouldn't have the registrations from the people there because they took it away to Germany.</span> <span id="s1081">They took it away to work.</span> <span id="s1082">They have a register.</span> <span id="s1083">They came up home, and they took up the kids and we start burning up the towns.</span> <span id="s1084">Every town house there, and Markuszow was the first we knew where to go.</span> <span id="s1085">We always used the people what were from there from this town, say from Markuszow say from ” • and other towns where they have – we had the people what run away from them villages.</span> <span id="s1086">And they were together with us then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: But now, how was it possible for you and your small army to burn down a building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: It was, it was very easy.</span> <span id="s1089">We took some straw and we threw in straw and made a fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Nobody saw you enter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: They saw, and they didn't say.</span> <span id="s1092">Some people – the Pollacks they saw, they were afraid of us because we came with rifles and then they – it was night.</span> <span id="s1093">Always in the night we were doing it.</span> <span id="s1094">And we were burning.</span> <span id="s1095">It was very, very easy for us.</span> <span id="s1096">We would – except once we had in Markuszow we had some going over.</span> <span id="s1097">The Germans were there, and – but before, before we came in the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s1098">And by accident, they saw our people and we had to fight with them.</span> <span id="s1099">And we still burned down.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a whole story.</span> <span id="s1101">Is a very long story.</span> <span id="s1102">And we still burned down the village.</span> <span id="s1103">But we had losses there.</span> <span id="s1104">One was killed, and one was Zelazny the strongest guy what we had had still today, still today had a piece of iron from the bullet was in him, staying there.</span> <span id="s1105">Didn't come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">02:25:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: During this action as you described, what was your responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: I was the leader.</span> <span id="s1109">As I was going with them, people, first of all, this not like in other armies.</span> <span id="s1110">A partisan, the leader had to go front.</span> <span id="s1111">That was our – I don't know why, but we took over the – a leader was in the front, and the soldiers were behind.</span> <span id="s1112">Here I think is the other way around.</span> <span id="s1113">I remember in the army it was the other, other way.</span> <span id="s1114">The officer was in the back and the soldiers were going in the front.</span> <span id="s1115">I remember in the war, the old officers were in the back and the soldiers were in the front.</span> <span id="s1116">Then here we changed it.</span> <span id="s1117">I was always in the lead.</span> <span id="s1118">I had to go in the front.</span> <span id="s1119">Wherever you went, I had always with me let's say a Bleichman or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and they were after me.</span> <span id="s1120">That's what we was scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1121">Every night when you go, you don't know what will happen.</span> <span id="s1122">Who will shoot or who will do something to you, you understand?</span> <span id="s1123">You didn't know if you will meet Pollacks what are against you – I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1124">One second.</span> <span id="s1125">I don't know what happen.</span> <span id="s1126">All of a sudden, some food or whatever.</span> <span id="s1127">But you had to do it.</span> <span id="s1128">You cannot tell the people that you are afraid.</span> <span id="s1129">You had to go.</span> <span id="s1130">You had to lead.</span> <span id="s1131">And it was like a army.</span> <span id="s1132">We got orders, you know, to burn down this and this village.</span> <span id="s1133">And we did it.</span> <span id="s1134">Next, we had this group of our people went out for food one night, a separate group, small, and on the way back some Polish people called over two of them what they knew them by name.</span> <span id="s1135">Morel, and the other one I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1136">Morel and the Pollacks, young boys from the same town where this Jew was, called him over, said, “Morel, come over here.”</span> <span id="s1137">And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over.</span> <span id="s1138">It didn't took long and they killed them, both of them.</span> <span id="s1139">The Pollacks.</span> <span id="s1140">And the rest of this group, was maybe four or five came running to us in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1141">Running, and they left everything because they had some food something, and they left everything and said, "You know, they killed Morel, and the killed the other one.</span> <span id="s1142">Two guys.”</span> <span id="s1143">We made a meeting from a few people there and we could talk to this Genek Kaminski came over to him because we wanted to find out exactly who did it because we didn't know who killed him.</span> <span id="s1144">We knew the village where it happened.</span> <span id="s1145">Then after meeting is an end, we decided to burn down the, the whole village.</span> <span id="s1146">And we burned down the whole village.</span> <span id="s1147">Came over at night from one corner to the other.</span> <span id="s1148">But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill the people.</span> <span id="s1149">We told them to run out before we went from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s1150">We had straw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too, petroleum or something we had.</span> <span id="s1151">We pour a little bit match and burned the whole village.</span> <span id="s1152">It was a very – one of the, one of the richest villages there around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">02:29:29</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: This was – it didn't feel good altogether because we had to live with them Pollacks.</span> <span id="s1156">We didn't come to fight with the Pollacks, and we left them and I remember I wrote myself a piece of paper in Polish.</span> <span id="s1157">I was – by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went through by the day.</span> <span id="s1158">I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing down almost everything what happened.</span> <span id="s1159">But I will tell you later what happened to it.</span> <span id="s1160">And I wrote them a leaflet like that said, "You see what you're doing.</span> <span id="s1161">You kill our people.</span> <span id="s1162">We have to kill you.</span> <span id="s1163">We didn't come to fight with you.</span> <span id="s1164">We want to fight the Germans, and I think you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our people.”</span> <span id="s1165">I left notes and left this.</span> <span id="s1166">Then we had a case like this.</span> <span id="s1167">We were in a farm house.</span> <span id="s1168">And a Polish man there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them.</span> <span id="s1169">The Germans came and somehow we, we were always soldiers.</span> <span id="s1170">That's what's good for us because we were watching.</span> <span id="s1171">We had a watch outside, a watch inside.</span> <span id="s1172">If we were sleeping, was still was a watch.</span> <span id="s1173">One or two was watching.</span> <span id="s1174">I was on the watch there outside and I see a lineup of Germans coming.</span> <span id="s1175">It was on a hill.</span> <span id="s1176">We were in a house and downstairs, down below the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s1177">I woke up everyone of us, put on – we had to – we start running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it.</span> <span id="s1178">Nobody could get out because they threw like we did.</span> <span id="s1179">Straw or something and they start shooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down the people there.</span> <span id="s1180">We ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1181">We ran, shoot back, run and shoot back.</span> <span id="s1182">No one of our people was killed there in this skirmish.</span> <span id="s1183">In the night, the Germans disappeared.</span> <span id="s1184">They left us alone.</span> <span id="s1185">We went back to this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the house and we said, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s1186">The man wasn't there already and the son wasn't there and we start asking people.</span> <span id="s1187">They said, "The son went to the Germans and he told them that we are there.”</span> <span id="s1188">So, "Good.</span> <span id="s1189">We will stay there and watching.”</span> <span id="s1190">And all of a sudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s1191">He said, "Oh, I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s1192">I – They – My father told me to go.”</span> <span id="s1193">It was the guy what we slept there, and he said his father told him to go to report to the Germans, you know, this.</span> <span id="s1194">"I will work with you.</span> <span id="s1195">I will be with you and please don't kill me.</span> <span id="s1196">Don't.”</span> <span id="s1197">We took him away.</span> <span id="s1198">We really didn't want to kill him.</span> <span id="s1199">Just want to beat him there, you know, a good beating, but I saw him.</span> <span id="s1200">Of course, a man like this if he goes report the Germans, he's a spy already against us.</span> <span id="s1201">This is nothing.</span> <span id="s1202">Then we took him out in the outskirts and start beating him up.</span> <span id="s1203">He was screaming there.</span> <span id="s1204">Then one of our people saw that he screams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him.</span> <span id="s1205">I was sorry that they killed him, but still it was coming to him.</span> <span id="s1206">When he killed him – he shot him it made a noise.</span> <span id="s1207">The shot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it was night and we just got away.</span> <span id="s1208">The next day they buried this boy, the Pollacks or two days in the churchman.</span> <span id="s1209">What is the name?</span> <span id="s1210">The Pope.</span> <span id="s1211">What is the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">02:33:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: The priest said to the congregation, “Listen, people, you see what's going on.</span> <span id="s1215">When a group of people come in…”</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: It's okay.</span> <span id="s1217">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: This will come out there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Why don't you pick it up then when you were talking about how the priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s1221">That's what I'm going to bring out, because it was very important.</span> <span id="s1222">And the priest came over and said, "Listen people.</span> <span id="s1223">You see what's going on.</span> <span id="s1224">We have the Germans on one side.</span> <span id="s1225">We have the partisans on the other side – the Jews, the Pollacks or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1226">The Jew – the Germans are our – is our enemy number one.</span> <span id="s1227">This group is coming to you.</span> <span id="s1228">They want some food in the night and they're going away.</span> <span id="s1229">They don't stay with you.</span> <span id="s1230">Don't report them.</span> <span id="s1231">Don't tell nothing because you will be squeezed in both sides.</span> <span id="s1232">They will kill you.</span> <span id="s1233">See here is a boy killed for nothing,” he said, “because he, he went to the Germans and he told.”</span> <span id="s1234">He said, "Don't do it any more.”</span> <span id="s1235">The priest said that.</span> <span id="s1236">This helped a lot.</span> <span id="s1237">Like I say, the priest –</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: How did you know that the priest gave this sermon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Oh, the Pollack, they told me.</span> <span id="s1240">The farmer's group.</span> <span id="s1241">When I went to the farmers, I came in.</span> <span id="s1242">I was home because I repeat the places.</span> <span id="s1243">When I went over to a farmer and he was nice to us.</span> <span id="s1244">You know, the farmer.</span> <span id="s1245">Because some of them, they were not too nice.</span> <span id="s1246">They just gave us what we wanted and get out.</span> <span id="s1247">Some of them were really nice.</span> <span id="s1248">They kept us.</span> <span id="s1249">They told us to stay with them.</span> <span id="s1250">Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on.</span> <span id="s1251">They told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them also.</span> <span id="s1252">He said, "Why do you have to go to call the Germans?</span> <span id="s1253">The Germans are far away.</span> <span id="s1254">They don't know what is going – coming in the, in the woods.</span> <span id="s1255">If you told them, they know.”</span> <span id="s1256">And this made a big difference.</span> <span id="s1257">Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us.</span> <span id="s1258">They stopped, except they let us go.</span> <span id="s1259">We came in.</span> <span id="s1260">We did our work.</span> <span id="s1261">We did never, never abuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in they run away.</span> <span id="s1262">They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not partisans groups – bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away whatever the farmer had.</span> <span id="s1263">But we came in like gentlemen you know.</span> <span id="s1264">We came in with a speech.</span> <span id="s1265">I said – I told them, “We're fighting for freedom.</span> <span id="s1266">We don't want nothing from you.</span> <span id="s1267">We just want to eat something and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.”</span> <span id="s1268">And this one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s1269">Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Were your – did your group have it's own identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: “The Mietek,” “the Mietek Grupa,” “Group of Mietek,” “the Group of Mietek.”</span> <span id="s1272">The group – lots of things later on: “The Group of Jegier,” names the people knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: This was your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: My group, “Mietek.”</span> <span id="s1275">Everybody knew about it and they knew – the farmers knew about me, and they knew about this recommend.</span> <span id="s1276">In fact, there was a, a landowner, very rich one, and he always gave us money when we came.</span> <span id="s1277">And he gave us a cow or whatever, whatever we wanted.</span> <span id="s1278">Horses we needed to go from one place to another.</span> <span id="s1279">He always gave us.</span> <span id="s1280">Then he gave it when I was there.</span> <span id="s1281">If the group came in without me, he wouldn't give.</span> <span id="s1282">He wouldn't give.</span> <span id="s1283">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1286">He had a mind something, and I think he was right after this.</span> <span id="s1287">After the war, this landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there also in the landowners house.</span> <span id="s1288">And he called me as a witness that I should tell the court how he helped, how he gave money you know.</span> <span id="s1289">And he said, said “I didn't gave no money to nobody, only you.</span> <span id="s1290">You should be the witness.</span> <span id="s1291">You should know about it.”</span> <span id="s1292">And he used it after the war.</span> <span id="s1293">He gave money only to me.</span> <span id="s1294">We used the money for all kinds of things we gave the farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">02:38:19</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: How, how much time had you spent in the woods with your group of men before you reached the point where you were confident about your leadership?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: It took time to be 100 percent confident in this.</span> <span id="s1298">It was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1299">I will tell you straight.</span> <span id="s1300">With Jewish people, it is very, very hard to be a leader.</span> <span id="s1301">Every one of our Jewish people were a leader himself.</span> <span id="s1302">They knew a lot you know.</span> <span id="s1303">They are not dummies.</span> <span id="s1304">Everyone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have to have patience and you have to have – I don't know what – to be a leader, but this is no jokes.</span> <span id="s1305">This is I tell you at this – what's the Ben-Gurion said it was, “I am a president of million presidents.”</span> <span id="s1306">And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this.</span> <span id="s1307">But there was a necessity.</span> <span id="s1308">I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish.</span> <span id="s1309">When I came to a farm or something I had – I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language was difficult.</span> <span id="s1310">Only Szengut was the guy what – but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish he couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know.</span> <span id="s1311">It was – we had to push him a little bit on the side.</span> <span id="s1312">Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't stay too long in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1313">They told us not to stay, and we didn't.</span> <span id="s1314">We felt – because we exhausted – I came twice – three times to the same farmer.</span> <span id="s1315">He didn't have what to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther.</span> <span id="s1316">Then I decided to go with the group of 10 people to find out – because they were talking about other groups on the other side of the Bug.</span> <span id="s1317">We were – there was – when you see the map, there was a, a – this river, Wieprz, is the name – Wieprz and the next was the Bug.</span> <span id="s1318">The Bug was the border from Poland and Russia already later.</span> <span id="s1319">But we were between the Wieprz and the Bug later.</span> <span id="s1320">In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wieprz.</span> <span id="s1321">We had to cross.</span> <span id="s1322">And we crossed over the Wieprz and we knew that between the Wieprz and Bug is a group – is groups, partisans there that we heard about.</span> <span id="s1323">You know they told us, the farmers.</span> <span id="s1324">There was no telephones, but we heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">02:41:10 We had connections all the time.</span> <span id="s1326">This Genek, his connections was saving us always.</span> <span id="s1327">We knew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of something, we knew about it.</span> <span id="s1328">They told us.</span> <span id="s1329">The farmers, one told the other and they told us.</span> <span id="s1330">We had the connections.</span> <span id="s1331">We had this.</span> <span id="s1332">And only with connections we could live through.</span> <span id="s1333">We were laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night.</span> <span id="s1334">I laughed and said what group is going again that meetings to get a connection then.</span> <span id="s1335">I felt that is the way to be because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know – no telephones, nothing.</span> <span id="s1336">You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying.</span> <span id="s1337">You have to have this.</span> <span id="s1338">You have to know what your neighbor's doing.</span> <span id="s1339">You have to know what's going on, and you have to know the other groups.</span> <span id="s1340">You have to know what's in the, what's going on in the country or in Russia.</span> <span id="s1341">We knew about politics.</span> <span id="s1342">We knew everything was in the front.</span> <span id="s1343">This in the front.</span> <span id="s1344">This we knew everything what's going on.</span> <span id="s1345">I was reading papers.</span> <span id="s1346">I was seeing everything clearly.</span> <span id="s1347">Otherwise, we couldn't live.</span> <span id="s1348">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1349">Of course, a lot of groups were – a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization.</span> <span id="s1350">They didn't have the connections and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1351">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s1352">The Pollacks killed them themselves or somehow the Germans – they told the Germans.</span> <span id="s1353">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s1354">Disappeared group by group disappeared.</span> <span id="s1355">And I went through this Wieprz.</span> <span id="s1356">There was a whole story how we went through that.</span> <span id="s1357">And we came over on the other side, and I was so tired.</span> <span id="s1358">Unbelievably tired.</span> <span id="s1359">And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side because we were walking two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s1360">We didn't know where we are going.</span> <span id="s1361">Completely!</span> <span id="s1362">We were – like I say, I didn't have the connection.</span> <span id="s1363">I didn't have the people around me.</span> <span id="s1364">The neighborhood there I knew already.</span> <span id="s1365">I knew where I'm going.</span> <span id="s1366">And here I didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s1367">And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woman there and she start screaming and crying, "Please don't do this.”</span> <span id="s1368">I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1369">We will not do nothing to you.</span> <span id="s1370">Just let us in.”</span> <span id="s1371">She said, "No, I can't because I have a child is sick.</span> <span id="s1372">Very sick.</span> <span id="s1373">He had typhus or something and you will catch it too.</span> <span id="s1374">Don't go in.”</span> <span id="s1375">Said, "Okay, we will go in the barn.”</span> <span id="s1376">We went in the barn.</span> <span id="s1377">We were dead.</span> <span id="s1378">We were so tired of walking.</span> <span id="s1379">I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt half, half dying.</span> <span id="s1380">And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people.</span> <span id="s1381">We always kept one men to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already.</span> <span id="s1382">I wake up and I see nobody's watching.</span> <span id="s1383">Nobody!</span> <span id="s1384">I woke up, and I was a very sleeper – I, I could hear everything always when sleep.</span> <span id="s1385">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1386">This was nature or something.</span> <span id="s1387">I could hear everything.</span> <span id="s1388">Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it.</span> <span id="s1389">Then I walked over – I woked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans, Polish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">02:44:37 And I woke up my people very fast.</span> <span id="s1391">And we walked out with the front and shooting at them.</span> <span id="s1392">They were not still organized.</span> <span id="s1393">They were still starting something then, and we start shooting at them.</span> <span id="s1394">And walked around the barn, and we start running away.</span> <span id="s1395">Because they were an army there.</span> <span id="s1396">Who knows how many?</span> <span id="s1397">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1398">And we start running, running and we – I see very bad.</span> <span id="s1399">There's no trees, nothing.</span> <span id="s1400">We are only a few houses there, and it is a field.</span> <span id="s1401">They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running.</span> <span id="s1402">They can shoot everybody.</span> <span id="s1403">And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a sudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall.</span> <span id="s1404">They were not dead.</span> <span id="s1405">Just one was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, "Please take my rifle.</span> <span id="s1406">I am dead.</span> <span id="s1407">They will kill me anyway.”</span> <span id="s1408">I said, "I don't need your rifle.</span> <span id="s1409">I have mine.”</span> <span id="s1410">I couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1411">Then all of a sudden I feel a shot.</span> <span id="s1412">It was my finger here.</span> <span id="s1413">I have still the finger here like this, shot here right here.</span> <span id="s1414">I squeezed my hand.</span> <span id="s1415">I see blood.</span> <span id="s1416">Yes, I took out, I don't know, a handkerchief or something.</span> <span id="s1417">I put it on.</span> <span id="s1418">I didn't make a big deal of it.</span> <span id="s1419">I was walking, walking.</span> <span id="s1420">All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg.</span> <span id="s1421">Yeah, right here.</span> <span id="s1422">Through.</span> <span id="s1423">And I cannot walk no more.</span> <span id="s1424">I cannot walk.</span> <span id="s1425">I was trying you know.</span> <span id="s1426">Szengut right behind me, and he start pulling me.</span> <span id="s1427">He said, "You have to walk.”</span> <span id="s1428">In the meantime, the rest of the people – we were about 10 or 12 – start moving.</span> <span id="s1429">You know, they cannot wait for me.</span> <span id="s1430">They see this one is laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't leave me alone.</span> <span id="s1431">He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking.</span> <span id="s1432">I see I still can walk.</span> <span id="s1433">The bone wasn't touched.</span> <span id="s1434">And this was luck.</span> <span id="s1435">It was just the meat here that was shot here.</span> <span id="s1436">And I could walk.</span> <span id="s1437">It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">02:47:17 And we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, "Fast put on a horse and wagon,” Szengut said, “and we will put on – I will put you down on this on the wagon and we will start running away with this.”</span> <span id="s1439">Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right by the border there when I was, I was there.</span> <span id="s1440">They came out.</span> <span id="s1441">And one starts talking Polish to me.</span> <span id="s1442">And he says in Polish, "You're a Jew, bastard?"</span> <span id="s1443">or something, this.</span> <span id="s1444">And he aimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s1445">I got up and Szengut grabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people.</span> <span id="s1446">I start screaming with my people, they rest, "Stop and start shooting back.</span> <span id="s1447">Start shooting back because otherwise nobody will live.”</span> <span id="s1448">And I remember like today this one of them guys, it was Andrejew.</span> <span id="s1449">He was the first one.</span> <span id="s1450">He turned around, took out the rifle, he was aiming at the Germans.</span> <span id="s1451">The Germans stopped.</span> <span id="s1452">They stopped.</span> <span id="s1453">Right away they fell through the floor.</span> <span id="s1454">And when he took out a few of our people.</span> <span id="s1455">There was a Finkel there was a few four or five.</span> <span id="s1456">They took out the rifles and they start shooting back.</span> <span id="s1457">When they stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went over to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know – don't know what happened to them again.</span> <span id="s1458">And between them was this Majdanek, this guy what run away from Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1459">He was killed there right away in this skirmish.</span> <span id="s1460">And I run away to the woods.</span> <span id="s1461">In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both went back to look.</span> <span id="s1462">Maybe they can help somebody to – they came to a farmhouse and they opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there.</span> <span id="s1463">A whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something.</span> <span id="s1464">You know they, they had that trophy.</span> <span id="s1465">They took away – I think they took away some money from these three guys too.</span> <span id="s1466">They had maybe a few – I don't know what kind money.</span> <span id="s1467">And Finkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there.</span> <span id="s1468">Then they run away, and they found me.</span> <span id="s1469">I was still waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">02:50:12 And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this – put me on this and they sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another – they stopped other farmers when they – on the way and we start moving.</span> <span id="s1471">And on the way I asked the farmer, "Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot – my finger start bothering me very much, more than the foot.”</span> <span id="s1472">I said, "I cannot walk and I cannot, I cannot function.”</span> <span id="s1473">He said, "You have to be helped.”</span> <span id="s1474">I said, "Oh no, my wife is sick and there's a – I'm afraid, but I will bring you over.</span> <span id="s1475">I have a farm and I have a man what works for me, and he will keep you.</span> <span id="s1476">He will keep you there.”</span> <span id="s1477">I said, "Alright, whatever he wanted to do.”</span> <span id="s1478">And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s1479">They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water.</span> <span id="s1480">I don't know what kind of water.</span> <span id="s1481">They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1482">They, they helped me out.</span> <span id="s1483">It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting.</span> <span id="s1484">All of a sudden, shooting again.</span> <span id="s1485">I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy.</span> <span id="s1486">We were there in the partition there.</span> <span id="s1487">The rest of the group was in another house.</span> <span id="s1488">Start shooting in the house.</span> <span id="s1489">Like a thunder.</span> <span id="s1490">Shoot directly in the house.</span> <span id="s1491">And the farmer showed me the way out in the back and me and Piasecki.</span> <span id="s1492">I got up and I said, "Where is Henryk?”</span> <span id="s1493">I said, "Where is Finkel?”</span> <span id="s1494">And I start looking back and I don't see him.</span> <span id="s1495">And the farmer said, "You cannot wait a second.</span> <span id="s1496">Run.</span> <span id="s1497">Run.”</span> <span id="s1498">And from the back of the farm it was already start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy.</span> <span id="s1499">We run away both of us.</span> <span id="s1500">And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night.</span> <span id="s1501">I was walking in the woods.</span> <span id="s1502">Walking, walking, walking.</span> <span id="s1503">It was day almost.</span> <span id="s1504">I went over.</span> <span id="s1505">I had no, no choice already.</span> <span id="s1506">I didn't know what to do myself.</span> <span id="s1507">I walked over to a farmer.</span> <span id="s1508">“You should help me something or give me a piece of bread or something.”</span> <span id="s1509">And I came over to the farm.</span> <span id="s1510">The farmer boy standing there came out and said, "God, what are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1511">He said, "The Germans were here last night here.</span> <span id="s1512">And they killed one of your people," he said.</span> <span id="s1513">And I figure out that that was Szengut.</span> <span id="s1514">“One of you people was killed.</span> <span id="s1515">And they took off even his boots they took off because he wore new boots.</span> <span id="s1516">He said, "They took off his boots and they took him away.</span> <span id="s1517">And you are here!</span> <span id="s1518">How does it happen?"</span> <span id="s1519">I walked a whole night in the woods and I came back to the same spot.</span> <span id="s1520">You know in the night, you don't know where you're going and there's a woods.</span> <span id="s1521">You don't know it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">02:53:16 I came back to this house.</span> <span id="s1523">Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still there.</span> <span id="s1524">They said, "No.</span> <span id="s1525">No.</span> <span id="s1526">They went away.</span> <span id="s1527">But they still come back or whatever.”</span> <span id="s1528">They said, “They knew that the partisans here, the group is here.”</span> <span id="s1529">I said, "I have no choice.</span> <span id="s1530">In the daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I came.</span> <span id="s1531">I came back and I came over to the Wieprz, to the river.</span> <span id="s1532">There's a big river and you stay here a night.</span> <span id="s1533">Cannot walk.</span> <span id="s1534">Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish kids from school.</span> <span id="s1535">They went there and they start screaming, "Jew.</span> <span id="s1536">Jew.”</span> <span id="s1537">I was so disgusted.</span> <span id="s1538">At least I had something in my hand like glass.</span> <span id="s1539">I will throw this as a bomb I said, “if you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming.</span> <span id="s1540">“They shut up and then came in a man.</span> <span id="s1541">I don't know, it looked like a school teacher.</span> <span id="s1542">He was dressed up nice.</span> <span id="s1543">He said, "What happened?</span> <span id="s1544">You are – you have a problem here?"</span> <span id="s1545">I said – I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">I want to go through the Wieprz.”</span> <span id="s1547">I said, "How can I go?"</span> <span id="s1548">He said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1549">I will show you where.”</span> <span id="s1550">He brought me over to a small house there, and there it was a guy with his – he had this – a boat, a small boat, and he was bringing over people on other side.</span> <span id="s1551">That was his – he said, "You have money?"</span> <span id="s1552">Said, "No, I don't have no money, but I have a lighter.”</span> <span id="s1553">I remember a very nice lighter.</span> <span id="s1554">I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1555">Kaganowicz was killed.</span> <span id="s1556">And I took away a watch and some lighter and I think he had some money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me.</span> <span id="s1557">And this lighter I took out.</span> <span id="s1558">"Show me it works.”</span> <span id="s1559">I showed him it works.</span> <span id="s1560">"Okay.”</span> <span id="s1561">For this lighter, he took me over on the other side with Piasecki.</span> <span id="s1562">We came over to the other side.</span> <span id="s1563">The other side I knew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer.</span> <span id="s1564">I see a light.</span> <span id="s1565">I say I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1566">You know this?</span> <span id="s1567">I start looking near this and I came over and see the rest of my people are there.</span> <span id="s1568">And they went – the Wieprz, then they came back to this farmer.</span> <span id="s1569">They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left.</span> <span id="s1570">We met and they said, "Oh, you still alive.</span> <span id="s1571">Somebody said that you are killed.”</span> <span id="s1572">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s1573">Szengut was killed because they said somebody was wounded and he was killed.</span> <span id="s1574">They knew already.</span> <span id="s1575">Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that – and I went back with this group.</span> <span id="s1576">I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too.</span> <span id="s1577">They went for food or something and I was staying with them.</span> <span id="s1578">It was also very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1579">I was feeling very bad, but they left me and they went.</span> <span id="s1580">But they came for me, and we went together.</span> <span id="s1581">We went back to the place that we knew before.</span> <span id="s1582">And they came over to a place where there was a bunker where I told them bunkers, and this Tolka had a bunker there before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">02:56:32 And I came over.</span> <span id="s1584">There's nobody there.</span> <span id="s1585">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s1586">And all of a sudden came over a – a father and daughter.</span> <span id="s1587">Said, "No, Tolka is no more here.</span> <span id="s1588">He's somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1589">They built another bunker because he was afraid to stay here.</span> <span id="s1590">He built for 40 people, he built a bunker somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1591">I said, "Can I meet him.”</span> <span id="s1592">The guy said, "Wait, maybe he has to come in here.</span> <span id="s1593">Tolka has to come in here.”</span> <span id="s1594">I said, "Alright.”</span> <span id="s1595">And it didn't take long.</span> <span id="s1596">This Tolka came over with Nam— with somebody else.</span> <span id="s1597">They said, "Look.</span> <span id="s1598">Look here, I am wounded," and they said, "I haven't got where to take you.</span> <span id="s1599">It's full there."</span> <span id="s1600">"It's 40 people," he said, "We have no food there.</span> <span id="s1601">It's impossible that we should take you.</span> <span id="s1602">No.”</span> <span id="s1603">What can I do?</span> <span id="s1604">Then I remind myself I met a guy, Drop was his name, like a farmer, a Pollack, what was nice to us.</span> <span id="s1605">And I went back to him.</span> <span id="s1606">I came back to him and he was, he was so fond of me.</span> <span id="s1607">He start kissing me.</span> <span id="s1608">He was so, so happy to see me, and he saw me in this condition and he kept me maybe a few weeks, a few weeks and all 10 of our people were there.</span> <span id="s1609">Ten – two or three was killed – about nine people.</span> <span id="s1610">We were there in his home by this Drop.</span> <span id="s1611">He went to a drug store.</span> <span id="s1612">He bought for me some, something to cover with and he helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1613">This finger gave me a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s1614">I got gangrene in this finger, and the whole hand was so we will have to cut this hand, but I had a very strong constitution and I felt good or whatever and it helped and it went away, but I have this till today.</span> <span id="s1615">It's crooked.</span> <span id="s1616">I can do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1617">I don't want to do nothing.</span> <span id="s1618">The foot didn't gave me too much trouble.</span> <span id="s1619">It was a time until it healed and I could walk and I was staying there.</span> <span id="s1620">till February 14, 1943, I was by farm – Drop’s farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: We're going to stop at this point and allow for another change of the tape and give you a chance to have another drink of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">02:58:48 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: As you were telling us, you were able to work your way through the first difficult encounter.</span> <span id="s1626">You were wounded and you got some help.</span> <span id="s1627">Now, we are at the point where you going to tell us about some of the experiences you had with some of the other partisan leaders, heroes, who had – whose names you had mentioned earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Like I said before, that in February ‘43, Drop, the farmer, came over to our place in the barn and we were there a few weeks already.</span> <span id="s1629">And he says, "Listen, boys, I cannot keep you no – any longer.</span> <span id="s1630">There is a problem.”</span> <span id="s1631">I said, "What happened.”</span> <span id="s1632">He said, "The bunker, from 40 people in the bunker with Jegier , they were all killed.</span> <span id="s1633">And I am afraid now.</span> <span id="s1634">It's not far from here," he said, “It was Amelin, was the name of the town there, village, and it's not far from my place and I am afraid the Germans will kill me and kill you.</span> <span id="s1635">Just tonight start walking.”</span> <span id="s1636">And we went out.</span> <span id="s1637">We start going to farmers in the night.</span> <span id="s1638">We came over to one place, they kept us very nicely and we had a very good experience with her in the night a farm woman there with a family, and they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1639">And she told us that she heard also what was going on there and that they killed 40 people there in the bunker what Jegier and Tolka had the Russia.</span> <span id="s1640">This was a lot of my friends.</span> <span id="s1641">I felt very, very bad and it was upsetting and we were afraid too because now the Germans will go after us, because we see the end.</span> <span id="s1642">It's no way out.</span> <span id="s1643">But we come to a farm like this and we got in touch back again with Genek Kaminski and we start telling him the story what happened.</span> <span id="s1644">Then he knew too.</span> <span id="s1645">He knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s1646">After maybe two days, we walked around.</span> <span id="s1647">All of a sudden in the night, we see a group is walking.</span> <span id="s1648">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1649">During the night we had our things.</span> <span id="s1650">We called "amkha," we called out.</span> <span id="s1651">That was our – what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">03:03:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Code.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Code.</span> <span id="s1655">And we called out "Amkha," and they answered "Amkha.”</span> <span id="s1656">We said, "Who is this?"</span> <span id="s1657">“Jegier.”</span> <span id="s1658">Jegier with a group of people.</span> <span id="s1659">Of course, it was Rubinstein, there – Sever – and other people.</span> <span id="s1660">"Oh, my God, What happened?"</span> <span id="s1661">They said, "They killed you.”</span> <span id="s1662">Said, "Happened that we went out – 14 people – we went out to forage there, to bring some food for the whole group and just at this night, when we walked out the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1663">Somebody told them.</span> <span id="s1664">The farmers told them where we are located, and they killed every – they threw in hand grenades and they killed everybody in this.”</span> <span id="s1665">Tolka and Mikoi and these friends of mine from Markuszow – all killed.</span> <span id="s1666">But 14 of them somehow got out.</span> <span id="s1667">We were very happy to see them and we start moving together with.</span> <span id="s1668">But still to go around with a bigger group was very dangerous and not practical.</span> <span id="s1669">When we come to a farm, "We can give you food for 10, eight people.”</span> <span id="s1670">But to feed a group for 30, 40 was already a big deal.</span> <span id="s1671">They didn't have even food for themselves.</span> <span id="s1672">Then we divided, and Jegier took his group, the Markuszow and others, whatever was left, and I had the prisoners of war I was with, but we kept very close touch.</span> <span id="s1673">We was almost two, three nights we had some spots where we met.</span> <span id="s1674">We made in advance, “you will be there and there,” or we knew what's going always a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: I'd like to interrupt a moment because you mentioned again you had the prisoners of war with you.</span> <span id="s1676">At any time, did you find that it was appropriate to involve women in any of your activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">03:05:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: We didn't think about then about women or not women.</span> <span id="s1679">It was very, very hard for a man and if a woman, it was almost impossible, but if a woman would come along, we would not send her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: That was our way.</span> <span id="s1681">But after a time, we had this experience and a woman came along.</span> <span id="s1682">Still we didn't take her with us, but she was near us.</span> <span id="s1683">She went – whenever we went, she was walking with us all night, and then when we stayed in a place so we had to do something.</span> <span id="s1684">They were staying in another place.</span> <span id="s1685">There was a woman with three men.</span> <span id="s1686">Where they came?</span> <span id="s1687">They came from Warsaw, she and another one.</span> <span id="s1688">Her name was, her name was Hanka.</span> <span id="s1689">Her friend was Halpern, the name Halpern.</span> <span id="s1690">They both jumped from a train what went from Warsaw to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1691">After the Warsaw, they had the, the fight there.</span> <span id="s1692">They run.</span> <span id="s1693">They caught them, and they were bringing them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1694">They jumped out through the train.</span> <span id="s1695">And when they came from the train, the farmers told them that we are out.</span> <span id="s1696">She just jumped out – this luck – she jumped on the spot but where we were.</span> <span id="s1697">But after a few days, it was just some time when we knew we had a big job with a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s1698">Came in some Polish – a group of Polish people were there, and they and us went for a big train, and we stopped the train and we burned down ammunition and oil and gas and – and we took away a few Germans there.</span> <span id="s1699">And we were not used to shoot people there but there was some of them, officers from the Polish group said, "What are you waiting, you Jews?</span> <span id="s1700">You are afraid to kill?"</span> <span id="s1701">They killed right away the Germans there.</span> <span id="s1702">But we little by little we got used to this blood, but still it wasn't my, my genes to kill people.</span> <span id="s1703">I, I couldn't do it, but I want to talk to you now about helping them.</span> <span id="s1704">When I met this Hanka, she was completely out.</span> <span id="s1705">She was hungry and barefoot.</span> <span id="s1706">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1707">One thing she has, she has a big hat.</span> <span id="s1708">She covered her hair that they shouldn't see that she is a girl.</span> <span id="s1709">She was afraid because girls was a problem.</span> <span id="s1710">They didn't want that, so she put on a hat and covered her hair.</span> <span id="s1711">She had short hair, covered.</span> <span id="s1712">And she was in a blouse something, very, very bad shape.</span> <span id="s1713">and I started talking to her.</span> <span id="s1714">She told me the story about Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1715">I didn't know what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">03:08:58 That's why I say through communication we find out what's going on, we found out what, what's going on, and happened she was her family or something from this leader Anielewicz, and she knew what's going on there.</span> <span id="s1717">She told us the whole story how the fight was going on.</span> <span id="s1718">A lot of people run away, and they are looking for partisans to fight, to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s1719">And I kept her around me.</span> <span id="s1720">She was officially like my girl, you know, because I took care of her and I watched her, but she couldn't be with us to do some work or to live together in the quarters.</span> <span id="s1721">They lived separately.</span> <span id="s1722">And walking around there, I came to a farmer and there's like a small child three, four years, a girl, laying there dirty.</span> <span id="s1723">She had – full of rats, she was – terrible situation she looked.</span> <span id="s1724">And I took – I told – I said, "Who is this child.”</span> <span id="s1725">He doesn't know, the farmer.</span> <span id="s1726">He doesn't know.</span> <span id="s1727">He found her on the street.</span> <span id="s1728">I figured right away, it's a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1729">And I cleaned her up and I brushed her and I stayed already and they special for her and I told the farmer, in no two ways, "This girl has to live and this girl you will feed and you will watch her.”</span> <span id="s1730">He said, "I am afraid the other farmers will tell on me.”</span> <span id="s1731">I said, "Good.”</span> <span id="s1732">I went out.</span> <span id="s1733">The whole village was not too big.</span> <span id="s1734">It was a small one.</span> <span id="s1735">And I knocked on the doors and the windows at night and I said, "Listen, there will be in two weeks a young girl coming to you to live with you.</span> <span id="s1736">You keep her.</span> <span id="s1737">And this girl, if something will happen to her, you will all be burned down.”</span> <span id="s1738">"You remember we burned down a place, I said to them.</span> <span id="s1739">That will happen to you people.”</span> <span id="s1740">"No.</span> <span id="s1741">No.</span> <span id="s1742">I will take care of it.”</span> <span id="s1743">Thank God, they took care of this kid.</span> <span id="s1744">It did live through the war.</span> <span id="s1745">She's today a teacher in Israel in the high school and I met her there when I was on ’81, I met her, and she's healthy.</span> <span id="s1746">She's married, and she has a nice family and I was very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1747">She was happy to see me too.</span> <span id="s1748">And she, she thanked me very well for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1750">If we think back to the actual experience of having a woman join – Hanka join the group, you continued on in your military activities for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1752">It had nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s1753">She was on the side, but I want to bring out, if you talk about women, we will talk about this later.</span> <span id="s1754">We got a order that we cannot stay in this neighborhood no more.</span> <span id="s1755">It was very dangerous there.</span> <span id="s1756">A lot of Germans came in there.</span> <span id="s1757">In the neighborhood</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">03:12:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Where did your orders come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Through this Kaminski, everything goes there.</span> <span id="s1761">We had a – name by the name: Mietek Moczar, he came to us.</span> <span id="s1762">He looked a little bit like you.</span> <span id="s1763">Tall and yes, handsome man.</span> <span id="s1764">He was, he was in a uniform for a major in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1765">Eloquent.</span> <span id="s1766">The man could speak nice and also he came to us to pep us up, to talk to us, and he was a few weeks with us.</span> <span id="s1767">Maybe two weeks, he was working with us.</span> <span id="s1768">He took part in our actions, whatever that’s supposed to be done.</span> <span id="s1769">And he was very close with me.</span> <span id="s1770">Somehow we got friendly, and we kept this friendship until he died now.</span> <span id="s1771">Later, he died in Poland.</span> <span id="s1772">And there was another one with the name “Bolek Alef,” Bolkowiak.</span> <span id="s1773">He was after the war a general in Poland.</span> <span id="s1774">He stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s1775">This man was also from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1776">He was in action in Warsaw, in the ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods.</span> <span id="s1777">But he was like an activist.</span> <span id="s1778">He went, he didn't stay in one place.</span> <span id="s1779">He was going from one group to the other, from one place to the other Polish groups and other groups.</span> <span id="s1780">Whatever it was group he was talking to as a speaker, a good one, and he was a – I think he was a lawyer for the war too.</span> <span id="s1781">Bolek Alef, he’s now – he died also two years ago in Poland.</span> <span id="s1782">And they were all – others they came to us.</span> <span id="s1783">You say, “Who?”</span> <span id="s1784">The people, they had the connections through this Genek, he was arranging this and they came.</span> <span id="s1785">They knew where we are, and in the night we were in this and this village.</span> <span id="s1786">We met, and this one thing when Moczar – when he came, we ordered the whole village – a few villages together, and he spoke to them.</span> <span id="s1787">And he spoke to them, he made a political – told them, "Listen.</span> <span id="s1788">Those partisans, they are fighters.</span> <span id="s1789">They are Jews.</span> <span id="s1790">They are doing their job and we are working together and help them and work with them.”</span> <span id="s1791">It was very, very important for us because, you know, we were not alone.</span> <span id="s1792">That's what I said all the time.</span> <span id="s1793">We were with an organization.</span> <span id="s1794">We worked with them.</span> <span id="s1795">And this helped.</span> <span id="s1796">All the time came in, there was a Polish group there what they were fighting as partisans but they were home more.</span> <span id="s1797">When they are needed, they came out.</span> <span id="s1798">When we did something – there's a train or something, they came with us and they helped us.</span> <span id="s1799">Was a Franek – was a guy, Przybyszówka was a village.</span> <span id="s1800">It was a very important group because they helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s1801">And they had some connections with Russia, too, and Moczar had a connection with Russia.</span> <span id="s1802">And an order came that we should go away from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">03:15:36</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Again, I'm interested in the fact that you had an order that you were following.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Your organization.</span> <span id="s1807">How would you describe it to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: We were a very loose organization.</span> <span id="s1809">We did whatever we had to do.</span> <span id="s1810">When it came – the Germans came in the middle of night.</span> <span id="s1811">When they caught us by surprise or something, we didn't have to ask somebody what to do.</span> <span id="s1812">We were on our – on our – on our own.</span> <span id="s1813">And when Jegier said – let's say he was working with this group, he was on his own.</span> <span id="s1814">And I with my group I was on my own.</span> <span id="s1815">And then we met and we talked together you know.</span> <span id="s1816">And we said what we will do, where we will go, how we will do things everything because the connections what they gave us was a big help to us.</span> <span id="s1817">First, of course, before they said, they have to wait for the Russians, and this was a big thing already because Russia start sending material, ammunitions and this, and food even they was end people.</span> <span id="s1818">They were ending up to the back – front they came, they was partisans and they came to us.</span> <span id="s1819">Everybody came to us.</span> <span id="s1820">But we, as Jews, didn't have the, the force but together we were a big group and we had a paper.</span> <span id="s1821">We gave out a paper.</span> <span id="s1822">It was – every action we was taken is still today written down.</span> <span id="s1823">Maybe we will be in Poland, check.</span> <span id="s1824">If they have the actions of their group from Emilia Plater was the name of my group, Emilia Plater.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: What does the name Emilia Plater stand for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Emilia Plater was the leader from the freedom of Poland before Poland was under Russia, under Germany and Austria, years ago in the 17s.</span> <span id="s1827">And this Emilia Plater was a fighter like Kosciuszko, Pulaski.</span> <span id="s1828">She was one of them fighters against tyranny of the Czar and we took the name, Emilia Plater.</span> <span id="s1829">She was a woman fighter then.</span> <span id="s1830">I had another goes – the first time was Kozietulski but not too long.</span> <span id="s1831">She was also a fighter for freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">03:17:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: You had mentioned earlier the relationship with the A.L..</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1835">That was the relationship with A.L..</span> <span id="s1836">The other group was the A.K., Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1837">Then people were – it was like here, the Republicans and the Democrats.</span> <span id="s1838">The democrat was more to the left, they was more to the right.</span> <span id="s1839">The A.K. wasn't – wasn't 100 percent antisemitic, but they didn't like Jews.</span> <span id="s1840">But they didn't let's say kill directly.</span> <span id="s1841">They were not friendly to us.</span> <span id="s1842">But we met once in while because we caught – a guy came from London.</span> <span id="s1843">He was thrown down by a parachute, to help the partisans, whatever.</span> <span id="s1844">And he was from the A.K.</span> <span id="s1845">He told us right away.</span> <span id="s1846">We caught him.</span> <span id="s1847">He fell into our hands.</span> <span id="s1848">And he start talking to us, and he showed us how to make hand grenades, a big one he was making.</span> <span id="s1849">And he was with us a few days.</span> <span id="s1850">Then we brought him over.</span> <span id="s1851">He said he wants to go.</span> <span id="s1852">He has contacts and he wants to go immediately.</span> <span id="s1853">And you shouldn't bring him.</span> <span id="s1854">We were very careful, but we brought him over there, and they made a party for us.</span> <span id="s1855">They gave us food because they knew the guy.</span> <span id="s1856">Nothing happened to us and we were very careful.</span> <span id="s1857">We were standing outside.</span> <span id="s1858">The whole group.</span> <span id="s1859">We were two or three people only working.</span> <span id="s1860">Jegier and me worked, and the rest were standing outside to watch.</span> <span id="s1861">But we didn't feel comfortable with them let's say put it this way.</span> <span id="s1862">If they – they caught a Jew separately on his own, they will kill.</span> <span id="s1863">You know, as a group, they couldn't start with us.</span> <span id="s1864">They, they – they knew that what could happen to them.</span> <span id="s1865">They didn't want to start with us.</span> <span id="s1866">But individuals, if they caught somebody, they – they caught the Morel, I told.</span> <span id="s1867">That was also from the A.K.</span> <span id="s1868">We burned down the whole village because of this, that’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">03:19:58</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Let's bring you toward the conclusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1872">Then the order came we should go the other side.</span> <span id="s1873">And when we came to the Wieprz, then they divided us.</span> <span id="s1874">Jegier with a group, and my group was divided Jegier went away with – some parachutes came down.</span> <span id="s1875">Some Russian groups came down and he had to bring him over to some – kind of place.</span> <span id="s1876">He was to stay with them.</span> <span id="s1877">And I went over to the other side of the Wieprz, between Wieprz and Bug.</span> <span id="s1878">There were other groups there, and we have to unite because we cannot stay there.</span> <span id="s1879">First of all, the terrain – the place where we were, were very antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1880">They, they were known.</span> <span id="s1881">We lived there from day to day because we had pistols, we had rifles.</span> <span id="s1882">When we came to a farmer, he couldn't say nothing because he was afraid of us.</span> <span id="s1883">But we didn't have the work with them you know.</span> <span id="s1884">You couldn't work with them.</span> <span id="s1885">The other side were, were the White Russians.</span> <span id="s1886">They – I don't know – somehow they were better to us and they were nicer people.</span> <span id="s1887">And then they helped us and they told us to go there on the other side.</span> <span id="s1888">And on the way, there a very big fight by the Wieprz, by crossing the Wieprz.</span> <span id="s1889">The Germans were there and waiting for us and we almost didn't make it to Wieprz.</span> <span id="s1890">They, they, they made a ring around us, and they were shooting and somehow someway we run through this one guy helped us with a boat, from our people other side and no one was killed.</span> <span id="s1891">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1892">And we came out on the other side, and the other side, they were shoot – the Pollacks, the A.K. were shooting on us.</span> <span id="s1893">They didn't know who this was, was all mixed up there.</span> <span id="s1894">And the Germans pinned down a group of very, very important men from Russia that came to Janowski, he was a writer from a main paper in Poland after the war.</span> <span id="s1895">And they pinned them down.</span> <span id="s1896">They couldn't – they couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1897">They couldn't walk through the Wieprz, they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1898">They stayed on the other side.</span> <span id="s1899">We went through again.</span> <span id="s1900">Then again an order came back say, "Go and rescue him.”</span> <span id="s1901">We went back.</span> <span id="s1902">About four, or five people, was Bleichman, Finkel, and other Zelazny.</span> <span id="s1903">We went back and we took a boat, some wires, something – I don't remember exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s1904">We brought over the whole group – 20 people.</span> <span id="s1905">We brought those whole – oh, he said this Janowski came from Russia.</span> <span id="s1906">He was a big shot from there already.</span> <span id="s1907">And he said, "You will get medals for this.</span> <span id="s1908">You, you did a job like.”</span> <span id="s1909">He was wounded, too.</span> <span id="s1910">We was carrying on our hands.</span> <span id="s1911">I remember, Zelazny, he was very strong man, we carried with his hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">03:23:02 We carried him over.</span> <span id="s1913">And we came to another place, another group, and after a few days, we met Chiel Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s1914">Chiel Grynszpan had a group already from 40, 50 people there.</span> <span id="s1915">And then people were from the neighborhood people.</span> <span id="s1916">He himself was a soldier.</span> <span id="s1917">He was a – whatever it is – cavalry men, on horses.</span> <span id="s1918">He always liked to be on a horse and he felt good with this.</span> <span id="s1919">And he, he was a very plain man, a good man, and a good soldier.</span> <span id="s1920">He had a discipline with them people.</span> <span id="s1921">We needed it because nobody knew how to keep a rifle, nothing.</span> <span id="s1922">He was the only one there that knew something.</span> <span id="s1923">There was another one later on.</span> <span id="s1924">But he – he managed.</span> <span id="s1925">He was there immediately.</span> <span id="s1926">When we came down, he was happy.</span> <span id="s1927">They really loved us, because we became soldiers.</span> <span id="s1928">We became some kind of a army and together right away, we started on trains.</span> <span id="s1929">This is how highways, trains, communications lines cut and we together.</span> <span id="s1930">Big train, but river and it was a bridge.</span> <span id="s1931">Thunder.</span> <span id="s1932">We broke down the whole bridge, you know.</span> <span id="s1933">It was on the border, the train.</span> <span id="s1934">And the same time I was with another group, maybe a hundred people.</span> <span id="s1935">There was children and women and all kinds of this there, and I found there.</span> <span id="s1936">And I had to carry them too.</span> <span id="s1937">And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go.</span> <span id="s1938">I walked straight on a German with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1939">And I walked them into the rifle.</span> <span id="s1940">Imagine how that – how I felt.</span> <span id="s1941">I stand still like a, like a dummy.</span> <span id="s1942">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1943">And all my people – was maybe a 100 of them – all disappeared.</span> <span id="s1944">In a second, I didn't see nobody.</span> <span id="s1945">Myself I stand on the highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Let's just make sure we understand.</span> <span id="s1947">You came upon this large group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: This was Chiel’s people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Chiel’s people.</span> <span id="s1950">And then you were walking with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Walking with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: You're in the lead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: In the lead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: And then again as you were walking the lead, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">03:25:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: A German was standing with a rifle and I stopped.</span> <span id="s1957">It was dark, pitch dark.</span> <span id="s1958">A moment ago I was on a horse, a white horse I remember, and I had enough of the horse and I gave it to another one and I was walking.</span> <span id="s1959">In from right there.</span> <span id="s1960">He saw us and he heard us because we were talking.</span> <span id="s1961">In Yiddish we talked, and everything was loud.</span> <span id="s1962">Then he was by himself there standing.</span> <span id="s1963">And I came over and I saw a German.</span> <span id="s1964">I said – I start talking German to him – I said, "Was machen Sie hier?”</span> <span id="s1965">“What are you doing here in the night?"</span> <span id="s1966">He said, "Look behind me.”</span> <span id="s1967">I looked.</span> <span id="s1968">There's a dark like this, there's a truck, a whole truck.</span> <span id="s1969">I said, "There's more Germans?"</span> <span id="s1970">He said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1971">There's in the truck sleeping people, and two of them walked out for help.”</span> <span id="s1972">“What happened?”</span> <span id="s1973">“We are stuck.</span> <span id="s1974">We was – a whole column went through here, and I am stuck with a few people stuck here on a truck.”</span> <span id="s1975">So, “you are ours,” we took him down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Let's slow down.</span> <span id="s1977">You were standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1979">Rifle – I start talk to him – he gave me the rifle.</span> <span id="s1980">He gave me the rifle, just like that.</span> <span id="s1981">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1982">He just handed over to me.</span> <span id="s1983">And then all my people came up – get up, took over the women, and he walked up.</span> <span id="s1984">I said, "There's somebody in.”</span> <span id="s1985">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1986">"Wake him up.”</span> <span id="s1987">We woke up two guys.</span> <span id="s1988">One was a black uniform from SS like, and the other one was in a plain uniform.</span> <span id="s1989">And he said, “Two went away, but I don't know where they are, but two are here.”</span> <span id="s1990">And all three we took away and the, the truck we destroyed completely, and we took out a lot of rifles there, ammunition, and some communications they had, wire, some radio something.</span> <span id="s1991">We destroyed everything completely.</span> <span id="s1992">It took us almost a whole night to work on this and it was daylight almost in the morning, and in the summer it gets six – five o'clock was there, and said, "Let's disappear from there," and we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: It must have been an incredible experience to find three—</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: German who so easily allowed themselves to be—</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: Easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: They were regular army.</span> <span id="s1999">They weren't in a column there.</span> <span id="s2000">They didn't know what partisans is.</span> <span id="s2001">They didn't know what's going on here altogether.</span> <span id="s2002">They didn't have an idea.</span> <span id="s2003">Here comes over a man talks to him in German, and he didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2004">You know, he didn't realize that, that I am the enemy.</span> <span id="s2005">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: You were in a German uniform at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: I had a coat.</span> <span id="s2008">I had a German coat, and I spoke German, and he didn't realize what happened, and the others simply got up.</span> <span id="s2009">And the other two simply got up.</span> <span id="s2010">They had no choice.</span> <span id="s2011">The others had no choice because we saw them waking up.</span> <span id="s2012">They were sleeping.</span> <span id="s2013">They were told to come out, and we were start dragging them around with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">03:39:01</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Then what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Then we were maybe a week maybe.</span> <span id="s2017">Somehow we couldn't get nobody.</span> <span id="s2018">The line of communication was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s2019">It was times that the Germans were all over.</span> <span id="s2020">Wherever we moved, the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s2021">And we had to stay still, to wait, to go later.</span> <span id="s2022">He was, was with, with his people, and I was with my people there.</span> <span id="s2023">And I, I had women and children and everybody.</span> <span id="s2024">This wasn't the regular group.</span> <span id="s2025">It was just a put together.</span> <span id="s2026">Just for one day suddenly.</span> <span id="s2027">‘Cause – I will tell you how it happened.</span> <span id="s2028">We had the children with us, and we start dragging them around and the Pollacks start screaming at us, "The Germans will look for them," and you have to do something.</span> <span id="s2029">I didn't want to kill them.</span> <span id="s2030">I had pity special on this one what gave me the rifle.</span> <span id="s2031">I, I didn't feel like killing him.</span> <span id="s2032">Till today, I am sorry because the man was decent you know.</span> <span id="s2033">He, he was a soldier and he gave me the rifle and didn't nothing.</span> <span id="s2034">He could shoot me like nothing.</span> <span id="s2035">He was in – he saw me and he gave it, and I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2036">And we kept him maybe a week or two until we met with Chiel back again and there's another group come over there, Russians and all this, and we made a meeting with three or four officers.</span> <span id="s2037">And we talked it over and said, "They have to be killed.</span> <span id="s2038">What they doing with us, they caught – they catch us?</span> <span id="s2039">They – not only they kill us, but they torture us.</span> <span id="s2040">They cut pieces from us.”</span> <span id="s2041">In fact, they cut one of my people.</span> <span id="s2042">They caught once.</span> <span id="s2043">They cut pieces from him.</span> <span id="s2044">They put to a tree and they cut – with a knife they cut pieces from him.</span> <span id="s2045">Lapides(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s2046">And that's what they were doing with the partisans when they catch them.</span> <span id="s2047">And they said, "What shall we do with them?”</span> <span id="s2048">I said, “Maybe you should wait.”</span> <span id="s2049">I wanted – and there was already headquarters there.</span> <span id="s2050">We had in one place headquarters already from Moczar there, and one with Zymierski there and all the big shots were there sitting – Bolek Alef and Zemsta came also, the guy.</span> <span id="s2051">And I said, "Maybe we should.”</span> <span id="s2052">And they said, "No, we will not drag them out.</span> <span id="s2053">We don't know how to get there.</span> <span id="s2054">It's very hard now to go and communicate.”</span> <span id="s2055">But that time week or two, we got to – to the headquarters.</span> <span id="s2056">We came there.</span> <span id="s2057">First thing I reported to him – to Moczar, that I caught three Germans and I had all the documents from there.</span> <span id="s2058">I took away all the documents.</span> <span id="s2059">I had their names and everything.</span> <span id="s2060">Then one of the Polish guys was, was something.</span> <span id="s2061">I don't know what it was mad at me, jealous or what it is because he didn't want to give a rifle, something from there that we took away.</span> <span id="s2062">And he went over to, to Moczar and he told them that we killed innocent people, three guys, Germans.</span> <span id="s2063">And Moczar said to me, "What do you mean you killed three Germans?</span> <span id="s2064">You have no right to kill nobody.”</span> <span id="s2065">And he start screaming at me and all this, and I had already – I was a officer already.</span> <span id="s2066">I took off my – I was a lieutenant – he took off.</span> <span id="s2067">He said, "you're dismissed,” and all this.</span> <span id="s2068">And in a day after Chiel came back and all this, he start talking and he said, "I have everything what I wanted to know.”</span> <span id="s2069">He gave me go back.</span> <span id="s2070">He said to me not to do it no more because they have to have some kind of an army.</span> <span id="s2071">It's not – you cannot do whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">03:32:40</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: So in fact the three soldiers were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Who killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Our people.</span> <span id="s2077">Three people.</span> <span id="s2078">I know even exactly.</span> <span id="s2079">I don't want to tell the names.</span> <span id="s2080">Our friends, they are today – one of them is in Florida, one is in Israel.</span> <span id="s2081">Out right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: During the experiences that you describe – and we’ll pick that up – but you raised the point, other people killing Germans, can you recall your own experiences killing Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: We had a lot of fights with Germans.</span> <span id="s2084">We were shooting to them and they shot at them.</span> <span id="s2085">I don't know if they were killed.</span> <span id="s2086">I assumed that they were killed also.</span> <span id="s2087">When they were shooting the rifle the bullet goes to, to them like they go to us.</span> <span id="s2088">And they were all going from us open, they were not afraid Jews, they're not afraid.</span> <span id="s2089">They go.</span> <span id="s2090">And they were shooting back.</span> <span id="s2091">I'm sure they were killed, but directly to shoot.</span> <span id="s2092">You had only three guys when you shot – went into a train, but we didn't shot.</span> <span id="s2093">The Pollacks shot them.</span> <span id="s2094">But it's different.</span> <span id="s2095">It was our group that shot them, and then three were shot directly from us.</span> <span id="s2096">We had later on more, but this was till then.</span> <span id="s2097">And we – I told you straight, us Jews we had once affect, we had a guy what was a Pollack and he was with us, and he denounced us.</span> <span id="s2098">He was with us, fighting with us, going with us and he had a chance.</span> <span id="s2099">He just disappeared for a few minutes and he told somebody.</span> <span id="s2100">He had contact where we were going and what we are doing.</span> <span id="s2101">And we, we found out very fast that he's doing this.</span> <span id="s2102">When we find out that, the man cannot live with us.</span> <span id="s2103">Then who will kill him?</span> <span id="s2104">Nobody wants to kill him.</span> <span id="s2105">And they came the Polish guys what I told you, they helped us out they were kids.</span> <span id="s2106">They were kids, that one Franek, he said, “Here, you shoot the man like this.”</span> <span id="s2107">And he took out a pistol and he shot him.</span> <span id="s2108">We didn't have the guts to shoot somehow.</span> <span id="s2109">I was a military man, but still directly to shoot in a fight it's different.</span> <span id="s2110">Directly to shoot wasn’t to easy.</span> <span id="s2111">Okay now, we went in a, in a village.</span> <span id="s2112">The name was Bojki, and in Bojki we were staying two and a half months, in one spot.</span> <span id="s2113">And there we formed a real army.</span> <span id="s2114">We formed groups.</span> <span id="s2115">You know we made groups, small ones.</span> <span id="s2116">Every one group had a leader and we made a military establishment.</span> <span id="s2117">And people were going out, out just to big farms we went out.</span> <span id="s2118">We collected cows and food, swine, whatever it is, whatever we needed for food, and we brought it over, and we had a base.</span> <span id="s2119">We was staying there.</span> <span id="s2120">The Germans knew that we are there.</span> <span id="s2121">The Pollacks knew we are there.</span> <span id="s2122">Nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s2123">We are staying there.</span> <span id="s2124">We went out every night, for trains or whatever you had to do.</span> <span id="s2125">We walked away from there.</span> <span id="s2126">And they were not doing nothing.</span> <span id="s2127">In fact, they had on the woods – we were – not too far was woods – was a sign, "Here Partisans," and they shouldn't go in – individual Germans, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">03:36:06</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: You have to explain to us.</span> <span id="s2130">Why do you think or why is it in fact that the Germans did not come?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: It was in ‘44 already.</span> <span id="s2132">This was ‘44.</span> <span id="s2133">The Germans had full hands on the fronts all over.</span> <span id="s2134">We knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s2135">We had the leaders, from the group.</span> <span id="s2136">You had – what's his name?</span> <span id="s2137">Moczar.</span> <span id="s2138">And what's their name?</span> <span id="s2139">Bolek Alef and Zemsta came from all over Russia was helping – started to help already.</span> <span id="s2140">And we were an army already.</span> <span id="s2141">We knew that we are not – we will not just give up and they knew that need a lot of military men to cope with us.</span> <span id="s2142">They need airplanes.</span> <span id="s2143">They need artillery.</span> <span id="s2144">They cannot just come in just to fight with us right then.</span> <span id="s2145">They knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: What size force did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: We had a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s2148">And then was a group of Russians there.</span> <span id="s2149">Chorny, Biely(ph), a lot of Partisans were there in these woods there.</span> <span id="s2150">A lot!</span> <span id="s2151">Thousands already.</span> <span id="s2152">And they – the Russians knew – the Germans knew that they are there, and they didn't come.</span> <span id="s2153">For a long, for a long time they didn't touch us.</span> <span id="s2154">Then the front start coming near, and May First, came Rola Zymierski, to us.</span> <span id="s2155">He was the leader of the whole army.</span> <span id="s2156">He was a general before the war, a very fine man, a older man.</span> <span id="s2157">And he spoke to the whole population.</span> <span id="s2158">He called over everybody and he spoke to them and he talked to them about the partisans.</span> <span id="s2159">It wasn't only Jews then.</span> <span id="s2160">It was Pollacks, Russians, everybody.</span> <span id="s2161">And he said, "The Russian front is very near, and these days we will be taken over by the Russians and we will take over Poland back again.”</span> <span id="s2162">Talked openly.</span> <span id="s2163">He already was sure of himself.</span> <span id="s2164">And then he came over to me and to Chiel Grynszpan, because Chiel and I worked together then.</span> <span id="s2165">Jegier, by the way, before when we divided, was killed.</span> <span id="s2166">In a skirmish with Germans, he was killed.</span> <span id="s2167">And there was no more Jegier and I was with Chiel.</span> <span id="s2168">I had my group.</span> <span id="s2169">He had his group but we kept together.</span> <span id="s2170">And what I want to say is–</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">03:38:32</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: The Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s2174">They were all, all over already.</span> <span id="s2175">They were – the Russians were – the contact with the Russians was so near.</span> <span id="s2176">In fact they had a whole delegation came to us in the woods, and they came to me and said, "Listen, we have confidence in you, your group.</span> <span id="s2177">Give me 10 people, whatever, to bring over the government, the future government of Poland to Russia.</span> <span id="s2178">We have them right here.</span> <span id="s2179">And I want you to give us some people.”</span> <span id="s2180">And I gave Morel, Bleichman, a nice group of 10 people.</span> <span id="s2181">I gave them to them and they carried over the main delegation from the Polish government to Russia, to Moscow.</span> <span id="s2182">And they made it.</span> <span id="s2183">They brought them over to airplane.</span> <span id="s2184">They had a skirmish there with some Hungarians that were fighting for – with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2185">Hungarians were fighting with the Germans – Rumanians were fighting with the Germans, there, on their side.</span> <span id="s2186">And somehow they brought them over.</span> <span id="s2187">They brought them over.</span> <span id="s2188">They brought them and they went to Russia, and they formed a government.</span> <span id="s2189">But it was our group that carried them through there.</span> <span id="s2190">And they remembered this.</span> <span id="s2191">Moczar – when I was there latest with Moczar he remembered this, the we took over – the group that took over the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: The front was quickly moving to your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: The front was moving very rapidly.</span> <span id="s2194">It was almost we could hear, already, the katyúshas this, this, the–</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Rockets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">03:40:32</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: Rockets.</span> <span id="s2198">And we hear artillery.</span> <span id="s2199">We can hear airplanes too.</span> <span id="s2200">And almost every few days the Russians came down to us and threw down ammunition, rifles, people.</span> <span id="s2201">They came in – one group came in 70 people.</span> <span id="s2202">We called them “skoczki.”</span> <span id="s2203">That means they jump – jumpers.</span> <span id="s2204">They came in 70 people.</span> <span id="s2205">Most of them were Jews, officers, trained in Russia or somewhere, and they came to us.</span> <span id="s2206">And women came over and now the story about ladies, women.</span> <span id="s2207">Hanka was the only one women what I knew that she is around like this.</span> <span id="s2208">And I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2209">When I came to Chiel, I find there a whole group of people, old, young, children.</span> <span id="s2210">There were a few hundred hidden in a wood, in a very, very strange pieces of land there.</span> <span id="s2211">It was water and you couldn't get there.</span> <span id="s2212">No German, nobody could get there.</span> <span id="s2213">And they pushed them there on this land, and they put them there.</span> <span id="s2214">And then they were bring to them food, something once in awhile.</span> <span id="s2215">Not too much.</span> <span id="s2216">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s2217">And when I came, she said to me, "This is people what I know.</span> <span id="s2218">They are almost from my villages there.</span> <span id="s2219">I know most of them people."</span> <span id="s2220">Pollacks came over to me and they said they will kill all of them if they wouldn't stop grabbing the chickens and the food in the night.</span> <span id="s2221">And they didn't have what to eat, and they ran out in the night.</span> <span id="s2222">They were going to the farmer.</span> <span id="s2223">And the farmers were ours, because we were standing – they knew us.</span> <span id="s2224">We had a base, and they came to Chiel and they told him – they said they will kill all the children and women.</span> <span id="s2225">Then he call over, “Mietek,” he said, “I cannot go to them people because we have to do something.</span> <span id="s2226">To kill somebody there or to do something.”</span> <span id="s2227">He said, "Otherwise, they will kill all of us too.</span> <span id="s2228">Not only them, but they will – Farmers you cannot stop because they are our bread and butter.</span> <span id="s2229">We have to work with them.”</span> <span id="s2230">Then I went there with three people.</span> <span id="s2231">I remember Rabinowitz(ph), from Warsaw, guy on horse, otherwise, you couldn't walk through there, water was there.</span> <span id="s2232">You know, the horses went through everything.</span> <span id="s2233">And I came to the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">03:43:02 I came to the place.</span> <span id="s2235">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2236">When I remind myself, I want to cry now.</span> <span id="s2237">It was my job.</span> <span id="s2238">People naked, half naked.</span> <span id="s2239">Ladies!</span> <span id="s2240">Men!</span> <span id="s2241">Children!</span> <span id="s2242">Everybody, they had some kind of covers they had.</span> <span id="s2243">They made.</span> <span id="s2244">They built.</span> <span id="s2245">Not on the ground.</span> <span id="s2246">On top.</span> <span id="s2247">And they were cooking, making food, something for the family.</span> <span id="s2248">.</span> <span id="s2249">When I saw this group, I couldn't – I couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s2250">I see people.</span> <span id="s2251">It's like from the old times.</span> <span id="s2252">You see in the – from the history books.</span> <span id="s2253">You see people like this.</span> <span id="s2254">And in between I looked down and I see a woman.</span> <span id="s2255">She looks like my mother.</span> <span id="s2256">Imagine!</span> <span id="s2257">And here I came in this in to kill them.</span> <span id="s2258">I have to kill somebody or I have to do something.</span> <span id="s2259">I see my mother there.</span> <span id="s2260">I went over to her and I talked to her and I said, "Where you come from?"</span> <span id="s2261">And I talked to others.</span> <span id="s2262">And then I put them together, and lined up and I said, "Listen people.</span> <span id="s2263">You want to live.</span> <span id="s2264">You have to behave.</span> <span id="s2265">You have to do something else.</span> <span id="s2266">You cannot just go to the farmers, rob them.</span> <span id="s2267">Wait for us.</span> <span id="s2268">Organize something.</span> <span id="s2269">There should be some organization because otherwise, they will – you will perish and we will perish altogether.</span> <span id="s2270">And they told me that a few youngsters there what were really no good.</span> <span id="s2271">They were robbing.</span> <span id="s2272">I said, "You three will come with me.”</span> <span id="s2273">They, they had some mothers there.</span> <span id="s2274">They had two sisters, and they thought I'm going to kill them.</span> <span id="s2275">And that was the, the, the order to kill them.</span> <span id="s2276">And I said, "Oh no, I will not kill nobody here.</span> <span id="s2277">They depend on me absolutely.</span> <span id="s2278">I'm not killing nobody.”</span> <span id="s2279">After going through a thing like this, and I took them away and I brought them over to the group, them three and they were very, very good soldiers there.</span> <span id="s2280">One is still today my best friend.</span> <span id="s2281">Whenever he sees me, he doesn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s2282">All three left with me and they are – they were with me.</span> <span id="s2283">But the group – the women, it was at a time the Pollacks still didn't give up.</span> <span id="s2284">They have to be feeded.</span> <span id="s2285">I said, “This is no good.</span> <span id="s2286">We have to take them away.”</span> <span id="s2287">And we brought the whole group, little by little, not in one shot, into the group, into the village there nobody should know.</span> <span id="s2288">Not even the headquarters didn't know, nobody didn't know.</span> <span id="s2289">And we brought over – and every group – we had maybe a 100, 120 people there, and every group we took in one or two women and they were cooking for us because we were standing in one place.</span> <span id="s2290">They were cooking, they were washing.</span> <span id="s2291">We had shirts to wash or something.</span> <span id="s2292">Then the women start working for us and they were doing group – some of them were very brave, and they said, "What do you mean washing this?</span> <span id="s2293">We want to have a rifle too.”</span> <span id="s2294">And have a Dora and another one there, Roska, and this, and they, they picked up rifles.</span> <span id="s2295">They put on rifles and they went out to work with us, the women you know, after a time that everything calmed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">03:46:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: How did they function?</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: They did – were very, very, very good because they have a group had to – then they had – they had to behave.</span> <span id="s2299">You know they were soldiers.</span> <span id="s2300">Everybody was a soldier.</span> <span id="s2301">Hanka had the worse time she had than everybody else.</span> <span id="s2302">She came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2303">She came – she was a very, very delicate women – she was from a good home.</span> <span id="s2304">She had maids home, and she didn't know what to do with herself.</span> <span id="s2305">Others were from farms, from villages.</span> <span id="s2306">They, they, they coped.</span> <span id="s2307">They knew how to cook.</span> <span id="s2308">They knew how to do something for us, and some of them baked for us.</span> <span id="s2309">We had a good time.</span> <span id="s2310">But she, she was lost.</span> <span id="s2311">Completely lost!</span> <span id="s2312">She couldn't – she was – it was so dirty here.</span> <span id="s2313">She, she couldn't – she didn't keep herself good.</span> <span id="s2314">I had a very, very hard time with her really to keep her alive and to keep her around there.</span> <span id="s2315">Also, she was very small and beautiful.</span> <span id="s2316">She was a beautiful women, with dark hair.</span> <span id="s2317">She was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2318">I liked her very much, and she liked me.</span> <span id="s2319">But I couldn't even come near her.</span> <span id="s2320">She was so – I knew she was dirty, and after a time she was assigned to watch for a guy what was wounded in a fight.</span> <span id="s2321">She, she went away from me, and she was staying with this guy until the war ended.</span> <span id="s2322">I didn't see her no more.</span> <span id="s2323">But before we divided two the groups divided to.</span> <span id="s2324">What happened.</span> <span id="s2325">When Rola Zymierski came First of May, and told us that near – the front is near.</span> <span id="s2326">He said, "You have to disappear from this terrain, from this land.</span> <span id="s2327">We have to go deeper and fight other Germans, deeper, deeper to the Weichsel to go deeper into the country, to the west.</span> <span id="s2328">The Bug was east, and we have to go to the west.</span> <span id="s2329">Then I remember I went, “Chiel,” I said, “Listen, what shall we do?"</span> <span id="s2330">I was afraid of these Pollacks there on the other side.</span> <span id="s2331">They were not too friendly to us, and here we had no freedom.</span> <span id="s2332">We were staying in one place for so many months.</span> <span id="s2333">We knew the people already, and they knew us.</span> <span id="s2334">We lived.</span> <span id="s2335">Then I said, "Maybe we shouldn't go.”</span> <span id="s2336">And Chiel said the same thing, "I know the people here, they knew me.”</span> <span id="s2337">They know Chiel.</span> <span id="s2338">Big shot he came with his horse.</span> <span id="s2339">They all – they, they respect.</span> <span id="s2340">And he liked to drink, he liked women.</span> <span id="s2341">He was a good leader, you know, a real one, a partisan.</span> <span id="s2342">I was more the intelligent type you know.</span> <span id="s2343">It was – when they needed something, they came to me, and I have – I took care of everything.</span> <span id="s2344">But he was a soldier.</span> <span id="s2345">And I said, "We will not go.”</span> <span id="s2346">And I went over to Rola Zymierski and I said, "You're going away, and this piece of land stays empty.</span> <span id="s2347">Nobody from, from the partisans, nobody will be here.</span> <span id="s2348">Let us be the guard.</span> <span id="s2349">When the Russian front come near, we will go come – we will go back.</span> <span id="s2350">But in the meantime, we will need 100 people here just to cover your retreat when you go back to them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">03:49:53 He said, "It's a idea.</span> <span id="s2352">Stay.”</span> <span id="s2353">And we remained here, and I remained there with 100 people we remained on the site of the Wieprz – between the Wieprz and the Bug.</span> <span id="s2354">And they went – the Wieprz, they went through, and they went to the terrain where I was before.</span> <span id="s2355">Garbów, Lubartów, and other towns there.</span> <span id="s2356">It didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s2357">The Pollacks, the A.K., they came over to me, and he said, "You want to live.</span> <span id="s2358">You want to live the group – a group nice there.</span> <span id="s2359">You have to belong to us.</span> <span id="s2360">You have to get with us together and work together.</span> <span id="s2361">You cannot be on your own because everybody left – not you, not the Russians, not the Pollacks, everybody already.</span> <span id="s2362">Only here you are, you are group.</span> <span id="s2363">You have to belong to us.”</span> <span id="s2364">I said, "Oh, oh, this is, this is death.”</span> <span id="s2365">Meantime – the same time Baranovskiy a general from Russia came down with airplanes, and the whole group of real army.</span> <span id="s2366">I'm telling you soldiers one by one.</span> <span id="s2367">They were really equipped.</span> <span id="s2368">Everything too.</span> <span id="s2369">And this Baranovskiy we found out through channels he's a Jew too, but he didn't give it up.</span> <span id="s2370">He didn't.</span> <span id="s2371">He never said that he's a Jew.</span> <span id="s2372">And after a few days, we said, “What do we have to do the A.K.?”</span> <span id="s2373">We said, “We will go over to Baranovskiy and want to meet him.</span> <span id="s2374">They say he came over on the terrain there.”</span> <span id="s2375">And we went to help him and how he can help us.</span> <span id="s2376">We came over to him.</span> <span id="s2377">He had a wife with him, and he had a pirate, a pirate, that’s a pir– that is a big bird, and he had caviar and he took us in like a – and it was something else.</span> <span id="s2378">We were dressed military dressed, very nice – I think was good looking then – and he start talking to me right way in Russia because I understood Russia, the Polish Russia.</span> <span id="s2379">And he said, "What you, what you have to go by yourselves?”</span> <span id="s2380">He proposed us until I – we didn't even say nothing.</span> <span id="s2381">He said, "Come to me.</span> <span id="s2382">Come to us.</span> <span id="s2383">We will form one group.</span> <span id="s2384">We have a few hundred people and you be there.</span> <span id="s2385">I see you are soldiers.</span> <span id="s2386">You are in that group.</span> <span id="s2387">You come to us.”</span> <span id="s2388">And that's what we were waiting for.</span> <span id="s2389">And we came, the whole group came to Baranovskiy.</span> <span id="s2390">And when we came to Baranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with us right away.</span> <span id="s2391">“No more Jews,” he said.</span> <span id="s2392">“You cannot be Jews.</span> <span id="s2393">By a group you have to be separate.</span> <span id="s2394">Every group, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2395">You cannot be Jews by themselves.</span> <span id="s2396">This is our policy.</span> <span id="s2397">And this is it.</span> <span id="s2398">You can do that otherwise.</span> <span id="s2399">Whatever you want, you have to be divided.”</span> <span id="s2400">In the meantime, he made me – and he made a group in Russian – Russian kept separate, and he made from Polish people, A.L. he called them.</span> <span id="s2401">The are Armia Ludowa.</span> <span id="s2402">He made a group, and I was – he made me the leader.</span> <span id="s2403">From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of them.</span> <span id="s2404">Not Chiel, Chiel stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">03:53:12 Then one night he calls me, Chiel, he calls out, "Listen you two.</span> <span id="s2406">I want you to leave.</span> <span id="s2407">I am sending you to Moscow, you two.”</span> <span id="s2408">I said, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s2409">we'll leave the people," I said.</span> <span id="s2410">"Never mind, you two.</span> <span id="s2411">I have very important papers.</span> <span id="s2412">I have to send them over.”</span> <span id="s2413">“How you will do?”</span> <span id="s2414">“I make a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and when I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers.</span> <span id="s2415">Then you two get up fast because you knew already what to do.</span> <span id="s2416">You get up, you two.</span> <span id="s2417">When you are up that's it.</span> <span id="s2418">I have to send you two.”</span> <span id="s2419">And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there came a guy from Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2420">He run away.</span> <span id="s2421">He was a politician.</span> <span id="s2422">He was – I think he was a communist, something like that.</span> <span id="s2423">He was the political figure there.</span> <span id="s2424">He said, "I'm going, too, at this meeting.”</span> <span id="s2425">He goes to the meeting too.</span> <span id="s2426">And he knows about us that have to get up and we're together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General Baranovskiy says, "I have to send out some people with papers and all this.</span> <span id="s2427">Who volunteers?"</span> <span id="s2428">Well, he gets up the first, Rubinstein he and Chiel after him, and I remained.</span> <span id="s2429">Only two.</span> <span id="s2430">And I remained there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: I am going to ask you in the few minutes we have left to focus on the closing days of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2433">That's what will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: Where you are now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s2436">Then, then I remained myself here with Chiel away and they had very important papers and then they went together to the border to the river that they have to cross.</span> <span id="s2437">There's a Pollack what knows where to cross, and he is the first one.</span> <span id="s2438">He walks them into the river.</span> <span id="s2439">He fells into the river.</span> <span id="s2440">After him goes Rubinstein.</span> <span id="s2441">The – Politruk, they called.</span> <span id="s2442">He walks in.</span> <span id="s2443">He fell in the water.</span> <span id="s2444">And Rubinstein made a “gevalt,” starts screaming.</span> <span id="s2445">He fell in the water with the uniform whatever, and he start screaming and the water was high over him and the Germans were not too far and they start shooting him already.</span> <span id="s2446">We had to retreat completely.</span> <span id="s2447">We came back.</span> <span id="s2448">And this day when he retreated we had a big, big fight.</span> <span id="s2449">The biggest one in the partisans.</span> <span id="s2450">We had there one of the partisans.</span> <span id="s2451">If the Germans find out that Baranovskiy is there, the group, he lives openly, you know they find out, they came with artillery.</span> <span id="s2452">Like I said they didn't come from soldier.</span> <span id="s2453">They came artillery, airplanes and – what's the name?</span> <span id="s2454">And the tanks and all this came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Just one big battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">03:56:09</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Big, big battle.</span> <span id="s2458">Big battle!</span> <span id="s2459">And the same day the other group what went the other side to my end was a part of my group too went to show the way there because was – what was the names?</span> <span id="s2460">What was his name?</span> <span id="s2461">Morel, Zelazny, Bleichman – you will hear a lot because he will I think he will be also there.</span> <span id="s2462">And they – he went back with this group, and they had the biggest fight also in the war.</span> <span id="s2463">Because the Germans want to clean up the partisans.</span> <span id="s2464">They knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s2465">The knew that the army's coming back.</span> <span id="s2466">When the army comes back, they will hinder us whatever.</span> <span id="s2467">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s2468">Then they had a order to clean us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: And they had a very big fight there.</span> <span id="s2471">Bigger than ours, maybe, with this and they had a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2472">A lot of people!</span> <span id="s2473">But in the night, they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: The Germans disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: No, the Germans was staying there, but our people disappeared in the night.</span> <span id="s2476">Most of them came back to us.</span> <span id="s2477">They had our base already.</span> <span id="s2478">They came back to us.</span> <span id="s2479">And our fight with Wola Wereszczynska we went into the woods.</span> <span id="s2480">And I don't think somebody was killed.</span> <span id="s2481">I know one airplane was shot down.</span> <span id="s2482">I know a few Germans were killed right what I saw in the, in the fight because we went into the woods and he was standing there.</span> <span id="s2483">There was a very big flash was in front of me.</span> <span id="s2484">I was behind a, a tree, a big one, and there was some water there in the front of this.</span> <span id="s2485">All of sudden, a splash there in front of this.</span> <span id="s2486">Artillery hit there, and it didn't, it didn't explode.</span> <span id="s2487">And then Baranovskiy was not too far.</span> <span id="s2488">I said to him, "Look here, I almost got killed.”</span> <span id="s2489">He said, "Jews don't get killed.</span> <span id="s2490">You are a Jew."</span> <span id="s2491">Just like that.</span> <span id="s2492">He made a joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: So you went through scot-free?</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: I went through scot-free.</span> <span id="s2495">After this, it took a few days, a few days after, the Russians start coming.</span> <span id="s2496">Started coming.</span> <span id="s2497">It was the worst part in our life cause the Germans were all over because they came from the front.</span> <span id="s2498">And there was tanks and the small vehicles and all over the field all over.</span> <span id="s2499">We didn't have where to hide.</span> <span id="s2500">We didn't have where to hide.</span> <span id="s2501">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s2502">Then I don't know, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s2503">It was some kind of a wooden area, small woods, small woods and we went into this.</span> <span id="s2504">Lucky we didn't go into the fields because they went through the fields.</span> <span id="s2505">The Germans went through the fields.</span> <span id="s2506">And we were, were there in this, and we laid down still sitting there.</span> <span id="s2507">I remember one of the women got up and she had a red, and red this – a handkerchief or something like that she ripped it off her head and I pushed her down.</span> <span id="s2508">And we were laid down, that the Germans came with airplanes with all this, we were laying there.</span> <span id="s2509">Somehow, they had their minds with something else, and they went through us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">03:59:26</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: With one minute left, I want you to tell us how the Russians came in and actually liberated your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: The Russians came in, and we were like an organized group, it came in a Pollack with a beard – he looked like Messiah.</span> <span id="s2513">He came over to us, he said, “What are you doing here in the woods?</span> <span id="s2514">You know the Russians are here in this village.</span> <span id="s2515">Right next to you, in this village the Russians are here.”</span> <span id="s2516">Said, “What?”</span> <span id="s2517">Said, “Come with me.”</span> <span id="s2518">And we start walking with – marching a group, like soldiers, you know.</span> <span id="s2519">We going – we’re proud.</span> <span id="s2520">All of a sudden the Russians start shooting.</span> <span id="s2521">The Russians, on us!</span> <span id="s2522">Because they knew – didn’t know who this is.</span> <span id="s2523">They thought it’s Germans.</span> <span id="s2524">A column of people going?!?</span> <span id="s2525">And we laid down and we sent out two or three guys with white – this handkerchiefs and all this.</span> <span id="s2526">And they went over to them and they told them it is a group of partisans and this, and they said, “Jews on top of this, what?”</span> <span id="s2527">Here this – a Russian general came over, a Jew.</span> <span id="s2528">And then another officer, a Jew.</span> <span id="s2529">There’s a lot of Jewish officers there, between the Russians.</span> <span id="s2530">And they were happy to see us, and they hugged us.</span> <span id="s2531">And they said, “But we have no time.</span> <span id="s2532">We are at war to go.</span> <span id="s2533">There is a place, there, not too far, what the SS staying and we have a big fight with them.</span> <span id="s2534">You stay here and then you – we took over Lublin already.</span> <span id="s2535">We took over Lubartów and all other towns are taken over already from us.</span> <span id="s2536">And you go back and you are free.”</span> <span id="s2537">And this free was, was very, very sad, very sad.</span> <span id="s2538">Then we start feeling how alone we are.</span> <span id="s2539">Everybody start looking for family.</span> <span id="s2540">Everybody start looking for, for somebody to, to, to share his problems, share this.</span> <span id="s2541">I couldn’t – with my family I was cut off, I didn’t know what happen there.</span> <span id="s2542">Then it takes – took time a little bit, they start coming from the other side, they told me that my family was killed, all of them in one day, they took them out, they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s2543">My brother was killed in a, in a camp.</span> <span id="s2544">And everybody, what remained there, from, from millions of millions of people, remained 150,000 people remained in Poland.</span> <span id="s2545">Why I know, because after this I organized registration and I was working with Dr. Sommerstein.</span> <span id="s2546">Maybe you heard about him?</span> <span id="s2547">He was a big leader for the war, he our leader from – in war for the area government and I was working with him, yes.</span> <span id="s2548">I had a very big job in Poland too, they gave me a job right away, and I registering all the Jews, everybody what lived through, came to me and they registered their child and this.</span> <span id="s2549">And I found what is going on, how many people and where they
