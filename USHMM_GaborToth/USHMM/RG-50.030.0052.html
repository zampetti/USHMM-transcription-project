id="s12">October 2, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: We are on camera.</span> <span id="s14">We have started to film.</span> <span id="s15">Would you tell me your full name please?</span> <span id="s16">Give me your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Father Francis Anthony Cegileka.</span> <span id="s18">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: In Grabow, the province of Poznan, Poland.</span> <span id="s20">But Poland under occupation of German in 1908, we still lived under the German power.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Father, if you would lean back and relax.</span> <span id="s22">I will move my chair forward if necessary so that you can hear me, but</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: We have started?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: We have started.</span> <span id="s25">It's important that you be comfortable.</span> <span id="s26">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s28">Uh...Tell me about your family.</span> <span id="s29">How many people were in your family and what...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: We were 9 children, five brothers and....uh...six brothers and three sisters.</span> <span id="s31">And...uh...we all had been educated first of all in the German schools and then since 1918, we had the opportunity to be taught in the Polish schools.</span> <span id="s32">And in my case I had to go to the college also and did then I studied theology in Rome, being called according to my judgment and conviction to the priesthood I had to study theology, philosophy and theology.</span> <span id="s33">And I entered the Society of the Catholic Apostolite, and after the first preparation, that is to say, grammar school, college...uh...after I have finished also philosophy in Poland, I was sent to Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Could we...could we back up a little bit?</span> <span id="s35">I'd like to know a little more before we go into those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: About your childhood.</span> <span id="s38">When you were...uh...a young boy...uh...I'd like to know a little bit about what life was like for you and your parents as a young...as a young...when you were a young boy in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: You see, when I was 6 years old, then I started the grammar school.</span> <span id="s40">Yet in...in 1918, we.</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">we are very unhappy because of the war.</span> <span id="s43">And my father was convoked to the army as the officer because he was ordered the school, and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle between German...German and Russian soldiers, he was taken into Russian captivity already in 1915 and he was there, which he knew Russian of course, so his conditions of life were not so difficult there.</span> <span id="s44">And the...the Russians have esteemed him and used him rather for the more secretarial work, not handwork.</span> <span id="s45">In 1918, he benefited and profited by the...uh... disorder because of the Russian Revolution and the .</span> <span id="s46">You see, just by his judgment he knew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when Poland became independent, he also had to enter the Polish army.</span> <span id="s47">But after some months he came back home and continued his business work.</span> <span id="s48">He was an exporter of food to greater cities, also to Berlin, during the occupation of Poland by Germans.</span> <span id="s49">And so our conditions of life were rather good and we had the opportunity to be developed really in the atmosphere of a loving family.</span> <span id="s50">And when other members, my brothers and sisters heard about the my life's decision that I will go to priesthood, then they also sympathized with me and helped me really to reach that priesthood by their sympathy, by their prayers and so on.</span> <span id="s51">And so...and....uh...uh...in 1920, I went to the gymnasium of Naklo in Poland and...uh...there I was 2 years and then transferred to Wadowice to the high school of my society.</span> <span id="s52">And...uh...it was in the dioceses of Krakau.</span> <span id="s53">And...uh...then after I had finished the high school, I entered the preparatory school for priesthood and...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What made you decide to go on and to enter the preparatory school?</span> <span id="s55">Why did you become a priest?</span> <span id="s56">Want to become a priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: You see there was in me some conviction that this is my way of life.</span> <span id="s58">It was not my decision, strictly speaking or theologically speaking, but some preparation from above.</span> <span id="s59">You see, we do believe in...uh...in our faith that all the vocations of priesthood for religious life come from God himself.</span> <span id="s60">And no doubt in order that this cause may mature, you may live a very dignified and religious also family.</span> <span id="s61">My parents were very faithful members of the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">All my brothers and sisters too.</span> <span id="s63">It was really the proper atmosphere.</span> <span id="s64">Also helping to deepen my conviction, there is my place.</span> <span id="s65">And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to Rome to the University to study theology and...uh...to get a doctor degree in theology.</span> <span id="s66">So...uh...27 I went to Rome and for 4 years I studied there at the Gregorian university and at 31, I received the Priestly ordination and also my doctoral degree.</span> <span id="s67">And I went to Poland...back to Poland just to celebrate really my priesthood ordination in my...uh...parish where my family lived.</span> <span id="s68">And then my professor who became Rector of Polish Catholic Mission in France, he came also for the celebration of my priesthood in my parish where he was a vicar and then invited me to come to Paris just to help in his Secretariat.</span> <span id="s69">My superiors have allowed, and I spent the first year of my priesthood in France.</span> <span id="s70">Then 32 came back to Poland and start...and taught...uh...the proper in minor college and then in the superior classes.</span> <span id="s71">It was 4...uh...24.</span> <span id="s72">Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s73">24 and 28, first in the first classes of colleges and then superior classes.</span> <span id="s74">And in 1938...uh...the Primate of Poland, Archbishop of Poznan who was also Director of the...uh...Polish Catholic Mission outside Poland, he was asked by my former professor, Director of Polish Catholic mission, that my superiors may help...may really allow me to come again to France and work there.</span> <span id="s75">And...uh...I was working for some time and...uh...then in 1938, my superior, former teacher of Latin, has resigned and the Primate has nominated me as superior of the Polish Catholic Mission, that is to say of the Pastoral care of all Poles in Poland.</span> <span id="s76">And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for the Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them.</span> <span id="s77">Traveling from place after place during summer.</span> <span id="s78">It was some days in which I remember some Polish parish has celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of France.</span> <span id="s79">And then ...then when the war came, to France, 1939, we have really also suffered much.</span> <span id="s80">And then...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...Germany has occupied Paris.</span> <span id="s81">And...uh... here really is my great, I would say, for for martyrdom because in...on October 26, 1940 ...uh...Gestapo came to the Polish Catholic Mission in Paris and told me, "Gentleman.”</span> <span id="s82">He didn't call me father.</span> <span id="s83">"We have in possession all of your sermons which you delivered to the French radio to the Polish people against our German system.</span> <span id="s84">You will not be free anymore.</span> <span id="s85">This is the day that we make really the end to your freedom.</span> <span id="s86">You come with us and we will place you in the prison of Paris.”</span> <span id="s87">You see 26...26th of October 1940, I was arrested and placed then in prison in Paris.</span> <span id="s88">And then there I was...from October 26th to November 26th, 1940.</span> <span id="s89">That is to say, in the Paris, Parisian...Parisian prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Father, don't...don't worry about dates.</span> <span id="s91">Truly.</span> <span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Tell...tell me why you had been arrested.</span> <span id="s94">The Gestapo referred to radio programs.</span> <span id="s95">A: You see...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Because...because they collected my radio sermons and believed that I am great enemy of Nazis, and they have not tolerated...you see people also in France who would say something against them, for the Nazis, for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s98">You see their system was sacred.</span> <span id="s99">Nobody had the right to offend them.</span> <span id="s100">And then I always remained with the same conviction.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What had you been saying on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, that Nazism, Hitlerism is not only an enemy of Jewish people, but they are also anti- Christian system.</span> <span id="s103">That is to say, not only a system to purify Germany from Jewish population, but also to not with us.</span> <span id="s104">It was impossible for them, but to take really under their influence the whole Catholic church.</span> <span id="s105">And then...so in my radio sermons, as I told you enlighten by the French government, I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi Germany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system, but anti-Christian and human system.</span> <span id="s106">Everything what was for us dignified, you see, was just condemned by Nazis, rejected by Hitlerism.</span> <span id="s107">And do not forget I told them that the whole world is not dependant of Nazis, but God is taking care of us.</span> <span id="s108">And so do not cooperate.</span> <span id="s109">Do not get discouraged.</span> <span id="s110">You will suffer no doubt, but in your suffering you will find always our sympathy and the sympathy of the whole Europe.</span> <span id="s111">And because, you see, of this tax of this approach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person.</span> <span id="s112">So they considered me as an Enemy No. 1.</span> <span id="s113">And then from Paris after 1 month of being in prison, I was just transferred...transferred to Berlin, and on my way to in Berlin, I was few days in Trier, , Hanover, and came to Berlin on December the 10, 1940...1940 to Berlin, .</span> <span id="s114">And really that in Berlin was a place of torture.</span> <span id="s115">And...uh...you see no freedom.</span> <span id="s116">Just closed in the cell and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some part in the of all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s117">Twice a month I was able to leave the cell.</span> <span id="s118">Otherwise, cell was my unique, only place to live.</span> <span id="s119">But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I was really taken into the black cell, that is to say without a light, without a light, without water, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days.</span> <span id="s120">That is to say, imagine only you have no possibility to look through the window because everything was closed.</span> <span id="s121">You didn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it to you.</span> <span id="s122">After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted.</span> <span id="s123">But this was not sufficient for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">You see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated me so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living any more, but to be sure they took me to the hospital where conditions were certainly not easy but better than the prison.</span> <span id="s125">So after some days I have recuperated and then they have taken me back to the .</span> <span id="s126">But with more normal conditions of life.</span> <span id="s127">That is to say, I have received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the Priminate twice a month.</span> <span id="s128">And from I was from December 10, 40.</span> <span id="s129">On July 29, 41, I left Berlin and then transferred to the camp of Sachsenhausen close to Berlin.</span> <span id="s130">And then I came to Sachenhausen on July 29th, 41, and was there to February the 3rd, 1942.</span> <span id="s131">And there I was also...uh...well, what I say, exhausted.</span> <span id="s132">You see because the conditions in the camp of concentration are not easy or were not easy.</span> <span id="s133">Neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s134">And so after 3 weeks in the hospital, I was for them fit to be transported to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s136">Let's stop a moment.</span> <span id="s137">If you could.</span> <span id="s138">I want to put this down.</span> <span id="s139">Can we stop and pause the tape a moment please.</span> <span id="s140">Uh...Steven, are you there?</span> <span id="s141">Can you...we're having sawing or hammering of some kind coming through.</span> <span id="s142">Would you please?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Okay, Father we are back on camera.</span> <span id="s144">You had wanted to tell us the dates of where you were on each place.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: But I have already told you.</span> <span id="s146">Yes.</span> <span id="s147">And we came to Sachsenhausen and in Sachsenhausen I was from July 29, 41 to February, the 3rd, 1942.</span> <span id="s148">And then I was transferred to Dachau to the prisons of Kothen, Leipzig, and Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s149">And on February the 13th, 1942, I came to Dachau.</span> <span id="s150">And...uh...finally, we shall speak about it later, on Sunday, April 29, 1945, we were liberated.</span> <span id="s151">Yes.</span> <span id="s152">But in Sachsenhausen, you see, the conditions were not as cruel as in Dachau.</span> <span id="s153">And I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking care of cleaning the roads and the streets in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s154">Deprived of any liberty!</span></p> <p><span id="s155">And then...then, of course, I was not beaten there as the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s156">And so I still was able to continue my life in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s157">In Dachau, it was really not easy to live and to survive because as the renowned French politician wrote in his book, he was also in Dachau, and in his book, Liberate Root of Liberty, he says in that book that the Dachau for him was an organized Hell.</span> <span id="s158">And you see if somebody very intelligent person really writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in Hell, without any hope, without peace, without liberty.</span> <span id="s159">You have been considered just there as a mechanical instrument, moved here and there.</span> <span id="s160">And...uh...in my case as the Polish priest, also, we had to work everyday in this so called plantation.</span> <span id="s161">And the...the work was really not easy and then every day, every day the same work.</span> <span id="s162">And without enough food.</span> <span id="s163">And then with the spirit of persecution you see.</span> <span id="s164">All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work, we our not human and.</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">uh.</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">although...although they were very...uh...I would say... uh...against all of us.</span> <span id="s169">Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see.</span> <span id="s170">And we did when they have...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best.</span> <span id="s171">When they disappeared, we just relaxed.</span> <span id="s172">And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us.</span> <span id="s173">And you see, some Gestapo people were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness.</span> <span id="s174">And many people beaten, and the plantation had to be transferred to the so-called hospital in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">And there the Gestapo men finished them.</span> <span id="s176">You see, there was a hospital in Dachau.</span> <span id="s177">I was there also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs.</span> <span id="s178">And...uh...we didn't have the true conditions which a sick person should have in the hospital.</span> <span id="s179">You see, they treated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the proper food.</span> <span id="s180">But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and peace of heart.</span> <span id="s181">How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions?</span> <span id="s182">And I answered just by your faith.</span> <span id="s183">You see, if you believed in God, in his not only justice, but also Law, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to us, it is also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the other people.</span> <span id="s184">And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some suffering.</span> <span id="s185">St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to God that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete also that suffering by giving our part.</span> <span id="s186">And so if you have such faith that your suffering really can bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength to survive.</span> <span id="s187">And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you.</span> <span id="s188">It can break you if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of suffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can make you stronger.</span> <span id="s189">The more so stronger if you are a believer.</span> <span id="s190">If you think that everything is under the divine control.</span> <span id="s191">And in this faith and in this spirit you can really energize also your body and bring more peace for your daily life.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: How did that help you in Dachau?</span> <span id="s193">What was in...in Dachau, how did your faith help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">What...what kind of things did you do in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in Dachau.</span> <span id="s196">If your faith was not firm.</span> <span id="s197">Why?</span> <span id="s198">Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has also given to the German priest a chapel, and they had the possibility to have their prayers, devotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were allowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the chapel.</span> <span id="s199">But here the danger for some people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended to go to the chapel and pray a little.</span> <span id="s200">But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to the order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a chapel.</span> <span id="s201">And so the lay people said, "Well, how can I believe if this minister of God is so cruel just not to allow me to go to the chapel for a spiritual comfort?</span> <span id="s202">and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way.</span> <span id="s203">We have to answer, "There are also people among the priest who act not according to their conscious, but according to the order received from the civil authority.”</span> <span id="s204">But in order to replace for our use chapel here and there when we were not specially...specially controlled by Gestapo, we formed really little group of people, and consoled each other and prayed with each other and so some little common utarian groups have been formed.</span> <span id="s205">And also it was...uh.</span> <span id="s206">.</span> <span id="s207">for us also a joy when some priest custodian, not allowing according to the order of Gestapo enter the chapel to...not German priest, that he has just closed his eyes and allowed us to enter.</span> <span id="s208">And then so from time to time it was also for us a spiritual consolation to pray and this chapel was reserved only for German priests and...uh...well some priests were so friendly to us that they also brought to us some part of the Holy whole.</span> <span id="s209">You know what it means?</span> <span id="s210">Yes.</span> <span id="s211">And so we were...uh...also not only consoled by strength you see, by this sacramental help and assistance.</span> <span id="s212">So you must say that the German priests tried to help us also, but too many were fearful and fearful...and...for example, to such an extent, that they say, "No, I will not do it.</span> <span id="s213">I cannot.”</span> <span id="s214">When I was really in Berlin in the hospital after this torture of the Holy Week then some men who took care of us sick people...uh...he, knowing that I am priest, said, "Well, if you so wish I can prepare for you perhaps the possibility to say Mass.” And I said, "I would be so grateful to you, but you must ask the priest, the chaplain to give you all the instruments and say...for saying Mass.</span> <span id="s215">I approached the prison, say Father and told him, "Father," I have all the opportunities for saying Mass here without being controlled by anybody in some secret place.</span> <span id="s216">Will you be so kind and give me everything that is necessary for celebrating.”</span> <span id="s217">And he said, "Father, I am too afraid.</span> <span id="s218">Do you think that I should expose myself to go to Dachau?"</span> <span id="s219">"Never mind.”</span> <span id="s220">You see, we had also such sadness, such opportunities that on the one hand you had the possibility to be strengthened spiritually.</span> <span id="s221">On the other hand, fearful people who could help you and that chaplain was really...I would say very cranky even.</span> <span id="s222">He feared too much the Gestapo, and even Dachau.</span> <span id="s223">If really somebody is in the need spiritual...spiritual need I should help him, also if I will be exposed to some suffering.</span> <span id="s224">We all are members of one family.</span> <span id="s225">And members which should help one another.</span> <span id="s226">And so this spirit you see of common utarian sympathy assistance was lacking also in Dachau, but as a rule we must say that all the priests except those that were in the German block for priests...uh...with some exception of course...all other priests tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s227">And...uh...so in this case, we can also understand why we have survived being helped, assisted by others, although not materially but spiritually.</span> <span id="s228">By this assistance, we really received new energy for survival.</span> <span id="s229">So then after many months...you see, at the end of 1944, we have received the privilege to receive packages from our parents.</span> <span id="s230">And then really we have received many packages our families.</span> <span id="s231">They tried to do their best in order to send us packages with the necessary...uh...food in order to strengthen us.</span> <span id="s232">And as a rule, Gestapo has allowed us to accept to receive all the packages and so from October 1944 til the end of the concentration camp on Sunday, 29th, we really became stronger people.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">And we may say prepared for liberty not to go from concentration camp even to hospital or to some other institution.</span> <span id="s234">So packages sent us by our parents really were a great blessing for us.</span> <span id="s235">And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came intact without corruption.</span> <span id="s236">And then from other members of families, here and there there was food and damage by this or other conditions.</span> <span id="s237">And so one idea came to a priest and he composed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really giving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family also, but especially to our mothers.</span> <span id="s238">And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology, and came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love for a God.</span> <span id="s239">And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with the food, really made us more normal people.</span> <span id="s240">And...uh.</span> <span id="s241">.</span> <span id="s242">when I was also in Dachau in...uh...in the hospital for some days, one priest was dying and called, "Mother," in such despair.</span> <span id="s243">"My dearest Mother.”</span> <span id="s244">I approached him and told him, "Father, be consoled.</span> <span id="s245">You will find the blessed mother in Heaven.”</span> <span id="s246">And he said, "Father, do you understand the deep love of a dying person for a mother?"</span> <span id="s247">And I said, "Well, I was not in this state of dying yet, but I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of life.”</span> <span id="s248">You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for a mother, and the love of Mother for us.</span> <span id="s249">Mother lives for her children.</span> <span id="s250">Not always children live for their mothers.</span> <span id="s251">But our suffering, for example, in this case in Dachau really renewed in us the worthiness.</span> <span id="s252">There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our mother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an extent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us.</span> <span id="s253">So then came the blessed day of...uh...April 29.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Can we hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s255">I would like not to get to the liberation yet.</span> <span id="s256">I would like to go back for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: You have mentioned being in the hospital several times.</span> <span id="s259">Could you tell us about the events that led up to your being in the hospital and you told me an extraordinary story before.</span> <span id="s260">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You see, when we speak of the hospital in Dachau or in Sachsenhausen then we should not believe that the name of hospital was identical with the conditions of a civilized hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">You were there only an instrument...uh...which really received here...here and there some care, but most minimal.</span> <span id="s263">When you came to hospital, then all the people who took care of the sick people believed you came here to die.</span> <span id="s264">And so if you didn't have the interior strength and the...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to survive that.</span> <span id="s265">And so many people really died there and how many?</span> <span id="s266">Well, for example, in Dachau 868 Polish priests perished.</span> <span id="s267">Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in the medical experiments, by torture in the prison .</span> <span id="s268">And the Polish clergy Dachau order no.</span> <span id="s269">clergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718.</span> <span id="s270">And as I already told you, 868 were...died, and was martyred, of course.</span> <span id="s271">And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests slowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent that they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in Dachau has ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood.</span> <span id="s272">You see, unheard...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did you see the ordination?</span> <span id="s274">A: Yes, I..</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">we did.</span> <span id="s277">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s279">Please.</span> <span id="s280">Put...put that down.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner.</span> <span id="s282">He was ordained by the French Bishop.</span> <span id="s283">Q: Tell us about that ordination as you saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Well, for us it was great day not only because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl Lisner, but because we really....uh...have...have experienced some spiritual atmosphere.</span> <span id="s285">You see, when you are deprived of any spiritual assistance and help and ordinary conditions of human dignified life, when you take part in such a great ceremony then you are liberated really and strengthened.</span> <span id="s286">And perhaps in our materialistic times, we do not realize...uh...what kind of help and assistance we are losing, becoming indifferent to all the religious exercises and so on.</span> <span id="s287">In that...in that...uh...concentration camp when, for example, such occasions happened that we had the possibility to assist during the Mass or before the Moment in the chapel or in this case, to be witnesses of the ordination.</span> <span id="s288">Oh, this was really a day of great spiritual elevation.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: The Germans permitted this ordination?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: You see, it was already...already 1944, as I said.</span> <span id="s291">He was ordained...ordained by the bishop in December 44, and from October 1944, we had already better conditions because of food we have received from our families.</span> <span id="s292">So this is the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: You had started...we sort of got off the track a little bit to tell about your experience in the hospital.</span> <span id="s294">How did you come to be in the hospital in the first place?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: You see, because work in...in the plantation, I collapsed out of exhaustion.</span> <span id="s296">And so I was unable to walk, to move.</span> <span id="s297">So the so-called Kapo, you see of that group of people in which I also worked, ordered some people to bring some...uh...uh...car that I may be transferred to the hospital.</span> <span id="s298">And so I suppose that the reason, the only reason was the exhaustion.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">And...uh...I didn't...didn't get much medical help, but I had the possibility to relax, to be free from the work.</span> <span id="s300">And did then also after some days, the possibility to approach the other prisoners also sick and console and strengthen them.</span> <span id="s301">And so in some case, it was not only a blessing for me to be there in the hospital but also for those who needed also some advice, some help, some encouragement and so on because many sick people out of exhaustion, of being deprived of any assistance, help and encouragement died.</span> <span id="s302">Or if they didn't die, they die yet, then they were more murdered and burned in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You had said also you were in the hospital another time for your legs.</span> <span id="s304">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s305">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Could you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there.</span> <span id="s308">There had seen what happened and given me some...uh...I would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the wounds.</span> <span id="s309">I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if you...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to overcome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to crematorium.</span> <span id="s310">You see when you speak of Dachau, then you just cannot think of normal conditions of human life.</span> <span id="s311">The more so of the proper conditions in the hospitals.</span> <span id="s312">They had to reopen also hospitals you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion also.</span> <span id="s313">So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in the concentration camps, then they just try also to visit or show here we also hospital we care of the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us, to ask how do you feel.</span> <span id="s314">And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the hospital, then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see.</span> <span id="s315">But really inhuman conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s317">Were you...uh...ever beaten and tortured in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of.</span> <span id="s319">This was the case.</span> <span id="s320">And so, for example, if...if I was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Perhaps because I was priest.</span> <span id="s322">But they didn't assist me.</span> <span id="s323">You had to just take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s324">And other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture.</span> <span id="s325">Many, many people really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to them that they had to finish their life.</span> <span id="s326">So conditions which were not human you see, and because of this you can understand why the many also writers, as I have quoted , the French writer, why they have spoken of Dachau as of the organized Hell.</span> <span id="s327">And many people really died and tortured in Dachau.</span> <span id="s328">I told you about, for example, Polish priest.</span> <span id="s329">We were there 1,718 and 868 perished.</span> <span id="s330">That is to say, died.</span> <span id="s331">And...uh...300 of them.</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">uh.</span> <span id="s334">.</span> <span id="s335">died because of tortured suffered in the medical experiments.</span> <span id="s336">The doctors tried to see what they can expect from...from...uh..., for example, if the tortured such person to such an extent or another one.</span> <span id="s337">You see, we are experimental people.</span> <span id="s338">And...uh...we must say that... uh...the German priest were rather more protected than we, the priest of other nationalities and the more so lay people.</span> <span id="s339">But some people knew how to organize also their lives and survive in better conditions.</span> <span id="s340">This is the case.</span> <span id="s341">And so then came the day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: At this point, we pause.</span> <span id="s343">We need to pause here and we will change tapes and then we will talk about liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Let us go back.</span> <span id="s347">If you would put that down.</span> <span id="s348">I would like to ask you now that the tape is on.</span> <span id="s349">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: The questions I asked I asked you when the tape was off.</span> <span id="s351">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s352">Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Uh...Could you tell me first, please, how you went about...uh...saying confession in Dachau.</span> <span id="s354">A: You see.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s356">You're on.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we were hidden in some corner of the concentration camp because to hear confessions...you see it was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture, and we tried to help the people that really in such way that these are became the victims of torture.</span> <span id="s358">And, also, during the work when we were not controlled by Gestapo, some people came to us and...uh...working a little, we have heard their confession and of course, tried to help them, strengthen them, to deepen their faith, confidence.</span> <span id="s359">And then, you see, one thing that you can communicate with another person and share, things which are great interest for you is most helpful, particularly in such conditions in which we lived in...in Dachau.</span> <span id="s360">And...uh...because of this we must say and repeat again that suffering can break, but also make you.</span> <span id="s361">Through suffering you can benefit so much that you can have an idea of it only after you finish your way of the cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">And...uh...this is really so that we may open our eyes more fully to the mysteries of our life, to the mysteries of our destiny, and then in our Christian life to complete what is wrong thing of the suffering of Christ for us.</span> <span id="s363">YOu see, Christ, according to our faith, has paid the majority of the price for the ticket to Heaven, but on the condition that we also give our part that the price may be made fuller.</span> <span id="s364">If we are not interested in it, then the precious suffering of Christ for us, for you, for...a person is lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: In Dachau, how did you help comfort people?</span> <span id="s366">Was this legal and open in the daytime or did you have to do it illegally and secretly?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Uh...Secretly.</span> <span id="s368">It was not allowed legally to bring to the people some religious comfort.</span> <span id="s369">You see, Nazi's most really diabolical system, trying to finish with faith, with religion and annilihate, everything what was not Hitlerism.</span> <span id="s370">It's a totalarian system, and then anti-Christian among the religious and no doubt that the Jewish people suffered really many losses but it was also and so because for Hitler, Judaism was a religion and then after finishing Judaism, they would like to finish Christianity.</span> <span id="s371">But they didn't have the possibility of it.</span> <span id="s372">You see there was a diabolical system .</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: How did you go about trying to bring comfort?</span> <span id="s374">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Well, you see, first of all, then we have offered to them a promise to help if we can and this are another case because they came to also with some difficulties in their work, in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: The other prisoners you mean?</span> <span id="s377">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: And so if you can help me, well how and this way or anther.</span> <span id="s380">And then particularly to...they came to receive some spiritual help, spiritual assistance that is to say to revive their faith that we live not only here on earth.</span> <span id="s381">This is only prelude to our eternal happiness, which we should deserve also by our suffering.</span> <span id="s382">And...uh...for some people there was also the question, "Why should a God permit such suffering?"</span> <span id="s383">You see, why?</span> <span id="s384">He is God.</span> <span id="s385">And so we had to explain to them that suffering, as such, is a part of our life.</span> <span id="s386">That Hitler has brought to us such really tremendous suffering, it is really his guilt, his responsibility and for us, and the patient to suffer it as much as we can for our greater and .</span> <span id="s387">You see nothing happens in the history of humankind without the permission of the of the divine providence.</span> <span id="s388">Nothing can happen.</span> <span id="s389">And so we must say, "But why God permits sufferings?"</span> <span id="s390">Well, this is for the cure.</span> <span id="s391">We should really admit it that sometimes we come in our life to such better development that no other medical, physical or spiritual, can be helpful to us except suffering because in the days and or hours of sufferings we really came to the better...uh...recognitions of our conditions of life.</span> <span id="s392">And there is also an importunity for the renewal of our faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">And...uh...uh...the opportunity to strength our whole.</span> <span id="s394">My suffering will be rewarded there.</span> <span id="s395">Here is a temporary only pilgrimage for me.</span> <span id="s396">There will be eternity.</span> <span id="s397">And so your faith, you see, was the greatest help in overcoming your suffering, despair, and to collapse.</span> <span id="s398">Without your spirit strength, it was impossible just not to collapse.</span> <span id="s399">Our body has very limited energy and if that body is not energized by our spirit and some reasonable explanation of your position or your suffering, then there is no hope of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you come into contact with non-Christians while you were in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Uh...Very rarely, because you see that they had separated the Jews and...uh...other Muslims, if they were there, from us.</span> <span id="s402">And it was only accidentally that we met, for example, some Jews or some Muslims.</span> <span id="s403">And otherwise you see Christian people were not so limited in their liberty to communicate as we with non-Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s405">You had started to tell us you...what happened as liberation approached.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: You see then in April we all remained in 45...we already heard of the victory of anti- German...uh...German soldiers, in the battlefields, and it was for us also a great help and assistance for strengthening our bodies, our minds, and our lives.</span> <span id="s409">But slowly in April...in April, we noticed that German soldiers really are collapsing on the front, receiving here or there some information and then we have also heard that the American soldiers are approaching and so also Dachau.</span> <span id="s410">And...uh...some movement...uh...of the Gestapo people in Dachau on April 28 told us that really the American army is approaching.</span> <span id="s411">And you see all the Gestapo people and controllers of our blocks left their place and we remained alone without indigilence.</span> <span id="s412">So we left our blocks, not going to work, and tried to come to the big public place of our official reunions.</span> <span id="s413">And that's one moment this approaching one soldiers to the tower and slowly, the Germans soldiers you see do not defend him to enter the concentration camp knowing that they are lost already.</span> <span id="s414">So the first soldier, American soldier you see, who came there to Dachau was a lady, and she was Miss.</span> <span id="s415">Margaret Higgins of Washington Post or New York Times, and she was such tremendously benevolent lady.</span> <span id="s416">We didn't recognize her as a lady and so everybody has kissed her and embraced her.</span> <span id="s417">She also and finally reunion, but finally, she said, "I am a lady in the sold...in the soldier's uniform," but don't fear.</span> <span id="s418">I am here just to help you as much as I can.</span> <span id="s419">And so we sang hymns of her thanksgiving to that lady.</span> <span id="s420">For us at that time, the great liberator.</span> <span id="s421">That is to say she came to us really as the representative of the American army, and after our first congratulations and songs of Hallulah...uh...other American soldiers entered Dachau and what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Brought many cars of food.</span> <span id="s423">And so we all have been invited to come and take as much as we only wished.</span> <span id="s424">It was a glorious day.</span> <span id="s425">And you see for some people it was the dangerous day because they had eaten too much and collapsed.</span> <span id="s426">You just cannot change your system, you see, so rapidly.</span> <span id="s427">But you just...uh...uh... should admit one thing.</span> <span id="s428">That your body is just asking you to fill it with food and food.</span> <span id="s429">If you have not guided your knowledge and with your mind, well you have taken too much.</span> <span id="s430">And then after the glorious day, we have...uh...received also the permission to prepare ourselves for leaving...uh...Dachau.</span> <span id="s431">And what that means, you have disposal to ask.</span> <span id="s432">And the...the French...French... uh...Consul from Paris sent really to...uh...Dachau some cards and in one card they have invited me also to join them, the Parisians, and come back to Paris.</span> <span id="s433">And so it was a victorious day.</span> <span id="s434">And because of the packages which I have received from my family as other prisoners do, I was strong enough just to take again my office of Director of Polish Catholic Mission and function there and liberate the priest who helped...suffered for me with great, really willingness to do whatever he was able to do.</span> <span id="s435">And so already at.</span> <span id="s436">.</span> <span id="s437">uh...uh...I..</span> <span id="s438">.</span> <span id="s439">I would say...at the end of Spring we really have recuperated fully and continued our work.</span> <span id="s440">Some people still trying to find means, for example, the Poles to come back to Poland; other group to Italy and so on.</span> <span id="s441">I was personally in this good position that I was stable to reach Paris...uh...some 3 or 4 days after liberation and.</span> <span id="s442">.</span> <span id="s443">uh...live my normal life.</span> <span id="s444">But having possibility I tried to use them to bring also help to other people in Dachau and help them or assist them in their return to their places.</span> <span id="s445">And so Friday was the end of our real remarkable which for men became only torture one after the other, and many really ...uh...died and didn't survive to experience the date of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Such is the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Indeed.</span> <span id="s448">If you're are in Paris and your story is not over.</span> <span id="s449">A: Not over.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: You're in Paris and you, I gather, was not in quite Paris either.</span> <span id="s451">The Communists didn't like you you told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s453">You see...</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I continued my work for two years.</span> <span id="s456">But being free and...uh.</span> <span id="s457">.</span> <span id="s458">in agreement with the French government, I tried to purify the Polish parishes in France from any Communistic influence.</span> <span id="s459">And...uh...to such an extent slowly...uh...uh...the General Council of Polish Communistic Government, you see, went to...uh...uh...the First Minister of French Government...uh...saying that I am just intolerable, that I persecute the peaceful people.</span> <span id="s460">And so some person was sent to me just to find out what is the matter.</span> <span id="s461">And I told him, "Well, you see, such is the case that we were not only against the Nazis, but also against Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">And for us Communists was also intolerable.</span> <span id="s463">And there are so many, so many communistic delegates from Russia to Polish groups that I had to defend our Polish citizens against this infiltration of communistic sick... sickness.”</span> <span id="s464">And then I really never allowed to infiltrate in our Polish organization...we never allowed the communists to really bring to them some damage.</span> <span id="s465">And I have received the answer of the communist...the French government congratulations.</span> <span id="s466">Yes.</span> <span id="s467">The former anti-really to hide the people that they may not become victims of communists, but now you see the...no photographs here.</span> <span id="s468">The communists...the communists after they have not received any help from ...from French government and to pacify me, they went to the upper story to delegate.</span> <span id="s469">And what did they do?</span> <span id="s470">They told him, "Your Excellency.</span> <span id="s471">Certainly Christianity can develop only in peaceful conditions of co- living and that this present and you must correct him or even dismiss him.”</span> <span id="s472">And so after the...uh...uh... communistic country left, the upper story delegates, the delegate of delegate, the future Pope...uh...jumped when he heard, call me and asked, "Father, what is the matter?</span> <span id="s473">I have received here so many accusations that you do not allow the people to live in peace and calm.”</span> <span id="s474">And I said, "Of course.</span> <span id="s475">We must now purify our ranks from communistic...communistic influence.”</span> <span id="s476">"And what about your relationship with the Polish government?"</span> <span id="s477">"I do not acknowledge the communistic government and the Consul General who...uh...calls himself Polish General Consul, is for me not any representative of Polish government because this Polish government is fully and entirely strange to our Polish...uh...people.</span> <span id="s478">And I will never allow to...the communists to infiltrate our Polish ranks.”</span> <span id="s479">And he said, "Well, you are responsible for your conditions of life, but try only not to offend them.”</span> <span id="s480">And I said, "Well, the...these communists personally will never be offended by me in my conversation, in my repression, and so on.”</span> <span id="s481">And I told the delegate, "If the communistic consul general comes to our church...uh...to the Polish church, I will accept him really as the faith will.</span> <span id="s482">I will also hear his confession.</span> <span id="s483">And so be sure that in the matter of religion, those communists will not be persecuted.</span> <span id="s484">If they would like to become really faithful to the church, they will have all the opportunities barred to bring the communistic poison to our Polish ranks will be excluded, but you see when the communistic ambassador didn't succeed to pacify me, going to the French government, and then...uh...to the upper story...to delegate, they went to the Provincial Superior of my Province in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s485">And they said, "If you do not dismiss Father Cegielka from the office of the Superior of Polish Catholic Mission, we will close your houses.</span> <span id="s486">And the Provincial answered, "He is not subject to me in his office.</span> <span id="s487">He was nominated by the Cardinal , the Prime of the Poland.</span> <span id="s488">And so I have no power.</span> <span id="s489">I cannot do anything.”</span> <span id="s490">And so the communists have understood that he cannot do anything and cannot just send me away from my office.</span> <span id="s491">So they went to the General and said, "If you do not dismiss this man from the office in Paris, that will be end of...uh...many priests in Poland.”</span> <span id="s492">And so the General...the General</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: The General of your order?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s495">The General wrote to me saying, "Father, you see I have received such bad news that they will close many things which are dear to us.</span> <span id="s496">Our schools, institution, and so on.</span> <span id="s497">And perhaps it would be advisable that you will ask the Primate to...uh...free you from that office.”</span> <span id="s498">And so because it was the interest of the society which I belonged, I asked Primate just to free me from this office and he...he received...has written me letter, "Father, with great really sadness, I must really give you the possibility to leave your office of the Polish...of the Director of the Polish Catholic Mission, but I take this with a great sorrow because you are needed so much here.”</span> <span id="s499">So after he wrote me this letter, I really asked him to nominate his successor.</span> <span id="s500">And he said the best thing would be that he who has helped the Polish mission during your concentration camp, may now take that...uh...office instead of your .</span> <span id="s501">You see this was the case of the decision to send me to honorary camp.</span> <span id="s502">That is to say I was unable to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s503">Unable also to work in France because they would...they communists would have suspicioned that I just had left...left my office, but still not being officially called Director, I still infiltrate all the possibility...possibility sections and bring...bring really for them great losses.</span> <span id="s504">So the General asked me to come to Rome for some months.</span> <span id="s505">I was helping him a little here and there, and then from America he has received some petitions from...uh...congregations of Sisters to send some priest to America who would give them retreats.</span> <span id="s506">You know what a treat is?</span> <span id="s507">Yes.</span> <span id="s508">And so he asked me whether I would go.</span> <span id="s509">"Of course, if you wish.”</span> <span id="s510">And so I came to America.</span> <span id="s511">And being here, I was invited...uh...to give retreats in many places so I was traveling from place to place.</span> <span id="s512">I was even asked to come to South Africa.</span> <span id="s513">Twice I was there.</span> <span id="s514">And to Canada.</span> <span id="s515">And always busy, busy .</span> <span id="s516">And after 20 years of giving retreats, you see, I had to...uh...relax because of the constant traveling and in 1968, I received the position of Proper Sorrow, of college person and then in Philadelphia was teaching, and teaching the students in colleges.</span> <span id="s517">I was also composing a special manuals, you see, to help them just not only to hear, but to read and when they read the material which we have explained to them and really accept some Christian education and Christian philosophy in college.</span> <span id="s518">And...uh...during the last years of my teaching, I received some special privilege.</span> <span id="s519">That is to say, in 72 and something 70, I was nominated as outstanding educator of America, a honor for me.</span> <span id="s520">Yes.</span> <span id="s521">And...uh...then I had to stay with my society , and I now am the Director of Infant Jesus Shrine.</span> <span id="s522">That is to say some charter to which come pilgrimages...uh...and get also some spiritual help.</span> <span id="s523">So this would be the end.</span> <span id="s524">Thank you so very kindly.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Father, thank you very, very much.</span> <span id="s526">A: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: You are very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Thank you for renewed thanks and for your
