This is Edith Millman, interviewing Mrs. Rita Harmelin.</span> <span id="s3">Mrs. Harmelin lives in Australia.</span> <span id="s4">Today is April 26, 1992.</span> <span id="s5">Rita, can you tell me when and where you were born, and a little bit about your early childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">RH: Right.</span> <span id="s7">I was born on the 17th of June, 1925, in Bucharest, Romania.</span> <span id="s8">My parents were not Romanian.</span> <span id="s9">They were Polish, but my father went to Romania after the First World War, when he couldn't get a job in Poland—as a Jew—because they were giving jobs to Polish teachers first.</span> <span id="s10">And in Romania he had a relative who found, who had some contacts and he had a very good job in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s11">We [tape off then on].</span></p> <p><span id="s12">EM: You mentioned that your father couldn't find a job as a teacher.</span> <span id="s13">Was he a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">RH: Yes, that was his profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">EM: Tell me a little bit what you remember about your life in Romania.</span> <span id="s16">If anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">RH: I remember quite well.</span> <span id="s18">Our life in Romania was very, very good, very pleasant as a child.</span> <span id="s19">My parents were very young, and they hadn't been married long, so they had plenty of friends and lots of entertainment.</span> <span id="s20">I'm not sure, but I think, that after ten years of their, of my father's stay in Romania, he had some difficulties with extending his stay in Romania, because at that time in Romania antisemitic, ...</span></p> <p><span id="s21">EM: Feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">RH: Feelings started to show, and they were at least towards foreigners.</span> <span id="s23">And perhaps my mother was homesick, so they decided to return to Poland.</span> <span id="s24">And that was 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EM: Where in Poland did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">RH: We went to, in Poland we went to live in a little town called Sambor in the south east of Poland, where my, both my parents came from.</span> <span id="s27">They used to live close to each other and the families were very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">EM: Could you tell me about, something about your early religious experience?</span> <span id="s29">Was it an Orthodox home?</span> <span id="s30">Or was it...</span></p> <p><span id="s31">RH: No, it wasn't Orthodox, but it was traditional in the way that, my parents came from a traditional religious home.</span> <span id="s32">They, the grandparents, I know, were very religious, but I don't think the distinction between Orthodox and, and Conservative was so great, because there was no Reform in Judaism then.</span> <span id="s33">So everybody did the same thing, actually.</span> <span id="s34">Perhaps my parents, having lived abroad, did not observe it so strictly, but the ho me was kosher and they used to go to the synagogue twice a year as...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EM: Regularly?</span> <span id="s36">Twice a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">RH: I mean they, for the holidays, for the great holidays.</span> <span id="s38">I remember my mother telling me that while she was in Bucharest she used to go every Friday evening to the synagogue as well, because they had some very nice and very beautiful services.</span> <span id="s39">But I was not, exposed to this, and I don't, was not made to do it.</span> <span id="s40">On the other hand, when I started going to school, I also went every day six days a week, for two hours to Hebrew school, where I learned some Hebrew language, and some history, as well as prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">EM: Was this Hebrew school a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">RH: It was a private Jewish school.</span> <span id="s43">It was supported by the Jewish community and also we paid fees for tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">EM: Tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">RH: Tuition, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">EM: Who were the teachers?</span> <span id="s47">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">RH: There was only one teacher, and his name was Feingold.</span> <span id="s49">He was a poor man, because the Jewish children gave him a little bit of trouble, and he also was, I think he was an asthmatic.</span> <span id="s50">So, I remember we gave him a lot of, because there were classes for, from, I think from eight year olds to twelve or fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s51">So, every class was a different...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">EM: Level and a different kind of children.</span> <span id="s53">Was it co-educational?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">Yes.</span> <span id="s56">It was co-educational, and there was even a voluntary school inspector.</span> <span id="s57">And I don't remember, I think we have even exams once a year, which, in Poland we didn't have exams in ordinary school, in the elementary school.</span> <span id="s58">We didn't have any exams at the end of the year, but in this school we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EM: You went to a public school for your...</span></p> <p><span id="s60">RH: I went to a public school for a formal education.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">EM: Secondary?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">RH: For a primary education.</span> <span id="s63">For a secondary there was only one high school in our city, which was private.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">EM: In the public school, do you remember approximately the percentage of Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">RH: I would think there was at least 30 percent, possibly more, possibly less.</span> <span id="s66">I really can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">EM: Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">RH: I mean, if I could think about it longer, but I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">EM: Do you remember about religious instructions for the non-Jewish kids?</span> <span id="s70">Was it in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">RH: There was religious instruction for non-Jewish school, but then also in the public school there was instruction for Jewish children at the same time.</span> <span id="s72">Only, they were taught by a priest.</span> <span id="s73">And we were taught by a layman, but a civilian religion teacher he was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EM: What did you learn in this religious, religion class?</span> <span id="s75">Was it history?</span> <span id="s76">Was it prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">RH: It was a little bit of everything.</span> <span id="s78">And not so many prayers, maybe the main ones, which we learned more of in this Hebrew school that I went to after.</span> <span id="s79">But we definitely had religious class once a week.</span> <span id="s80">I can't remember how long it was, possibly an hour.</span> <span id="s81">And we definitely learned history.</span> <span id="s82">And we learned Torah.</span> <span id="s83">Perhaps this was combined, or this was considered history, but we did learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">EM: Could you tell me if you had any Gentile friends, and any antisemitic feelings that you detected among your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">RH: Well, antisemitic feelings, we always detected, slightly.</span> <span id="s86">And they were never flaunted by the teachers.</span> <span id="s87">There were some antisemitic teachers, but as far as the primary schools was concerned, there wasn't so much of it as later perhaps, in high school.</span> <span id="s88">Not, notwithstanding that the high school was private, and it was actually founded by a Jew.</span> <span id="s89">But as far having Gentile friends, I did have some.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">EM: Could you tell me approximately how many Jews lived in, was this all in Sambor?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">RH: No, because after three years we settled in another town, in, not very far from Sambor.</span> <span id="s92">It was an oil well town called Boryslaw, and so called Zaglebie Naftowe, which I don't know how to translate into English.</span> <span id="s93">And we had about a third in the, the population before the war was about 30 odd thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">EM: There were, I'm sorry...</span></p> <p><span id="s95">RH: Population before the war, in Boryslaw, was about 30 odd thousand people.</span> <span id="s96">It later grew to about 45.</span> <span id="s97">And it was nearly evenly divided between Jews, Poles, and Ukraines.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">EM: In your experience, were, who was more antisemitic?</span> <span id="s99">The Ukrainians or the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">RH: Well, I can't say that one was worse than the other.</span> <span id="s101">They were both, and, you know, they, there were a lot of them who didn't know much about Jews, who were taught by their priests to hate them, so they hated them.</span> <span id="s102">Once they came in contact, for instance, at school, or in business, my father for instance has a very, had a very good friend.</span> <span id="s103">We found out that his son was a great antisemite, and he used to beat up Jewish students in Lwow.</span> <span id="s104">But were not, he met me after the war, and he said, "Where's father?"</span> <span id="s105">I said, "He's gone."</span> <span id="s106">He says, "I didn't know if he survived it."</span> <span id="s107">And he started to cry.</span> <span id="s108">And he said, "Brauner [RH’s maiden name] was the only honest man I ever knew."</span> <span id="s109">You see?</span> <span id="s110">So only on, on the level of individual acquaintances, there were some who may have been antisemitic in theory, but they were decent people, and they did the right thing.</span> <span id="s111">A lot of them did the right thing, but, the majority, whether they were, and also, Ukrainians hid me during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">EM: Eh, regarding...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">RH: Ukrainians...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EM: Oh, Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">RH: So, you really can't, can't say who was better, who was worse.</span> <span id="s116">They were all more or less tagged with the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">EM: I'm, yes, I want, I am driving at, in school, did you have more trouble with Ukrainian or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">RH: Well, it's hard to say.</span> <span id="s119">I had only Ukrainian girls with me in high, in primary school.</span> <span id="s120">In high school, they didn't come to the same high school.</span> <span id="s121">They traveled, Ukrainians traveled to the next town, where there was a Ukrainian high school.</span> <span id="s122">But I also had friends, Ukrainian girls, single.</span> <span id="s123">I wouldn't say a lot, but, I can't say who were, that I had any trouble with anybody, really, personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">EM: Did your parents socialize with non-Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s125">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">EM: People?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">RH: No.</span> <span id="s128">My father told me he had a good Polish friend during the war, the First World War, in, when they were in trenches together, a Pole.</span> <span id="s129">My mother had a school friend, a Ukrainian girl, when she went to school, before the First World War.</span> <span id="s130">But they never socialized in our town with anybody ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">EM: What kind of job did your father have?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">RH: Well, what I, when we went, when we came to Boryslaw, he was self-employed.</span> <span id="s133">He owned a printing factory in partnership with, also his old buddy from, from the war times, who was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">EM: You men-, could you, do you know in which army he served?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">EM: During the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">RH: Sure.</span> <span id="s138">He served in the Austria-Hungarian army, and he attained a rank of lieutenant.</span> <span id="s139">And when the war was over, he was demobilized and he came back, because that was somewhere on the front.</span> <span id="s140">I don't know.</span> <span id="s141">And then, he came back to his place of, of birth.</span> <span id="s142">All of a sudden that was Poland already, because Poland got, had independence, got into the Treaty of Versailles in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">EM: All right, tell me something more about your family.</span> <span id="s144">Your, did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">RH: No.</span> <span id="s146">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s147">But my parents both had quite big families.</span> <span id="s148">My father had four brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s149">My mother had five brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s150">And most of them were married, and most of them had children, but very few survived.</span> <span id="s151">[tape off ]</span></p> <p><span id="s152">EM: Could you tell me what you remember about the atmosphere in Boryslaw shortly before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">RH: Well, there were a few people who did expect the war to come.</span> <span id="s154">We knew about the things happening in Germany, because there were refugees from Germany and Austria on the Polish borders.</span> <span id="s155">And they weren't allowed to come into, so far east to Poland, except singular cases.</span> <span id="s156">So we did hear about the atrocities that were happening all over Germany towards the German citizens.</span> <span id="s157">But frankly, very few of us believed it.</span> <span id="s158">And there was a, no, no, special apprehension.</span> <span id="s159">And there was no, no special preparation for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">EM: Did you expect the war to break out?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">RH: Well, I was only 14, and I really didn't care very much, because I didn't understand this.</span> <span id="s162">My parents were talking about it, and other grownups were talking about it.</span> <span id="s163">But I really can't tell now what they were really saying, what they meant when, what they were saying, I know, that we didn't know what war was.</span> <span id="s164">We didn't know what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EM: One more thing.</span> <span id="s166">Did you belong to any Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">RH: No.</span> <span id="s168">Because, in our city there were some, but I was really too young to be interested, and I was terribly busy with school work, and with Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s169">And I learned music and I was running around all day, from one type of learning to another.</span> <span id="s170">And I didn't, I didn't belong to any.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">EM: Or did, do you know if your parents or any other members of the family belonged to Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">RH: Well, I know one cousin that, but I don't know, my parents, my mother belonged to WIZO.</span> <span id="s173">That I remember.</span> <span id="s174">I don't think my father did.</span> <span id="s175">I know another cousin belonged to the Betar.</span> <span id="s176">And that's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">EM: Was there a Kehillah in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">RH: Yes, I'm sure it was.</span> <span id="s179">There was also apart from the Hebrew school there was a Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s180">And there was a shochet, where we took our chickens to be killed.</span> <span id="s181">That's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">EM: Did your mother light candles on Friday night?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">RH: Yes, yes she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">EM: All right, let's go back to the war.</span> <span id="s185">What do you remember of the first days of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">RH: That's very silly, because I, what I remember is when the war started and we started hearing the planes—now I should have known better because I was 14—but I climbed into the attic, and looked through the opening somewhere to see the planes better.</span> <span id="s187">And that's about all.</span> <span id="s188">In a few days after the start of the war, we heard a noise, and there were German troops came in.</span> <span id="s189">And we, of course then, we started being scared.</span> <span id="s190">Although we still didn't know, because they were just in, troops.</span> <span id="s191">And they didn't do anything much, because just then Germany and Soviet Union signed a treaty, by which they divided Poland.</span> <span id="s192">And within, I can't remember that, it was a week or two or something like that, the Germans marched out again, and the Russian troops came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">EM: In that one week that the Germans occupied Boryslaw, were there any antisemitic incidents perpetrated by the...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">RH: By the Germans or by the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">EM: Well, both.</span> <span id="s196">First by the Germans, and then also by the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">RH: To tell you the truth, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s198">I can't remember, so, [tape off]</span></p> <p><span id="s199">EM: What happened when the Russians marched in?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">RH: Well, when the Russians marched in, everybody at first was more scared than when the Germans marched in, because we knew the Germans at least were civilized people, and we didn't know much about Russians except what old people remembered about the Cossacks, the First World War.</span> <span id="s201">And then, and they started first of all dissolving, taking over the industries, taking over the so-called bourgeois flats and houses and so on.</span> <span id="s202">The one good thing that I can say about them was that within a few weeks, they reopened the schools, which the Germans closed, for Jews as well as for non-Jews.</span> <span id="s203">And of course after that they started the great Russian propaganda, Soviet Communist propaganda.</span> <span id="s204">And, for instance, because my father owned a printing factory before the war, which was not a printing factory like you can imagine.</span> <span id="s205">It was a small thing that we just earned a small living at, but because he was an owner, some of his own workers, to whom he was very good and very human, even more than that, they sort of told the authorities that he shouldn't be working there, even as one of them.</span> <span id="s206">And they gave him a card which prohibited him from getting any job at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">EM: Were these workers that worked for your father Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">RH: Jewish.</span> <span id="s209">They were Jewish, particularly I remember one boy, right, who my father stayed, he was quite capable, but he, because he was very poor, he couldn't have any education.</span> <span id="s210">My father used to stay three times a week after work with him, to teach him, since he was a teacher anyway.</span> <span id="s211">He taught him a lot of things, and he was the first one who, who said, "Now, he's a rich man.</span> <span id="s212">He mustn't be here."</span> <span id="s213">And they took away, of course, the printing factories were one of the first to be nationalized by the Russians, because there was the danger that something will be printed which, of which they don't approve.</span> <span id="s214">But, they wouldn't allow him even to stay there as a worker, because his ex-workers just weren't behind him.</span> <span id="s215">And they never supported him.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EM: What kind of job did your father get?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">RH: After a few months, a good few months, we used to have a neighbor, who was a Ukrainian, who was, in, in Polish times he was a school teacher.</span> <span id="s218">And when the Russians came, they made him a school inspector, because the Soviet population thought that the Ukrainians were all with them, which of course they weren't.</span> <span id="s219">But, at least they had a little, a few more privileges, definitely more than the Poles.</span> <span id="s220">So this man became a school inspector.</span> <span id="s221">And he didn't care about that paper that I told you about, and he gave my father a job as a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">EM: What did your father teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">RH: First he taught in primary school.</span> <span id="s224">He taught arithmetic, music, and I can't remember what else.</span> <span id="s225">But then they opened a, I wouldn't know how to call it, a trade school.</span> <span id="s226">It was like a high school, but it taught general subjects too, but mainly prepared girls and boys for trade.</span> <span id="s227">And there he was teaching German, history I think, and music.</span> <span id="s228">And he always volunteered to make a school orchestra, so he always had a choir also I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EM: So your father was a musician?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">RH: My father was a musician too, but he wasn't a professional musician, only an amateur.</span> <span id="s231">He played the violin.</span> <span id="s232">He conducted orchestras whenever he could get enough music lovers together.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">EM: You stayed in the same apartment that you lived in before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">RH: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">EM: Or did you have to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">RH: During the times of the Russians, of the Soviet U-, I mean, I call them the Russians, we didn't have to move.</span> <span id="s237">But then, after two years, as you know, the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s238">You want me to talk about it, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">EM: Yeah, that'd be fine.</span> <span id="s240">Well, let's talk a little bit more about the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">RH: Russian time.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">EM: When the Russians occupied Boryslaw, did you still have religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">RH: No.</span> <span id="s244">Nobody had.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">EM: Did, but you were in the high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EM: Did you experience more antisemitism than before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">RH: No.</span> <span id="s249">No.</span> <span id="s250">Because, the people who showed antisemitism before the war, they knew that at least in theory, on paper, the Russians were against it.</span> <span id="s251">And they was plainly scared.</span> <span id="s252">So, I'm sure the antisemitism didn't die out all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s253">It's just that people were afraid to show it.</span> <span id="s254">Because there were cases where Jewish people were, you know, in with the authorities, and they could definitely take care of somebody who showed them antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">EM: Were there many Jewish Communists at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">RH: Quite a lot, because the Jewish Communists only, I mean, they came out.</span> <span id="s257">There were two kinds of Jewish Communists.</span> <span id="s258">They were suppo-, working class, and particularly printers were mostly Communists.</span> <span id="s259">And there were people of, sons and daughters of rich people, who were so-called salon Communists, who felt the injustices of the world.</span> <span id="s260">And perhaps it was fashionable, or something like that.</span> <span id="s261">Or, there were people who had all the qualities and they had the education, because for example, by some hook or crook, the parents send them overseas, over, abroad to study.</span> <span id="s262">And when they came home with a high degree, they couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s263">So these young people tended to, Communism.</span> <span id="s264">And they were very disillusioned later.</span> <span id="s265">But while they were, while the Soviet, and they were disillusioned in two ways, because the Soviet authorities didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s266">They didn't consider them as good Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">EM: Because they were children of well...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">RH: Not, not necessarily because of that.</span> <span id="s269">Because, I don't know, because they were foreigners, because they were not Russian or Soviet or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">EM: What citizenship did the Jews in Boryslaw have at that time?</span> <span id="s271">Were they still Poles, or did they, a Polish citizens?</span> <span id="s272">Or did they have to get some Soviet citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">RH: Well, we didn't really have to get anything, because they forced, the Soviet Union annexed that part of Poland, and incorporated it in the so-called, the Ukraine, by creating the so-called Western Ukraine.</span> <span id="s274">And one day everybody had to go to an office where everybody was given a passport.</span> <span id="s275">This passport was not like you understand a passport today, because you couldn't go anywhere with it.</span> <span id="s276">It was just a..</span> <span id="s277">.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">EM: Creden-...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">RH: Identity passport.</span> <span id="s280">But if you didn't have it, and somebody asked you for it, you risk five years in Siberia, because this was your identity card, and you have to have it.</span> <span id="s281">So, that made us Soviet citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">EM: Were there people that refused that identity card?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">RH: I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s284">Because if you didn't have that, you had nothing else.</span> <span id="s285">So I doubt that anyone refused it.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">EM: Were there refugees from western Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s288">Refugees from western Poland started to come over and I mean I can't tell you the numbers, but there were quite a few, because a lot of people had relatives in the east.</span> <span id="s289">And they grabbed their suit or an suitcase and a little bit of food and they came over.</span> <span id="s290">But a lot of them, after a few months or so, were very disappointed with their life there, and they decided, "Well, it can't be as bad in the west as it is here."</span> <span id="s291">And one day the Soviets played a neat trick.</span> <span id="s292">They advertised that everybody from the west of Poland who came to Boryslaw could register for going back.</span> <span id="s293">So, people registered in droves, and they were taken to Siberia instead of the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">EM: And they, these people were never given the...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">RH: Cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">EM: Soviet identity cards, that Soviet passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">RH: I really can't tell you.</span> <span id="s298">I think they, if they were there, they must have.</span> <span id="s299">So that really didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s300">That...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">EM: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s302">RH: They had it or not.</span> <span id="s303">If you wanted to go back west, that meant that you were an enemy of the State.</span> <span id="s304">You were not to be trusted, and you had better be put away so that you can't do any harm to the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">EM: So, not too many of the original local Boryslaw Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s306">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">EM: Were sent to Siberia at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">RH: No, when those people from the west were sent to Siberia, they also caught and took a few of the largest oil well owners, or land, there were no landowners, Jews, in Poland anyway, because we were, you were close to the borders, and within 100 km of the borders of Poland with any other country, Jews were not allowed to own land.</span> <span id="s309">But there were a lot of people who owned oil wells, or big factories, or something like that.</span> <span id="s310">And these, that handful of them, they were sent to Siberia at the same time.</span> <span id="s311">[tape off] Also, there were again not too many, but there were some people who, some men who were officers in the Polish army and they either died in the war—in the first weeks of the war—or they were interned in countries like Hungary.</span> <span id="s312">Their families were sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">EM: Were there any Jews in the Polish army?</span> <span id="s314">I mean, Jews from the Boryslaw area?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">RH: They must have, they, well, every boy of 20 was, not enlisted, but was conscripted in the Polish army, and Jews among them.</span> <span id="s316">They had to be.</span> <span id="s317">Very few Jewish people became officers, but officers had to, had, if they had a university degree.</span> <span id="s318">They had to make them officers.</span> <span id="s319">They couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s320">But there weren't many.</span> <span id="s321">I know just a few.</span> <span id="s322">But quite a few- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s323">EM: Interview with Mrs. Rita Harmelin.</span> <span id="s324">So, during the Russian occupation, you still stayed in your old apartment, and your father worked.</span> <span id="s325">And you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">RH: I went to school.</span> <span id="s327">We stayed in our own apartment, thanks to the fact that it was very small, and [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s328">EM: Did you have contact with the rest of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">RH: Well, we had very, well we had contact with the people who lived in our town.</span> <span id="s330">We didn't, there was a bit of the family in our town.</span> <span id="s331">There were two brothers of my mother's, and one sister.</span> <span id="s332">Both sisters, actually, came to Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s333">Well, both were from the west, not so much, Aunt Eva, one was from Sanok, and one was from Katowice, which is in the west.</span> <span id="s334">And she came to stay in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s335">We had very little contact with the people who didn't live in that town, because we weren't allowed to travel for, unless it was a really very good reason.</span> <span id="s336">For instance, in my father's family, we hardly had any contact at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">EM: Now, when the war between the, Germany and the Soviet Union started, could you describe the condition in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">RH: Well, the conditions in Boryslaw were more or less the same for two years, close to two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">EM: That means, during the Soviet...</span></p> <p><span id="s340">RH: During the Soviet occupation there was nothing much changed.</span> <span id="s341">Sometimes there was more food to be bought, and sometimes less, but somehow everybody managed.</span> <span id="s342">Then, on the 22nd of June, 1941, and that was the end of the school year, and there was a school party.</span> <span id="s343">And I remember, and oh, the, what I also remember, the, oh well the radio station was pretty far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s344">Somebody said that all, through the whole day and night before, there were, what do you call, the tankers, the railway was sending tankers with petrol west.</span> <span id="s345">All day and all night.</span> <span id="s346">It means that Russia was supplying the petrol, Boryslaw petrol, or perhaps also their own, to Germans.</span> <span id="s347">And on the 22nd of, like I said, after that school party, we were going home about 11:00, we saw fires.</span> <span id="s348">And we saw all sorts of things happening.</span> <span id="s349">And someone said that Germany attacked the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s350">And in a few hours or so, again I don't see...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">EM: How far from the border was Boryslaw, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">RH: It was less than, which border?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">EM: Between Soviet, ...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">RH: Soviet and...</span></p> <p><span id="s355">EM: German, and German...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">RH: Yeah, in the west.</span> <span id="s357">Well, I know the border was in Przemysl.</span> <span id="s358">I don't know, it would have been about maybe 500, 400 km.</span> <span id="s359">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">EM: About 400-500 km?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">RH: 500.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EM: So, it didn't take the Germans too long to come to Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">RH: No, because they, first of all they came in with tanks.</span> <span id="s364">They came in with all sorts of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">EM: Was there bombardment?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">RH: Yes, there was a little bit bombard-, not too much, because probably they wanted to keep everything whole for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">EM: Because that's the oil well...</span></p> <p><span id="s368">RH: Because of the oil.</span> <span id="s369">That was very crucial to them, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">EM: Were they near refineries in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">RH: Refineries were not in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s372">Refineries were in a town called Drohobycz, which was, I think, 11 km, which is about 7 miles away.</span> <span id="s373">And those were bombarded, but much later, by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">EM: Now, describe the entrance of the Germans to Boryslaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">RH: Well, mai-, they started coming, and we all hid, because we knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s376">And the first day, they, the Germans allowed the Ukrainians—more than the Poles—the Poles didn't take much part in it I think—free hand, in killing as many Jews as they like.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">EM: It was a pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">RH: It was a pogrom.</span> <span id="s379">And the pogrom was, there was a building which used to be a mining school.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">EM: What schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">RH: Mining.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">EM: Mining?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">RH: For the people to, who wanted to work in, that was in Polish times.</span> <span id="s384">And that building, because it was very convenient for them, was taken over by the NKVD, which was the precastle, pre-cursor, pre-something of NKVD, which was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">EM: The secret...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">RH: The dreaded Secret Police.</span> <span id="s387">And they apparently killed some people before they left, and left them in the cellar.</span> <span id="s388">And that was apparently, that pogrom was supposed to be in revenge for those killed there.</span> <span id="s389">Why should you kill Jews in revenge for other people who were killed?</span> <span id="s390">I don't know, but, anyway, in fact, my father was taken.</span> <span id="s391">I don't remember whether from the street or from the house.</span> <span id="s392">He was taken to that NKVD building.</span> <span id="s393">Luckily, he was beaten up very badly when he came back, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">EM: But nothing, I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">RH: But he wasn't, he was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">EM: He was alive to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">RH: Yeah, he was alive to come home.</span> <span id="s398">I think I should go back a little bit, because I didn't mention about the fires in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s399">When the Russians were leaving, they fired as many oil wells as they could.</span> <span id="s400">They dynamited the electric works, where electricity, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EM: Installations...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">RH: Installations so that we actually till the end of the war we didn't have any electricity.</span> <span id="s403">And they set fire to everything that could be valuable to the Germans.</span> <span id="s404">But the whole town, the houses, not many houses burned.</span> <span id="s405">And I remember this, because our house was set between three oil wells, and they all burned.</span> <span id="s406">But we were watching all night so that something doesn't fall on the house.</span> <span id="s407">Because we still lived in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">EM: Was this an apartment house, or was it a..</span> <span id="s409">.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">RH: No, no, it was a tiny little cottage, which had only one bedroom, one big bedroom, and one big kitchen, a hall, a bathroom, and that's about all.</span> <span id="s411">So, that was why nobody wanted it, wanted to live in it, and we lived there because it belonged to our relative, who moved to another city.</span> <span id="s412">And he let us live there relatively cheaply.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">EM: Now, how long did the pogrom last?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">RH: The pogrom lasted 24 hours [tape off].</span> <span id="s415">So that pogrom lasted 24 hours.</span> <span id="s416">As a matter of fact, it was like this: the people—I don't think they were Gestapo yet—they were just some German police or something who gave the order for the pogrom—didn't say how long it should last.</span> <span id="s417">And, since Boryslaw was a small town, they went to Drohobycz, where they had the head office, or they set up.</span> <span id="s418">Because it was just in the first few days.</span> <span id="s419">And that was, we were told, or everybody was told, it should be 24 hours.</span> <span id="s420">But the people who could give the order to stop were not in our town.</span> <span id="s421">They were in Drohobycz.</span> <span id="s422">And we had a neighbor—not close neighbor, but a neighbor—who, quite a young couple, Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s423">And I don't think we knew them personally then, but the wife we always knew, because she was a very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s424">And they were not married very long.</span> <span id="s425">And she went by foot, on foot, because there was no transportation already.</span> <span id="s426">She went on foot to Drohobycz, and she found this, this, man who could give the order to stop, and she made him telephone the local person and give the order.</span> <span id="s427">Because otherwise, I mean, it was 24 hours already, but nobody had the right to tell them to stop, so they wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s428">And then there was a teacher, I think I mentioned to you, the teacher who gave, who became the inspec-, school inspector and gave my father a job.</span> <span id="s429">They lived quite close to us too.</span> <span id="s430">So, his wife, who was also my husband's teacher when he was a little boy, went and sort of got my hus-, father out.</span> <span id="s431">I mean, they were letting everybody go anyway, but, with her he came home and he wouldn't be attacked again or something.</span> <span id="s432">So she brought him home that night.</span> <span id="s433">And then there was a few weeks' peace, because that's how it happened from, between pogroms and actions there was rela-...</span></p> <p><span id="s434">EM: During that first pogrom, do you know if any people were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s436">There were, but I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s437">I don't remember how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">EM: But, they were mostly Ukrainian that took part in it, not Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">EM: Or whether Germans took...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">RH: Well, the Germans sort of egged them on and I'm sure they didn't spare a few things, but nobody was shot if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s442">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">EM: Now, describe life after the pogrom a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">RH: Well, we just lived life, in a cage.</span> <span id="s445">Because everybody was afraid to go out, and then they sort of organized a Judenrat slowly, and everybody was registered.</span> <span id="s446">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s447">EM: Did the Jews have to wear any arm bands or a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s449">They made us wear arm bands, blue and white arm bands with the star of David on it.</span> <span id="s450">No yellow stars like they did in Germany.</span> <span id="s451">And I remember one Ukrainian girl, who used to go to school with me.</span> <span id="s452">She probably didn't realize that, what the arm band meant.</span> <span id="s453">It wasn't just degrading us.</span> <span id="s454">It was also that if somebody sees us from the back and knows I'm Jewish, they could s-, they could hit, shoot me!</span> <span id="s455">But this girl said to me, "Well, I'm Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s456">I would be proud if they made me wear a yellow, blue band."</span> <span id="s457">I said, "Well, I'm not ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s458">But you realize the danger."</span> <span id="s459">But she said, "What danger?"</span> <span id="s460">And she didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EM: Now, did they establish a ghetto in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">RH: Well, it was a ghetto, but not right away.</span> <span id="s463">It took a while.</span> <span id="s464">And it wasn't really a ghetto like in other towns, because Boryslaw was built in a very haphazard way.</span> <span id="s465">There was one very long main street, and Jews were living all along everywhere, mixed up with the other population.</span> <span id="s466">So it wasn't really possible.</span> <span id="s467">And I really don't know the date when.</span> <span id="s468">I think, between the first pogrom there was another one, the second one.</span> <span id="s469">Any of those dates I have, but just now I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">EM: The dates are not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">RH: Important.</span> <span id="s472">And there was only, the third one was in, in August, 4th of Au gust, '42, I think, where they took a lot of people to Lemberg, to...</span></p> <p><span id="s473">EM: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">RH: To the Janowska.</span> <span id="s475">And after that only they told us to leave our houses and to go to a certain, well, it wasn't a suburb, a certain little district where we, they told all the Gentiles to get out of there, and we lived in those.</span> <span id="s476">This was a very poor housing thing, and we had the ghetto there.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">EM: Was this, was it surrounded by a wall...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">EM: Or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">RH: No.</span> <span id="s481">No, no, they didn't build a wall.</span> <span id="s482">They set around police, the Jewish police to guard us.</span> <span id="s483">There weren't any Germans guarding us then, because a lot of people used to work in the petrol industry, and that's what they needed most.</span> <span id="s484">They didn't want to stop producing petrol, so they kept a lot of those Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">EM: So, do you know of any organized deportations from Boryslaw, or, so-called actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">RH: Well, every, yes, I know, I'm just, after the first one, which was a pogrom, this, from then on, there were organized deportations.</span> <span id="s487">The second one was I think in the same year as the first one.</span> <span id="s488">I can't think even on when it was.</span> <span id="s489">And then I don't know where they took them then.</span> <span id="s490">From the third one they took people in the, to the Janowska [unclear].</span> <span id="s491">Then there was a fourth one, where they took them again.</span> <span id="s492">I was in it.</span> <span id="s493">I was caught in it.</span> <span id="s494">But by then I was working in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">EM: Where, how were you caught?</span> <span id="s496">From the street?</span> <span id="s497">From a place of work?</span> <span id="s498">How were you caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">RH: From the place of work.</span> <span id="s500">It was a very, it's also, again, a very long story, because, being a petrol industry, they knew that a lot of the Jews who still lived in Boryslaw, they knew an awful lot about the petrol industry.</span> <span id="s501">They were, most of them were owners before, who was not deported to Siberia and was still there.</span> <span id="s502">So they put us in a, I mean, not that I was one of them.</span> <span id="s503">I was only about 16 or 17 then.</span> <span id="s504">But, all the Jews who, who could, got a job with, in this industry.</span> <span id="s505">And we used to, here's another digression.</span> <span id="s506">My father, being a teacher, somebody found out that he was a music teacher and German teacher.</span> <span id="s507">And one of the people who, one of the German directors of the, of the petrol industry, was a man called Siegemund.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EM: Siegemund?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">And he, he was a captain I think in the German army, but he was wounded, and he was lame [tape off].</span> <span id="s511">That shows you how I, because he helped me, he saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">RH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s514">And this, Herr Siegemund found out that my father was a teacher, and he, through somebody, asked him to come and teach his son to play the violin.</span> <span id="s515">So my father used to go there.</span> <span id="s516">He got a thing that he could cross the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">EM: Pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">RH: Pass, at night, because we weren't allowed to walk at night.</span> <span id="s519">And he used to go to that place once or twice a week, I don't know.</span> <span id="s520">And he used to teach this little boy violin.</span> <span id="s521">And I remember my father telling me how remarkable it was, because the par-, both parents and the little boy treated him just like one of them.</span> <span id="s522">They asked him to eat with them.</span> <span id="s523">They, the little boy climbed on his knee.</span> <span id="s524">But they had also a daughter who was about 12 then.</span> <span id="s525">So she started making a big fuss that a Jude is eating with them and playing with the boy, so then it became a little bit more strict.</span> <span id="s526">And this Mr. Siegemund was my boss.</span> <span id="s527">So, in the so-called fourth action, there was another German I must mention, because he was very important.</span> <span id="s528">And his name was Bertold Beitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EM: Beitz?</span> <span id="s530">It's B-...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">RH: Yes, Bertold Beitz.</span> <span id="s532">It's a very well-known name everywhere now.</span> <span id="s533">You probably heard about him too?</span> <span id="s534">No.</span> <span id="s535">Well, he was apparently a nephew of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s536">EM: Do you know how to spell the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">RH: Of course.</span> <span id="s538">Of course.</span> <span id="s539">B-A-, B-, German, B-E-I-T-Z.</span> <span id="s540">He was our savior.</span> <span id="s541">He was really, he was also very handsome.</span> <span id="s542">And he was a bigger director than Siegemund.</span> <span id="s543">Siegemund was my immediate boss, and he was the boss of the whole, it turned out that he wasn't even a party member.</span> <span id="s544">He was a nephew of Frank, the governor of Galicia.</span> <span id="s545">And he was a very young man, about 26.</span> <span id="s546">And he used to have, I wouldn't say, a soft spot for Jews, but he was a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">EM: Was he in uniform...</span></p> <p><span id="s548">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">EM: Or in civilian...</span></p> <p><span id="s550">RH: He was a civilian.</span> <span id="s551">He was not in uniform and, actually in industry there was nobody in u-, even this captain was not, because he was wounded by the Poles and then he wasn't in the army anymore.</span> <span id="s552">And this Beitz had a lot of people.</span> <span id="s553">Somehow he had a human contact with us, with the Jews.</span> <span id="s554">He didn't, I wouldn't say he was a Jew lover, but he was just a human being.</span> <span id="s555">And being our director he of course knew from the Gestapo or from others when something was happening.</span> <span id="s556">And somehow Jews also sort of smelled it in the air.</span> <span id="s557">And there was one guy, very courageous, we used to ask him, straight out, "Mr. Director, will there be a, an action?"</span> <span id="s558">So one day he found out that they're planning an action for the next day.</span> <span id="s559">So he told us that we can sleep in the office.</span> <span id="s560">We don't have to go back to the ghetto or wherever we live.</span> <span id="s561">We can sleep in the office.</span> <span id="s562">So, I don't remember where I hid my mother, or whether she hid herself.</span> <span id="s563">And I and my father, because we were both working there, we stayed in the office.</span> <span id="s564">Somehow in the evening, not in the middle of the night, I went home to see whether my grandmother was all right, because she was still alive then.</span> <span id="s565">And, she was...</span></p> <p><span id="s566">EM: Did your grandmother live with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">RH: My grandmother lived with us since a few years before the war, because both my aunts who used to take care of her got married, and then she came to live with us.</span> <span id="s568">And she was an invalid.</span> <span id="s569">She was, for certain reasons, bedridden for the last sixteen years of her life, and she was already pretty old and pretty broken by all her, all the things that happened.</span> <span id="s570">And she couldn't have gon-, she couldn't be taken anywhere, because she had one leg amputated, and an arm—her arm was stiff.</span> <span id="s571">She couldn't walk, she couldn't, she had to be carried.</span> <span id="s572">And there was nobody else then.</span> <span id="s573">But she was all right at home.</span> <span id="s574">I went to see her.</span> <span id="s575">And we went to, with my father to sleep in that office.</span> <span id="s576">In the morning, this Herr Beitz came once more, and he told us, we thought about him like, you know, Messiah.</span> <span id="s577">He said, "Bleibt ruhig," or he had to go to, to Lwow for some reason.</span> <span id="s578">"Bleibt ruhig, nothing will happen to you until I come back."</span> <span id="s579">Unfortunately, somebody noticed that so many Jews stayed overnight in the office, I think 180 or more.</span> <span id="s580">And they, whether it was the Germans themselves or somebody told them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s581">But about half an hour after Beitz left, the Reiter Politzei came, and they chased us all out of there onto the, onto the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">EM: The Reiter Politzei.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">RH: Yes, that's a..</span> <span id="s584">.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">EM: That's cavalry?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">RH: It was, a cavalry, it was a, it was not army, although they had very similar uniforms.</span> <span id="s587">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">EM: Were they on horses?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">RH: They were on horses.</span> <span id="s590">Sure.</span> <span id="s591">They were on horses.</span> <span id="s592">And they, I don't know what exact authority they had, but they certainly had authority over Jews.</span> <span id="s593">They were not Gestapo, and they were not the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">EM: And they were, were they S.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">EM: No?</span> <span id="s597">Not S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">RH: No.</span> <span id="s599">But, they told us to get out, because they were on horses and had guns and what could we do?</span> <span id="s600">So we went, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">EM: It was you, and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">RH: My, me, and my father, and all the Jews who were there.</span> <span id="s603">And we spent a day and a night—and I'll never forget that night—I mean, I'm trying to forget it.</span> <span id="s604">But, the next, I can't remember how many people, I think two-and-a-half [?</span> <span id="s605">200 ?]</span> <span id="s606">people were in that, that warehouse, waiting to be taken away.</span> <span id="s607">We didn't know where.</span> <span id="s608">Just before, just be fore they started segregating us, Beitz came back from wherever he was, and found out that the Reiters took, played a trick on him.</span> <span id="s609">So, I don't know, he couldn't come, but he sent Siegemund and a few other people, and they started to bargain, to haggle with the Gestapo, who was then, who then took us over, for all the Jews.</span> <span id="s610">And of course he, he managed to take out 180 men and seven women.</span> <span id="s611">Among the 180 men was my father.</span> <span id="s612">And there were six women only to go, and then, Siegemund said, "Da ist die kleine Brauner ich muss sie haben auch."</span> <span id="s613">[There is the small Brauner, I have to have her also.]</span> <span id="s614">So they looked at me, well, I mean, I was 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s615">What, what can I do?</span> <span id="s616">What, how come I'm so important?</span> <span id="s617">So they asked me what I do, and I said, "I am a typist."</span> <span id="s618">So they asked me what system do I type, and I didn't know what they meant.</span> <span id="s619">I was so frightened.</span> <span id="s620">So I said, "Underwood," because I had a typewriter, an Underwood typewriter.</span> <span id="s621">So he looked at, this Gestapo man looked at Siegemund and said, "Sind sie Wahnsinnig?"</span> <span id="s622">[Are you crazy?]</span> <span id="s623">He said, "You mustn't praise Jews particularly as stupid as that."</span> <span id="s624">And he turned away.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">EM: You mustn't what?</span> <span id="s626">Praise?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">RH: Praise the Jews.</span> <span id="s628">You mustn't fight for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">RH: So, and he turned away.</span> <span id="s631">And Siegemund just grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out to the other side, and I was the seventh woman that was saved that day.</span> <span id="s632">So then we went home, not to work, and you know how it works with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">EM: So, and there were some people that were not saved then...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s635">And they went to, I don't know where.</span> <span id="s636">I don't know.</span> <span id="s637">I, maybe also to Janow.</span> <span id="s638">Or, I don't know.</span> <span id="s639">But they were never seen again.</span> <span id="s640">They were killed, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s641">Maybe they went to, what was the camp close to Lublin?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">EM: Majdanek?</span> <span id="s643">Belzec?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">RH: No.</span> <span id="s645">Majdanek was near Krakow I think.</span> <span id="s646">Majdanek, Treblinka, they were near Krakow.</span> <span id="s647">And that might have been Belzec, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s648">I can't understand how I don't remember these things.</span> <span id="s649">You know so many years.</span> <span id="s650">Anyway, it worked like this, that once they had their quota of Jews and the action was finished, it was finished.</span> <span id="s651">You could go home and nobody caught you on the street.</span> <span id="s652">Sometimes the Poles or the Ukrainians helped the Germans out, but after it was finished it was finished for some time.</span> <span id="s653">So we went home, and my mother was still hidden.</span> <span id="s654">So I went home to see about my grandmother.</span> <span id="s655">And she was there and she was all right, but she was already dying.</span> <span id="s656">And she took me for my mother.</span> <span id="s657">She didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s658">And she had pains in her leg.</span> <span id="s659">So, I used to do that with her.</span> <span id="s660">I used to treat her, because we couldn't get pain killers.</span> <span id="s661">And there was this painkiller “Kogutek” in Poland, and we had very few of them that we could get.</span> <span id="s662">So I used to half them or even less, and add some sugar and salt to make it taste bad, and I used to give it to her and it sort of helped, because, like a placebo or something.</span> <span id="s663">So I remember she said she had pains and I gave her “Kogutek” like that.</span> <span id="s664">And she went to sleep, and in the middle of the night, or maybe in two hours, I don't know, I woke up, and went to see whether she wanted something, and she was dead, in her sleep.</span> <span id="s665">So that was one lucky thing, and she was, she died in her own bed, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EM: Do you know how old she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s668">I think she was 76 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">EM: Was, were you able to bury her in a cemetery, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">RH: Yes, there was my father, and there was one uncle left, my uncle David.</span> <span id="s671">I think he was still there then, and Adam, who was the Gentile husband of one of my mother's sisters.</span> <span id="s672">The three of them went to the cemetery and they buried her with their own hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">EM: Um, [tape off ] so your grandmother died in, what was it, 1943?</span> <span id="s674">Or 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">RH: No, I think it was '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">EM: '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">RH: November, '42, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">EM: After this action, oh, did your mother work in, at the off-...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">RH: Yes, later.</span> <span id="s680">Later, my mother worked with me and with my father in the same office.</span> <span id="s681">And that was also thanks to Siegemund.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EM: Do you remember the next action?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">RH: The next action was the so-called, the fifth action.</span> <span id="s684">Now, between the fourth and the fifth, peop-, or maybe even before, the Jews who were working for the Germans, I mean in the factories or in maga-, in warehouses or in the offices, we got a so-called arm band "A", which meant arm band Jude.</span> <span id="s685">They had a letter "A" and a number.</span> <span id="s686">And I was too young for...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">EM: That was in, in addition to the other...</span></p> <p><span id="s688">RH: Oh they were, no, no, instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">EM: Instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">RH: There were ordinary arm bands, and the Arbeits Juden had the, the other arm bands.</span> <span id="s691">And I didn't have an "A" arm band, even though I was working.</span> <span id="s692">But, about that time, they also gave us a letter "R".</span> <span id="s693">This was a little square of perhaps four inches square, 10 cm or 12 cm, about 12, of ordinary linen, on which was embroidered the letter "R" in black, and a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EM: And it was on a white linen, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">RH: On a white, cream, something linen.</span> <span id="s696">And this letter "R" meant that we were working for the Ristungs industry.</span> <span id="s697">And this is why we were important.</span> <span id="s698">And we were supposed to be left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">EM: Where did you wear that star?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">RH: On the lapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">EM: On the lapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">RH: It had a little hole, and we put a safety pin through it.</span> <span id="s703">And, we were so proud of, the ones who- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s704">EM: ...Could you describe the type of work you were doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">RH: Well, I think, at that time, when we already had ice, I was working in the office, and it was colder in Invertar Abteilung [inventory department] where we were mostly writing in the stock, writing up the stock of the nationalized oil wells.</span> <span id="s706">All the oil wells that were nationalized first by the Russians, when the Soviet troops came, they were never given back to their rightful owners by the Germans.</span> <span id="s707">And forever there was something to stock about, and we were kept writing the cards, the stock cards.</span> <span id="s708">I mean that's what I was doing.</span> <span id="s709">Later I was, somehow somebody discovered that I could type a little bit, so I was typing whatever was necessary.</span> <span id="s710">I was sort of pretending to be a secretary, but I did type letters for the signatures of Directors and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EM: At that time did you live in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">RH: We still lived in the ghetto, though it wasn't a real ghetto.</span> <span id="s713">It was called a ghetto, or the Jewish Quarters, because we didn't have a wall.</span> <span id="s714">We just had Jewish policemen patrolling the street so that nobody could get in and out, but we did really.</span> <span id="s715">We were taken to and back, under guard.</span> <span id="s716">But, Boryslaw was in such a peculiar situation because people who were living, they didn't work too many of them in one place.</span> <span id="s717">There were two in one place, one in another place, so, up to a point we went together, but then they had to let us go our separate ways.</span> <span id="s718">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s719">EM: Did any non-Jews work with you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">RH: When I was working in the office, yes, there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">EM: What was the attitude of the non-Jews towards the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">RH: Well, Boryslaw being such a small town, practically everybody knew everybody else.</span> <span id="s723">Some of the people who worked with me were in my school; they were schoolmates.</span> <span id="s724">Some didn't want to have anything to do with me, and some really helped.</span> <span id="s725">Some gave me some soup or talked to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">EM: What was the food situation among the Jews at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">RH: Well, the food situation was very bad, because we were, all right, we were told to move from our own houses to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s728">By then, most of us were robbed or practically nobody had many more belongings.</span> <span id="s729">So there was very little we could sell.</span> <span id="s730">Actually we had, what we could sell we sold a year or two before.</span> <span id="s731">And we did have a food ration.</span> <span id="s732">I think it was a pound of bread a week.</span> <span id="s733">I'm trying to think what else they gave us, if anything.</span> <span id="s734">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s735">A month or, the time while we were in the ghetto we had to sort of scrounge something.</span> <span id="s736">Once they opened the zwangs arbeitslager [forced labor camp], the camp, then it became a little better, because we got a piece of bread and some soup, and a dish of black coffee or, erzatz coffee, daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">EM: Where was the camp in relation to the former ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">RH: It wasn't very far, but the camp was a, also it wasn't a real camp.</span> <span id="s739">It was a previous, oh, I don't know what to call it in English.</span> <span id="s740">We called it the kaserne [barracks], although there were never any soldiers in it.</span> <span id="s741">But, before then, I think there were great stables for somebody's horses.</span> <span id="s742">And there were several buildings, somewhere, obviously, for people to live, but somewhere really only for horses and they were somehow prepared for us.</span> <span id="s743">But, they didn't just move the ghetto, all the people from the ghetto immediately to the kaserne, only slowly.</span> <span id="s744">And, it took quite a while before the ghetto was entirely abolished.</span> <span id="s745">And, when we were there, they had a kitchen in which Jews were, and they gave us at least regularly some food.</span> <span id="s746">Of course it was never enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">EM: What year was it, or what, now what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">RH: I think that was '43.</span> <span id="s749">Early in '43 there was the so-called "fifth action," when I was caught.</span> <span id="s750">Because, even though I had this "R" I didn't have the "A" and I was going from the ghetto to work and again some Reiter [rider] took and sort of caught us and brought us to a building which used to be a movie theater before the war.</span> <span id="s751">And there were quite a lot of us there.</span> <span id="s752">And it was just opposite our office.</span> <span id="s753">Now somebody quickly, who saw me there, went to my father and told him that they caught me.</span> <span id="s754">I don't remember why my father, because we usually went to work together.</span> <span id="s755">And my father again went to my boss Siegemund, who was also his, his boss, and said that I was caught on the way to work.</span> <span id="s756">So he just walked over, and—it wasn't immediately—but he walked over to this place after a few hours and started calling me out, and just told the, the German soldat guard that I am his worker.</span> <span id="s757">And he practically dragged me out by my sleeve.</span> <span id="s758">On the way he said “Ich habe schon wieder dich zu...” again I have to... you.</span> <span id="s759">And he brought me to the office.</span> <span id="s760">And then, he decided that it wouldn't be safe for me.</span> <span id="s761">My parents were all right, because that action was, I think for young people, for non-"A", I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">EM: What was the "A" again?</span> <span id="s763">I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">RH: Arbeits, ArbeitsJude [work Jew].</span></p> <p><span id="s765">EM: ArbeitsJude.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">RH: And he said, just at that time they opened the kaserne, they opened the camp.</span> <span id="s767">And I was perhaps one of the first 20 to go there, because it was safe, supposedly.</span> <span id="s768">Whoever was in that camp was not molested any more.</span> <span id="s769">Of course it wasn't true, but at least for me it was right.</span> <span id="s770">And this camp, as I said, it wasn't prepared, but it was just starting, so it was still in a very primitive status.</span> <span id="s771">It wasn't to be compared with any of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s772">It was like a, like a holiday place in comparison.</span> <span id="s773">But, for instance, there were no windows.</span> <span id="s774">And winter in Poland is quite harsh, so you had snow inside the house, in the room.</span> <span id="s775">There were about 12 girls in my room...</span></p> <p><span id="s776">EM: What do you mean, no windows?</span> <span id="s777">That there were no...</span></p> <p><span id="s778">RH: They were broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">EM: Oh, broken windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">RH: Yeah, broken windows.</span> <span id="s781">And there was no heating.</span> <span id="s782">But, after, and you, I remember having to sleep in my coat.</span> <span id="s783">My winter coat was stolen, but my summer coat and some rags around my head, and something more around my feet, because it was very cold.</span> <span id="s784">There were about 12 girls in my room, that we huddled for warmth, and a few men in another part, because we didn't live together.</span> <span id="s785">But, somehow we managed.</span> <span id="s786">And slowly, slowly, they, because Boryslaw had a lot of natural gas, the, the ground gets.</span> <span id="s787">So they brought in some gas to burn and it was, became a little bit more possible.</span> <span id="s788">And from there, every morning at 6:00 we went to work again under guard, and at 6:00 in the evening we came back under guard and then we got something to eat.</span> <span id="s789">And slowly, the camp was filled up, because then they started to close the ghetto.</span> <span id="s790">And my parents came over too to the camp.</span> <span id="s791">And this is how we lived for some months there.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">EM: Your father still worked in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s793">RH: My father's work in the same office as I did.</span> <span id="s794">He was a little bit my superior because he had a lot of experience.</span> <span id="s795">He spoke German very well, so they gave him some little bit more important work, but it was definitely not any authority or anything.</span> <span id="s796">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s797">EM: At that time did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s799">She, actually, she worked with us.</span> <span id="s800">She worked in the same office too.</span> <span id="s801">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">EM: Did you all live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">RH: No, I lived with my mother in the women's quarters, and my father lived in the men's quarters.</span> <span id="s804">We saw each other in the office, and at meals, and, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s805">EM: How long did this last?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">RH: Well, this, we were in the camp actually until about March, '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">EM: Well, did this camp have a name?</span> <span id="s808">What did you call this camp, besides being the kaserne?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">RH: We called it in Polish koszary.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">EM: Koszary.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">RH: But, it was called officially a zwangs arbeitslager [forced labor camp], but it didn't have a particular name.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">EM: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">RH: And, because of this peculiar position of Boryslaw, it wasn't as harsh or as difficult.</span> <span id="s814">They needed, because not only they needed the hands to work, because they had enough hands.</span> <span id="s815">They weren't such good workers in this, always hungry and, but, a lot of the Jews who still were there in Boryslaw and who were made to work in this office were previous owners.</span> <span id="s816">And they knew an awful lot.</span> <span id="s817">Each knew enough about his own oil well, or his own several oil wells to help them in the cataloging all these thing, all these machines and all the equipment and all this that we were doing there.</span> <span id="s818">And I think this was really an excuse for this Mr. Beitz.</span> <span id="s819">Because if he let all the Jews be taken away, now he would have nobody to be a chief of, a director of.</span> <span id="s820">So he kept us alive, which was very good.</span> <span id="s821">I can't say that he did it only for his sake.</span> <span id="s822">He didn't do it particularly for our sake.</span> <span id="s823">He was a decent man, but he also profited by not having to go to the front.</span> <span id="s824">He was a very young man, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">EM: When you say about Jews owning oil wells, did the Jew or any person have to be very wealthy to own a oil well in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">RH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">EM: Because here when you think about oil wells you think about...</span></p> <p><span id="s828">RH: Yes, well, Boryslaw's oil wells were, this was a very old oil field.</span> <span id="s829">It was the first established in Europe.</span> <span id="s830">And it was by then partly exhausted.</span> <span id="s831">Now, it wasn't that you have to be very rich to own one, because you could actually own a part of one.</span> <span id="s832">You could, in partnership.</span> <span id="s833">And oil wells was just a gamble, like anything else.</span> <span id="s834">It could be a gusher, although there were none in Boryslaw in my time.</span> <span id="s835">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s836">But it could be just a hole in the ground where you poured money in and very little came out.</span> <span id="s837">There were quite a lot of wealthy Jews who, perhaps, weren't wealthy when they bought it, but that, over 20 years or 30 years of their life made them wealthy.</span> <span id="s838">But actually they, as usual, the wealthiest companies owning oil wells, were foreign companies like, Limanova, for instance, was a French company.</span> <span id="s839">There was a Belgian company.</span> <span id="s840">There was somebody else.</span> <span id="s841">They owned not just one or three, but they owned a lot of them.</span> <span id="s842">So, and they employed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s843">So, these were really the wealthy owners.</span> <span id="s844">But, in a place like Boryslaw before the war, if somebody had one or two oil wells he was considered a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s845">I mean, it was not a Rockefeller, but, they were clinging to it and they made a very good living off.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">EM: Did these people live in Boryslaw, the ones, the owners?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">RH: Yes, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s848">EM: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">RH: Mostly, the ones that I'm talking about who worked with us, they usu-, they mostly did.</span> <span id="s850">And there were quite a lot who, Boryslaw wasn't any in great shakes to live in, so they lived either in Lwow, or even abroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">EM: Could you tell me what happened later?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">RH: Well, after this fifth action, there was another one, very shortly, when the Germans were beaten at the Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s853">And that was I think February, '43.</span> <span id="s854">And that was a big, still a big action in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s855">And then, I think that was the first time that they didn't take them away anywhere.</span> <span id="s856">They shot them in the, in the town, behind the town.</span> <span id="s857">I can't remember how many people died then, because my memory for figures is very hazy now.</span> <span id="s858">And then I must say that we had, we, the girls who lived in the women's part were guarded always by the Ukrainians, Ukrainian volunteers.</span> <span id="s859">They weren't soldiers, but they were Ukrainian youth to whom Hitler promised a free Ukraine.</span> <span id="s860">Of course he didn't keep his word, but they believed in him, and they volunteered for all functions.</span> <span id="s861">So they got their uniform and they got a gun, and they were guarding Jews or beating Jews or whatever they like.</span> <span id="s862">And there was a, during the sixth action, we had a little bit of panic in the camp, and there were only, there were, there was one guard outside our door, and of, off the women's part.</span> <span id="s863">But there were also two guards outside the main gate.</span> <span id="s864">But, perhaps we knew some ways where we could slip out some other way, and we couldn't, because the guard in front of our door wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s865">And one of the girls knew his family, and said to him, "Why don't you want to let us out?</span> <span id="s866">Let us save ourselves."</span> <span id="s867">And he just stood there with a, with a gun and would laugh and wouldn't let us go out.</span> <span id="s868">And then we found out that he actually saved our lives.</span> <span id="s869">Because everybody who left the camp then was caught, and shot.</span> <span id="s870">And we, the few girls that we, he wouldn't let out, we were free and then, you know, after this was finished, it was finished again for some months.</span> <span id="s871">And, like I said, people with "R" or with "A" they weren't supposed to be touched, but it wasn't true, only after this last big action, sixth, there were little small ones, which we stopped counting already, because it was, the life was quiet for a while and then was another big, another thing, and another few people or a few hundred were taken away.</span> <span id="s872">There weren't many left anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">EM: Tell me something, what was happening with the children at that time, since they wouldn't have...</span></p> <p><span id="s874">RH: Well, people who could, people who could, brought the children to the camp.</span> <span id="s875">Some were hiding them or giving them away to Gentile families, for keeping, for safe keeping.</span> <span id="s876">Some were using all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s877">I know in our room there was a lady who, who brought her, I think he was 11, a little boy with her.</span> <span id="s878">And every day she would, when she was making the bed, she would put him under the mattress, and he would stay there all day until she came back from work.</span> <span id="s879">And then she fed him, and he had to be quiet, and nobody was supposed to see him.</span> <span id="s880">And I think that boy actually survived the war.</span> <span id="s881">And I can't remember many children around.</span> <span id="s882">And if they were, they were hiding.</span> <span id="s883">For children not being productive had no right to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">EM: Could you describe what happened later, after a few months of your life in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">RH: We were sort of living from day to day.</span> <span id="s886">We were always scared, but we had a lot of this, this Galgenhumor [gallows humor=grim humor], which was probably a defense mechanism for the young people, though we were all 17, 18.</span> <span id="s887">Nobody wanted to die, but we never thought about it all day.</span> <span id="s888">And, we just lived that way for a while.</span> <span id="s889">And then, we started getting news from the front.</span> <span id="s890">After Stalingrad we knew that Germany cannot win the war, and of course some had more hope.</span> <span id="s891">Some had less hope.</span> <span id="s892">The camp...It was not very far from a forest.</span> <span id="s893">And people started slipping out at night and trying to build little hiding holes that you, bunkers, in the forest.</span> <span id="s894">And they were taking a little bit of food at a time.</span> <span id="s895">They were some boys who used to go every, work all day, and at night they went to the forest and worked all night, and they used to come back.</span> <span id="s896">And quite a few people escaped then, and hid in the forest.</span> <span id="s897">Not too many survived from that, because when the peasants found a hole like this, immediately they, they called the Germans, and they were brought back to the camp, or shot on the way, or something or other.</span> <span id="s898">Some did help, some who did help with food or didn't say anything, I mean, if somebody didn't shoot you, he already was considered a nice guy.</span> <span id="s899">So, we didn't have this, anybody who could do it for us or who could, asked us to go, we didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s900">And we, and that time I, I mean I knew Rolek my husband all my life, because we went to school together and his father was my family doctor.</span> <span id="s901">And then he started asking me to go, his parents were prepared to go to hide in a place, in a house of a certain Ukrainian guy who was a patient, whose father was a patient of his father.</span> <span id="s902">And he wanted to take me with him.</span> <span id="s903">And I said, "I don't think your parents will want me," but I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s904">He said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s905">I talked it over with them.</span> <span id="s906">And they said, 'Yes,'" which I don't think was the truth now.</span> <span id="s907">But I said, "I'm not going anywhere without my parents."</span> <span id="s908">And then he went to my mother, and my mother said, and I'm not sure she didn't like him.</span> <span id="s909">She told me that they have a proposition from a Polish woman to hide them.</span> <span id="s910">I knew this woman.</span> <span id="s911">She was very nice, and she came to my mother often.</span> <span id="s912">And she has room only for two people.</span> <span id="s913">And since everybody knew that Rolek's family can provide me with one, then, mother said, "If you go with him, then we will have a better chance."</span> <span id="s914">And I, being stupid and young, believed it.</span> <span id="s915">Anyway, this is what happened, that in a while, we had news from the front that things are going badly for the Germans, but at the same time, when they are retreating, they probably won't leave anybody alive to be a witness.</span> <span id="s916">So I think in March, at the end of March, '44, Rolek came to me and said, "Well, this is the time.</span> <span id="s917">Tomorrow we have to go."</span> <span id="s918">And I said good-bye to my parents and I went with him and his family to this Ukrainian's place.</span> <span id="s919">Now where we stayed, in his cellar.</span> <span id="s920">[tape off then on] There were Rolek, his parents, his aunt, and I.</span> <span id="s921">There were five.</span> <span id="s922">There was another family—two sisters and a nephew.</span> <span id="s923">That's eight.</span> <span id="s924">There was a married couple and a young boy, that's eleven.</span> <span id="s925">And there was another young couple, thirteen.</span> <span id="s926">I think that was it.</span> <span id="s927">And we were all hiding under his, under the floor of his bedroom.</span> <span id="s928">And he allowed us to come out at night.</span> <span id="s929">All day we were sitting in the, in the cellar and were quiet.</span> <span id="s930">And at night he allowed us to come and go upstairs and cook a little bit and have something to eat.</span> <span id="s931">And then we went back to the cellar.</span> <span id="s932">And I don't know how the neighbors didn't notice that the light was on there and that she was, ac-, we thought nobody else knew about it.</span> <span id="s933">But it turned out that the wife of this guy had six or seven sisters.</span> <span id="s934">And each of them knew about us, and each of them did a little bit of shopping so that she wouldn't stand out at buying too much food.</span> <span id="s935">We actually paid them for it, but I mean, what was money in such a situation?</span> <span id="s936">And it was very dangerous for them already.</span> <span id="s937">Because then, if we were caught, they would be shot too.</span> <span id="s938">But somehow we stayed there till the beginning of August, '44, when the Russian troops came back.</span> <span id="s939">And that was the end of the war for us.</span> <span id="s940">Of course, there were, when we left, there were still quite a few people in the, in the camp.</span> <span id="s941">And my parents, for instance, wanted to prolong the time when they wouldn't have to go to that woman.</span> <span id="s942">But they waited too long, and they were caught and taken to, they were taken in April, 1st, to Plaszow, and then my mother was taken to Auschwitz, where she was killed on the 14th of May.</span> <span id="s943">And my father went, I don't remember whether he went directly, I think directly to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s944">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s945">EM: So, your parents really had an arrangement with this Polish woman to hide them.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">RH: Well, I, for a long time I sort of doubted it.</span> <span id="s947">I thought maybe they did-, my mother told me that only to make me go with Rolek, because she knew I wouldn't leave them.</span> <span id="s948">But later I did meet that woman, and she said, "You know, I have your eiderdown and some other things," that my mother gave her.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">EM: Your what?</span> <span id="s950">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">RH: Her, she had our eiderdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">EM: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">RH: A comforter.</span> <span id="s954">A comforter.</span> <span id="s955">We had a big one that we brought from, from Romania.</span> <span id="s956">And she had something else that my mother gave her to prepare for the time she would go there.</span> <span id="s957">So I said, and, her name was Mrs. Naparova, I remember now.</span> <span id="s958">I said, "Did she real-, did you really mean it?</span> <span id="s959">Do you really mean that she was coming?"</span> <span id="s960">"Oh yes," she said.</span> <span id="s961">"They were supposed to come as soon as they could.</span> <span id="s962">But they stayed in the camp as long as they could, because they didn't have any money, and I didn't have any money, to feed them.</span> <span id="s963">So, and they didn't want, they thought maybe they'll run away a few days before the end."</span> <span id="s964">So, but it didn't work that way.</span> <span id="s965">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s966">EM: So this woman would have taken your parents without being paid for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">RH: Without being paid for it, because they, she knew, she knew us that we lost everything already during the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s968">We had nothing to pay her with.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">EM: Was she a close friend of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">RH: No, not really.</span> <span id="s971">She was a very simple woman.</span> <span id="s972">I don't remember whether she was some kind of dressmaker or something.</span> <span id="s973">I don't know where my mother knew her from.</span> <span id="s974">She wasn't a friend at all.</span> <span id="s975">She was just a woman my mother knew, a simple Polish woman.</span> <span id="s976">And, I don't even know where my mother knew her.</span> <span id="s977">But she came a few times to our house—I remember this—before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">EM: Now, when, did you know when your parents were taken, when you were hiding, did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s979">RH: When I was hiding, they let me know, because the owner of the house we were hiding in, he used to work in a different office, but not far from the camp.</span> <span id="s980">And he saw them being taken to the station.</span> <span id="s981">Well he told, when he came back he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">EM: Were the people from the camp being transported by truck?</span> <span id="s983">Or by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">RH: No, they were, they were marched to the station, and they were put on cattle trains, box train.</span> <span id="s985">And they were taken to the other end of Poland, to Plaszow.</span> <span id="s986">And of course, some died on the way.</span> <span id="s987">Some managed to escape from the wagons—not many.</span> <span id="s988">Some jumped down and broke their legs and were killed, you know.</span> <span id="s989">But some got right to Plaszow and...</span></p> <p><span id="s990">EM: Was that, was that camp liquidated at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">RH: No, because when they took all those Jews who were there at that time, when there were a lot of Jews who were hiding in tiny little towns and villages around Boryslaw, all the ones who escaped previously to the forest, we had mountains—the Carpathians—was just behind our town, and the forests were very thick.</span> <span id="s992">And for a while they, whomever they caught, or who was given away by the Poles or the Ukrainians, they brought to the, back to the camp, and sort of waited until there were enough to transport them again.</span> <span id="s993">And there were three such transports.</span> <span id="s994">And the last one went directly to Oswiecim, because Plaszow already was in the hands of the Russians.</span> <span id="s995">You see, the Russians went like this.</span> <span id="s996">They went with a column, they tried to fight.</span> <span id="s997">But if they couldn't take a town, if it was defended too strongly, they went further, and they left those pockets of Germans in other towns.</span> <span id="s998">So, when we, the last transportation from Boryslaw to Auschwitz was right in the, at the end of July.</span> <span id="s999">And we were already free on the 7th.</span> <span id="s1000">So when we were, I was free, those people were still on those cattle trucks on the railway going to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">EM: So, were you liberated in July?</span> <span id="s1002">Or August?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">RH: No, in, on the 7th of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">EM: Of August, I thought you said...</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">RH: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">EM: In July.</span> <span id="s1007">[tape off then on] So, your parents were taken in one of the,...</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">RH: On the first, the first such transport they were taken, in April.</span> <span id="s1009">It was two weeks or so after I went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1010">And this is when they were taken.</span> <span id="s1011">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">EM: At any time- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">EM: ...Do you remember if at any time there was any talk of resistance or actual resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">RH: Well, they were, there was talk about resistance, but people kept it to only those who could really do something about it.</span> <span id="s1015">I was not in this circle.</span> <span id="s1016">I was about 17, 18 then, very kept together with my mother.</span> <span id="s1017">I couldn't do anything like that.</span> <span id="s1018">But anyway, in Boryslaw it was very difficult, because there was never a great group of Jews together.</span> <span id="s1019">Some were working here.</span> <span id="s1020">Some were working there.</span> <span id="s1021">Some were going and coming back from the, of course the boys were buying guns and it never came to anything, because we were surrounded by not only the Germans, on a, I mean, there were nearly as many of them as of us.</span> <span id="s1022">But apart from this there was for instance the A.K., the Polish underground, who tried to provoke us into something.</span> <span id="s1023">But they actually were not allowed to take, they came once, one guy came to the camp, I remember.</span> <span id="s1024">And Rolek called me then.</span> <span id="s1025">He wanted to sell them guns, and he wanted to take them to the forest.</span> <span id="s1026">Luckily nobody believed him, because then we found out he was a provocateur, and didn't do much good.</span> <span id="s1027">There were some boys who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">EM: Well what would have happened if the people would have gone to the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">RH: Oh, he would have taken them straight to the Germans!</span> <span id="s1030">Or Germans straight to them.</span> <span id="s1031">I mean, he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">EM: He, he w-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">RH: He was a real, em, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">EM: Collaborator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">RH: Collaborator, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">EM: Because you see he was from the A.K., so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">RH: Well, he was from, he said he was from the A.K., but as far as I know, the A.K. also didn't help...</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">EM: Didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">RH: Cooperate with Jews.</span> <span id="s1040">They didn't perhaps cooperate with Germans to the extent that they helped them, but as far as Jews were concerned, the A.K. definitely didn't want any Jews left in Poland just like the Germans didn't want.</span> <span id="s1041">And the Ukrainians were also, except for like you say, like I said before, personal friends or some decent people.</span> <span id="s1042">You didn't do it from the love of Jews, but from their own decency.</span> <span id="s1043">They also didn't have any interest in keeping Jews alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">EM: Could you tell me, how did you learn about the fate of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">RH: All right.</span> <span id="s1046">When I was still in Boryslaw, as I told you, we were free before the rest of, before all the other camps.</span> <span id="s1047">I got a letter, which my father, who was freed in May, 1945, he was freed in a camp in Austria which was Linz Drei.</span> <span id="s1048">[Linz Three]</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">EM: Linz-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">RH: -drei.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">EM: -drei?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1053">Obviously they had... Two camps or three camps there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">RH: It was near the city of Linz of course, and they had there a great, big, and I think there were, I don't know how to call it, the Hermann Goering's work.</span> <span id="s1056">I don't know what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">EM: Ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">RH: Ammunition.</span> <span id="s1059">And my father was practically dead, because not only was he very emaciated, but he also had some infection on his face.</span> <span id="s1060">But, he was freed by the Americans.</span> <span id="s1061">And of course they put him straight in the hospital, and starting feeding them a lot.</span> <span id="s1062">A lot of people died just then, because they couldn't take the food any more.</span> <span id="s1063">And my father somehow survived, and I don't kn-, survived, and I don't know exactly how he happened to meet or just, just, by coincidence, meet a Russian officer who was going into, was going back from the American Zone to the Russian Zone, or was going home.</span> <span id="s1064">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1065">He asked him to mail a letter, once he gets over the border into the Russian Zone.</span> <span id="s1066">And that letter came to Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1067">And this way I knew my father survived, because he wrote to me.</span> <span id="s1068">And from then on I made all the possible step, took all the possible steps to go and meet him.</span> <span id="s1069">But it wasn't so easy, because you couldn't get out of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1070">But, after a while, that would be, also about August.</span> <span id="s1071">No, no, that was, after June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">EM: June of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">RH: June of 1945.</span> <span id="s1074">I must go a little bit back.</span> <span id="s1075">When we were freed, of course we were freed by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1076">And they immediately occupied Boryslaw, and they were still the same as they were before.</span> <span id="s1077">So they opened the schools immediately, and they allowed us to go to school.</span> <span id="s1078">But everybody who was 18 was supposed to work during the day and go to night school, which we did.</span> <span id="s1079">And we decided to do quickly our leaving certificate.</span> <span id="s1080">[graduation certificate]</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">EM: Matura?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">RH: Matura.</span> <span id="s1083">Somehow, I didn't even try to do that, but they ma-, let me jump through one year.</span> <span id="s1084">So I did the Matura together with Rolek, with, who was always one year ahead of me.</span> <span id="s1085">And, just at that time we heard that there is going to be an exchange of citizens between the Soviet Union and Poland.</span> <span id="s1086">I mean, after-war Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">EM: Because that part of Poland was annexed to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">RH: Annexed to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1089">So the Soviet Union wanted the Ukrainians who lived in the west, and, to come back.</span> <span id="s1090">And for that they allowed the Polish citizens to go west.</span> <span id="s1091">And so we jumped at it as soon as we got our, our Matura we left.</span> <span id="s1092">Even Rolek's parents stayed a bit longer.</span> <span id="s1093">And particularly I was in a hurry because I already had that letter from my father.</span> <span id="s1094">So I wanted to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s1095">And as soon as we got there, we started looking for a possibility to go, for me to go to Austria to find my father.</span> <span id="s1096">Well, it wasn't just as easy as that.</span> <span id="s1097">You couldn't decide and get a passport and go away.</span> <span id="s1098">You had to go through, through this so we could smuggle yourself through the border.</span> <span id="s1099">And there were people who used to arrange these things.</span> <span id="s1100">And I joined a group of Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">EM: Greeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">RH: Greek Jews who were deported, who were deported to Auschwitz from Greece, and a few survivors were allowed to go home to Greece.</span> <span id="s1103">There weren't too many Greeks, but there were a lot of Polish Jews who wanted to get out of there, and I was one of them, and I had to pretend I am Greek by not opening my mouth all through the, through the border guards things, because nobody had any papers, any names, any nothing, and that was, I think early October, 1945.</span> <span id="s1104">And it took me about two weeks to get to Austria, where I found my father.</span> <span id="s1105">In the meantime while I already knew my father was alive, in the meantime people started coming back from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1106">And while I was waiting to get out of Poland to find my father, a friend of mine, who was with me, and her mother and my mother were in the same room at the later stage in the camp.</span> <span id="s1107">And she came back, and she told me, cause she was together with her mother and my mother, taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1108">And at this famous selection on the 14th of May, her mother and mine were taken one way, and she was hit with the butt of a rifle and she was sent the other way.</span> <span id="s1109">So she lived.</span> <span id="s1110">But she told me exactly what happened to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">EM: So you know that your mother and her mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">RH: Died together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">EM: Died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">RH: Yes, and she, this woman, she still lives, she is alive in Israel.</span> <span id="s1115">We see her from time to time.</span> <span id="s1116">[tape off then on] So, she even told me exactly what my mother kept saying all that way.</span> <span id="s1117">She kept saying that she is very happy that I am not with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">EM: Did she know how come your mother got separated from your father, in Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">RH: Well, they were separated in, Pla-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">EM: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">RH: Plaszow.</span> <span id="s1122">And the men stayed there longer.</span> <span id="s1123">The women were taken away to Auschwitz earlier.</span> <span id="s1124">And my father was I think a week or two—they were separated immediately—but then, my father, before my, they took my father to Auschwitz, there was, though, to, sorry, to Mauthausen, I think it was two weeks or so after.</span> <span id="s1125">I couldn't be sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">EM: So, your father was taken, as far as you remember, from Plaszow to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">EM: Or took first to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">RH: No, no, he wasn't in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1130">He was taken to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1131">You see, my father didn't talk about it much.</span> <span id="s1132">He didn't want to tell me details.</span> <span id="s1133">And I knew it distressed him enormously.</span> <span id="s1134">But I knew he, he, all through his life he had nightmares and he was calling out in his sleep.</span> <span id="s1135">So I had a few details, but I couldn't put them together.</span> <span id="s1136">I knew how bad it was, but he never wanted to tell me, or my boys.</span> <span id="s1137">He never, never wanted to tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">EM: So, what happened later?</span> <span id="s1139">You joined your father and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">RH: I joined my father in Austria and he was by then working in the UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">EM: The United Nations...</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">RH: So, United Nations, Relief and Rehabilitation Organization, or, Association.</span> <span id="s1143">And he was then manager of the office, because he was always into these, these jobs [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">EM: That was in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">RH: That was, yes, in October, '45.</span> <span id="s1146">And I got a job there too and we, I stayed there with him, and we were hoping that my parents-in-law and Rolek—actually, I wasn't married yet—but we were hoping that they could join us, and then we can all come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1147">Because we had relatives here who were willing to send us papers for the whole family.</span> <span id="s1148">But his parents weren't so very willing, because they had relatives in Australia and they preferred to go there.</span> <span id="s1149">In any case, Rolek started, Rolek was in Poland.</span> <span id="s1150">He started studying medicine, and he, they lived in Breslau, where he went to a university for a while.</span> <span id="s1151">And he wrote me, also letters were very hard to smuggle through, but he wrote me through somebody to come back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1152">With my father we can get a, somewhere to live and we can get jobs and all this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1153">And I decided that I didn't want to believe that entirely the way he said it.</span> <span id="s1154">He was a bit too enthusiastic and my father was too old, and he went to, he wasn't so very old.</span> <span id="s1155">He was only fifty-, '45 and four, forty-nine years old.</span> <span id="s1156">But he was after such a terrible ordeal.</span> <span id="s1157">So I thought I'd go to Poland myself, because it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just to sit on the train and go.</span> <span id="s1158">I had to again smuggle myself through the, through the border—twice, not just one border.</span> <span id="s1159">And I decided to go and see what happened, how, how does it really look?</span> <span id="s1160">By the time I got there, my parents-in-law already had a permit, landing permit, to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1161">So, if I had come with my father, we would have stuck in Pol-, were stuck in Poland and that was it.</span> <span id="s1162">So I was very glad.</span> <span id="s1163">I smuggled myself out of Poland again, and I'm not such a big hero.</span> <span id="s1164">I don't know how, people helped us, there were organizations who arranged these things.</span> <span id="s1165">And then, Rolek came to, Rolek already had all the papers in order.</span> <span id="s1166">And he got, there was this very short time when Poland was allowing people to emigrate and gave them passports.</span> <span id="s1167">So he came to Austria, and we got married then.</span> <span id="s1168">And he had to go immediately back to Poland within a week or so, immediately back to Poland so that he and his parents to go, could go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1169">Because, as his wife I could get a permit to go to Australia in a very short time.</span> <span id="s1170">If I were only the fiancé , first of all I couldn't bring my father with me.</span> <span id="s1171">And then it would have taken years.</span> <span id="s1172">As it was, we didn't see each other for about 18 months.</span> <span id="s1173">And then we, my father and I went to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">EM: So when did you arrive in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">RH: I arrived in Australia exactly on the 9th of January, 1949.</span> <span id="s1176">My father immediately got a job, and he died in 1976.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">EM: Oh, how, briefly, how was your life in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">RH: Well, Australia is a very good country, only in the beginning you don't think so.</span> <span id="s1179">You only begin to appreciate Australia when you have children.</span> <span id="s1180">It's a good place to bring children up.</span> <span id="s1181">And Australia is a very, as I said, is good to everybody.</span> <span id="s1182">A lot of people had it much easier than we.</span> <span id="s1183">I don't know, you need a bit of luck, a bit of ability.</span> <span id="s1184">But on the whole, I have two sons who did very well, and they're happy there.</span> <span id="s1185">And I think I must say that on the whole it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">EM: Were you helped by any Jewish organizations when you arrived in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1188">When Rolek arrived, he was helped by a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1189">They lent him some small amount of money to set up in business.</span> <span id="s1190">But, I think, they promised, I'm not really sure what happened, whether they promised and didn't deliver, or whether they did give him some money, but that was before I arrived.</span> <span id="s1191">When I arrived he was already in, doing a little bit of business.</span> <span id="s1192">And I helped, started helping him immediately.</span> <span id="s1193">And as I said, we arrived on Tuesday.</span> <span id="s1194">By Friday my father had a job, so he helped us too.</span> <span id="s1195">And after that, we didn't need or didn't ask anybody's help.</span> <span id="s1196">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">EM: Could you tell me what you know about the rest of the family?</span> <span id="s1198">You were an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">EM: But, do you know of what happened to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">RH: To the other relatives.</span> <span id="s1202">Now, on my father's side, it's easy.</span> <span id="s1203">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1204">My father had four brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s1205">The sister died before the war.</span> <span id="s1206">She was a very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1207">She was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1208">And she died before the war.</span> <span id="s1209">I think she was about 28.</span> <span id="s1210">But, out of the brothers, two were married, with two children each, and two were not married.</span> <span id="s1211">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1212">On my mother's side, my mother had five brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s1213">So, on my mother's side, two brothers, and one sister survived.</span> <span id="s1214">And each of the brothers who survived had one daughter.</span> <span id="s1215">The others who died all have children and nobody survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">EM: Nobody survived?</span> <span id="s1217">Do you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">RH: I have only, at the moment I have one living aunt, who is 88 years of age.</span> <span id="s1219">[tape off then on].</span> <span id="s1220">So, apart from this auntie, there is one cousin living in the United States, and one cousin living in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">EM: Do you know what happened?</span> <span id="s1222">I mean, your cousins died.</span> <span id="s1223">Do you happen to know where, or when, they perished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">RH: I'm afraid I don't know exactly when.</span> <span id="s1225">And they were, one was ol-, a year older than I.</span> <span id="s1226">He lived with his parents in a little town not far from Boryslaw, which was called Stary-Sambor.</span> <span id="s1227">And, for a while, during the first months of the German occupation, they all stayed with us in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1228">But, they were afraid, because they didn't belong there.</span> <span id="s1229">They didn't have any documents, so they went back to their own town.</span> <span id="s1230">But, somebody gave them away.</span> <span id="s1231">And I don't know many details.</span> <span id="s1232">But I know that nobody survived, but I don't know exactly when and what happened.</span> <span id="s1233">Then there was one uncle who lived in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1234">Two uncles, actually, lived in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1235">But one died in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1236">The other one died in the beginning of the occupation, but his wife and two children were taken by the Germans, and I'm not sure exactly when.</span> <span id="s1237">The other uncle perished with his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s1238">Also, I'm not sure whether they lived together or some went first and some later.</span> <span id="s1239">Because we were not, we were separated.</span> <span id="s1240">We were not together at all.</span> <span id="s1241">We saw, we could see each other only very seldom.</span> <span id="s1242">[tape off then on] The last aunt, which was my mother's middle sister, used to live in Sanok before the war, but she also came back to Boryslaw with her husband.</span> <span id="s1243">Her husband was in the concentration camp with my father in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s1244">I'm not sure when he died.</span> <span id="s1245">And I'm not quite sure when aunt died.</span> <span id="s1246">Either he, she probably was taken in the third action.</span> <span id="s1247">And that was about it.</span> <span id="s1248">That was the nearest family, and I don't really know much about any further.</span> <span id="s1249">I'm sure there were quite a few, but we were not together in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">EM: Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">RH: There is a lot more to say, but I don't know exactly what.</span> <span id="s1252">And just the fact that I'm here, it's very often a great source of guilt feeling to me, but, and I really, one thing I don't know is why.</span> <span id="s1253">That's about all I have to say, unless you ask me more questions and I'll answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">EM: It's a very common feeling, the guilt feeling...</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">RH: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">EM: And the search for an answer, why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">RH: I'm not searching, because I know there is no answer, but it's, that's the only thing you can say about a thing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">EM: Your children, do they question you about your past?</span> <span id="s1259">Do you talk about your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">RH: Well, when they were little, I didn't want to tell them too much, since they, as I said, they were born in Australia.</span> <span id="s1261">It was an entirely different world.</span> <span id="s1262">There are not too many Jews there, although we were, we always had a little circle of friends.</span> <span id="s1263">And not that I avoided the subject, but I thought, I'll ask them, when they ask me I'll tell them, but not before.</span> <span id="s1264">We never hid anything from them.</span> <span id="s1265">We never pretended things didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1266">They did ask.</span> <span id="s1267">But then after a while they didn't ask too many questions, so I s-, one day when they were already in their early teens, I asked them, "Don't you really want to know all this what happened and where you..." And he said, they said, they wanted to know very much, but they saw how distressed I became every time even the subject came up, and they didn't want to make me upset, so they stopped asking.</span> <span id="s1268">They are interested in it now, and they're trying to make sort of family histories and all this sort of thing, but now they're grown men and very busy with their lives.</span> <span id="s1269">So we don't see each other too often, but definitely they were interested.</span> <span id="s1270">They know quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1271">They read a lot.</span> <span id="s1272">They were both in Israel and they, they know quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1273">But exactly my feelings, or exactly all my, all my what I went through, no, they don't know.</span> <span id="s1274">I don't want them to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">EM: How do they feel about their Judaism?</span> <span id="s1276">Religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">RH: Well, unfortun-, I mean, I don't know if it's unfortunate, they don't like organized religion.</span> <span id="s1278">They feel quite comfortable being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1279">They are not, I would say, obviously, patriotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">EM: You mean patriotic as...</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">RH: As, as...</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">EM: As Jews, or as...</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">RH: I mean, Israel is important to them, but they don't make a big thing out of it.</span> <span id="s1284">And, that's it.</span> <span id="s1285">They don't hide it.</span> <span id="s1286">They had little trouble at school because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s1287">In Australia it's not very common.</span> <span id="s1288">But there were cases when someone called them, "Dirty Jew," and they, they fought their own...</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">EM: Battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">RH: Battles, and it didn't scar them, or it didn't make them bitter or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1291">This is actually why I didn't want them to know too much.</span> <span id="s1292">I know that when they, Danny was only a very little boy.</span> <span id="s1293">He was at school.</span> <span id="s1294">And, it was a public school.</span> <span id="s1295">There were only two or three Jews in that class.</span> <span id="s1296">And when the religion lesson came, there was not enough to have a rabbi, so they sent them to some other religion.</span> <span id="s1297">And after a few weeks I noticed, or months, they didn't, they don't pay much attention to religion in Australia anyways, so they only had once a month a minister come and tell them.</span> <span id="s1298">And I saw that he was too young.</span> <span id="s1299">He was very, likely to become confused.</span> <span id="s1300">So I went to the headmaster and I said would he excuse him for, from religion because, not because I have any, you know, they should know that other religion exists.</span> <span id="s1301">But he gets confused and he's a little bit too young to decide what's what, and could he ask him to, tell, make him do something else, some extra homework or something in that time?</span> <span id="s1302">So the Headmaster said, "Yes, I can do that, but don't you want him to be like other children?</span> <span id="s1303">Because he'll feel different."</span> <span id="s1304">And I said, "Well, he is different.</span> <span id="s1305">And sooner or later somebody will remind him about it."</span> <span id="s1306">So he was very surprised, because that, at that time that wasn't even an issue in Australia.</span> <span id="s1307">But he did what I wanted and, sure enough in high school.</span> <span id="s1308">Somebody reminded him, but it wasn't serious and it wasn't very bad, and this boy's father came to us, with the boy, to make him apologize.</span> <span id="s1309">So, you see, it wasn't really this type that you'd find in Europe or in other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">EM: So you don't find too much antisemitism in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">RH: Well there must be...</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">EM: O-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">RH: Because it's...</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">EM: Overt, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">RH: No, overt there is, there are groups who, who have no work and no education, so they go and they smear synagogues with swastikas.</span> <span id="s1316">But, Australia now has too many different religions and too many different nationalities that this is of any seriousness.</span> <span id="s1317">And, I'm saying if the government doesn't encourage it—and it doesn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">EM: Is there separation of, there's no separation of State and Church?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">RH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">EM: There is.</span> <span id="s1321">Because you say that they have classes of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">RH: Well, they have classes in the religious, in the religion, because the parents wish so, but it's not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">EM: Mandatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">RH: Not mandatory.</span> <span id="s1325">It's not separated like it's in America, that you can't even say a prayer.</span> <span id="s1326">But, the State and the Church, I mean, there are too many churches.</span> <span id="s1327">There is not one Church that is, like in Poland, the Catholic Church was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">EM: Not one dominant...</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">RH: No, no, not one dominant.</span> <span id="s1330">There is the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s1331">There are different denominations of Protestants, and everybody's allowed to do whatever they want, and there are even, there are Muslims and Hindus and Hare Krishna, and goodness knows what.</span> <span id="s1332">So everybody's allowed to do what they like, and provided there is no discrimination and no particular, you know, harassment.</span> <span id="s1333">And then, everybody's allowed to go their own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">EM: Do you feel it's important for non-Jews to know about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">RH: Well, it's important of them to know, because, but I really don't believe that knowing about it would prevent them, or their children doing something.</span> <span id="s1336">This is a hist-, this was a historic force which may repeat itself and I don't think this is so simple, that if we tell them how terrible that was, they will be scared so much of themselves that they will never do it again.</span> <span id="s1337">I don't think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">EM: So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">RH: But it's important.</span> <span id="s1340">I mean, people ask me, quite a lot of non-Jews, ask me.</span> <span id="s1341">For instance, I knew a very intelligent woman, a painter, who told me, "Look, I can ask you because I know you will tell me the truth."</span> <span id="s1342">And that was at the time when Australia had 7,000,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s1343">Now it's got 17.</span> <span id="s1344">"You know, when you tell me," sorry, Australia had 12 then.</span> <span id="s1345">"So, if you tell me 6,000,000 died in several years, short time, I just can't, I can't take it in.</span> <span id="s1346">I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s1347">After all, it's half of the population of Australia!</span> <span id="s1348">So tell me, how much truth there is."</span> <span id="s1349">So I told her.</span> <span id="s1350">Poland had three-and-a-half million Jews.</span> <span id="s1351">They're gone.</span> <span id="s1352">So many French, so many Dutch, so many Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1353">And then she understood the, the, m-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">EM: The enormous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">RH: The enormity of it.</span> <span id="s1356">Of course not everybody pays attention to it.</span> <span id="s1357">Nobody, not anybody's interested, but, I had an old babysitter, an English woman, who told me that during the war they collected gold for the Jews in Germany, to take them to, to buy them out of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1358">And she gave her wedding ring, and she had a brooch, a brooch of her mother's that she gave away.</span> <span id="s1359">You see?</span> <span id="s1360">Of course it didn't go there, and it didn't help anybody, but there were people like that.</span> <span id="s1361">And- Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">EM: ...When you look back, do you feel that the Ukrainians were helping more or less than the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">RH: No, I can't say that at all, because it was very individual, and it did not depend on what nationality they were.</span> <span id="s1364">There were Poles helping, and Ukrainians helping, and at the same time, Poles helping the Germans, because everybody had an interest in getting rid of Jews.</span> <span id="s1365">I can't say who was worse.</span> <span id="s1366">The Ukrainians on the whole were more, shall we say, uncouth.</span> <span id="s1367">They were less smooth and more, like peasants in their ways.</span> <span id="s1368">But some had kind hearts, and you can say, you can quote anecdotes from both sides.</span> <span id="s1369">As far as I know.</span> <span id="s1370">I mean, there were people, there were, I have a friend who says that when she, even before the war, all she knew about Polish boys is that they were throwing stones at Jews.</span> <span id="s1371">On the other hand, I was going to school with Polish boys, who were very kind to us, and who, a lot of them did help.</span> <span id="s1372">So, you can't generalize.</span> <span id="s1373">I can never generalize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">EM: Did you have any contact with clergy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">RH: No.</span> <span id="s1376">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1377">I personally didn't.</span> <span id="s1378">I just, was one case in my family where my uncle's little girl was saved by another uncle, and her father went to the priest and asked her to save her, to have her baptized and give her Polish documents.</span> <span id="s1379">So this particular priest, who was, it turned out, a very decent man, he said...</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">EM: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">RH: Yeah, yeah, Ksiade Osikowicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">EM: Osikowicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">RH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1384">And, I didn't know him even personally, but we heard about him a lot.</span> <span id="s1385">He saved quite a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s1386">He baptized some.</span> <span id="s1387">Probably they reverted back later, but with this, with my cousin who now is alive and living in Israel, he gave her papers, and she was not baptized, because she didn't [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">EM: How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">RH: She was about three at the time.</span> <span id="s1390">And as a matter of fact, this Ksiadz Osikowicz was killed in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">EM: She, she wasn't baptized.</span> <span id="s1392">Did she say why he didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">RH: No, he didn't want to be suspected of trying to catch souls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">EM: To catch souls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">RH: To catch souls for the religion, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">EM: So he didn't want to take advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">RH: Advantage of, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">EM: Of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">RH: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">EM: And he gave her papers without...</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">RH: Without baptizing her, and she's a good Jewish woman to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">EM: This Ksiadz, em...</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">RH: Osikowicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">EM: Osikowicz.</span> <span id="s1405">You say he perished in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">RH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">EM: Do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">RH: I don't think he perished in Auschwitz only for helping Jews.</span> <span id="s1409">But, he was also active in the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1410">And for one reason of another, he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">EM: Taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">RH: Taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">EM: Do you have any recollection of Jews helping other Jews or, for non-selfish reason, or even endangering their lives by being, collaborators with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">RH: Well, unfortunately I have more of those second recollections than first.</span> <span id="s1415">Of course there were a lot of Jews who helped each other, without thinking.</span> <span id="s1416">There were perhaps some Jews who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">EM: I don't mean family members, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">RH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">EM: Strangers, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">RH: Strangers, yes, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1421">It was, if it was, if it happened and when it happened it was taken for granted that it should be so.</span> <span id="s1422">But on the other hand, there were some Jews who collaborated in the way that they became policemen or that they became a kapo and they were, they were, some who did help the Germans and to the detriment of other Jews, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">EM: [tape off then on] Can you think of any other incidents when you were helped by non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1425">I had several incidents.</span> <span id="s1426">I may not remember them all, but some, although they are small, they really stand in my memory, and I must never forget about it.</span> <span id="s1427">For instance, I had a school friend, a Polish girl, whose name was Wadka Kusztak.</span> <span id="s1428">And her parents, her father was an ordinary laborer in the industry, but she was a very bright girl and she went with me to high school.</span> <span id="s1429">They were very poor, even in Polish circumstances.</span> <span id="s1430">But we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s1431">She came to my place.</span> <span id="s1432">Only once she invited me to her place, and young as I was, I was shocked, because in her house, there was no floor.</span> <span id="s1433">There was the earth.</span> <span id="s1434">Anyway, they were decent people, and she, when the Germans came, she became a servant for an, a German who was sort of Lord mayor, like that.</span> <span id="s1435">And this girl would come to my place, which was not the ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s1436">We were still living in our house.</span> <span id="s1437">And she—once a week—and she would bring me one roll with ham.</span> <span id="s1438">And, this is like somebody would give me today a pound of caviar every day and a bottle of champagne, because this girl, she didn't have anything else, but she had a brother and a sister and two parents, for whom this roll would be just as great a, a necessity or a luxury as for me.</span> <span id="s1439">But she did bring it to me for many, many weeks until later she lost her job.</span> <span id="s1440">And the last time she came, she brought me a pair of wooden soled shoes, because she saw that I grew out of mine, or didn't have any more shoes.</span> <span id="s1441">So, this thing I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s1442">They were, there was a Ukrainian, there were three Ukrainians, young Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1443">I don't know where they knew my father from, but they found out that he was a teacher of German.</span> <span id="s1444">So, they came to him to give them lessons, because they liked to be well with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1445">I don't know their names even, and I never met them before or after, but they were three young boys maybe between 18 and 19.</span> <span id="s1446">And I was then only say, 15.</span> <span id="s1447">But I was very small.</span> <span id="s1448">And these boys used to come to lessons and not only they paid my father with money—which was also very rare, because we didn't have any way to get real money except selling our stuff—but, they used to bring a small bottle of milk, a little piece of meat, and a little sack of flour.</span> <span id="s1449">And they used to give it to my mother and they said in Ukrainian, "To dla detiny."</span> <span id="s1450">And that means, "That's for the child."</span> <span id="s1451">That was me.</span> <span id="s1452">Every such thing.</span> <span id="s1453">I had a Ukrainian girlfriend that's, from primary school who, I don't know how she remembered that, but she remembered I like a particular dish, pierogi.</span> <span id="s1454">So she came to the ghetto once, with a big dish of pierogi, and another dish of sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s1455">There was only small things, but they just show, they didn't show a great solidarity with us, but they showed that they were human beings.</span> <span id="s1456">And this is why I say I can't generalize.</span> <span id="s1457">Some were like this, some were like that.</span> <span id="s1458">There were a lot of instances.</span> <span id="s1459">There was for instance, a neighbor of ours who used to go to school with my father.</span> <span id="s1460">And, they weren't friends all the time.</span> <span id="s1461">They just met by coincidence when we lived in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1462">And he also had a daughter, an only daughter.</span> <span id="s1463">And she was, her mother and she, the daughter, were considered very chauvinistic Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1464">And she even told me once that she would be proud if they made her wear an arm band like ours, only with the Ukrainian colors.</span> <span id="s1465">But, when, one day, and my mother still had a fur coat, because we had to give away all our furs.</span> <span id="s1466">But when we had to give away that, my mother took the fur coat to her, because she was a good neighbor, and said, if the times change, they will give it back, otherwise.</span> <span id="s1467">So, after the, not after the war, but after that particular time when we had to give away all our furs, she came and she brought it back.</span> <span id="s1468">And my mother sold it to her for some food, or, I don't know what happened, but at least, she didn't have to do it.</span> <span id="s1469">And as I said, anybody who didn't kill me was a gentleman.</span> <span id="s1470">So, we must remember those things.</span> <span id="s1471">And there were some bigger deeds, too.</span> <span id="s1472">There was one guy who was a young man, who was considered a little bit abnormal because he had religious mania or something, a Pole, a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1473">It turned out that, after the war that he saved 15 Jews in his house.</span> <span id="s1474">He fed them.</span> <span id="s1475">He didn't make them, or let them pay.</span> <span id="s1476">Actually, those people who he saved were quite well off.</span> <span id="s1477">You see, you can't, you can't,...</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">EM: Now, briefly, help, any incidents of help from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">RH: Well, I had very great incidents from, of help from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1480">I mean, not too many, but at least two, who were really, one is quite well-known all over the world for helping Jews in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s1481">His name is Bertold Beitz.</span> <span id="s1482">I think he's still alive.</span> <span id="s1483">And he personally pulled me out, and my father, from one action.</span> <span id="s1484">And, not only me, I mean it, we weren't particularly friends of his.</span> <span id="s1485">And it was quite a strange situation, because he was a young man.</span> <span id="s1486">He was not a partegenosse, which we found out after the war.</span> <span id="s1487">He had an interest in keeping Jews alive as long as possible in Boryslaw so he could be the big chief and we were his Indians.</span> <span id="s1488">Otherwise he probably would have had to go into the army.</span> <span id="s1489">But nevertheless, he did save quite a few Jews.</span> <span id="s1490">And, that was recognized.</span> <span id="s1491">He was invited to Poland.</span> <span id="s1492">He was invited I think even to Israel.</span> <span id="s1493">I'm not sure of that, though.</span> <span id="s1494">But I'm sure his name is somewhere in the Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1495">And also he was invited to Moscow, and everywhere it was acknowledged the help he gave people.</span> <span id="s1496">The other one was his subordinate, but who was also my boss.</span> <span id="s1497">His name was Siegemund.</span> <span id="s1498">And he...</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">EM: Do you know how to spell that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">RH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1501">S-I-E-G-E-M-U-N-D.</span> <span id="s1502">Siegemund.</span> <span id="s1503">I don’t know his first name.</span> <span id="s1504">And when he first came to Boryslaw we were living still in our house not in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1505">And he, somebody told him that my father is a teacher of violin.</span> <span id="s1506">So he sent for my father, to teach his son.</span> <span id="s1507">He played the violin.</span> <span id="s1508">And in his house my father was invited to, they knew we didn't have any food, so whenever they were eating, they were, invited my father to sit with them, which was unheard of.</span> <span id="s1509">The little boy climbed all over his knees and played with him, and he taught him the violin.</span> <span id="s1510">And the parents were very civil.</span> <span id="s1511">There was only one girl, who was about 12, who was already Hitler Jugend.</span> <span id="s1512">And she started making a fuss about not allowing a Jew to sit at their table.</span> <span id="s1513">And so they were, probably the parents were scared that she'll tell somebody, and those lessons were discontinued.</span> <span id="s1514">But at the same time, he used to be my boss where I worked, in the Karpaten-aktien gesellschaft.</span> <span id="s1515">I just remembered.</span> <span id="s1516">And then he also pulled me out, twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">EM: Well, is there anything else that you can think of that would be worthwhile recording?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">RH: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1519">I really can't think of.</span> <span id="s1520">These are the, the, the single examples of decent people.</span> <span id="s1521">Against that you can put all those thousands of murders, murderers.</span> <span id="s1522">But I can't at the moment think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">EM: All right, Mrs. Harmelin.</span> <span id="s1524">I do want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1525">And that's about all in the interview.</span> <span id="s1526">It's going to be of great help, and I know it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s1527">I do thank you.</span></p></body></html>
