by stating your name, your date of birth, where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My name is Herbert Katzki.</span> <span id="s13">I was born October 4, 1907 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s14">Most people don't know where Elizabeth is, but there is such a place.</span> <span id="s15">I come from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and personal background in terms ofa religious home, a politically active home.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, let's see.</span> <span id="s18">I moved from Elizabeth to New York, and it was in 1917.</span> <span id="s19">Weit was a combination of households.</span> <span id="s20">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away.</span> <span id="s21">And so we were there along mymy mother with two children and her mother.</span> <span id="s22">And so we had to get along.</span> <span id="s23">My education was in the New York school system.</span> <span id="s24">I went to New York University, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics.</span> <span id="s25">Went to school at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs.</span> <span id="s26">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a mercantile firm.</span> <span id="s27">Working in the credit department decided me on becoming a credit man.</span> <span id="s28">And so in school, I studied credits and collections.</span> <span id="s29">That was the subject of my major and accounting.</span> <span id="s30">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular firm and went into the banking business.</span> <span id="s31">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman.</span> <span id="s32">Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company.</span> <span id="s33">I started working for the Manufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929.</span> <span id="s34">And I guess that probably influenced my career.</span> <span id="s35">Anyhow, I was with the bank until 1936.</span> <span id="s36">They got looking around to see how things were going.</span> <span id="s37">Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing.</span> <span id="s38">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job.</span> <span id="s39">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years.</span> <span id="s40">That was a very long agreement.</span> <span id="s41">I worked in the New York headquarters office of the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s42">Then until 1939I was there until November.</span> <span id="s43">How come?</span> <span id="s44">The war began in September.</span> <span id="s45">It became apparent to me as it did to others that circumstances will have changed in Europe, and JDC would need all the help it could over in Europe.</span> <span id="s46">I volunteered to go overseas.</span> <span id="s47">I was accepted, and I went overseas.</span> <span id="s48">And I arrived overseas in December 1939.</span> <span id="s49">My first permanent job, we thought would be in Paris, the headquarters in Paris, where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there.</span> <span id="s50">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T‑r‑o‑p‑e‑r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC.</span> <span id="s51">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join Mr. Troper.</span> <span id="s52">Joe Schwartz landed in Italy, joined Troper, who was going to Eastern Europe, who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off.</span> <span id="s53">While they were overseas, war did ensue.</span> <span id="s54">While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along.</span> <span id="s55">That was in June 1940.</span> <span id="s56">They were traveling around.</span> <span id="s57">The Germans were practically knocking on the door in Paris.</span> <span id="s58">I was in charge of the office.</span> <span id="s59">It was the European headquarters, I was in charge of the office at the time.</span> <span id="s60">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move its office.</span> <span id="s61">It couldn't remain there.</span> <span id="s62">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in Paris at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French‑Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others.</span> <span id="s63">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the American Embassy, who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of Paris or not and so on.</span> <span id="s64">Decided to close up the office and to move out.</span> <span id="s65">That was on Mondayit's Mondaythat was on Sunday.</span> <span id="s66">I guess that was on June the 8th orif that was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s67">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the office.</span> <span id="s68">Closed the office, movedintended originally to move to Tours.</span> <span id="s69">Couldn't go to Tours because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from Paris to Tours, and they occupied the city to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in.</span> <span id="s70">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the office, I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving Paris.</span> <span id="s71">They came in Monday to leave the office with their baggage and so on, and they went over to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s72">I came there when Ias I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies we decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us.</span> <span id="s73">And the JDC was the only Jewish organization, welfare organization, in Paris, all by ourselves.</span> <span id="s74">Well, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Troper came back to Paris on Monday.</span> <span id="s75">The rest of the staff had left.</span> <span id="s76">I had kept the office open.</span> <span id="s77">There were just onetwo secretaries, myself andno, three secretaries, myself and then the two gentlemen who came back.</span> <span id="s78">We closed down theclosed down the shop on Tuesday, and the Germans came in on Thursday.</span> <span id="s79">As I said, we've started out for Tours, we couldn't get in, had to change directions.</span> <span id="s80">We ended up in Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s81">We moved the JDC headquarters over to Bordeaux</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Can I interrupt you here.</span> <span id="s83">I have a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: You were in Europe already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had started</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q:in Europe.</span> <span id="s88">What was the mood?</span> <span id="s89">What did you think was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: The mood in Paris was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs Elysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal.</span> <span id="s91">And you couldn't tell by looking around the streets that anything was happening at all.</span> <span id="s92">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans.</span> <span id="s93">Well, it was misplaced, as you know.</span> <span id="s94">So thatwe ended up, then, in Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s95">We moved the office down there.</span> <span id="s96">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe with which we had been operating to tell them where our new office was in Bordeaux, to discover later on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out.</span> <span id="s97">They were held up by the center, by the military people in Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s98">We were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or five days.</span> <span id="s99">Government in the meantime had moved down to Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s100">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the city.</span> <span id="s101">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the railroad station to let the French know that they're still around.</span> <span id="s102">And the French, then, had sat down and said, "Anybody who wants to leave Bordeaux, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out."</span> <span id="s103">So we were there.</span> <span id="s104">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s105">We decided to get out.</span> <span id="s106">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the fields, just to get out of Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s107">As a matter of fact, the road were so crowded at that time with refugeeswho were coming down from Belgium into France, and from Northern France going down to Southern Francethat the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from Paris to Bordeaux, it took us three days to get down there.</span> <span id="s108">The roads were that crowded with refugees.</span> <span id="s109">And we had hardships along the road too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s110">So we decided then to get out of Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s111">We did that and headed for Lisbon and decided that the Lisbon was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in European territory, and that's the place to have the office.</span> <span id="s112">That was all right because the United States was not yet in the war.</span> <span id="s113">This was inwhen we went to Lisbon, that was in June, July 1940.</span> <span id="s114">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in Lisbon, and that's where we were going to make our new headquarters.</span> <span id="s115">I went back to Marseille after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French‑Jewish population, especiallyparticularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the north and from Belgium.</span> <span id="s116">Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I opened up the office for the JDC in Marseille for unoccupied France.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: I want to backtrack a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Because I have a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s120">In 1939 and 1940 before Paris was occupied</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Where were your efforts directed?</span> <span id="s123">Where were the JDCwere you sending money into Germany or</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No.</span> <span id="s125">Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into Germany.</span> <span id="s126">We had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German Hoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in Germany with which we worked, whereby they would collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the United States.</span> <span id="s127">They would collect them in Marks, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars.</span> <span id="s128">Consequently our dollars did not go into Germany, but the counter‑value of local currency, which was already in Germany, was made available to the agency with which we operated.</span> <span id="s129">So if you ask if we sent money in, we did not.</span> <span id="s130">We operated that kind of a transaction.</span> <span id="s131">And when Austria was overoffice was the anschluss, we did the same thing with Austria.</span> <span id="s132">And in due course we even worked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into Poland.</span> <span id="s133">We didn't send money into Poland either.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: You went over with this purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, I went over for theI didn't go over as a financier.</span> <span id="s136">I went over as aas a generalist, who happened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over.</span> <span id="s137">I went over, as I say, as a generalist.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Is that what</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: You ask what did we do out of Lisbon.</span> <span id="s140">And Lisbon, since we were not in the war, and Lisbon was neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been in contact with, by phone or mail or whatever.</span> <span id="s141">But of course, by mail we would not have tried to get in touchor any other waywith Germany, because anything that a name like Jewish, who would have beentripped us in Germany, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow.</span> <span id="s142">And the same thing with Austria.</span> <span id="s143">But with the other countries we could still work.</span> <span id="s144">There weren't many countries left where the Germansof course they occupied everything.</span> <span id="s145">So that while we were at liberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Now, being that you were in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in Germany and Austria than the people back in the United States had.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in Lisbonback in Lisbon in 1943that we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the concentration camps, which later became known.</span> <span id="s150">We did notI did not know that in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s151">We didn't have that information.</span> <span id="s152">The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by Riegner from Geneva, and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American Mission in Berne.</span> <span id="s153">And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that were coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that proof.</span> <span id="s154">Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on.</span> <span id="s155">But in Lisbon, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it.</span> <span id="s156">They didn't know it either.</span> <span id="s157">They had no reporters running around loose, going into the camps or something.</span> <span id="s158">So we didn't know it.</span> <span id="s159">And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were suppressed.</span> <span id="s160">So the information wasn't generally known.</span> <span id="s161">So we worked then.</span> <span id="s162">We stayed in contact, which was all right until December 1941, wheneverything got stopped off when we entered the war, and then we were fighting with Germany and with Austria, and the Italians came in in June 1941.</span> <span id="s163">And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on.</span> <span id="s164">We had to find other ways then for remaining in contact and communicating with them.</span> <span id="s165">We got in touch with a man in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s166">You may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph).</span> <span id="s167">His name keeps coming up.</span> <span id="s168">He lived in up in St. Gallen in North Switzerland, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare organization.</span> <span id="s169">And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s170">He finally gave up that position with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC.</span> <span id="s171">So he became JDC's representative in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s172">And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these countries which the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he was in contact with Hungary, with Romania, and even with Shanghai, with France, occupied, and so on.</span> <span id="s173">And he did the things for us.</span> <span id="s174">Communication with Soudymiah was easy enough by telephone.</span> <span id="s175">From Lisbon you could talk back and forthyou could talk to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s176">That was all right.</span> <span id="s177">You just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossedgoing to cross France, that was Germany.</span> <span id="s178">Do it by ; they were more liberal.</span> <span id="s179">And you could make your telephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s180">So that's how we kept in touch, then, with the countries with which the JDCwhich the United States ultimately was in war with.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: When you were in Southern France in, I guess, 1939, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I went there</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Were the refugees there?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What was that operation about?</span> <span id="s186">What did you do there?</span> <span id="s187">Tell me more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Working out of France, that was strictly for France.</span> <span id="s189">The refugees who had been up in the northern partit turned out to be the German‑occupied areato the extent that they could, they came down to the southern part.</span> <span id="s190">Who were they?</span> <span id="s191">The ex‑Germans and the ex‑Austrians and the exother countries with which the Germansthe Germans were at warso they came down south.</span> <span id="s192">The Belgians came down south, so there were plenty of refugees in the unoccupied zone.</span> <span id="s193">Also came to Marseille the agencies with which we had been working in Paris.</span> <span id="s194">They were evacuated the same as we were.</span> <span id="s195">They ended up in Marseille too.</span> <span id="s196">The office was in Marseille with which we worked, they were there.</span> <span id="s197">The Oseyou may have heard about themO‑s‑e.</span> <span id="s198">That's .</span> <span id="s199">They were down there.</span> <span id="s200">The agencies with which the JDC had operated in Paris were over in Marseille, so we just resumed contact with them.</span> <span id="s201">And we knew how they operated, they knew how we operated.</span> <span id="s202">We were back in business again</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So what were you able to do down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A:in Marseille.</span> <span id="s205">The assistance which was given in the unoccupied zone was mainly a cash relief assistance program, because it was still possible for people to buy things in the stores and so on.</span> <span id="s206">And their big problem was that they had no jobs, and what they needed was some money with which to live.</span> <span id="s207">And the JDC provided that.</span> <span id="s208">The OSE was a medical assistance organization, and they cared for children.</span> <span id="s209">So they did their job.</span> <span id="s210">They had misunderatret (ph)installations where children, unaccompanied children were.</span> <span id="s211">And they had a medical program.</span> <span id="s212">The HIAS (Hebrew Immigration and Sheltering)what the HIASyou know what the HIASyou know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s214">What I know is that's sort of a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: We just had to providewe just had towe provided them with funds so that they could continue operating in these various fields which I have just described to you.</span> <span id="s216">And we worked with welfare organizations too.</span> <span id="s217">There was a Jewish welfare organization in Lyons, which was pretty large.</span> <span id="s218">And the other thing that we did out of Marseille was to continue sending assistance up to Paris.</span> <span id="s219">Of course we had left behind in Paris there some Jewish people who remained up in Paris and kept the organizations going and so on.</span> <span id="s220">And there was a woman who was active in the International Social Service, a non‑Jewish lady who used to travel back and forth between the two zones.</span> <span id="s221">And we would give her a sum of money, and she would take it up with her back to Paris.</span> <span id="s222">And she would bring back the reports from Paris so that we knew what was going on up there at least and could follow up on their household and financing arrangements and so on.</span> <span id="s223">And so that's how we kept in touch with Paris.</span> <span id="s224">And so out of Marseille we were able to keep things on some kind of a fairly even keel in France.</span> <span id="s225">That went along reasonable all right until November 1942.</span> <span id="s226">In November 1942, the Germans came down and occupied the unoccupied zone and so on.</span> <span id="s227">And then things became a little bit topsy‑turvy, because the Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource to which they could turn back on.</span> <span id="s228">And our office in Marseille became peripatetic, because they couldn't afford being around with the Germans and looking for Jewish people and so on.</span> <span id="s229">So it became peripatetic and so on.</span> <span id="s230">But the work continued, and during the whole war period the JDC programs continued.</span> <span id="s231">Of course there was problems connected with it.</span> <span id="s232">It didn't necessarily work smoothly, but to the extent possible, continued in both zones.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Did you get at all involved with the French‑Jewish resistance?</span> <span id="s234">Did you give them any kind of assistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: When I left Germanywhen I left France, I came on home leaveI left Marseille in the end of September, I think, or beginning of October of 1941 for some home leave.</span> <span id="s236">And I was on my way back to Lisbon when we entered the war.</span> <span id="s237">My assistant, who remained in Marseille, who was French, he took over then, when I couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s238">It subsequently developed that this assistant was active in the Jewish Army of Resistance.</span> <span id="s239">We didn't know it at the timeextracurricular activity.</span> <span id="s240">And we didn't know that until he left France and came down to Barcelona.</span> <span id="s241">So that if you ask were we in contact with the resistance, sure, we were.</span> <span id="s242">As a matter of fact one of the things that we financed in France was thewe helped the local organizationwe didn't do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s243">We didn't work in our own name in France.</span> <span id="s244">We worked through local organizations, which as you know is a matter of policy of the JDC.</span> <span id="s245">We worked through local organizations.</span> <span id="s246">And one of the organizations with which we worked had a business of providing false documents through Jewish people.</span> <span id="s247">As a matter of fact, I'm toldI didn't know this until laterI'm told that these things were printed at the office of the .</span> <span id="s248">But they worked with our money.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: You worked with organizations, were they Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Jewish organizations, yes.</span> <span id="s251">They worked with our money.</span> <span id="s252">Most of the agencies, Jewish agencies, in France were working with our money.</span> <span id="s253">We might not have had our own personnel there, butyou see, one of the advantages that JDC haswe have been in business for a long time.</span> <span id="s254">We started in 1914 with this first shipment to Palestine.</span> <span id="s255">We learned something from the first war.</span> <span id="s256">And the first war was that we should do things in our own name, but to work through indigenous organizations.</span> <span id="s257">Because if we do things in our own name with our own personnel, the day we pull outand we thought we were temporarythe day we pull out would be the day the agency would collapse.</span> <span id="s258">The work would collapse.</span> <span id="s259">So we developed local organizations in all the countries in which we operate, and we always worked through them.</span> <span id="s260">And our advantages that we had that when the JDC was not present, they knew enough about what the JDChow it operated and what its desires were and so on that they were able to function without our actually being there, but they carried on.</span> <span id="s261">And that's what kept the JDC going.</span> <span id="s262">"JDC" quote, unquote had all of these countries in Europe from which the JDC had no direct contact, but they knew enough about what they had learned from us, which we had learned after the first World War to keep on going.</span> <span id="s263">And there was always some embryonic JDC around in the countries of Europe that keep things going.</span> <span id="s264">And so that's how the work continued in France for the refugees and kept on that way, I guess, in 1944, when our Paris office was reopened, when Paris was liberated.</span> <span id="s265">We went back to Paris again on the same premises which we had, which we had closed up in June 1940, went right back into the same premises.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Now, you took a little bit of a detour before going back to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: When did I go back to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Didn't you go for a while to the War Refugee Board?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s270">Well, I went back</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Or that was afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s273">I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s274">So I went on home leave, as I told you, in 1941.</span> <span id="s275">I was on my way back to Marseille when we went into the war, and we werethere was solittle uncertainty that the Germans were coming down into Portugal that our New York office sent their message over to Lisbon, all the Americans had come home.</span> <span id="s276">So I landed in Lisbon on Monday, and on Friday I was on back to the States.</span> <span id="s277">And it took me a good couple of months before I could have permission to go back to Lisbon again.</span> <span id="s278">I was in Lisbon there until the end of 1943, when I entered the army.</span> <span id="s279">But my military service was on Detached Service as a special attache (ph) to the American Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, which I did as an army man.</span> <span id="s280">And that was for the War Refugee Board, when I went back to Turkey.</span> <span id="s281">Turkey was an area through which there could have beenand to a certain extent there wasmovement of refugees to Palestine.</span> <span id="s282">The people who were coming out from Hungary, from Poland would come out via Varna, which is in Bulgaria or via Constanta, which is in Romania.</span> <span id="s283">They would come out by boat down through the Black Sea as far as Istanbul and then over land to Palestine.</span> <span id="s284">I was attached to the embassy in Ankara, but I was stationed in Istanbul for the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s285">And that was part of my job in connection with this movement going through.</span> <span id="s286">The work for the refugees in Istanbul was divided in three ways.</span> <span id="s287">There were three agencies involved.</span> <span id="s288">The Jewish agency was there to controlto have something to say about people going to Palestine and issuing certificates for that purpose.</span> <span id="s289">There was another group of individuals from Palestine stationed in Istanbul representing the different political parties that the Mossadyou probably have heard.</span> <span id="s290">The Mossad spoken about, they were the Mossad.</span> <span id="s291">They were there.</span> <span id="s292">So you had the Jewish agency doing the technical work.</span> <span id="s293">You had the Mossad organizing these transports.</span> <span id="s294">The JDC was there.</span> <span id="s295">They did the financial work.</span> <span id="s296">The War Refugee Board did the political work.</span> <span id="s297">What was their political work?</span> <span id="s298">The Turks would not give transit visas to anybody.</span> <span id="s299">In order to get through to Palestine, you had to go via Turkey.</span> <span id="s300">Turkey wouldn't let them through.</span> <span id="s301">Why wouldn't they let them through?</span> <span id="s302">Because the British wouldn't let them into Palestine, no place to go.</span> <span id="s303">So there had to be discussions and negotiations and one thing or another with the British and with the Turks.</span> <span id="s304">That was War Refugee Board business.</span> <span id="s305">And finally the Turks agreed to give a transit visa to any refugee who could put his foot on Turkish soil.</span> <span id="s306">So the job was to get the people to Turkey.</span> <span id="s307">So they got them to Turkey.</span> <span id="s308">They came from Ubea (ph), which is an island off Greece.</span> <span id="s309">They came across, and they landed in Ismea.</span> <span id="s310">They came by boat from Constanta and Varna through the Black Sea to Istanbul, and a couple of transports even came through by train to Istanbul.</span> <span id="s311">And since they got their foot on Turkey soil, they got transit visasthe place agreed to let them in, and so theyI don't know, about 9,000, 10,000, something like thatgot into Palestine that way through theit was an effort of the War Refugee Board and the political angle.</span> <span id="s312">When I finished with the job in Turkeybecause you remember Bulgaria and Romania turned around in 1944 and entered the war on our sidethey didn't need the War Refugee Board anymore in Turkey.</span> <span id="s313">And I was reassigned to the mission in Berne, Switzerland for the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s314">I was stationed in Geneva.</span> <span id="s315">What was my job there for the War Refugee Board?</span> <span id="s316">There was a group of HungariansI don't know, about three or four hundred Hungarianswho were admitted under certain circumstances, permitted to leave Budapest and ended up in Bergen‑Belsen.</span> <span id="s317">And we tried to prevail upon the Swiss to let them come in to Switzerland instead of sitting up in Bergen‑Belsen.</span> <span id="s318">And we gave the Swiss a guarantee that at the earliest moment, if they would let these people into Switzerland, we will evacuate them.</span> <span id="s319">So we worked that one out, and they had these three or four hundred people came down from Bergen‑Belsen, and they landed in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s320">And then it was my job to get them out of Switzerland, and I had to do that through the army and field telephones, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s321">Anyhow, they got out of Switzerland, and they went to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: When you say "got them out," can you tell me a little bit more about how you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s324">For instance, when we got them outthe army controlled the transportation.</span> <span id="s325">Anything that movedthat involved transportation had to do through the army.</span> <span id="s326">So I would go from Geneva into France, where there was an army host on their field telephone, to get through via the field telephone from Annacey through Lyons, from Lyons to Paris, to talk to the transport people in Paris.</span> <span id="s327">The transport people from Paris moved.</span> <span id="s328">They moved from Paris to Rehon (ph).</span> <span id="s329">That's where the treaty was signed, the peace was signed.</span> <span id="s330">So then another operation I had to go through to get through Lyonsafter the armistice, they moved to Germany, and they ended up in the Archifaven (ph) building in Frankfurt, had to get through to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s331">All this by telephone, the field telephone and so on.</span> <span id="s332">Anyhow, that's how I got them out, by working it out with the army transport that they would take them, because they had to go by boat through the Mediterraneanby land you could get them to Italy.</span> <span id="s333">They went down by trainItaly, but they didn't control the boats.</span> <span id="s334">The boats, you had to do that through the army.</span> <span id="s335">So that's how theyhow this particular group was moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What time period are talking about here?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Swiss trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: What time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: This was in 191945.</span> <span id="s340">I would say about July or August 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So I just want to ask you questions for my own clarity.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: You started with the War Refugee Board</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yeah, then when the war was over, I got out of the army.</span> <span id="s345">When I got out of the army, that released me from the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s346">So that ended up the War Refugee Board job, which I told you started in February 1944, and it landed until I got out of the army in October 1945.</span> <span id="s347">That finished me with the War Refugee Board, that finished me with the army.</span> <span id="s348">I went back to the JDC.</span> <span id="s349">I went back overseas again.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s351">Back to the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s352">How large of an operation was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: What with the War Refugee Boards?</span> <span id="s354">We hadthere were exactly four people in this dembo (ph) in Turkey.</span> <span id="s355">It was Ira Hirschman (ph), who was the chief of mission.</span> <span id="s356">There was myself, two secretaries.</span> <span id="s357">That was the whole War Refugee Board in Turkey.</span> <span id="s358">And we worked through everybody else, through the Jewish agency, with the Joint (ph), everybody we worked through.</span> <span id="s359">But that was our job.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you work with other U.S. organizations like the State Department or the OSS or</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s362">The War Refugee Board consisted of three people with the secretaries, the treasury, which was Morgenthau.</span> <span id="s363">There was Secretary Stimson.</span> <span id="s364">I think he was war.</span> <span id="s365">And I think Hull was Secretary of State.</span> <span id="s366">Anyhow, there were three Secretaries of State with the War Refugee Board responsible directly to the President.</span> <span id="s367">So we were in that channel with the War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s368">That was our contact, that was the backing that we had.</span> <span id="s369">And then in consequence of that, we were practically unique, because we had permission to deal with the enemy that was going to be of any way to help the refugees.</span> <span id="s370">So we were entitlednormally American citizens could do that.</span> <span id="s371">We were authorized to deal with the enemy in order to do what we had to do to rescue people.</span> <span id="s372">The War Refugee Board, they had a representative in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s373">That was Iva Olsen (ph), who had worked out the deal with Raul Wallenberg, who ended up in Budapest.</span> <span id="s374">You've heard of Raul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s375">The War Refugee Board had a representative in Lisbon, they had one in London.</span> <span id="s376">That was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did you</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: We did the workwhat?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did you have the support you needed from the State Department in war</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: You had what you needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: The War Refwell, as far as we were concerned, out in the field, our contact was the headquarters of the War Refugee Board in Washington.</span> <span id="s383">Let them worry what they're goingbut they were helpful, because we had the three Secretaries of State, and so they were helpful.</span> <span id="s384">We got help from the OWI and others.</span> <span id="s385">We had to have that kind ofhad to have that kind of help, because we were only a facilitating group to get things done.</span> <span id="s386">We were dependent on other people.</span> <span id="s387">One of the big problems of the War Refugee Board was that the government gave them no money.</span> <span id="s388">The government gave them money, only enough to cover their administration expenses.</span> <span id="s389">And the other requirements of the War Refugee Board was paid by the Joint.</span> <span id="s390">You find the Joint all over the place.</span> <span id="s391">We were paid by JDC.</span> <span id="s392">For instance, example, Raul Wallenbergyou know what he did in Budapest with our money.</span> <span id="s393">JDC was our money.</span> <span id="s394">JDC was helping me, War Refugee Board.</span> <span id="s395">I was wearing that hat at that time.</span> <span id="s396">But the JDC was all over the place.</span> <span id="s397">They were very helpful.</span> <span id="s398">In any event, then I went back overseas, then, to JDC.</span> <span id="s399">And when I went back overseas, then, I went to the Paris office, because the Arabthe Paris office had in the meantime then retransferred to Lisbon back to Paris after it was possible for us to go back up there.</span> <span id="s400">I got back to Paris in December '45, was there for a couple of weeks when I had to go into Germany to relieve Jake Trobe (ph).</span> <span id="s401">I think I told you about that inside before.</span> <span id="s402">Jake Trobe (ph), who was in charge of our officeour operationin Germany, he got mixed up with thisthe General Morgan incidentand he was withdrawn.</span> <span id="s403">And I went in to take over the German operation from him.</span> <span id="s404">That's what got me up to Erolson (ph), and got me</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s406">But you need to tell me about this, because people may not have seen the other parts of these interviews.</span> <span id="s407">So I need you to tell me when we're talking about, when you ended up going back to Paris and how you got up to Erolson and when that wasjust very briefly.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Well, I got back to Paris in December 1945.</span> <span id="s409">I would like to make a break to tell you something else.</span> <span id="s410">In 1943 when I went back to Lisbon, after a great deal of effort the United States finally agreed to accept 5,0005,000, it was 10,000Jewish refugee children in the United States for safekeeping during the war, the same way as they had permitted the English to come over here.</span> <span id="s411">You remember when the English came in.</span> <span id="s412">They agreed to take them into the United States.</span> <span id="s413">And one of the things I was supposed to do when I went back to Lisbon was do some work with this project.</span> <span id="s414">I went back with another JDC member, the name is Soeboe (ph).</span> <span id="s415">And there was an American agency involved in that, German‑Jewish Children Agency, I think it was.</span> <span id="s416">So then we went up tothe effort was made with the French to give exit permits to the people to leave France who had come out from the unoccupied zone, leave Franceformer unoccupied zone.</span> <span id="s417">Laval refused it.</span> <span id="s418">And Laval wouldn't let them out, and so the thing fell through.</span> <span id="s419">So they couldn't get the kids out.</span> <span id="s420">And the kids that we did bring out were kids who were already out, either in Spain or in Portugal or those children who with their parents were smuggled over the border from France into Spain, so acquired a couple of kids.</span> <span id="s421">Instead of having the 5,000, we only got about 2, 300.</span> <span id="s422">That's all, because Laval put his foot down on it.</span> <span id="s423">So that's one effort we made with the refugeeto help refugees, and discovered then it didn't pan out.</span> <span id="s424">So then I went back to Paris, then, and took over there from Jake Trobe (ph) in Germany.</span> <span id="s425">And in order to get back into Germanythey ran a very tight operation.</span> <span id="s426">The army, of course, was responsible; the American army for the American zone, the British army for the British zone, et cetera.</span> <span id="s427">And they were responsible for everything that went on in their particular zones.</span> <span id="s428">Responsibility for the American army in the American zone, keep peace and quiet and so on.</span> <span id="s429">And while technically they were responsible for the welfare of the people in the zone which they occupied, they said in effect, "We're soldiers, we're not welfare workers."</span> <span id="s430">And they gave the job to the UNRRA as a subcontractor, so to speak, to provide care for the refugees and the displaced persons who were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you went back, then, to Paris in November '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah, I went in NovemberDecember '45, yeah.</span> <span id="s433">I left in November, yeah.</span> <span id="s434">And then went back to Paris in 1945.</span> <span id="s435">I was in Paris for a couple of weeks, and then were sent up to Germany to take over from Jake Trobe (ph), who was reassigned.</span> <span id="s436">How do you get into Germany?</span> <span id="s437">Army had subcontracted to UNRRA to provide basic care and maintenance for the refugees.</span> <span id="s438">The JDC wasin order to get in, we had to come in under the umbrella, then, of UNRRA.</span> <span id="s439">And UNRRA’s headquarters at that time were in Herxt (ph), which is outside of Frankfurt in Germany.</span> <span id="s440">A couple of weeks after I arrived in Herxt (ph) then, UNRRA’s entire headquarters operation was sent up to Erolson (ph) and so on.</span> <span id="s441">Since I was at JDC headquartersand at JDC headquarters, I was attached to UNRRA’s headquartersthe office had to move up to Erolson (ph) too, so that the headquarters for the operation in Germany was in Erolson (ph).</span> <span id="s442">Headquarters for the American zone was in Munich.</span> <span id="s443">Headquarters for the British zone was in Bergen‑Belsen.</span> <span id="s444">Berlin was Berlin, and the French zone was inoh, shootI forget the namearound Constance someplace.</span> <span id="s445">I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s446">Anyhow, and so the work that I did in Germany was to travel around the offices to try to things going along smoothly.</span> <span id="s447">The JDCI mentioned this before, I guessran a rather decentralized operation.</span> <span id="s448">The JDC proceeded on the ferry to trust the men in the field, where the men were sent out to the field and certainly given the responsibility for maintaining a country‑wide operation.</span> <span id="s449">He was carefully selected, because he had to make decisions on the spot, couldn't go to Paris every time.</span> <span id="s450">He had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s451">Times were changing too quickly, and Paris couldn't know the local conditions as well as the men on the spot.</span> <span id="s452">He had to make the arrangements.</span> <span id="s453">So I traveled around the various offices, try to keep in touch, if I could help them with some kind of guidance, you know, how their programs were going and so on.</span> <span id="s454">And I did that for about a year, when we decided to decentralize further.</span> <span id="s455">Hence, having a central office for Germany, we had the zones, Munich, Belsen; report directly to Paris.</span> <span id="s456">And we eliminated the overall office for Germany itself.</span> <span id="s457">Berlin, I think, at that time headed into Munich.</span> <span id="s458">And that was an operation which we did for the refugees, for the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s459">And did our work, whatever it was, to feed the people, to clothe the people.</span> <span id="s460">Actually, the UNRRA, they had the responsibility, then, for the basic feeding of these people, which the army had subcontracted to them.</span> <span id="s461">But that was the limit of their responsibility, to keep the people alive, to give them some medical help, to give them shelter, give them some clothing.</span> <span id="s462">But there was a plethora of assistance, which the people required, which UNRRA didn't give them.</span> <span id="s463">There were questions of education and entertainmentgood Lord, anything that you could think of, UNRRA didn't do it.</span> <span id="s464">In addition to that, the food rations, which the refugees gotthe displaced persons gotwas so very low, and the diets were so monotonous and so on.</span> <span id="s465">So the JDC, to put it very crudely, put the fringe on the embroidery.</span> <span id="s466">We provided all these extra amenities that were supposed to make life more bearable for these people, which were terms of educations and lectures.</span> <span id="s467">And we had traveling entertainers and legal aid and everything that was required .</span> <span id="s468">It wasn't a job, we had to do it.</span> <span id="s469">So that was the JDC's job for all these people.</span> <span id="s470">That included immigration assistance too.</span> <span id="s471">How did we get into the immigration business?</span> <span id="s472">I was on the telephone up in Erolson (ph), and I got a telephone call from Dr. Schwartz, who was the head of the whole overseas operationtelephoned thefrom Paris to ask me to get in touch with our representatives in Stuttgart, that she should help a certain woman to immigratesome problem and some papers or something.</span> <span id="s473">And so I said to Dr. Schwartz, "Why come to us?</span> <span id="s474">We're not in the immigration business."</span> <span id="s475">And Dr. Schwartz said to me yes, we are, beginning now.</span> <span id="s476">And that was of the immigration business.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Now, was that in '46?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: That was in '46.</span> <span id="s479">We had been in the immigration business before that.</span> <span id="s480">When we were in Lisbon, there was these people who were coming down from Germany and Austria and other countries.</span> <span id="s481">Now, the HIAS was operating in Lisbon too at that time.</span> <span id="s482">But the HIAS, they operated with individual cases.</span> <span id="s483">If a relative in New York or Kenosha, Wisconsin came to them and said I have a relative, so and so, can you help them get out.</span> <span id="s484">And the HIAS would say give us the money for the transportation, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s485">And then they would work on the case.</span> <span id="s486">We couldn't afford that luxury.</span> <span id="s487">We were in the wholesale business, because as I explained to you before, the Hoofsverine (ph) and the Rifeserine (ph) and so on in Germany sent all their cases down to us, because we were paying their transportation as I explained.</span> <span id="s488">So consequently, we would have to buy all the passages on a ship in order to make room for these people who were coming down.</span> <span id="s489">So while the HIAS, they were in the retail business, we were in the wholesale business.</span> <span id="s490">But we were in the wholesale business because Lisbon was the only port in Europe for which people could sail.</span> <span id="s491">All the other ports were occupied by the Germansor I take that back.</span> <span id="s492">Spain had some ports too that were open.</span> <span id="s493">But Lisbon was the main port.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: You know what, we need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: You were talking about the fact that the Jewish</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah, we were in the wholesale business.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Wholesale immigration business.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah, so wewhen I said Dr. Schwartz said we are now in the immigration business, we were in it before, but on a different level.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: What otherhow else do you see the scope of your operation?</span> <span id="s502">What other kinds of aid did you give?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Did JDC give?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: To characterize the work that we do, we do everything from prenatal care to care for the aged.</span> <span id="s506">We don't quite bury them, but everything in between we do, with the prenatal care and postnatal care, kindergartens, educationspublic level education.</span> <span id="s507">Ted mentioned to you about the scholarship for the university students.</span> <span id="s508">The work that we're doing now in addition to care for the agedin Israel, for example, we have training programs for principals of the ministries and municipalities to try to give them some notions as to how they might improve the services that they give.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: But backactually, I really need to focus a little bit back on the postwar years in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s511">Well, with thewell, that was about the work that could be done in Germany from the cradle to the grave, but you know, the people who survived what they had gone through, I think that there was a principle of natural selection that was involved, and the people who came through, managed to come through.</span> <span id="s512">So that what we had to do did not have to be ground down so finely.</span> <span id="s513">The broader, simpler things we didn't have to do.</span> <span id="s514">So many of the things that we would do in a country, as I saylike Israel which is much further advanced.</span> <span id="s515">So that's what we did in Israel, was supplywe had this big supply program going</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: In Israel or in Europe?</span> <span id="s517">You just said Israel.</span> <span id="s518">Do you mean in Israel or in Europe are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I'm back in Europe again, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s521">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: With the supply program, what we did.</span> <span id="s523">We had a representative up in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s524">We had a representative up in Copenhagen and another one in Oslo.</span> <span id="s525">And at least one could buy food and other things in Sweden, which were not available on the .</span> <span id="s526">And so we bought food up there.</span> <span id="s527">We bought dairy products in Copenhagen and whatever, and we loaded trucks and sent them down through.</span> <span id="s528">Some stopped off in Belsen.</span> <span id="s529">Others went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s530">They went over as far as Bublee (ph) with the food stuff.</span> <span id="s531">They went through Krogg (ph), and we left food, which we had acquired in Stockholm and so on.</span> <span id="s532">When the supply line from the United States wasn't open, we had to be content with what we could get up in the Scandinavian countries.</span> <span id="s533">And that went along all right, excepting that there wasn't enough of it, but we couldn't give anymore than we got in, than we could acquire and so on.</span> <span id="s534">What else did we do?</span> <span id="s535">For the education side we had to print our own books.</span> <span id="s536">We had an educationhe was principal of a school up in, I think, in Newton, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s537">He was principal of the school.</span> <span id="s538">He to come over to the JDC to go overseas as our education guy.</span> <span id="s539">So he was traveling around in Germany, stopped at one of the camps, spoke to one of the ladies who was trying to do some educational work, a teacher.</span> <span id="s540">And she told him what a problem she was having.</span> <span id="s541">She didn't have a blackboard, she didn't have any chalk, nothing.</span> <span id="s542">What did he do about it?</span> <span id="s543">Where was he going to find a blackboard?</span> <span id="s544">He remembered that down the road a piece, he had passed a building, which had been evacuated.</span> <span id="s545">And all the shades were in the windows.</span> <span id="s546">He took these green shades down, gave them to the woman, which she used for blackboards.</span> <span id="s547">And he went around to a supply guy in the PX and got chalk, and she was back in business, and she was able to teach.</span> <span id="s548">Well, we had to have people who could use their ingenuity in that way to make things out of nothing.</span> <span id="s549">So it was that sort of educational work that had to be done.</span> <span id="s550">Oh, there were all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s551">There was the big election in Frankfurt and Ufumbah (ph), where the Germans had stored stuff, which had been looted from the private people, from Jewish libraries and things like that.</span> <span id="s552">It was all in there.</span> <span id="s553">And the job wasnot doing any good there, whatever.</span> <span id="s554">So arrangements had to be made for moving the stuff out and distributingstuff which was in the Ufumbah (ph) deposit.</span> <span id="s555">Those are things that came up.</span> <span id="s556">They were very helpful to people whom we were trying to serve and what contributions which the JDC could make to welfare in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: What about helping to rebuild religious communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, we did that in Germany too.</span> <span id="s559">Well, we did that all over.</span> <span id="s560">We did a couple of things.</span> <span id="s561">In several of the countries, there weren't many rabbis, for example.</span> <span id="s562">The rabbis had been killed off and immigrated.</span> <span id="s563">Yugoslavia at that time had one rabbi who was in Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s564">Stockholm had one rabbi, and he was aged.</span> <span id="s565">We had to do something about that.</span> <span id="s566">We gave scholarships to train rabbis.</span> <span id="s567">The fellow from Sweden went over to the United States, a fellow from Yugoslavia went over to Israel, a fellow fromwho was working in Romania, he went to Israel, to help rebuild the communities.</span> <span id="s568">Two things: First, we had to train rabbis.</span> <span id="s569">And secondly, we imported rabbis on contract basis, who were willing to give a yearor a year and a half or two years, whatever it isto go into a county and do a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: What about in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: In the camps?</span> <span id="s572">There were rabbis in the camps, who were among the interneesis that the right word to use?</span> <span id="s573">in the camps itself.</span> <span id="s574">And if there was no rabbi, there would be peoplemen, who were sufficiently educated in Hebrew that they could conduct the service.</span> <span id="s575">And you may know, in the Jewish religion you don't have to be ordained to conduct a service.</span> <span id="s576">A lay person can do that too.</span> <span id="s577">And so that was done in many of the places where therein the camps, where they needed a quasi‑religious functionary to run the services.</span> <span id="s578">But the JDC provided funds.</span> <span id="s579">You probably heard a story from Tetfear (ph) about a mikvah.</span> <span id="s580">There was a question of a mikvah, which came up in Vohrenwald, which was a camp.</span> <span id="s581">A very well known, world known, Jewish rabbi ended up in Fohrenwald, and he insisted on having a mikvah in Vohrenwald itself.</span> <span id="s582">There was one, but it wasn't kosher enough.</span> <span id="s583">He wanted to make his own.</span> <span id="s584">All right.</span> <span id="s585">So finally a mikvah was built for him by the JDC, but then there was the question of water.</span> <span id="s586">You know the water has to be rain water, pureit's all described in the Talmud about the water.</span> <span id="s587">There was no such water.</span> <span id="s588">JDC staff member in Vohrenwald, he went up to the hills with a truck, and brought back a truck full of snow and melted the snow, and the snow was pure, that was fit for the mikvah.</span> <span id="s589">So the rabbi had his mikvah and the water, because our guy went up into the mountains and brought snow back, but it was pure water.</span> <span id="s590">You had to do that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s591">And then in the communities themselves there was a businesswe had to start Sunday school classes.</span> <span id="s592">We imported staff from Israel to do that sort of thing with Sunday school classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish backgrounds and so on.</span> <span id="s593">We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the synagogues.</span> <span id="s594">We felt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into bricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat.</span> <span id="s595">You couldn't feed them bricks and so on.</span> <span id="s596">And so we didn't do too much of that.</span> <span id="s597">But where something was mobile, anything that a person could carry with them, that, we were interested in doing.</span> <span id="s598">Health, they could carry with them; education, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with themgood for the JDC.</span> <span id="s599">But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the graveyards.</span> <span id="s600">You can't take that with you.</span> <span id="s601">And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could do that.</span> <span id="s602">Family members or people from the same town or something could do that.</span> <span id="s603">We had other things to do with our funds.</span> <span id="s604">And so then I was in Germany, then, for a year with our program there.</span> <span id="s605">Then I went back to Paris and undertook other functions there.</span> <span id="s606">For awhile I filled in a blank in the immigration department of the JDC.</span> <span id="s607">The immigration, that was really a tough business, becauseas you have heardeverybody wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s608">And you had people in Eastern Europe; Poland, Romania and Hungary, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s609">They were all to come to Paris to wait in Paris until they could get their visas.</span> <span id="s610">And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas.</span> <span id="s611">Nobody would let people in.</span> <span id="s612">Even to come to the United States, visas were issued in the order of priority of your registration.</span> <span id="s613">And according to priorities in Poland, you could have waited for eight years or ten years before you had , because it was all done on a quota basis.</span> <span id="s614">So everybody wanted to come down to Paris.</span> <span id="s615">Paris got all clogged up with refugees who were sitting around.</span> <span id="s616">Of course, we had to maintain them.</span> <span id="s617">What were they going to live on?</span> <span id="s618">We had to maintain them while there were in Paris.</span> <span id="s619">And so we had to arrange for them to be held back in the countries from whence they came and sent messages back to Poland, Czechoslovakia not to let people come into Paris until they are called forward by us.</span> <span id="s620">Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a ship.</span> <span id="s621">At that time the ships were all clogged up.</span> <span id="s622">There were no passenger boats going between Europe and the United States at that time.</span> <span id="s623">When I say "no," sure, there wereevery once in a while there would be a boat.</span> <span id="s624">And there was a great deal of competition to get on those boats.</span> <span id="s625">So there were so many places that we could get.</span> <span id="s626">So we had to tell peoplekeep them back where they are, keep them out of Paris, because the authorities in Paris were after us, to keep the influx down.</span> <span id="s627">And so they had to stay back.</span> <span id="s628">On one occasion we had to take a whole boat, the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to Australia.</span> <span id="s629">There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one boat and send the boat down to Australia to get them down there.</span> <span id="s630">And so we were in the immigration business startingas I told youuntil 1954.</span> <span id="s631">And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were involved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too.</span> <span id="s632">So that took us out of the immigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhowat least took it out of our office and took the responsibility away from us.</span> <span id="s633">Another operation that we had was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation.</span> <span id="s634">The foundation was established during the wars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor peopleor people who couldn't go to the bank.</span> <span id="s635">Banks wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so exorbitant.</span> <span id="s636">So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these cooperative banks were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the place, all over Eastern Europe, had these foundations.</span> <span id="s637">And then of course, there were people who couldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these local banks.</span> <span id="s638">So we opened up free loan societies and provided the capital for that.</span> <span id="s639">As I said before, anything that you touched, the JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to normal as quickly as possible and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Was the primary goal to bring people back to normal, to sustain them or to get them moved out?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Which was the primary focus if there is one?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: That's a difficult one.</span> <span id="s644">I think it was more important to move people out, because they could be brought back to normal in the country to which they were going.</span> <span id="s645">And I would say if one had to make a choice, whether you bring people back to normal or move them out, move them out.</span> <span id="s646">Although it was difficult to move them out if they weren't normal.</span> <span id="s647">So which comes first, the chicken or the egg?</span> <span id="s648">It's a difficult one to work on, but it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: When you arrived, when you were Erolson (ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q:overseeing that, did the situation you found yourself in, in terms of the numbers of refugees, numbers of people with great needs, did the situation seem overwhelming?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I don't think that's a good term to use.</span> <span id="s653">We knew that we had a big job.</span> <span id="s654">If you're overwhelmed, you stay home.</span> <span id="s655">We had a big job, but maybe the job got bigger.</span> <span id="s656">And you had to do it, but you couldn't be overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s657">Maybe you were underwhelmed.</span> <span id="s658">You certainly couldn't be overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s659">The job might have been considered overwhelming.</span> <span id="s660">I think there's a nuance between the job being overwhelming and being overwhelmed by it.</span> <span id="s661">You know?</span> <span id="s662">We weren't overwhelmed</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: But the job was</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: But the job was overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Can you describe that a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Look, the JDC had a job to do.</span> <span id="s667">And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it or can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that, whatever.</span> <span id="s668">You just dug in and did it.</span> <span id="s669">Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we surrounded ourselves with a group of "can do" people, and they did.</span> <span id="s670">We had to do it.</span> <span id="s671">There was no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Was the situation something more than you had ever encountered before?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Of course I'd never encountered it before.</span> <span id="s674">Nobody had encountered in before.</span> <span id="s675">This was the first time in history that you had a problem like this.</span> <span id="s676">You certainly didn't learn how to handle it in school.</span> <span id="s677">You certainly didn't learn it in the school of social work when the people were social workers.</span> <span id="s678">You talk with a social worker and you say listen, did your social work help?</span> <span id="s679">They say it did not.</span> <span id="s680">But again, we had people who were working for us who didn't come out of the social work field at all; teachers, for example.</span> <span id="s681">We hadthe man who ran our camp in Cyprusyou know about the Cyprus businesshe was a school teacher.</span> <span id="s682">He wasn't a social worker.</span> <span id="s683">But he had social instincts.</span> <span id="s684">So we knew what to do.</span> <span id="s685">We didn't have the formal training, but he knew what to do, social work.</span> <span id="s686">People were the way they weretheir characteristics.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Do</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, I wonder whether I can take a time out to go to the men's room.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Where was this Joint successful?</span> <span id="s691">I would say this: I think you have to look at it a little bit in terms of the times.</span> <span id="s692">What had happened to the Jewish people in Europe was really so horrible.</span> <span id="s693">As you think about it, it's incredible.</span> <span id="s694">You can't even talk about it.</span> <span id="s695">How do you kill billions of people just like that?</span> <span id="s696">And I think that stirred up a lot of the younger people and some of the older people too, who want to do something to try tonot make amends, because we didn't do itbut to try to do something to relieve their plight of people involved a little bit.</span> <span id="s697">And they were willing to put in their time and their energies to do something about it.</span> <span id="s698">You had to have certain characteristics of the individual, I think, to begin with.</span> <span id="s699">It had to be people who were interested in doing things for other people.</span> <span id="s700">And when these stories got out as to what had happened, a decent feeling, decent thinking young guy would really want to do something to try to help straighten the world out a little bit.</span> <span id="s701">And so they were willing to devote part of their time at least to making a contribution to bettering the lot of some people at least.</span> <span id="s702">And concerns on trying that outlet in the JDC and going overseas and doing something about it.</span> <span id="s703">And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work with us, and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for JDC and contributed to our success.</span> <span id="s704">And I think that the JDC could feel some satisfaction that it really did contribute something to Jewish life.</span> <span id="s705">Whether it's the fellow who landed back on his feet in Europe or immigrated overseas, I think we did a lot to help people.</span> <span id="s706">They were in far away places; South America or elsewhere.</span> <span id="s707">JDC followed them along and did what it could to give them some kind of break.</span> <span id="s708">I think people are entitled to a break in life, and if you can do something to help them if they didn't have a break, I think you should.</span> <span id="s709">And I think that motivated a lot of people to do what they did.</span> <span id="s710">And I think that accounts for JDC's success.</span> <span id="s711">And then when you add to that the personalities in the United States, the lay people, who were behind the JDC and the thought that they give to it, they're entitled to a lot of credit.</span> <span id="s712">They helped create the atmosphere which makes people happy to do it.</span> <span id="s713">And that's all one's asking, .</span> <span id="s714">I don't think I have to add anything to that.</span> <span id="s715">I think in words of one syllable that would account for JDC's success that there isn't much that can still be done, there's always more that can be done.</span> <span id="s716">Lots of people, they had this tendency, when they look at the brick wall, they don't look at the bricks, they only look at the hole in the wall.</span> <span id="s717">They don't see the accomplishments.</span> <span id="s718">They only see what was undone.</span> <span id="s719">They see the hole, they don't see the bricks.</span> <span id="s720">Every once in a while we sit back and we look at the bricks too, and you get a certain feeling of satisfaction out of doing it, doing something for somebody else, whatever.</span> <span id="s721">You don't get wealthy at it, but the satisfaction that you get remains with you.</span> <span id="s722">I think that the success that the JDC has had accounts for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">CONLUSION OF INTERVIEW USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337 PAGE 4</span></p></body></html>
