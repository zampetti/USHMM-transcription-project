Do you have any memories or can you think of any ways in which World War I impacted your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was too young, although I heard some stories after I grew up, which my father told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What kinds of stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, for instance, there was a meat rationing naturally, and meat was hard to get and my grandmother lived with us, and my father usually was staying in line to -- to get some meat.</span> <span id="s29">And my grandmother used to tell him, don’t ever bring any horsemeat home, because I will not cook it.</span> <span id="s30">And one day he did bring horsemeat, so of course she di -- he’d -- she didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s31">And after cooking and eating, my father asked her, well, how did she like the meat.</span> <span id="s32">And so she said it was very good.</span> <span id="s33">And so he said, well you ate horsemeat.</span> <span id="s34">Of course, she was very upset and she didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What made your family move from Lemberg to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: The beginning of World War I, which stared on September the -- well, actually, my father was a Russian.</span> <span id="s37">He w -- he was a Russian citizen.</span> <span id="s38">He was born in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s39">And of course, he was afraid that he would have to join the Russian army.</span> <span id="s40">So therefore, my uncle, my mother’s brother, who was in the military at that time, arranged with the last transport out of Lemberg to Vienna to have my mother put on -- on a train, being ready to give birth and the next day I was born when they arrived -- after they arrived in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you ever go back to Lemberg to visit relatives or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I was -- no, not to -- not to Lemberg, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did you have any family in Vienna?</span> <span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">I had my aunt and I had several cousins and my uncle and that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What was the Vienna of your childhood like?</span> <span id="s47">Was it industrial, was it commercial?</span> <span id="s48">What kind of city was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: It was commercial, mostly, and art.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Were there many Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, the city when I grew up had about two million population and the Jewish population was almost 10 percent of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How would you describe the relationships between Christians and Jews during your childhood in Vienna?</span> <span id="s53">A: It -- there were no problems, it -- n-naturally Vienna, Austria, the whole country was about 98 percent Catholic, but I didn’t feel any anti-Semitism personally, and I didn’t hear of any other people talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did your parents ever give you advice on how to -- to relate to your Christian neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Was there such a thing as a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s60">There was a -- a section of Vienna called Leopold staat.</span> <span id="s61">It was the second district and that was mostly populated by Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Was your family religiously observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What traditions did you observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Can you give me some examples of holidays, how they were observed?</span> <span id="s67">A: Well, there was nothing but Orthodox religion in Vienna at that time, so naturally, whatever you -- whenever you visited a synagogue when -- it was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s68">So I didn’t know any difference until I came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you have a favorite holiday when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Surprisingly, it was Christmas.</span> <span id="s71">It was always a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Can you elaborate what you did on Christmas?</span> <span id="s73">A: Well, we celebrated like everybody else.</span> <span id="s74">Was just a -- a -- Jews as well as Christians celebrated the holiday.</span> <span id="s75">Of course, sometimes, speaking of holidays, not really -- I was ra -- going to school I was looking forward to holidays because I didn’t have to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: When -- when you said that Jews and Christians both celebrated Christmas in Vienna, can you explain what that tradition at that time and that place was like, cause I don’t think it’s like what most people think of today when they talk about Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, it was more or less a tradition.</span> <span id="s78">I -- I do remember for instance that in my uncle’s house -- he was a general in the old Austrian army, in the medical corps, and I guess he was exposed to the celebration of Christmas throughout his career, and he always had a Christmas tree in his home.</span> <span id="s79">And we all got together and then celebrated the holiday, exchanged gifts like an-anybody else.</span> <span id="s80">And I was -- to me it was just normal.</span> <span id="s81">Was not something which was unusual for me to look forward to.</span> <span id="s82">But of course, as I got older, I understood more about the difference between Christianity and -- and Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did your family observe any Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s84">A: The only Jewish holidays we really observed were the Rosh Hashanah and me -- and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s85">And that was the only time we did go to the synagogue and we -- well, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you have any religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s88">Through my entire school year, elementary as well as high school, I had two hours a week religion -- religion classes, conducted by a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: What else do you remember about your early years in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: There were good days and there were bad days.</span> <span id="s91">In general I enjoyed school.</span> <span id="s92">I enjoyed the camaraderie, had many friends, and we played different sports together and we were very active, and got together and went to the opera and went to the movies, standing in line, getting into the various -- into theaters.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What kind of school did you attend, was it public or private?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did you have any favorite subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Well, I always enjoyed history and geography and that was my forte.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were little, in school, or on the playground, or anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s99">There was always friendship and there were no -- no arguments.</span> <span id="s100">I mean, I personally stayed away from any arguments about religion or any of that -- or politics.</span> <span id="s101">I never joined any -- any group, any special group.</span> <span id="s102">I stayed away from it.</span> <span id="s103">I do remember one time I was in high school and somebody made a statement which I did not care and we got into a fight right in the classroom, the benches were flying and everything else.</span> <span id="s104">But that was the only time, and I -- I knew if anybody made any comments about Jews or religion or anything of that sort, I fought back, because I was proud to be a Jew and -- and I didn’t hide it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you remember the statement that provoked that fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I don’t -- I do not remember, but I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Were most of your friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: It was sort of -- I would say about 50 - 50.</span> <span id="s109">And we got what -- got -- got well, I mean, we -- we -- we laughed together, we played together and there was n-never any expression of you are a Jew, you are a Catholic, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: When you were a child, what did you think you would want to do when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: I was always into science, I liked that.</span> <span id="s112">Yeah, and I also wound up doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: You told me some of the things that you did for fun when you were a kid, movies and opera.</span> <span id="s114">What else comes to your mind about some of the things you did when you weren't in school when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I -- I don’t know, I can’t -- can’t separate it for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: As you became a young adult, late teens, early 20’s, what was your social life like in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, social life.</span> <span id="s118">We always had parties at home, and some -- we -- well, do you mean social life as in -- within the family or among friends, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Both, and I was also thinking in terms of dating an-and -- just the kinds of things that young adults do.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: All right.</span> <span id="s121">We had always a lot of fun together as students, and we went out mostly to the opera and the different theaters.</span> <span id="s122">And we also had parties at home, mostly at home.</span> <span id="s123">We never went out to -- to bars or any of that sort.</span> <span id="s124">And it was a different life then than it’s today, that -- that I know.</span> <span id="s125">We le -- we -- we lived a -- a clean and healthier life.</span> <span id="s126">We also took a lot of trips, hiking trips and mountain climbing in those -- in my day -- young days.</span> <span id="s127">Went skiing away for a few days or a couple of weeks during the wintertime.</span> <span id="s128">Yeah, I -- we played all kinds of sports.</span> <span id="s129">I was a member of one of the sports clubs, the Vienna football club.</span> <span id="s130">And I was very active in tracks -- in -- in track and -- and in soccer, and was active in the junior league and even won couple first prizes in the track.</span> <span id="s131">So we were always thinking about not just having fun but something substantial, where you accomplish things or when you enjoyed things like the theater or the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: How much education did you get in Vienna?</span> <span id="s133">How high or how far did you go in your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I finished the [indecipherable] technical college in Vienna, graduated in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And you were qualified to do what with that degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I was a civil engineer, and that qualified me for quite a few ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you follow the events in Germany in the early 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Not until Hitler became chancellor in 1933.</span> <span id="s139">Then, especially the Jewish people were aware what’s -- things -- what -- what’s going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s140">Although, times really got bad for the Jews when Hitler took over Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: We-We’ll get to that in a minute, but you’re -- you’re running just a little ahead of me.</span> <span id="s142">So when Hitler became chancellor -- you said that’s when you first really became concerned, what were some of the thoughts that you had and what -- do you remember any of the conversations that your Jewish friends had at -- at the time that he first became chancellor?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: For some reason we never were -- had any conversation about it, or exchanged any views.</span> <span id="s144">But -- that -- we always felt that it won’t happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Do you remember reading reports of the Reichstag fire and -- and the emergency decrees that came after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, I [indecipherable] excuse me.</span> <span id="s147">Yes, I followed the -- the news, of course, in the newspapers as well as the radio.</span> <span id="s148">And something -- as a matter of fact, speaking of radio, that’s a radio which my father and I put together ourselves.</span> <span id="s149">And was quite a big success.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What was going on in Austria, specifically with Dollfus.</span> <span id="s151">Can you tell me a little bit about what was going on with the politics of the country in those days?</span> <span id="s152">A: Well, mostly under Dollfus, things were pretty -- pretty steady and were no problems as far as anti-Semitism is concerned.</span> <span id="s153">The administration tried to make it as -- as easy as possible for the Jewish population, and they -- they tried not -- tried to make the Jewish population feel at peace that nothing would happen to them.</span> <span id="s154">And he did try to protect the Jewish population especially, and fought the -- the Nazis in the city continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Were you aware in the early 30’s about the existence of Dachau and about the book burnings and about some of those things that were happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Just was aware of it, but nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What was your reaction when you heard about the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses?</span> <span id="s158">Did you have any reaction to that or was that something that kind of seemed to fit the same pattern?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Not -- not until Hitler marched into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Before he came into Austria, though, did you see any of the Nazi propaganda that was anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s162">You know, there were lots of political pamphlets, pasted information on lampposts and w-walls and prints and all that.</span> <span id="s163">It was very uncomfortable too, to see it and to read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Can you remember any of the things that you saw or that you heard at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, as a matter of fact, I was interested in collecting all these stickers, political stickers.</span> <span id="s166">And as a matter of fact, I brought it with me to the United States and I give it to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s167">And they -- they, as a matter of fact, displayed it on the third floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you ever listen to Hitler on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: On the radio?</span> <span id="s170">Yes, yes, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What was -- what were your reactions when you heard him on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I just -- I think -- I think he sounded to me like a crazy man, that’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: You mentioned before that the Jewish community was a little concerned.</span> <span id="s174">Did the Jewish community do anything, or was there any activity at that time to show that the Jewish community was concerned about what was happening right across the border in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: They were concerned, but they always felt safe in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: What was happening in your life during the early 30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: You -- the early 30’s?</span> <span id="s178">Well, there was actually no change.</span> <span id="s179">As a matter of fact, the only experience I may have had a few times when I went to the college, that some of the anti-Semitic organizations, student organizations tried to start a fight.</span> <span id="s180">Sometimes they were successful, a lot of times they weren’t.</span> <span id="s181">But I myself, personally speaking, always tried to keep out of things, just minding my own business.</span> <span id="s182">And just, as I said before, I never joined any political organizations.</span> <span id="s183">But there were a few scraps between the students, whether they were Jewish or -- or Gentile, but -- but somehow it didn’t affect me in s -- in any way.</span> <span id="s184">I was upset about it, of course, but nothing I would do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: You mentioned before that Dollfus tried to keep things quiet, especially for the Jewish population, was fighting Nazis in the streets.</span> <span id="s186">How much did you know about the Nazi attempt to seize power in Austria in ’34?</span> <span id="s187">Did you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Oh, in -- that was -- well, that was the time when Dollfus was killed, and -- it was murder, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s189">No, I d -- I -- I don’t -- I was not too much interested in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: When Hitler started moving, before he even came to Austria, what were your thoughts, if you can remember, when he entered the Rhineland back in ’36?</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember when he entered the Rhineland?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s193">Well, it was -- it was just another -- another act of his, and we in Austria just -- we were more or less like a neutral country.</span> <span id="s194">We were hoping and trying to -- to stay quiet and --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you have a sense of increasing alarm, or was it still status quo when he -- when Hitler signed with Mussolini, when they signed their Berlin-Rome access.</span> <span id="s196">Were you -- were you beginning to get concerned, or did you still feel safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No.</span> <span id="s198">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Still felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">City was still normal.</span> <span id="s202">No changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you have any knowledge of what was happening in the United States with respect to the Jewish community and the protest against Hitler?</span> <span id="s204">Did any of that news ever filter out to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">Was never anything written up in papers or otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you follow the 1936 Olympics?</span> <span id="s208">You were a big athlete, I was just wondering if you -- if you followed the Berlin Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s210">Yes, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s211">I did personally listen to the radio, watching the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Any -- any memories of the Olympics that stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Not really, I -- I knew, of course about the -- the black people who -- who represented United States.</span> <span id="s214">There was a lot -- lot of talk about that, and -- and in a way we were glad that they won.</span> <span id="s215">We were -- were very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Were there any newsreels at that time showing the Olympic events?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, not -- not -- not that -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s219">What was happening in your life right before the anschluss?</span> <span id="s220">What were you doing?</span> <span id="s221">Were you working, were you still a student?</span> <span id="s222">What was happening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Well, that’s a good question, because as I graduate the college, I also had to have -- had to serve three months in the military.</span> <span id="s224">And it’s like an -- like we’d call here ROTC.</span> <span id="s225">And I reported to the -- to an artillery regiment, which was an exclusive regiment at that time, and my uncle helped me.</span> <span id="s226">And served for three months, going in in January 1938.</span> <span id="s227">And I was out of town on maneuvers, and March the 14th we -- there were rumors that the Germans may take over Austria, and Chancellor chus -- Schuschnigg at that time said that he does not want to see any blood flowing in the streets of Vienna, or for Austria, or the entire country.</span> <span id="s228">And he would not issue any -- any orders to fight or anything.</span> <span id="s229">Those were the initial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared.</span> <span id="s230">Suddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started.</span> <span id="s231">And of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I think I was the only Jew in the whole regiment.</span> <span id="s232">And he immediately notified me that I could go take the next train back to Vienna to see my parents.</span> <span id="s233">And that he would see me again in the barracks back in Vienna, because they were packing up and ready to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s234">And that was one sight I will never forget.</span> <span id="s235">When I arrived at the railroad station in Vienna, I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform, military uniform.</span> <span id="s236">When I arrived in Vienna, got off, got out on the street, I couldn’t believe that I -- I was in -- in a city where I not only was born, but raised and went to school.</span> <span id="s237">It was a completely strange atmosphere.</span> <span id="s238">First of all, there were people on the streets.</span> <span id="s239">Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband.</span> <span id="s240">Flags all over the place, which never occurred during my lifetime in Vienna.</span> <span id="s241">And I took the streetcar, go home, and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this particular moment I didn’t know that they were all Jews who were down on their knees scrubbing the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s242">And I just couldn’t -- couldn’t believe, couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s243">And I got home and met my parents.</span> <span id="s244">And my father -- that was on a Sunday when I arrived, my father went to the office the next day on Monday, and when he got -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his office.</span> <span id="s245">And they introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business over to the German banks.</span> <span id="s246">And as a matter of fact it was -- I think it was like a contract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938.</span> <span id="s247">And they were more or less watching every move he made during that period, and in the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my family in the -- in the United States and started procedure, getting an affidavit to get me out.</span> <span id="s248">At that time we also unfortunately found out that as far as I’m concerned, I could leave Vienna without any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa.</span> <span id="s249">But my parents, unfortunately, my father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish quota.</span> <span id="s250">Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa to get to United States, so naturally -- we had contacts in Yugoslavia and other places and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s251">But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the barracks, to my barracks, and believe me or not, I got into my room and I couldn’t find any of the -- my personal belongings.</span> <span id="s252">And, as a matter of fact, the whole regiment couldn’t find anything of their own belongings.</span> <span id="s253">And what we found out is the German -- Germans moved in.</span> <span id="s254">As a matter of fact when I arrived in the barracks, I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the field, just like it was theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: I have to interrupt you because --</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: -- we have to change tape.</span> <span id="s258">Just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Norbert Hilsberg.</span> <span id="s261">This is tape number one, side B. And you were telling me about the barracks, coming back to your barracks and what you found there.</span> <span id="s262">And if you would, please continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: As I said, when I came back into the barracks, I couldn’t find my personal belongings and we later found out that the Germans just took over and threw everything down into the cellar of the barracks.</span> <span id="s264">So we all had to scramble and find our things.</span> <span id="s265">I eventually did.</span> <span id="s266">I immediately contacted my commanding officer about the situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s267">And so he said don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s268">Of course, I also explained to my commanding officer that I couldn’t leave Vienna until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport, because those are requirements to get the visa.</span> <span id="s269">So he said don’t worry about it, I’ll take care of everything.</span> <span id="s270">I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over two weeks, as a matter of fact, which helped me considerably, moving around the city without any fear.</span> <span id="s271">And so the day when the commanding officer had the military passport for me, he called me in the office and said, now here’s the passport, but I won’t give it to you.</span> <span id="s272">I said, why won’t you give it?</span> <span id="s273">He said, because I want to make sure that you’re gonna deposit th -- in the American embassy, where it belongs.</span> <span id="s274">I said, well then, let -- take it out, I’m going to the embassy right now.</span> <span id="s275">He said, no, I’m going to call a taxi for you, put you in the taxi and -- and you -- you take it.</span> <span id="s276">Which I did, and I went to the embassy directly from the barracks and deposited a passport in the embassy and then went home.</span> <span id="s277">Of course, after that I had to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I was discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in the Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army.</span> <span id="s278">And as a matter of fact, I still have my military passport with me.</span> <span id="s279">And so a -- twice -- we -- we lived in a -- an apartment building and [indecipherable] apartment building near the American -- well, wi -- American embassy as a m -- as a matter of fact, a new American embassy after the war is located within a block, walking distance from where I used to live.</span> <span id="s280">And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the situation and always informed us whenever the Gestapo came by to inquire about the Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here.</span> <span id="s281">And so whenever that happened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with the Germans to be in his office until September the first, but for me, I had to leave the city twice.</span> <span id="s282">And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- Vienna, and stayed there for about a week, then I came back again.</span> <span id="s283">Well, finally I received my visa in June of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted.</span> <span id="s284">And of course I could not leave Vienna with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to United States.</span> <span id="s285">And of course my father, being in a bank, he arranged prior, long prior, my -- before my departure, to have money picked up in -- in twa -- in Paris when I arrived there from Vienna, which I did, was very lucky.</span> <span id="s286">Of course, everything -- before I left Vienna, my passage was completely paid and taken care of from France to the United States.</span> <span id="s287">And of course I was concerned about my parents, what -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s288">It’s only for about I think six weeks.</span> <span id="s289">And then they traveled to Italy and from Italy they went to France.</span> <span id="s290">And in the meantime, my uncle who had -- who lived in Philadelphia, and he had contacts with the State department, and arrangements were made that my parents take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of course sh -- that’s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the West Indies, a cruise to the West Indies and arrive in Cuba.</span> <span id="s291">And so naturally my parents bought s-some cruise tickets in Paris, and they left France on that cruise ship in 1940.</span> <span id="s292">And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in Santiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the American embassy in -- in Havana that greeted them and took them off the ship.</span> <span id="s293">And my parents stayed in Havana for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the United States, they came.</span> <span id="s294">So that is my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: I -- I have a lot of question to --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: -- to ask you.</span> <span id="s298">If your father was able to get money out before the anschluss, when did he already start making plans for you?</span> <span id="s299">When did your parents already start thinking about getting you and getting themselves out?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Ma -- my mother was the driving force really, because my father s-said -- I -- I had nothing to say anyway.</span> <span id="s301">I was a good boy.</span> <span id="s302">But my -- my father just took it easy, he said, well, everything will be go -- will go back to normal, nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s303">And -- but my mother was the driving force, and she -- she really did a fine job to get us all out.</span> <span id="s304">As a matter of fact, there’s a very interesting -- very interesting story.</span> <span id="s305">Se-September -- September first came, and of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s308">And my father left -- on that day, he left for the railro -- for the railroad station.</span> <span id="s309">I don’t know what for, he went downtown on something else also.</span> <span id="s310">And luckily, he called home to tell my mother something, and my mother said, don’t come home any more.</span> <span id="s311">And the reason was is while my father was away, a knock on the door, and a couple men standing out in front of the door and then my mother says, can I help you?</span> <span id="s312">And they said, I would like to -- we would like to talk to Mr. Hilsberg.</span> <span id="s313">So my mother said, well, Mr. Hilsberg is downtown for a -- I don’t know what -- well, when is he coming home?</span> <span id="s314">So my mother says, well, I really don’t know how long he’s going to stay downtown.</span> <span id="s315">He said, well we -- we’d like to talk to him.</span> <span id="s316">So my mother replied -- said, well you know that we are leaving today.</span> <span id="s317">So he said yes, we know, but we still like to talk to Mr. Hilsberg before he leave.</span> <span id="s318">So that was it and luckily my father called in the meantime.</span> <span id="s319">My mother said, don’t come home.</span> <span id="s320">I’ll just lock the door and I’ll leave the key with my neighbors and say goodbye to everything.</span> <span id="s321">I’ll meet you at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s322">And that’s what happened and that’s how they got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: But when did she start making arrangements?</span> <span id="s324">Do you know when she started?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I don’t remember the date, or when they received the -- the visa to -- to leave Vienna for yu-yugos -- for Yugoslavia, but I do know that they were well prepared shortly after I left Vienna, where their -- their personal belongs were all -- already packed, because arrangements were made that they would go to -- to United States to live there.</span> <span id="s326">So we ha -- I had one uncle in -- in California, and so everything was sent -- all the crates were sent to California.</span> <span id="s327">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: I -- I’m still trying to figure out when your dad got the money sent to Paris for you, because he di -- did he do it before the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s330">As a matter -- that was good question, I’m glad that you asked me.</span> <span id="s331">What happened is when the word came that maybe -- that the Germans may wind up and enter the -- the -- Austria, that’s when he felt that he better transfer some of the -- the money, the family money, as a matter of fact, to Paris, to the bank, which is -- was the main branch there.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: I do have some other questions --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: -- about what you told me.</span> <span id="s335">The -- the biggest question in my mind is why would your parents -- why would anybody take a cruise in 1940?</span> <span id="s336">The war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s337">I must be missing something.</span> <span id="s338">Was it -- did people feel it was safe to take a -- a cruise?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: That was the only chance for them to leave Europe and they just took the chance, and it worked out fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Before you were allowed to come into the United States, did you have to take any tests, any physical or mental tests?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: In the time you were still in Vienna, after the anschluss, had you heard about some of the concentration camps and did you know anybody who was sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I -- I knew a very close school friend, his father was sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s344">And -- but I do -- do know that he was released from Dachau and came home after a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: You also mentioned that you packed up your things and you left.</span> <span id="s346">What did you take with you?</span> <span id="s347">What of your personal items did you take with you besides the stamp collection that you donated to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Well, just took my -- my clothing, and that -- that’s all, just what’s on your back.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: You -- did you take any photos with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, that was all packed in the crates.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: How did you personally travel, and did you travel with anybody else, or were you completely alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s353">I do have -- I do ha -- ha -- I did have a second cousin in Paris I stayed with for about a couple weeks before I left France for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: You said you had an uncle in Philadelphia and an uncle in California and the -- the crates and everything went to California.</span> <span id="s355">Was California your destination also?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I assume it was my parent’s destination, but it has changed because they finally settled in New York and everything had to be sent back to New York -- California.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: But when you came to the United States, what was your destination?</span> <span id="s358">Where did you think you were going to end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I stayed with my great-aunt in New York for a couple weeks and then -- that was in the summer, of course, of ’38.</span> <span id="s360">And my uncle from Philadelphia picked me up and took me to his summer home up in New Hampshire and we stayed there all summer, and then went back to -- to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You told me to ask you about the hurricane of 1938; I did not forget.</span> <span id="s362">Can you tell me about the hurricane?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: That was quite an experience for me because I’m -- I was never in my life exposed to it, even though it was only 24 years of my life, but I -- I never -- never experienced it myself and I certainly did.</span> <span id="s364">It was a little -- a home right on a lake, and that lake became an ocean.</span> <span id="s365">As a matter of fact, when I came over on the ship across the ocean to the United States, I went through a storm.</span> <span id="s366">And I just remembered that moment when that hurricane came over New Hampshire and that little lake became a -- became an ocean.</span> <span id="s367">And it was really very tough to get out because luckily the summer home was not hit by any trees, but trees were falling all over the place.</span> <span id="s368">As a matter of fact, the next day, my uncle and I, we had to move tree trunks in order to get out to the main road from the house.</span> <span id="s369">So it was quite an excitement for me.</span> <span id="s370">I -- I -- in a way I enjoyed it, but yet I felt very sorry for all the damage I saw in the way home from New Hampshire to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did you speak any English before you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Where did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: In school, in high school.</span> <span id="s375">I took classes in French and in English, and through my entire high school I had two hour -- two classes a week, which -- an hour in English as well as in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What were your expectations of the United States when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I read a lot about the United States and I had my family, had family in the United States and they came to visit us many times in Vienna and stayed with us.</span> <span id="s378">So I had a pretty good idea as to what the units -- United States, especially New York, looked like.</span> <span id="s379">And I was not a bit disappointed or -- or surprised when I saw it myself with my own eyes when I arrived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What about your expectations of the American citizens?</span> <span id="s381">How did the Americans strike you?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I liked them from the moment I arrived in the States.</span> <span id="s383">I think it -- I was -- I was used to that type of life and excitement and variety of life in the United States, and I felt very quickly, almost immediately I felt like it -- being at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Did you realize at that time just how lucky you were to have gotten out?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I certainly was because as a measure f -- as a mat -- as a matter of fact, when I found out recently that I am considered a -- a survivor, I -- I just couldn’t believe it, because I personally really did not suffer, and for that matter, my -- my parents didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s386">They suffered a little bit more than I did, but at least they made it out all right and didn’t have these bad experiences.</span> <span id="s387">And -- and -- and kept on living.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: When you came to the United States, did people ask you about what was going on in Vienna and what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, they did, but I didn’t have much experience except my just personal, couple experiences I had during my -- before I left Vienna.</span> <span id="s390">But otherwise no, I -- I couldn’t -- couldn’t really tell them.</span> <span id="s391">I -- ab -- of course I was able to tell them the story what I saw while I was there, how they treated the -- the Jewish people, not only that, but the Jewish owners of -- of stores and so on.</span> <span id="s392">And life really changed overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Now, you had already left Austria when a lot of historical events happened, so I would like to ask you about a few of them, and if -- if you were not aware of them, that’s fine, but let me just ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Had you heard about the Evian conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: There was some written in the paper, that’s all I -- I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What was your reaction to the agreement between Chamberlain and Hitler, the peace in our time agreement?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, that was -- that was devastating really, because I personally didn’t believe in it and it sure proved the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How was that event, this peace in our time, that agreement between --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: How was that reported in the United States newspapers and on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I really -- I really don’t -- I -- I can’t express myself, I -- I -- I -- I -- I really don’t -- don’t know, I -- I do know that everybody was upset, and the -- it was not believable.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: How did you learn about the events of Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Through the newspaper and radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: And what were your thoughts when you read about these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I really couldn’t believe it, what they have done.</span> <span id="s407">And just sitting here and -- and -- and trying to reminisce, it is just unbelievable that in the -- in this world things like this can be done, even in those days, which was 50 some years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community here and the -- just the general American public here to the news of Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I really, really w-were -- was not too much aware of it except for just the news.</span> <span id="s410">I guess I was too young in the group I was with.</span> <span id="s411">They just did not pay too much attention to it, except of course that everybody was upset what has happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: At that time were you still in touch with people in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Can you tell me, besides the hurricane, what did you do those first few weeks and months that you were in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, the first -- first two weeks in New York, I had a marvelous time, I had a cousin, the young -- young girl who took me all over New York, showed me all the sights.</span> <span id="s416">And one night, as a matter of fact, she -- she took me to a café, dancing, and she couldn’t believe that I -- I was up to it, to the latest dance available, because Vienna was very cosmopolitan and of course, we just did the same thing in Vienna as they did in New York, or any other place in the United States.</span> <span id="s417">As a matter of fact, I also concentrated on seeing all the American movies in Vienna while I was still living there and that -- that helped my English also, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Were you able, or did you need to get any more education in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: All right, you were here by the time Hitler annexed part of Czechoslovakia, and did you think that that event was reported accurately and well in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I really would not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Do you remember hearing about the Saint Louis, the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s424">As a matter of fact, not until the -- the -- I think there -- there was a movie about it?</span> <span id="s425">Yes.</span> <span id="s426">That was actually the first time that I really knew what was -- really what was happening.</span> <span id="s427">Truthfully speaking, I didn’t read too much newspapers in the beginning when I was here.</span> <span id="s428">[indecipherable] I had other interests.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Is there anything that -- that we haven’t talked about that stands out in your mind about the period of time before World War II started?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: How -- how do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: For example, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you came here?</span> <span id="s432">Or any anti-foreign feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Here in the United States?</span> <span id="s434">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: September 1st, 1939, how did you find out that war had started?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: A friend of mine and it was on a Sunday, he went in the afternoon, in the mid-afternoon to the movies in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s437">That’s where I lived.</span> <span id="s438">And when we came out, there were extras, on World War wa -- World War II broke out.</span> <span id="s439">That was -- that’s how I found out that the war started, the invasion of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Did you still have any family left in Lemberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: In Poland.</span> <span id="s443">Did you still have any family left in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, no, they’re all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: With the news that the war had begun, how did the American population react, and were you surprised in any way by the American reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And you had no correspondence with anybody in Europe still, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: How carefully did you follow the war news?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Well, not until -- not until 1941 did I really follow that.</span> <span id="s451">Course, 1941, that’s when I entered the services of the United States Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did you have any idea of how the Jews were being treated at that -- you know, in ’39 and in ’40?</span> <span id="s453">Before you got into the military, did you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Only from what I read in the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: In what ways was America changing in ’39 when the war started and into 1940?</span> <span id="s456">Did you detect any changes in the American community?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you notice any alarm in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Oh, I -- I heard, but somehow it didn’t affect me too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: And what was happening in your life in 1939 and 1940?</span> <span id="s461">What were you doing before you got into the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Well, I graduated in 1936, and I got a job in a research organization, and at the same time also, I was always participating during my younger years, growing years, in -- in choirs, joining choirs and singing in the school, and -- and everybody in the family, including my -- my mother, of course, suggested that I have a beautiful voice, and I -- I should try to -- to learn, to study.</span> <span id="s463">And I just -- I’m always up for some -- always up -- ready to do something else, something different.</span> <span id="s464">And I had a -- a interview with one of the finest voice teachers in Vienna at that time.</span> <span id="s465">And he said, my God, I want you to be my student.</span> <span id="s466">And he -- I started to take singing lessons.</span> <span id="s467">And then he transferred me to his assistant, a Bulgarian man, and I studied voice and ca -- actually continued studying voice when I came to Philadelphia, I went to the Curtis Institute and studied voice there.</span> <span id="s468">In the meantime also, naturally, I wanted to be independent so my uncle got me a job in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What kind of job?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Well, he was -- had connections with the city solicitor of -- of Philadelphia, and of -- my first job we came -- we came back from the hurricane experience in September of -- September of 1938, which was the 27th of September 1938, and -- and he -- this man got me an interview with a person in the ci -- in city hall who had something to do with the library.</span> <span id="s471">Apparently they needed some translators.</span> <span id="s472">So I went up there, was -- had an interview at nine o’clock in the morning and we had a very pleasant meeting.</span> <span id="s473">And the last question he asked me, he said to me, are you a citizen of the United States?</span> <span id="s474">I said no, but I -- I already -- already applied for my -- for my second papers.</span> <span id="s475">I do -- I do have them.</span> <span id="s476">So he said to me, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s477">And he pounded his fist on his table and said I don’t care if even President Roosevelt is going to ask me to give you a job, I will not.</span> <span id="s478">That was that.</span> <span id="s479">That was my experience, my first experience trying for a job in -- in the United States.</span> <span id="s480">So I went back home and I told my -- my uncle about it.</span> <span id="s481">He says well, let me call Mr. Sharfson, and he called him.</span> <span id="s482">So the guy says to him, well, don’t worry about it, I’ll get him an -- a job.</span> <span id="s483">And sure enough, two days later I had an interview in the Litz department store in Philadelphia in the advertising department.</span> <span id="s484">And so I -- I -- I worked there until I went to the service in February of ’41.</span> <span id="s485">And thit -- the what I did is, since I was musically inclined and knowledgeable in a way, I -- the department store had, every Sunday morning, a two hour classical music -- a -- a music hour, two hours.</span> <span id="s486">And I was in charge to arrange the program every Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s487">So that was a nice, interesting job for me to do.</span> <span id="s488">And of course I had to be careful, using the -- the time properly with -- with the commercials and so on.</span> <span id="s489">And on the side I have oth-other duties like filing and doing things in the advertising department.</span> <span id="s490">So I -- I liked that, I -- I enjoyed it very much, and -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Norbert Hilsberg.</span> <span id="s492">This is tape number two, side A. And I’m sorry, we were talking about your job and the concerts, the Sunday morning concerts and -- and some of your other duties and responsibilities, and you were abo -- you were going to finish with that and about to tell me about going into the military.</span> <span id="s493">And I’d also like you to tell me if you were drafted, or if you volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, so as I -- as I was saying, I was proud to make my ow -- have my own money and do as I pleased.</span> <span id="s495">And in the mean -- also, I continued taking my lessons, singing lessons at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s496">And then in Octob -- was it October or November of 1940, Congress drafted th-the bill for conscriptions.</span> <span id="s497">And at that time when -- you had to go to the draft board and report, and -- and they gave you a number when you -- when -- the numb -- yeah, the number was a number -- if you had a low number that means that you -- they would call you for duty in a -- in a short time.</span> <span id="s498">An-And unfortunately, I -- I had an -- well f -- actually fortunately I had a low number.</span> <span id="s499">And it was, of course, winter of ’40 - ’41, and in those days, of course, you only served for one year.</span> <span id="s500">That -- that’s the time period.</span> <span id="s501">So I liked having had the experience in the military in Austria.</span> <span id="s502">Of course, I was aware that the summertime, especially the summertime in the Amer -- in the American camps, I -- I found out were located, most of them in -- in the beginning of the -- the war, in -- in the south.</span> <span id="s503">So -- and I always hated hot weather.</span> <span id="s504">So I figured well, if I can -- since I have a low number, I found out when they’re going to call me, which I did and they told me, well, your number would indicate that you probably will -- will be called in April or May.</span> <span id="s505">So I said, April or May?</span> <span id="s506">I said -- so I asked him, would -- could they take me now if I -- if I decide?</span> <span id="s507">But of course, I have to check with my boss first.</span> <span id="s508">He said well, if you want -- want to volunteer, we’ll take you in right now if you want to.</span> <span id="s509">Said no, le-let’s wait.</span> <span id="s510">I went back to my job and I talked to the boss and he said fine, go.</span> <span id="s511">If you feel -- if you want to go now, go ahead and go into the service.</span> <span id="s512">We’ll keep the job for you.</span> <span id="s513">When you come back, I guarantee you, you will have your job back.</span> <span id="s514">So with that, I felt good about it.</span> <span id="s515">I went back to the draft board.</span> <span id="s516">That was about -- must have been about January and I volunteered for a year, and February 18th of 1941, I went to the service.</span> <span id="s517">I was taken to Fort Dix in New Jersey and I had my physical and I had interviews.</span> <span id="s518">I had the intelligence test and during the intelligence test they asked me, do you have any special -- special unit you would like to join?</span> <span id="s519">So I said, well I really -- I really don’t care.</span> <span id="s520">So the -- the interviewer says, well, you have engineering background and you wa -- do -- what-what else did he say?</span> <span id="s521">Don’t -- don’t remember.</span> <span id="s522">Engineering background and what was the other one?</span> <span id="s523">Oh, the military service, of course, in the Austrian Army.</span> <span id="s524">So wha-what would you like, engineering?</span> <span id="s525">I said, I really don’t care.</span> <span id="s526">I’ll just go in and finish my year and that’s all I’m interested.</span> <span id="s527">So they sent me to Fort Bell wa -- which is -- which is an engineer camp, and -- and I went there and they put me into mapmaking.</span> <span id="s528">And of course, that’s my -- my forte.</span> <span id="s529">I like geography and of course, in my engineering ground -- background helped me to learn quickly how to make maps.</span> <span id="s530">My math and -- and geology is included in -- in that.</span> <span id="s531">And I -- I started out as a private in 1941, and shortly I became promoted and my commanding officer and the executive officer of the battalion which I-I was attached to, came over to the drafting room every morning for inspection.</span> <span id="s532">And as I was sitting in my drafting table and so my commanding officer and my b -- company officer st-stayed th -- I -- I was the only table, always stopped, talking to me.</span> <span id="s533">At the other tables they just passed by.</span> <span id="s534">He says well, how’s my little refugee feel today?</span> <span id="s535">You gained some more weight.</span> <span id="s536">And so came -- was in November, or -- or must have been end of November or early December, that was December seventh.</span> <span id="s537">Yeah, it was December seventh, of course.</span> <span id="s538">Was December seventh, it was in a Sunday.</span> <span id="s539">A friend of mine, we took off.</span> <span id="s540">I got a pass to go into town.</span> <span id="s541">We went to Washington and the reason was that th-the [indecipherable] choir gave a concert the Constitution Hall at three o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s542">Well, in those days, before the war s -- before the United States was involved in the war, of course, they -- they didn’t care too much for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s543">And -- so we went to the Constitution Hall and it was all sold out, no tickets available.</span> <span id="s544">Otherwise in the -- in the later days, after the war started, well they gave you free tickets and everything was available for the -- for the u -- United States soldier.</span> <span id="s545">So we wound up in the -- went to the Library of Congress to play some chess.</span> <span id="s546">But five o’clock was the time for the Library of Congress to close, so we returned the chess set, and the guy behind the counter said, okay, good luck boys, won’t see you any more.</span> <span id="s547">I said, what -- what do you mean, won’t see you any more?</span> <span id="s548">That was five o’clock in the afternoon, December 7th, 1941.</span> <span id="s549">So he said, well don’t you know that Pearl Harbor was -- was bombed?</span> <span id="s550">Pearl Harbor was bombed?</span> <span id="s551">What?</span> <span id="s552">We went out -- well, it was really chaos in -- in the city of Washington.</span> <span id="s553">There were army trucks all over, picking up all the soldiers from th -- on the streets and taking them back to the camps.</span> <span id="s554">Well, we decided we’re not going to get caught.</span> <span id="s555">We went through side streets and though alleys and we wound up at Basil’s delicatessen on Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street, and we figured we’ll have the last good Jewish meal.</span> <span id="s556">And we came back -- we took the bus back to the camp, to Fort Belvoir and my God, everybody was packing, everybody was ready to go.</span> <span id="s557">But luckily our outfit was attached to general headquarters in Washington, so -- and of course we were not involved in that.</span> <span id="s558">So that’s -- that’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: After Pearl Harbor, did your duties or responsibilities change?</span> <span id="s560">A: Well, it was s-secrecy all around, especially in -- in my job because we -- we started to be involved in preparations for -- for war maps and invasion maps and that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s561">So naturally, secrecy was all around us.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: When you first joined the military, what was your citizenship status?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I was still waiting for my citizenship.</span> <span id="s564">As a matter of fact, I did not become a citizen until April of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: I’d -- I’d like you to tell me about some of the changes that you saw unfolding in this country right after Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s566">In those first weeks and months after Pearl Harbor, what did you see around you, not just in the army, but did you have any contact at all with any of the civilian centers, like any of the cities or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, not -- not at all.</span> <span id="s568">I do know one thing, that we were very busy in doing our job, and there was little time left for other st -- things to do.</span> <span id="s569">And we had very little conterwi -- of course we -- we wer -- we were told to have as little contact as -- contact as possible with the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So tell me what you were doing generally or specifically in 1942.</span> <span id="s571">Were you still -- you were Stateside?</span> <span id="s572">You’re nodding your head, bu --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes, we were -- we were Stateside, and working pretty hard.</span> <span id="s574">We -- I myself put in anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day to prepare all the maps necessary for the -- for north Africa especially at that -- at that time.</span> <span id="s575">And in 1942, when things became more and more involved for the United States, our general headquarters decided to send us overseas to be attached to a general headquarters in Europe.</span> <span id="s576">And at that time also there was -- they started to prepare for the European invasion, and that would be a good location to do what we have to do.</span> <span id="s577">Unfortunately, or fortunately, whichever, I was still not a citizen, and even though my commanding officer did his utmost to take me along, the war department -- at that time war department would not allow me to go because it was too dangerous if I were captured as a -- I was still, more or less I -- an Austrian, or an enemy, anyway.</span> <span id="s578">And so they kept me here and they formed a new cadre for a new battalion for mapmaking, because they needed more than one, so of course I was left back in the United States and we formed a new ou-outfit.</span> <span id="s579">And -- and we -- we put all these newcomers through basic training like I used to go through, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s580">And -- and we worked.</span> <span id="s581">We’re still attached to general headquarters in th -- Washington.</span> <span id="s582">And then come 1940 -- ’43 -- of course I was a citizen in April, but in November of 1943, our out -- the new outfit was sent to north Africa, and that’s where I left for overseas in November of 1943.</span> <span id="s583">And I stayed in north Africa for about a year.</span> <span id="s584">We took over a little French si -- town, little ti -- cher -- Cherchell.</span> <span id="s585">And we set up shop there and did a lot of work for the invasion of southern France with the seventh army, and also worked for General Mark Clark in -- in Italy.</span> <span id="s586">And started preparing, as a matter of fact, started preparing to work -- make military maps of Austria.</span> <span id="s587">And of course, I was in charge, naturally.</span> <span id="s588">But we did not finish it because we were asked to be sent back to United States and back to the Pacific, and we went to Hawaii.</span> <span id="s589">We attached to Pacific Ocean headquarters and started to work on all the invasion maps of the islands and Japan and so on.</span> <span id="s590">And as a matter of fact, on -- on V -- not so V -- no.</span> <span id="s591">Yeah, V-J day, that’s when the -- when Japan finally gave up.</span> <span id="s592">On V-J day the war didn’t end for our outfit, because it just so happened that we worked on Tokyo bay and General mar -- MacArthur would not move in with the Missouri into the bay, unless he has all the information available to him.</span> <span id="s593">He just didn’t trust these guys, naturally.</span> <span id="s594">And so we -- for us the war wasn’t over until two weeks after V-J day.</span> <span id="s595">And we finally were finished and that was in ’45.</span> <span id="s596">And I was dischar -- discharged in November of 1945.</span> <span id="s597">And when my wife picked me up from Fort Mead, she told me that there was a letter from the war department waiting for me.</span> <span id="s598">And of course, I -- at that point I did not have any idea what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s599">And I -- I would not go back to Philadelphia because my wife is a Washingtonian and she has all her family and friends here and so I decided we’re going to raise a family here, in Washington area.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I want to stop you before you go any further because I have several questions.</span> <span id="s601">I don’t even know where to start.</span> <span id="s602">What was your final rank at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Your rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: The rank?</span> <span id="s606">Master sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: While you were still working on maps of Europe, whether you were in the United States or in north Africa, did you have any idea of what was happening to the Jews inside the Reich?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Just what I heard on -- on radio broadcasts, that’s all we had at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So you had no maps or no intelligence on the camps themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Not on the camps, no.</span> <span id="s611">We knew -- we knew that there were camps, but we didn’t know more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Were there any reports, either in the regular newspapers or in “Stars and Stripes” about what was going on while you were already in Hawaii?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes, yes, we knew that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What -- what do you recall about reading “Stars and Stripes” for example, and do you remember reading about the liberations of some of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s616">But that’s -- that’s just about all the -- they were just short reports, there were no details.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: You also mentioned a wife.</span> <span id="s618">Now, you have to back up and tell me when you met your wife and when you got married, because you kind of forgot that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: It was -- I believe -- I think it was in April of 1942.</span> <span id="s620">I -- friend of mine and I, we had the early evening off, and we went to the movies in a ge -- in a -- in Fort Belvoir.</span> <span id="s621">And th -- we were at the early show and the show was over, I think it was nine o’clock in the evening and my friend, he always went to these dances.</span> <span id="s622">They brought in girls from the Jewish community center or from other organizations to dance with the boys, entertain them.</span> <span id="s623">And on that particular day there was some Jewish org -- something of -- I think it was from the Jewish community center, were sent to Fort Belvoir.</span> <span id="s624">And my friend says to me, let’s go.</span> <span id="s625">I -- I want to go.</span> <span id="s626">He usually went to these affairs, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s627">And so he said, come on, don’t be a spoilsport.</span> <span id="s628">I said okay, I’ll do you a favor.</span> <span id="s629">So we walked into the hall where were -- they were dancing and a buddy of mine was working the record player.</span> <span id="s630">So he saw me and he called me up on the stage and said, come on, let me dance while you -- if you want to work.</span> <span id="s631">I said, sure, sure, I’ll ta -- I’ll take over, I’ll play the records.</span> <span id="s632">And for the rest of the evening, was almost until about 10 o’clock or so, I played records.</span> <span id="s633">And the dancing -- and I -- I just looked and enjoyed watching the people.</span> <span id="s634">And -- and all of a sudden -- it was the last dance, all of a sudden I see a girl coming by the stage right -- right below me and sh-she had a do -- red -- red dress on, or was it a jacket or something, but she just hit my eye.</span> <span id="s635">So I said, I want to dance with her, and I jumped off the stage.</span> <span id="s636">And I asked for the dance and that -- whoever [indecipherable] passed it on, and we were dancing.</span> <span id="s637">And I said -- I said to her, my first words -- words were, where have you been all evening?</span> <span id="s638">So one word led to another and as a matter of fact I -- I was supposed to, since I was in charge, I was supposed to bring the records back -- back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s639">So of course, was late at night and -- and the records were heavy.</span> <span id="s640">So it just so happened that my wife-to-be had a car with all the girls in there.</span> <span id="s641">So I said, do you mind to drop me off with the -- those records?</span> <span id="s642">So she said, I really don’t have any room.</span> <span id="s643">I really have full of -- they had, you know, she had about a half a dozen girls in th -- in the car.</span> <span id="s644">So, in those days they had the standing boards on the cars, on the old cars.</span> <span id="s645">So she said, if you want to, you can stand on a -- on a -- on a boar -- on a body board, or whatever they called it and I’ll take you back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s646">So -- so she took me back to the barracks and before I -- I left, I said, can I have your phone number?</span> <span id="s647">So she says, I’m in the phone book.</span> <span id="s648">Just like that.</span> <span id="s649">And that’s the -- that’s the beginning of the story and here we are almost 60 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Maxine.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Let’s go back to the war years.</span> <span id="s653">What memories do you have of hearing of the death of Roosevelt and also the death of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I was sitting in a [indecipherable] of -- in the Schofield barracks in Hawaii, writing a letter to my wife.</span> <span id="s655">It was 11 o’clock in the morning, Hawaii sty -- Hawaiian time and the news just came over the radio about Roosevelt’s death.</span> <span id="s656">And I ex-expressed my -- my sorrow and then how I felt in the letter to my wife at that time.</span> <span id="s657">Don’t remember any more of the details of what I wrote.</span> <span id="s658">But that was my first moment when I found out about Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: When did you hear that Hitler had died?</span> <span id="s660">When Hitler died.</span> <span id="s661">Do you remember hearing about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes, I heard about it, but everybody was al -- naturally very happy, and celebrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Where were you on V-E day when -- when the war in Europe was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: V-E day was in May of ’45.</span> <span id="s665">Yeah, I was in -- in Hawaii, working hard, working about 12 - 14 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: What were your thoughts and reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, it’s finally over, but I -- I’m still not finished.</span> <span id="s668">I have to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: At the time of -- of V-E day, did you have any idea at that time again, any idea as to the extent of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I had the inclination because I believe I -- my wife did give me some -- some information about it in the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism while you were in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind about the war years that we haven’t discussed, that you’d like to talk about now, before we go to the postwar?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, nothing really.</span> <span id="s675">Nothing I -- which was special or anything, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s677">After you were discharged from the service, what did you do next?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well this I -- this I mentioned before, I -- when I got home and I opened up the letter from the war department, they offered me a professional position in the war department, continuing what I have done during my army service as a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Was there ever a time, any time in your life up until then, where you thought possibly of going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: I want to talk about some of the events that happened after World War II that were related to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s682">Did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I -- I followed it, just reading the papers, not -- not too much into detail, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Did you feel justice was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Did you follow the U.N. debates on the partition of Palestine?</span> <span id="s687">Was that something that was of interest to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did you have any reaction to the birth of the state of Israel in 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s691">Yes, I was very happy that the Jewish people have to -- have their own place and live their life, hopefully in peace.</span> <span id="s692">But th-things turned out differently, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial in the early 1960’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Just what was written in the paper, just pure curiosity.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: During all of these events, did you get a sense of how the American population was reacting to the Nuremberg trials and the partition of Palestine?</span> <span id="s696">Do you have any memories along those lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: You stayed in the military after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Oh, you sta -- in a related field, with the mapmaking --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Excuse me, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s703">You were in Washington during the Korean war and the war in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Do you have any thoughts about those events in American history?</span> <span id="s706">Any -- do you have any reaction or any thoughts about those events.</span> <span id="s707">Well, how did you feel about the wars at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Well, of course I was involved in -- in working on these areas and doing my best to -- to help the American soldier.</span> <span id="s709">Other -- otherwise no, I -- I don’t have any other reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: As a Jewish refugee, what was your reaction to the Civil Rights movement in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Well, I was very interested naturally, and I felt that it was about time that we forget the -- the fights among black and white or whatever color is involved.</span> <span id="s712">And after all, I personally feel that we all equal and deserve the same treatment regardless of color or religion or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: The 60’s were a very turbulent time in this country.</span> <span id="s714">Do you have any thoughts about some of the events of the 60’s, whether it was Civil Rights, or the Kennedy assassination or even the sexual revolution.</span> <span id="s715">An-Anything strike you as, you know, did anything strike home with you, based on your life experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: The only thing which disturbed me, and the -- what -- what -- which I personally feel caused the -- the 60’s to turn out the way they did is the drug revolution.</span> <span id="s717">I -- I personally believe that if not for the drugs, things would have been more normal than what they turned out then, and unfortunately continue today.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: I’d like you to tell me about your professional career over the years.</span> <span id="s719">Wa -- about your professional career.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Are you speaking of while I was working for the Department of Defense?</span> <span id="s721">Well, I continued to -- doing what I was doing in the service.</span> <span id="s722">Of course we were very busy regardless, whether there was no war, or -- or peace.</span> <span id="s723">We had our problem with the Soviet Union and with -- with the Eastern Bloc.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: I’m sorry, I have to interrupt you, we’re very close to the end of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Norbert Hilsberg.</span> <span id="s727">This is tape two, side B. And you were talking about the work that you were doing with the maps, with respect to the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well, it’s -- ma -- in my profession the war still continued as a civilian, and we were just as busy as we were during the war years, working long hours.</span> <span id="s729">We have all these problems like the Cuban crisis and the Bay of Pigs.</span> <span id="s730">And I was always involved in those activities.</span> <span id="s731">And kept us busy, it was very interesting work, very challenging work, tiring at times.</span> <span id="s732">And of course with the revoluti -- revolution of the computers, things became easier to handle, but yet, they were even more complicated than before.</span> <span id="s733">I personally was very pleased with -- with my life during that period.</span> <span id="s734">I feel that I accomplished a lot and I was also re-rewarded with nice reports.</span> <span id="s735">And -- and I continued climbing in the echelon of my office, and finally wound up as a -- in a staff position in the headquarters as a production e-engineer, and had additional responsibilities, was not involved in doing it myself but directing other people how to do it and what to do.</span> <span id="s736">And that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: You have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes, I have two daughters, four granddaughters and two great-granddaughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: What have you told your family about your childhood and your experiences in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Actually very little.</span> <span id="s741">We -- just lately my family has got more and more interested in my life and experiences, especially since I was asked to give this interview, they’re very an -- very anxious to listen to the results.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Has your view of religion, of Judaism changed since your days in Vienna?</span> <span id="s743">Are you more religious, less religious?</span> <span id="s744">Has anything changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I’m more conscious of being a Jew, and -- although I still don’t belong to any temple or synagogue.</span> <span id="s746">But I -- I do think more about it and I -- I feel a lot closer to my people.</span> <span id="s747">I feel it’s in -- in my age it’s a little bit too late, but I do my best.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Are you involved with any Holocaust related groups or institutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Well, I’m a member of the Holocaust Museum ever since it was established, even before -- before they started to build the museum itself.</span> <span id="s750">And I contributed some of my collections and I also contribute every year, as a member.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Do you or your wife do any work with the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Have you gone back to Vienna in the years since the war?</span> <span id="s754">A: Yeah, I went back three times.</span> <span id="s755">The first visit back since I left was in 1971 and believe me or not, we did not feel -- my wife and I, we didn’t feel too comfortable there.</span> <span id="s756">They -- they seemed to feel that th -- we’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s757">They did not go out of their way to help us or talk to us, give us service and so on.</span> <span id="s758">But I also must say that I left in ’38 and I came back in ’71, that the city itself has not changed a bit.</span> <span id="s759">Everything is the same.</span> <span id="s760">The streetcars are numbered, they go in the same places I’m used to, the buses, nothing has changed.</span> <span id="s761">And I was glad to see that, although the people were a little bit sour.</span> <span id="s762">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s763">Just because I was there, maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s764">But anyway, the second visit we had is when my granddaughter spent her college semester in -- in Florence, and we all visited then.</span> <span id="s765">And that was really a -- the best time I’ve had with my children and grandchildren, when we went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s766">We met them -- we visited the first -- well, we went to o -- Vienna first and then my daughter and her husband and their three daughters joined us in Vienna when they came up from Florence.</span> <span id="s767">And we spent eight days in Vienna and I took them through the whole city, and I took them to the elementary school where I used to go to.</span> <span id="s768">But -- this is the nice thing about Vienna is -- compared to the United States, they’d rather destroy and build new in the United States, but in Vienna they -- they’re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and maintain it properly.</span> <span id="s769">But anyway, [indecipherable] elementary school and my youngest granddaughter was a -- I think about seven or eight years old, and of course she just enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s770">I took her to the classroom where I was sitting for my -- my sec -- my second grade.</span> <span id="s771">And as a matter of fact it was a Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s772">Of course, school are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school on Saturday, so we just arrived there when the children left, and I was waiting until they are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the school building.</span> <span id="s773">And in the classroom, one of the classroom the teacher was still there and says, I told her, but she just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s774">She couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s775">And I took her to the apartment where we used to live and of course that was a really high moment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so interested in seeing where I grew up.</span> <span id="s776">And -- and the third time was in 1990.</span> <span id="s777">We took a talk tour to ma -- eastern Europe and we wound up in Vienna for the third time.</span> <span id="s778">And as a matter of fact, I did visit Auschwitz when I was in Poland and it was devastating really, even now.</span> <span id="s779">And I was in Kraków and I was in [indecipherable] Budapest and then I would up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s780">And in those -- as a matter of fact, I didn’t mention that in the second visit to Vienna with my family, I -- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as being a visitor there.</span> <span id="s781">People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant and it was almost like being in any other city in the United States, really.</span> <span id="s782">But if course, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally.</span> <span id="s783">And bif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same.</span> <span id="s784">I enjoyed it while I was there for about three days.</span> <span id="s785">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: I had asked you before, and I’ll -- I’ll ask you this again, maybe I can get a -- a different perspective.</span> <span id="s787">During the war you didn’t realize the full impact of the genocide.</span> <span id="s788">When did you realize just what you had escaped, what you -- you know, by leaving when you did?</span> <span id="s789">When did you get the full impact of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Unfortunately, I lost all my family in Poland.</span> <span id="s791">Had family in Warsaw, had family in Lódz, I had family in Kraków, I had family in Belgrade, and they were all gone.</span> <span id="s792">I tried to -- as a matter of fact, i -- bef-before -- and let’s see, it was -- must have been in the 50’s, yes, it was in the 50’s, my father -- I don’t remember how he found out that the cousin of mine from the family in Warsaw survived.</span> <span id="s793">And he is in -- he was in Paris, he lived in Paris and my father got in touch with him and tried to bring him over to the States.</span> <span id="s794">He was married at that time already.</span> <span id="s795">And -- but in turn his wife found out that her father survived -- I don’t -- I think it was Auschwitz, and lived in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s796">So naturally they decided that they’re going to Tel Aviv rather than come to the United States.</span> <span id="s797">And so at least found out that one survivor.</span> <span id="s798">Then, a second survivor I found out is -- I -- I -- I -- throughout the years, since that time, up until the -- this moment, I tried to find out what happened to them, and I got in touch with the international Red Cross.</span> <span id="s799">And through them I found out that my uncle, who lived -- they lived in Lódz, he died in the ghetto, Lódz ghetto.</span> <span id="s800">But my aunt and their son wound up in Auschwitz, and of course, unfortunately my -- my -- my aunt -- my aunt, she just didn’t survive the camp in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s801">But my cousin, who was then in his late teens, they sent him to Dachau.</span> <span id="s802">And I found out through the Red Cross that he was liberated in Dachau and they gave me all the information available, but they could not find out for me what happened after he was liberated.</span> <span id="s803">And I’m still trying to -- to locate and find out what happened to him, but no luck so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Did any of your childhood friends from Vienna survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I have a dear friend, we grew up together in high school and through our late -- latter years.</span> <span id="s806">He came to philadel -- Philadelphia too, shortly after I arrived there.</span> <span id="s807">And once in awhile he -- he goes -- he went back to Vienna more often.</span> <span id="s808">Now, he was half Jewish and he was half Catholic.</span> <span id="s809">So he had the easier rap -- rapport with the people -- with our school friends, and he saw some of them and -- and he found out that some died during the war, were killed during the war and other survived and they just make a bare living, which I don’t really care about the ones who survived, truthfully, as far as I’m concerned, even though I didn't have any bad experiences during our time in school, they were -- they were fine.</span> <span id="s810">It’s very possible that they -- they felt bad about it, too, but after all, they had to survive, and they had to do whatever they had to do.</span> <span id="s811">I do have one experience myself.</span> <span id="s812">The first -- first visit in Vienna, I noticed that a school friend of mine in high school, he was the -- the son of one of the big precision instrument stores in Vienna.</span> <span id="s813">And when he came back, his -- the -- his -- his father’s store was located nearby where I lived, where I grew up, so we came by and I noticed the name -- same name still on there, so I figured must be the son who is in business.</span> <span id="s814">And so just of curiosity I walked in.</span> <span id="s815">He was a Gentile.</span> <span id="s816">And I walked in and I w -- I recognized him immediately, and he was busy with a customer so I stood on the side waiting until he was finished.</span> <span id="s817">No sooner the customer walked out, he turns around, he says, Norbert, where have you been?</span> <span id="s818">Where have you been; that -- that hit me.</span> <span id="s819">He should have known.</span> <span id="s820">But anyway, well he welcomed me and -- back, and let’s get together.</span> <span id="s821">And I said, I’m sorry, I -- it’s my last day and I wanted to show my wife some other things.</span> <span id="s822">So that -- that -- that was my personal experience going back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Did any of your Jewish school friends survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I really -- I hope they did, but I have no -- no contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: When you look back on your life in the United States, what would you say has been your biggest disappointment in the United States, or what has been your best surprise about life in America, or both.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: We have no disappointment really.</span> <span id="s827">And it’s accentuated what I always thought about the United States, because my original plans is -- of course, Hitler helped me -- my original plans was to -- to go to the United States and live there anyway.</span> <span id="s828">So I just -- just assimilated immediately, just like I -- I always lived in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: September of -- of last year, September 11 -- nine-11, given your life experience, how did you see that event and how do you see life in America today?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well, Americans unfortunately, that’s one thing I -- oh, anyway, I was going to say, Americans forget too easily, and I feel that we are -- little by little we -- we forget about September 11th, 2001.</span> <span id="s831">And I was very, very disturbed about what happened that day, and I just -- I still can’t believe that we have people in this world who -- who do such things in a civilized society.</span> <span id="s832">I -- as far as I’m concerned they’re the scum of the earth</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: One or two more questions.</span> <span id="s834">Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you would like to add?</span> <span id="s835">I mean, you didn’t tell me much about your parents after they came here.</span> <span id="s836">Would you like to talk about your parents a little bit and how they managed here?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: All right.</span> <span id="s838">My parents settled in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s839">My father tried to get into -- back into the banking business, but he was not very successful at that time, I don’t know why, but at that time I guess, they just said they didn’t hire anybody and maybe -- maybe his English was not too good, I have no idea, or the -- they both spoke pretty well.</span> <span id="s840">So -- but he was always a very handy man.</span> <span id="s841">He made furniture and I built radios with him.</span> <span id="s842">And so he found himself a position in a -- during the war, he found himself a position in a naval ordinance factory in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s843">And he worked himself up to an inspector.</span> <span id="s844">And he worked hard.</span> <span id="s845">He had to get up early to get the subway to Brooklyn, and came home and he was tired.</span> <span id="s846">But he made a nice living.</span> <span id="s847">And of course my mother started to give piano lessons and she was very successful in that, throughout the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did you ever sing professionally after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No.</span> <span id="s850">I -- I do remember during our stay in north Africa, in that little town of Cherchell -- no, no, I’m sorry, not to Cherchell, it was Affrevielle.</span> <span id="s851">During the -- we -- we became very friendly there, mostly Jewish -- Jewish families living in that little town who escaped from the mainland.</span> <span id="s852">And we have quite -- we had a few Jewish fellows in our outfit and we became friendly with these people.</span> <span id="s853">They -- they invited us for Friday night Shabbas and Saturday and went to the synagogue, and -- but we also helped the people, the local people celebrate Easter.</span> <span id="s854">And so one of my close buddies, he played the piano, so he played the organ in the church, they didn't have any organist there.</span> <span id="s855">And I sang the Ave Maria.</span> <span id="s856">And well, we made the local people very happy, and I enjoyed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And you are retired now?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Now, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s860">Wh-What’s still in store for you?</span> <span id="s861">What yet would you like to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Well, first of all, celebrate my 80th -- 88th birthday and secondly and most important, cel-celebrate my 60th anniversary, which is only a few -- couple -- two or three weeks away from now.</span> <span id="s863">And hopefully, hopefully I -- I will enjoy to see my great-grandchildren grow up.</span> <span id="s864">Maybe I’ll see them in school yet.</span> <span id="s865">I -- I hope so.</span> <span id="s866">I do my best.</span> <span id="s867">They -- they keep me alive, they keep me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: I want to thank you and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Norbert Hilsberg.</span> <span id="s869">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
