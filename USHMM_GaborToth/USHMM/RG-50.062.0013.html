here.</span> <span id="s18">I am second generation Japanese American.</span> <span id="s19">My parents were Nissei, they were Japanese citizens.</span> <span id="s20">I was 24 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked.</span> <span id="s21">I was drafted into the army a few months before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s22">The Commander told us Japanese Americans that we were related to Japan and couldn't be trusted.</span> <span id="s23">Nevertheless we served like other nationalities.</span> <span id="s24">I did not feel good about it but we were in the army of our country.</span> <span id="s25">We were there to serve and we adjusted like anyone else.</span> <span id="s26">I felt I was an American like anyone else.</span> <span id="s27">I did not speak to my parents about this during or after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">I went to a Japanese school.</span> <span id="s29">It was not anti-American.</span> <span id="s30">Japanese Americans in the service were sent to the islands to serve.</span> <span id="s31">They did not hire Japanese Americans to serve in Pearl Harbor in the military installations but after the war they did.</span> <span id="s32">They needed men.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">I trained in Camp Shelby, Mississippi and in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s34">I went to a relocation camp to visit a friend and did not like what I saw, barbed wire fence, machine guns.</span> <span id="s35">My friend worked as a Japanese schoolteacher and was taken to a relocation camp.</span> <span id="s36">My parents were plantation workers and were not bothered.</span> <span id="s37">Anyone connected with Japan was picked up and put in a relocation camp.</span> <span id="s38">I did not like it.</span> <span id="s39">I talked to some people about it.</span> <span id="s40">I feel that people should be compensated for their losses and some sort of apology should be given to them.</span> <span id="s41">Redress should go through court and through Congress.</span> <span id="s42">It is wrong and nothing like that should happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">This was done under the law.</span> <span id="s44">.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">When I finished training, I served in Italy and France.</span> <span id="s46">I did not experience any discrimination in Mississippi.</span> <span id="s47">Once on a bus a 1st Lt. , Black, came on the bus on his way home.</span> <span id="s48">The white driver stopped and told him to get on the back of the bus.</span> <span id="s49">A white private could sit anywhere.</span> <span id="s50">He went to the back and said nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">One time a black soldier who was going home on furlough, got on a bus, the bus driver hit home, kicked him out of the bus and used a blackjack to hit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">The police wagon came and picked him up and the other bus drivers came up and shook his hand and congratulated him.</span> <span id="s53">Nobody did anything, white or black soldiers, or they would get the same.</span> <span id="s54">We were treated like white soldiers.</span> <span id="s55">.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">They called us Japs and there were a few fights.</span> <span id="s57">As a Japanese American I saw discrimination against blacks.</span> <span id="s58">White soldiers did nothing.</span> <span id="s59">If I interfered I would get the same treatment.</span> <span id="s60">As long as I did not do anything I felt they would treat me right.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">American troops called us Japs, you were an American soldier and you accepted.</span> <span id="s62">You should be equal since we were going to fight the same people.</span> <span id="s63">I do not have any trouble in Hawaii with</span></p> <p><span id="s64">discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">I became aware of the Holocaust through newspapers.</span> <span id="s66">Films and TV reports of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s67">I was really surprised that anything like this could happen.</span> <span id="s68">My daughter went to Dachau on the way back from Israel and told us what she saw.</span> <span id="s69">Something like this should never happen again.</span> <span id="s70">We try to attend the annual Holocaust Memorial services.</span> <span id="s71">This issue should be alive so that it will not happen again.</span> <span id="s72">Something like that could happen again unless it is kept alive.</span> <span id="s73">People should know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Five years ago we started going to the Holocaust Memorial Service at the Temple.</span> <span id="s75">I feel that by going, more people will be aware of what happened and it won't happen again.</span> <span id="s76">I do not discuss this too much with my friends.</span> <span id="s77">If they are interested I will discuss it with them.</span> <span id="s78">I do not know if my Japanese American friends know I attend</span></p> <p><span id="s79">the services.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">When my daughter was in high school, she always talked about going to Israel.</span> <span id="s81">After graduation from the University of Hawaii I gave her permission to go to the Hebrew University.</span> <span id="s82">I felt if she wanted that experience, she should have it.</span> <span id="s83">When asked if she was Jewish, her replied no she is Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">To prevent the Holocaust from happening again I attend the Memorial Service to keep it alive.</span> <span id="s85">I learned about the Holocaust more from TV than from reading about it.</span> <span id="s86">Something has to be done so it will not happen again.</span> <span id="s87">In University of Hawaii my daughter studied Hebrew and then attended Hebrew University.</span> <span id="s88">She admired the Jewish people and their achievements.</span> <span id="s89">I am not too sure why she is so interested in the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">With regard to the relocation camps in America.</span> <span id="s91">I told my family about these camps.</span> <span id="s92">My daughter had a Jewish friend who was a West Point graduate and she brought him to the house.</span> <span id="s93">We talked about the Jewish military and Entibe and how they have to keep themselves in top shape, surrounded as they are by unfriendly nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">In the Kibbutz where my daughter is there are students from all over the world.</span> <span id="s95">She is not the only Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">I believe that those who were relocated to camps in the U.S. should be recompensed and the government should apologize to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">I entered the Army shortly before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s98">I took training in Shelby, Miss. and Mc Crory.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">END.</span></p></body></html>
