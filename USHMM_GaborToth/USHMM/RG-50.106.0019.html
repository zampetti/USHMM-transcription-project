id="s43">And my father at one time I think it was 1932 my father was arrested for spying for the United States because or was it 1933?</span> <span id="s44">Just when Hitler came to power, I think.</span> <span id="s45">Because a rabbi a tourist from the United States came to visit my father in the synagogue and he was arrested.</span> <span id="s46">And I see it right now.</span> <span id="s47">I still can see it.</span> <span id="s48">We could see, from our upstairs window, his cell across the street.</span> <span id="s49">And we waved at each other.</span> <span id="s50">This is what I remember.</span> <span id="s51">He was released because they couldn't find anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: After how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: After just a few days.</span> <span id="s54">And of course the heat on the Jews so I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s55">We moved to Speyer, which actually this is the town I grew up.</span> <span id="s56">We lived under conditions which were actually I had no problem because I was a blond little Jewish kid, and I played with all the gentiles.</span> <span id="s57">Now my brother looked like a not like a blond, he was dark.</span> <span id="s58">And he was not liked by his peers.</span> <span id="s59">He had all kinds of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: His nonJewish peers?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: His nonJewish peers where he went to school.</span> <span id="s62">This went on until 1935.</span> <span id="s63">Now, in 1935 when these laws came to came about where we couldn't go to public schools anymore, my father became my teacher.</span> <span id="s64">And we had a small what it's called what is it?</span> <span id="s65">Parochial school or private school, Jewish, above the synagogue.</span> <span id="s66">A oneroom school, what about 25 kids from grade 1 1 to 7 or 8th grade what they call here.</span> <span id="s67">And things became a little bad for the Jews already then.</span> <span id="s68">Like markings on the walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Saying what?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Saying: Juden raus.</span> <span id="s71">Like I was sent out, because I was a blond kid, to buy butter which we are not allowed to buy enough.</span> <span id="s72">We were only allowed to I think a quarter pound of butter.</span> <span id="s73">And we couldn't have a maid anymore.</span> <span id="s74">And</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You were 10 years old at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Do you remember how you felt, what some of your thoughts were as a 10yearold boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: As a 10yearold boy I was amazed by the parades by the Nazis when they walked down the streets.</span> <span id="s79">And I have talked to other people in the same situation that were my age, and they felt the same way.</span> <span id="s80">It was for for a 10yearold, the music, the parades, the marching and the things were exciting.</span> <span id="s81">I didn't know the impact, what it really was.</span> <span id="s82">I believe and I tell this to a lot of school children today that I was much more innocent as a 10yearold than the 10yearold as of today in 1995.</span> <span id="s83">And I had no problem personally.</span> <span id="s84">Yes, we couldn't do certain things.</span> <span id="s85">We couldn't shop at certain times, we weren't allowed to go out at night.</span> <span id="s86">It didn't bother me because I was a kid, I had to go to school the next day.</span> <span id="s87">Now my father was he was in charge of a nursing home in Neustadt.</span> <span id="s88">And he was on Sunday mornings he made his rounds on bicycle and I went with him to the little bitty towns outside where there was just a handful of Jews.</span> <span id="s89">And he did, what you call here, Sunday school.</span> <span id="s90">Now this went on really with no problem.</span> <span id="s91">However, 1938, my bar mitzvah</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Okay, we'll get to that in a moment.</span> <span id="s93">Did your mother work?</span></p>

was three years older, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Three years older than you, yeah.</span> <span id="s100">And you said you had before 1938 nonJewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yeah, I had.</span> <span id="s102">He didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: He didn't, right.</span> <span id="s104">Did you have any hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Soccer.</span> <span id="s106">I was a great soccer player as a kid.</span> <span id="s107">Sports were my hobbies.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And you played again with nonJewish</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah, I played with nonJewish kids.</span> <span id="s110">I went out to the local soccer club or whatever it was and I watched them.</span> <span id="s111">Nobody bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you belong to any youth groups at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s115">Obviously you had a religious family life, your father being who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Right.</span> <span id="s117">And actually it didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s118">It didn't touch me personally.</span> <span id="s119">I know what was going on but I was a happylucky kid anyway.</span> <span id="s120">It didn't bother me until 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s122">Now comes 1938 and it's your bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s123">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, it was supposed to be bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s125">On the 19th of November however, 19th of November didn't exist anymore because it was wiped out by the burning of the synagogues during Kristallnacht, which I remember well.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What do you remember about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I do remember that I was excited.</span> <span id="s128">Because I didn't know my portion, and I should have shown my portion a long time ago.</span> <span id="s129">And this is not it's not really funny.</span> <span id="s130">It's 13yearold boy who looks forward to his bar mitzvah and the presents are coming.</span> <span id="s131">The arrangements are made.</span> <span id="s132">It's supposed to be a huge bar mitzvah because I was the last one, my brother had his three years before.</span> <span id="s133">And his bar mitzvah, we had no problem.</span> <span id="s134">The family came, we were in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s135">It was you know, 1935 in April.</span> <span id="s136">So there was really no problem then.</span> <span id="s137">Mine, of course, never took place.</span> <span id="s138">On the night of the 9th of November the November 8th was my birthday on my birthday I received a brand new bicycle.</span> <span id="s139">And they hung up the bicycle in the</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Not in the courtyard, the bay window.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you live in an house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: We lived in an apartment, a threestory building.</span> <span id="s144">We lived there.</span> <span id="s145">And actually we lived on two floors.</span> <span id="s146">But it was hanging in the bay window.</span> <span id="s147">I was not allowed to ride this bicycle until I know my portion.</span> <span id="s148">And boy, did I start studying.</span> <span id="s149">And 9th of November I heard the sirens.</span> <span id="s150">I see the flames, which the synagogue was about corresponding to one block away from us, and the flames.</span> <span id="s151">My mother and father said we should go in the basement, because we heard all the noise in the streets, not to go into the bay window to look out into the street.</span> <span id="s152">It was the main street of Speyer.</span> <span id="s153">The Jewish butcher was across the street.</span> <span id="s154">The people by the name of Kauffman had a store two doors down.</span> <span id="s155">And we heard all the noise.</span> <span id="s156">We I really didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s157">But we went down in the basement.</span> <span id="s158">And my father was very excited because at the moment we didn't know it was just the synagogue or more.</span> <span id="s159">He did get a phone call from a colleague that the synagogue is burning in Mannheim.</span> <span id="s160">So he probably knew.</span> <span id="s161">That's what he told us later.</span> <span id="s162">Then came two gestapo men to the door and asked: (?</span> <span id="s163">alera?)</span> <span id="s164">will you come with us and take one of your boys with you.</span> <span id="s165">My father chose me to go with him.</span> <span id="s166">And we went down to the gestapo headquarters, just down the street a piece.</span> <span id="s167">And well, we were assembled.</span> <span id="s168">It was cold, November, about 80 people.</span> <span id="s169">We were shoved in a truck, bus type, wall to wall people.</span> <span id="s170">And hold all night and wound up in the camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s171">How that part how we got there exactly I don't remember too well because I was a kid.</span> <span id="s172">I was lying on the floor, may I was asleep.</span> <span id="s173">When we got there we were separated from the adults and stayed in the barracks with youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Who made up the group of people coming from your town to Dachau?</span> <span id="s175">Who else?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: The Jewish men.</span> <span id="s177">Only men, only males.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: And what about the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: There was a few children.</span> <span id="s180">There was a young man by the name of a young man, my age, a classmate of mine by the name of Eddy Adler, which I understand survived the holocaust.</span> <span id="s181">And</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What were your thoughts when you and your father were being taken away by the gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, you know the word "Dachau" was feared.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you know what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: I knew it was a prison, because it was used as a prison at that time.</span> <span id="s186">There was no extermination camp, there was no death camp, there was no such thing then.</span> <span id="s187">It was a prison.</span> <span id="s188">I found out it's more than a prison.</span> <span id="s189">That the Jews were of course herded.</span> <span id="s190">Not led, they were herded.</span> <span id="s191">They were pushed.</span> <span id="s192">And we had to take a shower and the kids were separated from the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What did your father say to you before you were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: "Nobody is going to harm you.</span> <span id="s195">Don't worry."</span> <span id="s196">He had faith.</span> <span id="s197">My father was a soldier in the First World War for the Germans.</span> <span id="s198">And he told me that, don't worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What language did you all speak at home?</span></p> <p><span

less that no harm will come.</span> <span id="s205">I was with a bunch of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: About your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: About my age no, a little older.</span> <span id="s208">I was one of the younger ones.</span> <span id="s209">There were up to about 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s210">We were not allowed to talk to each other.</span> <span id="s211">I had to do a job, which was clean the latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did you bring anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah, we were allowed to bring some overnight change.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Of clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Of clothes.</span> <span id="s216">We did not use we didn't have to wear a uniform or anything, we wore our own clothes.</span> <span id="s217">We had to take a shower and we were shaved, I remember.</span> <span id="s218">Because Jews have lice.</span> <span id="s219">That was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Your whole body was shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No, just</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Just the hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: And</span></p> <p><span

on, what's going I haven't done anything.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't know the impact of what it was.</span> <span id="s229">Maybe my father knew more than I did, but I had no problem.</span></p>

father never laid a hand on me.</span> <span id="s240">My mother beat the heck out of me.</span> <span id="s241">But I guess I was a what do you call it?</span> <span id="s242">What was I called?</span> <span id="s243">Spitz poop.</span> <span id="s244">You know what that is?</span> <span id="s245">Well, whatever it is, it's like a it's like Dennis the Menace type.</span></p> <p><span

remember was that you were not allowed to look up, you're supposed to bow your head down.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did that upset you?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I questioned it because I knew what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Hope, look up to I knew that but we had no problem.</span> <span id="s259">Some kids got beat up because they didn't behave themselves and talked back to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s260">I know one kid got beat up with the butt of a gun.</span> <span id="s261">We weren't allowed to pick him up.</span> <span id="s262">I still see that kid laying there.</span> <span id="s263">And the soldiers took him away, the guards, and he never came back.</span> <span id="s264">So I really don't know who he was or what happened.</span> <span id="s265">Like the soldiers said: Let that be a lesson to you.</span> <span id="s266">And we slept on wooden planks with filthy straw or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Were you wearing a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I did not have to wear a star there.</span> <span id="s269">I was supposed to wear the star I remember.</span> <span id="s270">I never wore it.</span> <span id="s271">I hated that thing.</span> <span id="s272">I was blond, I wanted to be look German.</span> <span id="s273">But we were liberated, we were freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: After how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I think it was the first week of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: So you were there for two or three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s278">I think it was about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And did you have a specific job?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yeah, cleaning the latrine.</span> <span id="s281">That was my job.</span> <span id="s282">Under guard.</span> <span id="s283">Three guys standing, watching me washing.</span> <span id="s284">But my father, I met my father and we were both released.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Had you had any contact with him during</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: those few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Was that very frightening to be without him?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s291">I asked questions and almost wasn't allowed to speak.</span> <span id="s292">You know.</span> <span id="s293">And the other kids the same thing, because we whispered at night.</span> <span id="s294">And they had their fathers too.</span> <span id="s295">But who would think that any harm can you know, you don't kill outright like this?</span> <span id="s296">In fact, now history proves that Hitler did not kill in 1938.</span> <span id="s297">Yes, a few that persisted.</span> <span id="s298">I met my father and we were released.</span> <span id="s299">In fact, we were driven home in a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: By?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: By SR.</span> <span id="s302">Because my father was put in charge of keeping the area left of the mine river of the Rhine River Judenfrei, free, rid of Jews, especially children.</span> <span id="s303">Now history will tell me why this was done, because the Jews were all spies for the French and the English and the British and because Hitler already started working on the war with friends, you know, that this was on the border of France and Germany.</span> <span id="s304">This I found out later.</span> <span id="s305">Anyway, we came home and there was nothing in the house.</span> <span id="s306">My bicycle was gone.</span> <span id="s307">My bar mitzvah did not take place.</span> <span id="s308">I didn't care about if I knew my portion or not, I wanted my bicycle.</span> <span id="s309">No kid got a new bicycle.</span> <span id="s310">That bicycle was really that was in me for a long time.</span> <span id="s311">And I hated the Nazis for that bicycle.</span> <span id="s312">That was the thing.</span> <span id="s313">So here we are, a somebody downstairs told my father where my mother and my brother were.</span> <span id="s314">And they were with a taxi cab driver at the outside of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: NonJewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: NonJewish.</span> <span id="s317">I don't remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Were there nonJews in your building, neighbors in your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s320">But they didn't react.</span> <span id="s321">They didn't want to be seen period.</span> <span id="s322">They knew we were coming back but they had no they didn't want to talk.</span> <span id="s323">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s324">We met my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s325">And then my father and my mother were put in charge by the gestapo to conduct Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s326">You know what I'm talking about?</span> <span id="s327">To France, Belgium, Holland.</span> <span id="s328">And I was put on a train going to France.</span> <span id="s329">I think it was the 16th of December 1938 with 80, 100 kids.</span> <span id="s330">And my brother was put on a train to Switzerland and we were separated.</span> <span id="s331">And I went to Strasbourg first.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your leaving your family then.</span> <span id="s333">What was that like for you?</span> <span id="s334">A young boy to have to leave your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I didn't think much of it because I was promised that: We'll see you soon.</span> <span id="s336">We're going back and forth.</span> <span id="s337">At that time they had to move to Mannheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: My parents, on the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s340">How my father survived financially I really don't know.</span> <span id="s341">All I know is when he came to France delivering more children to (?</span> <span id="s342">Baron/Mayer?)</span> <span id="s343">Rothschild and I remember exactly because I was put in the seminary at the Ecole (?</span> <span id="s344">Mymoni?)</span> <span id="s345">and the Ecole (?</span> <span id="s346">Rabbinic?)</span> <span id="s347">to become what my father was.</span> <span id="s348">And he came to visit us.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Can you describe the trip with the children on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Happy.</span> <span id="s351">We had a ball.</span> <span id="s352">The kids didn't none of the kids you asked me the question, what parents if they missed their parents.</span> <span id="s353">This was like going to a Camp (?</span> <span id="s354">Lama?)</span> <span id="s355">to on vacation.</span> <span id="s356">Remember, it's school time.</span> <span id="s357">School, we were supposed to be in school, right?</span> <span id="s358">The kids loved it and I did too.</span> <span id="s359">And then I was put in the seminary.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Were there leaders on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s362">My mother was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Oh, you were with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Oh, my mother was the chaperon and there were other people.</span> <span id="s365">I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s366">But I knew my mother and my father were in charge of many transports.</span> <span id="s367">They went back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Oh, so they also went on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: They went on the train.</span> <span id="s370">See, I had so many coincidences in my life, that I was put in that seminary and I had contact with my parents, because they came, delivered kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And would go back and</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: And would go back.</span> <span id="s373">My father went (?</span> <span id="s374">sloring?)</span> <span id="s375">at the Rothschild's.</span> <span id="s376">He took me with him.</span> <span id="s377">And I remember the Place de le Concord where his it's not a chateau, it's just a mansion.</span> <span id="s378">And he I had to wait outside, I couldn't go inside.</span> <span id="s379">My father came back smiling.</span> <span id="s380">He got some money and he was happy that he could go back and get more kids.</span> <span id="s381">So this went back and forth.</span> <span id="s382">I was all right because I knew where my parents were and my parents knew where I was.</span> <span id="s383">Until of course September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s384">I always said there is fate in love, coincidences.</span> <span id="s385">The day the war was declared my father and my mother were in France.</span> <span id="s386">They couldn't go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: In France with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: They were.</span> <span id="s389">They happened to deliver kids and couldn't go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Where you were, they were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, I was in school.</span> <span id="s392">It was a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Where was the boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: At the in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: And I lived there.</span> <span id="s397">Where were my parents?</span> <span id="s398">They had to live in a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: But in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: In Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Okay, so they were in the same city?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: They were in the same city.</span> <span id="s403">However, we had to register as German citizens living in France while France is at war with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I always tell this to children and tell the teachers here, the same thing as the Japanese were interned in 1940, '41.</span> <span id="s406">So the day we had to register the kids were not put in camp, my father and my mother were put in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s408">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: My father and my mother were in a camp.</span> <span id="s410">My mother was in (?</span> <span id="s411">Bourse?)</span> <span id="s412">.</span> <span id="s413">I don't know the exact date when she went to Bourse.</span> <span id="s414">My father was put in a camp called (?</span> <span id="s415">sejour man labour?)</span> <span id="s416">, which was not a bad camp.</span> <span id="s417">Now when the Germans came and invaded France we ran and, as you know, maybe you should know</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: "We" being?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: We</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Your mother, your father and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No.</span> <span id="s422">We know now we, all of us know that there was an organization, the security (foreign language spoken) which is the (?</span> <span id="s423">OA OSE?)</span> <span id="s424">which was the highest of France, who helped children, which I was put in a what do you call it?</span> <span id="s425">A children home away from the northern part.</span> <span id="s426">When the Germans came, we had to run out.</span> <span id="s427">And we went outside of Limoges, in a castle.</span> <span id="s428">This is a new picture for this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: That was not with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I was not with my parents ever again until after the war with my mother.</span> <span id="s431">I knew that my father was in that camp and it wasn't very far.</span> <span id="s432">We visit him.</span> <span id="s433">Two kids went from this children home, walked over to (?</span> <span id="s434">Saint Jomai?)</span> <span id="s435">, which was about at that time 8, 10 kilometers.</span> <span id="s436">And because we could correspond actually with him.</span> <span id="s437">He knew where I was.</span> <span id="s438">However, we weren't allowed to go back.</span> <span id="s439">They kept us.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: At your father's camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah, in (Saint Jomai?)</span> <span id="s442">.</span> <span id="s443">Well, we didn't like it.</span> <span id="s444">The French were the keepers of the camp and not the Germans.</span> <span id="s445">And the next day we got out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Under the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s448">We had to go back to the home, and we did.</span> <span id="s449">I don't know if they let us go or what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What were the conditions like in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: They were not bad.</span> <span id="s452">There were barracks, there were there was Jewish life even there.</span> <span id="s453">There was it seems like everybody wore a head cover and had their own clothes.</span> <span id="s454">And they complained about the food of course because they couldn't eat kosher.</span> <span id="s455">And I think my father made the decision for people: Eat what you can what you want.</span> <span id="s456">A lot of people didn't want to eat it.</span> <span id="s457">But, you know, like now you look back and you think, what's the big deal?</span> <span id="s458">They never came back, they were all delivered to the Germans later on.</span> <span id="s459">Well, my father from what I know now, I was in that home, my father was in that camp in Saint Jomai, my mother was in (?</span> <span id="s460">Geurs?)</span> <span id="s461">, I was alone in the world, and the Germans invaded all of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">(Tape changed)</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: This is tape 1, side B. Continue, you were talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: And now I was alone in the world with a bunch of kids.</span> <span id="s465">And these kids who were sponsored actually by the this organization.</span> <span id="s466">In 1988 we had a reunion.</span> <span id="s467">There was supposed to be 4,000 kids that were sponsored by this organization.</span> <span id="s468">It took about 10 years to find them but unfortunately they only found 175.</span> <span id="s469">We met in Los Angeles in 1988.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What was it like living in this home?</span> <span id="s471">Was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: In the home there was enough food.</span> <span id="s473">The Germans came this was just when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s474">This was disbanded then because _ .</span> <span id="s475">And I went out in the from Limoges I went I knew my mother was in (?</span> <span id="s476">Geurs?)</span> <span id="s477">But I was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Who caught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: The French.</span> <span id="s480">And put me in Geurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: You were by yourself when they caught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No.</span> <span id="s483">We were about oh, 20 or 30.</span> <span id="s484">I don't remember their names exactly, who they were, because they didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: These are 30 children?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s487">I looked for them.</span> <span id="s488">And I ask at that reunion: Who was with me?</span> <span id="s489">And one fellow said he was caught but taken to what was the name of that camp?</span> <span id="s490">But anyway, he went to</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: A different camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: He was delivered to the Germans, to Auschwitz, to (?</span> <span id="s493">Transi?)</span> <span id="s494">and so on and but he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So you were taken to Geurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I was in Geurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Did you speak French?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: How did you know French?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Well, I was in the seminary and it was all in French.</span> <span id="s501">And</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: So you learned when you came to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I had no problem learning the language.</span> <span id="s504">In fact, I became a French citizen later on.</span> <span id="s505">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s506">Who cared?</span> <span id="s507">But, again, I was alone in the world.</span> <span id="s508">I couldn't even ask where my mother was.</span> <span id="s509">At that time my gosh, I was 17 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: What month was this?</span> <span id="s511">Do you know when you got to Geurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: The fall, I think it was October.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: '42, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I was there until the Germans came and the French really let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What did you do at Geurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s519">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s520">I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s521">I had no clothes.</span> <span id="s522">They gave you clothes.</span> <span id="s523">I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s524">The French got it us and they had to do their job.</span> <span id="s525">They were polite.</span> <span id="s526">I had no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did you have enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No.</span> <span id="s529">Never.</span> <span id="s530">I mean food was a matter of what we have.</span> <span id="s531">Ovaltine, yuck.</span> <span id="s532">And a bowl of soup at night and a slice of bread in a bucket.</span> <span id="s533">And I had no work to do, just clean your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: In the barracks.</span> <span id="s536">There was it was like an army cot.</span> <span id="s537">It wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s538">That part was not bad.</span> <span id="s539">The bad part came later when I was when the Germans came and we ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: "We" being?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: We, the children.</span> <span id="s542">We were not with adults, there was a separate area.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did not see your mother in Geurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: You did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s547">I ask and they didn't know or didn't want to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: How upsetting was that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I was more worried about my father because I felt I was safe here in Geurs.</span> <span id="s550">But my father, where the heck is he?</span> <span id="s551">Then I found out that he was in (?</span> <span id="s552">Limile?)</span> <span id="s553">, which was a camp.</span> <span id="s554">He had a visa to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s555">All the I don't know what you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Paperwork?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: No, transition camp to go away.</span> <span id="s558">But the Germans came of course and the French delivered them.</span> <span id="s559">They wanted to deliver my mother too.</span> <span id="s560">My mother had a stroke.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: In Geurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: In Geurs.</span> <span id="s563">They left her for dead and she survived.</span> <span id="s564">How she survived, I don't know.</span> <span id="s565">I tell you how I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You're now running with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I'm running from A to Z in the Alps.</span> <span id="s568">And we were told: Go to the Alps, the Italians are occupying that part, they're not as bad as the Germans, on the east side of France.</span> <span id="s569">I got to Geurs.</span> <span id="s570">Here's the amazing stretch to Geurs.</span> <span id="s571">To the town of (?</span> <span id="s572">Sheer?)</span> <span id="s573">near Grenoble and where I was I have no idea how I got there, how I made contact with that woman that was part of the French underground.</span> <span id="s574">And she told I think there was about six or seven.</span> <span id="s575">I was the youngest one.</span> <span id="s576">But one at a time we'll take the streetcar kids don't know what a streetcar is anymore today and the little train to go at the end of the line in Bourgd'Oisans near Bourgd'Oisans, you know how to spell it?</span> <span id="s577">Bourgd'oisans and the to go join the French underground.</span> <span id="s578">I, one morning, was told she gave me what they call a (?</span> <span id="s579">peckla?)</span> <span id="s580">a bag made out of a blanket and put clothes in there and stuff.</span> <span id="s581">Gave it to me and said: Go to the streetcar, here's some money for the streetcar, and we go to the end of the line, you will be greeted by people that will take care of you.</span> <span id="s582">When I got on the streetcar, sure enough a mile down the road or a kilometer the Germans came and stopped the train for identification cards I did not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Did you have any ID on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s585">I listened to the Germans because I understood German, what they want.</span> <span id="s586">They had their own interpreter who spoke to the conductor, the driver of the streetcar.</span> <span id="s587">There's a platform in front and then there's the cab and the door which the passengers sit.</span> <span id="s588">And I was standing on there because I was always interested how this thing works.</span> <span id="s589">And the German said to the driver no, he asked me if I have in French, if I have identification card.</span> <span id="s590">Before I could answer, the driver said: He's my apprentice, he doesn't have a card yet.</span> <span id="s591">That saved my life once.</span> <span id="s592">I went up in the end he was part of the underground too, the driver, from what we found out later.</span> <span id="s593">And I tell you that at the end of my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: So they believed him when he said</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s596">Oh, no anyway</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: They believed him when he</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: They believed him because I forgot to tell you this.</span> <span id="s599">They asked me to drive the streetcar.</span> <span id="s600">Have I learned to drive the streetcar?</span> <span id="s601">And me, in my stupid voice, said yes.</span> <span id="s602">And the guy stand there looking at me.</span> <span id="s603">I went over there, took care of the controls, put this thing in gear and it worked.</span> <span id="s604">So they went.</span> <span id="s605">They went into the compartment, asked by then there was two or three people, and it was 5:30 in the morning, people going to work or something.</span> <span id="s606">Anyway, at the end of the line there were two guys with guns.</span> <span id="s607">I thought I was dead.</span> <span id="s608">But these were guys from the Maquis, and welcomed me with open hands.</span> <span id="s609">They were Spaniards, they were mean characters.</span> <span id="s610">They hated (?</span> <span id="s611">Jews?)</span> <span id="s612">.</span> <span id="s613">They were from the Spanish War of 193738.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: The civil war?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Right.</span> <span id="s616">The Franco war.</span> <span id="s617">These guys were all ex felons.</span> <span id="s618">You know, they were all they were mean.</span> <span id="s619">They had no pity with anybody, they only hated Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: But they nonetheless welcomed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: They learned because I hated Germans too.</span> <span id="s622">It's the only reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Now, again, you were young.</span> <span id="s624">Were you very fearful yet or at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I was I had no time to have fear, I had to survive.</span> <span id="s626">And I sort of always I was an optimist.</span> <span id="s627">This cannot go on, because I didn't know at the time that the killing took place.</span> <span id="s628">And I heard from the NBC the NBC, the BBC, which they had up in the mountains, what was going on.</span> <span id="s629">Well, I was up there and I had to do the chores up there.</span> <span id="s630">I was like a little what we call today militia.</span> <span id="s631">We had to go down and blow up a bridge.</span> <span id="s632">And I got a gun, which I reluctantly used.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: How did you know how to use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: We got training.</span> <span id="s635">They taught us how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How big a group was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: 400.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Men?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: It was well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Was it only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span> <span id="s642">Women too.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And any young children?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, no young children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: And</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I think had an affair with a girl up there.</span> <span id="s647">But anyway, the life was not bad.</span> <span id="s648">We had food, at times we didn't.</span> <span id="s649">At times we had to kill a cat to eat.</span> <span id="s650">Yeah, it tastes good.</span> <span id="s651">Like a chicken.</span> <span id="s652">You know, it wasn't kosher of course but it's we survived.</span> <span id="s653">I had to learn how to be on guard when they blow up a the convoys of the trains and the trucks.</span> <span id="s654">The Germans could not come up.</span> <span id="s655">We were on top of the mountain in the Alps.</span> <span id="s656">They knew we were up there.</span> <span id="s657">The British came and dropped us some ammunition and guns and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Now, exactly what location was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: This was right on the Italian border.</span> <span id="s660">Actually the closest town was was it Modane, Modane.</span> <span id="s661">It's not very far from (?</span> <span id="s662">Shalmberi?)</span> <span id="s663">where the and (?</span> <span id="s664">Upduez?)</span> <span id="s665">where the Olympics were held a few years ago.</span> <span id="s666">And I don't know how we survived, it was cold up there.</span></p>

<p><span id="s809">Q: How did you know it was the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: We saw the Americans coming down the road.</span> <span id="s811">Hey, funny vehicles.</span> <span

That was the name.</span> <span id="s888">CCM cha cha, 6th regiment or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s889">The other coincidence is it's unbelievable to this day.</span> <span id="s890">Where is my father?</span> <span id="s891">Where is my mother?</span> <span id="s892">I went to the ChampsÉlysées in 1945 looking for the boards that were put up on the side with names.</span> <span id="s893">And I put my name on, who I'm looking for.</span> <span id="s894">And I had no idea where my mother was.</span> <span id="s895">I went back because I had free I was a second lieutenant, I could go anywhere I wanted to.</span> <span id="s896">You know, France was free.</span> <span id="s897">And I could ride a bus, a train, anything I wanted.</span> <span id="s898">And I went back to (?</span> <span id="s899">Sheer?)</span> <span id="s900">.</span> <span id="s901">For some reason, why would I go to (?</span> <span id="s902">Sheer?)</span> <span id="s903">to see that woman who sent me up to the Maquis?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Oh, I have that somewhere.</span> <span id="s906">Madame she's dead.</span> <span id="s907">My mother told me at one time she's dead.</span> <span id="s908">Because I got on a streetcar, who was the driver?</span> <span id="s909">The same one.</span> <span id="s910">And he recognized me even if I was in uniform.</span> <span id="s911">We hugged.</span> <span id="s912">This was amazing.</span> <span id="s913">And you know, this you know, I told him, (French spoken) you have saved my life.</span> <span id="s914">And he embraced me.</span> <span id="s915">He invited me to join him, the family that night for dinner but I didn't go.</span> <span id="s916">For a simple reason, when I opened the door to go in to the where the people sit</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: On the streetcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: On the streetcar.</span> <span id="s919">Who was sitting there?</span> <span id="s920">My mother, looking for me.</span> <span id="s921">She was in real bad shape.</span> <span id="s922">She had pieces of paper in her hand.</span> <span id="s923">She still couldn't talk too plain because for her slow.</span> <span id="s924">We never had a good conversation.</span> <span id="s925">She and then she got well again later on.</span> <span id="s926">I'm talking about 20 years later but her memory was gone.</span> <span id="s927">And this is the coincidence there.</span> <span id="s928">She knew that my father died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s929">She had a piece of paper where somebody told her that he was he perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s930">He went to _.</span> <span id="s931">That was it.</span> <span id="s932">We went to the American consulate.</span> <span id="s933">My brother was safe in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: What were your thoughts when you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s936">It's one of those hugs and that you never forget.</span> <span id="s937">She had BO, and I remembered it because she didn't have much to wear.</span> <span id="s938">This is what I remember.</span> <span id="s939">We stood there for 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s940">Even the driver stopped.</span> <span id="s941">It's yeah, it's one of those things.</span> <span id="s942">I don't care if what happened.</span> <span id="s943">This has I've never written down anything and this is 50 years later.</span> <span id="s944">I still see it like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s945">It was a green street car.</span> <span id="s946">I still see the benches, wooden benches, my mother sitting there disheveled.</span> <span id="s947">We went then I knew what to do, we went to the highest and got help.</span> <span id="s948">Even (foreign language) gave us _.</span> <span id="s949">Anyway, we got money and we could go to the consulate of the the American consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: This is we're talking are you still in (?</span> <span id="s951">Sheer?)</span> <span id="s952">?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: We were well, my mother was put up in Grenoble at that time then.</span> <span id="s954">And I was still in the French army.</span> <span id="s955">And I was made a French citizen but I had to give up my French citizenship in order to come to the United States because of the German quota.</span> <span id="s956">A lot of people don't understand that anymore, but that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s957">And then in 1947 my brother joined my mother in France, in Grenoble, and lived with her.</span> <span id="s958">I was in the army.</span> <span id="s959">In the 6th of June 1947, we embarked on a boat to the United States.</span> <span id="s960">And I have been here ever since, and I am still an optimist.</span></p> <p><span

about your father's experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Really none.</span> <span id="s966">Because all my mother had, papers and conversation with survivors that have seen my father in

them: Eat what you can, do what you can, pray in your own way and have faith.</span> <span id="s968">He was a good man.</span> <span id="s969">He believed in people, he was an optimist, he had a tremendous sense of humor, which maybe I inherit, and I'm glad.</span> <span id="s970">My father was the man who couldn't see bad in anything.</span> <span id="s971">He had a good marriage with my mother.</span> <span id="s972">He was well liked by his motherinlaw, they were proud of him.</span> <span id="s973">My her my grandfather, his fatherinlaw was a wine merchant near Westerburg,

Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1008">And he ordered on Friday night the meal which came, bacon and eggs.</span> <span id="s1009">That was he knew about English.</span> <span id="s1010">These are little things that I remember.</span> <span id="s1011">Anyway, we came to the country.</span> <span id="s1012">We had a little storm and stood outside of the harbor in New York.</span> <span id="s1013">We're supposed to come in six days, we came in seven days.</span> <span id="s1014">And at night, it's a beautiful site outside of New York.</span> <span id="s1015">We had I had no idea what the Statue of Liberty was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Did you know any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Me?</span> <span id="s1018">Chair, ceiling, boy, girl.</span> <span id="s1019">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1020">The first words I learned in this country were bad words which we're not supposed to use.</span> <span id="s1021">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: You say the Statue of Liberty, did that mean anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah, they told us, this is the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1024">What do I know?</span> <span id="s1025">I was more interested in the lights going on on the Hudson west side highway.</span> <span id="s1026">I never seen so many lights flickering.</span> <span id="s1027">This was and I made the acquaintance with an English young woman on the boat and we were standing there holding hands.</span> <span id="s1028">That was my look, I was 21 years old.</span> <span id="s1029">And when we came here, there were people standing at the pier.</span> <span id="s1030">I think it was pier 32 in New York.</span> <span id="s1031">And the first thing they said, like they all do and have done it before and do it again: Forget the past, forget about it.</span> <span id="s1032">It's easy to say, right?</span> <span id="s1033">Now I'm 21 years old.</span> <span id="s1034">They drove me through New York and showed me the tall buildings, which I didn't want to see because I was more interested in the girls on the street, on the side.</span> <span id="s1035">And I had an uncle here who was with me, who came through, and he says: You leave the American girls alone.</span> <span id="s1036">If you kiss the girls here, you have to marry them.</span> <span id="s1037">Anyway, I came here and everyone said forget your past.</span> <span id="s1038">And I have not spoken about this until 1985.</span> <span id="s1039">Yes, but not in public or anything.</span> <span id="s1040">I think Rabbi Schlossberg, my rabbi, my boss, he convinced me to speak about Kristallnacht at one __ We observed the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1041">I don't know, it was the 45th or 50th.</span> <span id="s1042">Anyway we had</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Did you speak with your mother and your brother about your experiences after you</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: My mother, she didn't remember everything because she lost memory.</span> <span id="s1045">My brother lived with my mother, never got married.</span> <span id="s1046">He died in a car accident in 1970 outside of Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s1047">The same day I had a child that also died on the same day.</span> <span id="s1048">But anyway, I have survived and I'm not in bad shape as far as mentally.</span> <span id="s1049">But I have, like Rabbi Schlossberg and other people told me, that I have an obligation to spread the word.</span> <span id="s1050">Reluctantly I do this.</span> <span id="s1051">Now I get a satisfaction of speaking to people in the hinterlands of the Midwest.</span> <span id="s1052">We're not talking about New York, Washington, Chicago or Detroit, we're talking about where I live where Jews are still seen with horns.</span> <span id="s1053">That I get a satisfaction out of speaking to schools and tell them not necessarily my life but what the holocaust can do to you.</span> <span id="s1054">Because many of these kids' parents don't believe the holocaust happened.</span> <span id="s1055">It's everywhere.</span> <span id="s1056">When I talk, I remember one school, I talk about the sten gun I had in the Maquis.</span> <span id="s1057">The kids write me letters afterwards, which are very interesting.</span> <span id="s1058">None is alike.</span> <span id="s1059">Because I ask the teacher that the kids write something about the speech.</span> <span id="s1060">Some of them go, some of them don't.</span> <span id="s1061">One of them, a kid writes: I like Mr. Marx's talk about guns because I love guns.</span> <span id="s1062">The kid is 10 years old or 12 years old.</span> <span id="s1063">We shoot every Sunday and I love to play with guns.</span> <span id="s1064">Well, my mission wasn't done.</span> <span id="s1065">I had one experience in one high school, I spoke to 200 juniors and seniors, they were exchange students from Switzerland, Germany and Poland, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1066">And I told them my message there is different than when I tell you my story.</span> <span id="s1067">My message is it shouldn't happen ever again, because it can.</span> <span id="s1068">A young woman from Germany comes to me: I want to show you something.</span> <span id="s1069">Do you speak German?</span> <span id="s1070">I said: Yeah, but speak to me in English, this is America.</span> <span id="s1071">I can speak English.</span> <span id="s1072">I want to show you something.</span> <span id="s1073">She opens her purse and shows me the picture of her grandfather in an SS black uniform with all kinds of ribbons.</span> <span id="s1074">Proudly she showed me this picture.</span> <span id="s1075">What shall I do?</span> <span id="s1076">I had enough how do you say that in English (?</span> <span id="s1077">kayack?)</span> <span id="s1078">to walk away, not to get involved with this child.</span> <span id="s1079">Because later on, when I tell this to people, they say you should have taken the picture and tear it up.</span> <span id="s1080">That's not the answer, but it did happen.</span> <span id="s1081">These experiences are still out there that 17, 18yearold young woman is proud to have that picture.</span> <span id="s1082">She probably doesn't know what that man did.</span> <span id="s1083">He probably killed a few hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: What did you do professionally?</span> <span id="s1085">Did you go back to school when you got here</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Here I went to work.</span> <span id="s1087">I worked in a delicatessen in Indianapolis, made sandwiches in the window because I couldn't talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: How did you end up in Indianapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I had we had an uncle.</span> <span id="s1090">My mother had eight brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1091">One of them was here.</span> <span id="s1092">And he wouldn't hire me in his business because I can't speak English, he couldn't either.</span> <span id="s1093">But and he his name was John Steinberger and he died since, and he is the one that gave me that ring.</span> <span id="s1094">Anyway</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: How long did you stay in Indianapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: I stayed in Indianapolis until 1959 when I got married.</span> <span id="s1097">And I worked in that delicatessen and I got fired because I wanted more money.</span> <span id="s1098">I was tending bar and go to school at night at Indiana University.</span> <span id="s1099">I didn't get a degree, but I went to business school.</span> <span id="s1100">Because a long, long relative, cousin picked me up and made me work for him.</span> <span id="s1101">His name was Max Reiss.</span> <span id="s1102">I don't know if you ever heard that name before.</span> <span id="s1103">But he's Finer Foods.</span> <span id="s1104">He died since too.</span> <span id="s1105">And I worked for him and then I worked for his competitor.</span> <span id="s1106">I was in the food business.</span> <span id="s1107">I was in the I was moved to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1108">And there I became parttime cantor on Friday.</span> <span id="s1109">I was home Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</span> <span id="s1110">Went back on the road Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</span> <span id="s1111">And that's how I got acquainted with because my background from home, from the seminary, from the school in Paris, and the encouragement of Rabbi Sacks in Minneapolis, who was a lousy chauffeur blower.</span> <span id="s1112">When I heard that, I says: Give it to me.</span> <span id="s1113">And I've been blowing the chauffeur ever since.</span> <span id="s1114">But I became their cantor on Friday, on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1115">And there was no money.</span> <span id="s1116">And then I was moved to Dayton, Ohio where I did my voluntary services for the Wright Patterson Air Force Base on Friday nights and Saturday mornings.</span> <span id="s1117">I was the divorced from my first wife because I spent too much time on weekends, instead of with the children, with the what she called me, she came from a very informed environment, she called me a religious nut.</span> <span id="s1118">And I shouldn't have done it, we didn't get along any more to call her that.</span> <span id="s1119">I came to Louisville, Kentucky in 1978 because I wanted to settle down and not travel anymore.</span> <span id="s1120">There was an opportunity for opening up a gourmet delicatessen food store which I was knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1121">And it didn't go over.</span> <span id="s1122">Rabbi Cling from the congregation _+ said: We need a religious director.</span> <span id="s1123">What's a religious director?</span> <span id="s1124">A religious director is a glorified (?</span> <span id="s1125">shama?)</span> <span id="s1126">.</span> <span id="s1127">I said: What is my job?</span> <span id="s1128">He says: Anything that I don't want to do you do it.</span> <span id="s1129">And I've ever been there ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Can we talk a little bit before we end about your feelings and your reflections?</span> <span id="s1131">You had said that you have this sense of optimism that you probably inherited from your father.</span> <span id="s1132">What else kept you going through these terrible times of the war?</span> <span id="s1133">Anything else besides that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Well, one, how can anyone believe six million, five million, four million, one million?</span> <span id="s1135">Impossible.</span> <span id="s1136">Okay, so they're put in a camp, don't get much to eat.</span> <span id="s1137">But killing?</span> <span id="s1138">It's how can and I was a young punk who loved life.</span> <span id="s1139">And I don't know, I still do.</span> <span id="s1140">At the age of 70 I still believe that I'm one of the luckiest people in the world.</span> <span id="s1141">And this is what I tell the people.</span> <span id="s1142">What kept me alive is I don't know.</span> <span id="s1143">But I wanted to stay alive because and I don't want to be a saint or anything, but I hope the next day is better than the one yesterday.</span> <span id="s1144">And when Rabbi Kurshner says bad things happen to good people look, I'm not good people, bad things happen anyway.</span> <span id="s1145">Bad things can happen to anyone and not everybody is good.</span> <span id="s1146">It's easy to say bad things happen to six million.</span> <span id="s1147">They were all good people.</span> <span id="s1148">And like you asked me awhile ago, my father had a big influence on me despite I only knew him for a few years.</span> <span id="s1149">And my love for him, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1150">Children ask me, and this is what I say at the end: Why do you still believe in God?</span> <span id="s1151">I keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1152">I'm not what you call an orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s1153">I wear a kippah when I go to holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s1154">I'm not a fanatic.</span> <span id="s1155">As a child I wore a (?</span> <span id="s1156">talibkatan?)</span> <span id="s1157">.</span> <span id="s1158">As a child we wore a very _ from home.</span> <span id="s1159">The question is why I still believe in God?</span> <span id="s1160">The answer is why not?</span> <span id="s1161">And that's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: You had talked about the fact you still have dreams about those times.</span> <span id="s1163">And in any other way has the holocaust affected your everyday life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Oh, I was told that I get very emotional at the time of Yom HaShoah.</span> <span id="s1165">I found out that other people are in the same boat.</span> <span id="s1166">That it is amazing there's a scar.</span> <span id="s1167">We all have scars.</span> <span id="s1168">And this scar may be healed but it's there.</span> <span id="s1169">But why did it take 50 years to get a holocaust museum?</span> <span id="s1170">All of a sudden in 1950 nobody wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1171">Was America ashamed of it?</span> <span id="s1172">Maybe they should have, maybe not.</span> <span id="s1173">I'm not a politician.</span> <span id="s1174">But America should have done more and they know it.</span> <span id="s1175">All of a sudden not necessarily all of a sudden, in the last 10 years or so the stories come about.</span> <span id="s1176">There's a lot of people, myself, who I didn't mention what I saw when we were running from the Germans, that the Messerschmitts up there were shooting at at civilians running away from Paris.</span> <span id="s1177">We just saw people getting killed and bloody stuff in the on the way to Limoges.</span> <span id="s1178">You know, it's impossible to explain these things.</span> <span id="s1179">There are no witnesses to it.</span> <span id="s1180">There are just those who survived and they didn't want to talk.</span> <span id="s1181">I know people that were in the same boat as I am.</span> <span id="s1182">I met them out in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1183">They didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1184">They have a new life.</span> <span id="s1185">Some of them went to school, some of them became very wealthy.</span> <span id="s1186">Some of them did well.</span> <span id="s1187">I don't know if they have done their share to Judaism or not.</span> <span id="s1188">Because if I win the lottery tomorrow, that's another story.</span> <span id="s1189">But I think we have now and I realize, and like I said, I'm not a good guy, I'm not a saint.</span> <span id="s1190">We now have an obligation to spread the word.</span> <span id="s1191">And as a school, I'll tell the teacher is waiting for me over there now in the little county.</span> <span id="s1192">She she says I'm her she's a very devout Christian: I am the Jewish what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1193">Preacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Proctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Messenger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: No.</span> <span id="s1198">The man that goes around and makes speeches like oh, the preacher that is on the radio, TV</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Billy Graham?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1201">What is he called?</span> <span id="s1202">A</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Minister?</span> <span id="s1204">Evangelical?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Well, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1206">A messenger.</span> <span id="s1207">Then I have and the teachers are really appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: You said you never wore a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I was supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: I was supposed to wear it in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And why did you not wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: I ran away, didn't I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: What were your thoughts on the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: (?</span> <span id="s1216">Sweeve?)</span> <span id="s1217">was the one that my thoughts on it?</span> <span id="s1218">Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1219">I disguised myself as a Frenchman to survive.</span> <span id="s1220">Why should I put a thing on there and give myself away?</span> <span id="s1221">That was my</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Did you receive</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: In the camp where I wore the (?</span> <span id="s1224">sweeve?)</span> <span id="s1225">I never understood that.</span> <span id="s1226">Why wear, in a camp, a thin (?</span> <span id="s1227">sweeve?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: So you did not even wear it</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: No.</span> <span id="s1230">I never had to.</span> <span id="s1231">I never was forced to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: You never were forced to, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I never were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Did you receive reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: I oh, my mother, she messed us up.</span> <span id="s1236">Years ago, years ago for education, we got a lump sum something.</span> <span id="s1237">Now my mother is financially she was all right.</span> <span id="s1238">And I tell you why.</span> <span id="s1239">My father was an employee of the German government.</span> <span id="s1240">The clergy was paid by the government.</span> <span id="s1241">Until 1938.</span> <span id="s1242">And she now, her all these years that she was in the nursing home was paid with the pension from the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: How do you feel about her getting having got the money from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Should have gotten more.</span> <span id="s1245">But money doesn't pay life.</span> <span id="s1246">A lot of people say that but it's not true.</span> <span id="s1247">Money can do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1248">And I know people who went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1249">It's amazing how our Jewish people feel that way, when they say: My hometown.</span> <span id="s1250">Uhuh, I have no hometown.</span> <span id="s1251">My hometown is where I live now, where I have a wife.</span> <span id="s1252">That's my hometown.</span> <span id="s1253">I hear people going back to my hometown in Castle or wherever they are.</span> <span id="s1254">That's not a hometown.</span> <span id="s1255">She never had a home, she got chased out of there.</span> <span id="s1256">We have our own Jewish people buy MercedesBenz of course.</span> <span id="s1257">And to me, I said it one time, I says: I won't go in that Nazi car.</span> <span id="s1258">And the man was very upset about that, what I said.</span> <span id="s1259">Let them do what they want.</span> <span id="s1260">There is I don't want to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1261">People went to Germany as guests of the German I wrote for the heck of it.</span> <span id="s1262">I wrote to the town of Speyer: I am Ernst Marx, son of Leo Marx, later (?</span> <span id="s1263">Abino?)</span> <span id="s1264">Marx.</span> <span id="s1265">And I would I hear that I'm welcome in your city.</span> <span id="s1266">What when shall I we intend to visit you next year.</span> <span id="s1267">I don't know, it's always in German.</span> <span id="s1268">Anyway, said: What is your what do you help us out financially?</span> <span id="s1269">The answer came: My name is not Bürgermeister, my name is Ober Bürgermeister _ port.</span> <span id="s1270">And he says: I am 42 years old, I do not know anything about the past.</span> <span id="s1271">Our town is not in position to finance your trip.</span> <span id="s1272">However, you will always be welcome in our city.</span> <span id="s1273">Oh, achtung _ Very Truly Yours.</span> <span id="s1274">So I am no, a lot of people ask me do I want to go back.</span> <span id="s1275">I went to Israel three times.</span> <span id="s1276">I went to Israel to pick up my mother who was in Israel and had another stroke in Israel.</span> <span id="s1277">And I had to bring her back first class on Luf on Lufthansa to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1278">This is the funniest and because El Al didn't have any room.</span> <span id="s1279">And went back on two trips with the synagogue to Israel as part I was at the upper shem.</span> <span id="s1280">And I said (foreign language) at the flame down there.</span> <span id="s1281">I think this was the highlight of my whole life.</span> <span id="s1282">You know, we have a beautiful museum right over here, which is historical.</span> <span id="s1283">It's not for us, I think our it's not a museum, a memorial is in Israel.</span> <span id="s1284">They're building more, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">(Tape change)</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: What are you going to do with this thing now?</span> <span
