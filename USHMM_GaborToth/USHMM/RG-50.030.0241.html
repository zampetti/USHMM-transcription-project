id="s12">Q: Good Afternoon.</span> <span id="s13">Would you please tell me, for the record, your name, your date of birth and your place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well my name was Gerd G-E–R-D Sigmund(ph) von Halle.</span> <span id="s15">Was born on December 2, 1922, in Hamburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I had one brother and his name was Hans Jürgen(ph), and he was l year and nine months older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And what was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father's occupation – he was an architect, specializing in building department stores in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about your childhood while you were in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well, it was a very pleasant time.</span> <span id="s22">My father was doing rather well as an architect.</span> <span id="s23">We lived in a upper middle class neighborhood in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s24">We went to public schools there, and life was, was pretty nice although I understand when I was a baby, of course – this was still – we're talking about 1922, ‘23, there was, they had it was at the end of World War I and the inflation I understand from my mother that they bought a bottle of milk for a million marks and so on, so times were not that easy when I was a baby, but I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s25">And we went to public school, went to what they call Oberrealschule, which you would call here a junior high school.</span> <span id="s26">And then Hitler well, of course, in 1930 and ‘31 and ‘32, Hitler became more popular and things became more difficult for the Jews although I was still a young child and not quite aware of everything that was going on.</span> <span id="s27">In 1933, Hitler came to power as Chancellor and then, of course, things changed very dramatically.</span> <span id="s28">I still remember being in junior high school as an 11 year old and we had to learn how to give the Hitler salute.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">01:03:00 So here we were marching around in the gymnasium giving the Hitler salute in the proper fashion.</span> <span id="s30">And whenever there was a holiday every house had to display a flag.</span> <span id="s31">It was either the swastika flag or the German flag and we didn't display either one of them, but then we were told that we had to and so my father went out and he bought the German flag black, red and gold flag, and so we displayed that on the balcony and my father was very much aware that there was no future for us.</span> <span id="s32">So since he had a sister married to a Dutchman in Amsterdam, he decided to move to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s33">Furthermore, although we had been thinking in terms of going to America, but America in 1933 wasn't exactly streets weren't lined with gold and I think America didn't need a German architect at that particular time, so we moved to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s34">Amsterdam in those days was an absolutely delightful place to live.</span> <span id="s35">I would say probably one of the most wonderful times of my life I've spent in Amsterdam as a young man.</span> <span id="s36">It was a very quiet, easy going lifestyle.</span> <span id="s37">The Dutch were delightful people.</span> <span id="s38">Everything went very slowly.</span> <span id="s39">Everything was very neat.</span> <span id="s40">Everything was very clean.</span> <span id="s41">And so there we, we went to school even though when we arrived there the Dutch schools were way ahead of the German schools and so I was – and both my brother and I, we were both put back one class so we were put back one grade.</span> <span id="s42">Holland, as I said, was, was delightful uneventful to a degree and, and we were not – and of course, the war clouds started gathering in the late ‘30s.</span> <span id="s43">And we were not too much worried about Holland being – becoming involved in the war because in the last war, that is, World War I, Holland was neutral.</span> <span id="s44">And for whatever reason – I can't give you the reason, but for whatever reason, we felt and the Dutch people felt that because we were neutral in World War I we probably will remain neutral in World War II.</span> <span id="s45">Needless to say, that did not turn out to be true and in May of 1940 the German army moved into Holland and the war really was over before it even began because the whole Dutch army had to capitulate within a period of four or five days that we were no match for the German army who came in with a tremendous amount of air power etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">01:07:00 Being a Jew, of course, that was a very, very unsettling time for us.</span> <span id="s47">We didn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s48">We saw the German army marching through the streets.</span> <span id="s49">For the first time in my life, I see the green uniforms which was the uniform of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s50">I'd never seen that before, and they marched through the streets, and to be very honest, we were quite frightened by all of this.</span> <span id="s51">As it turned out, the first year of the occupation was completely uneventful.</span> <span id="s52">The Germans in that first year of occupation behaved almost unbelievably gentleman-like.</span> <span id="s53">They didn't bother anybody.</span> <span id="s54">There were no real problems.</span> <span id="s55">Until one day, a group of young Jews were arrested in Amsterdam just haphazardly.</span> <span id="s56">They were just taken off the street.</span> <span id="s57">There was no reason for it.</span> <span id="s58">And they were arrested.</span> <span id="s59">And then followed by about a month or so later, there was – I don't know whether it's exactly the way it happened, but there was an explosion in a German officer's club.</span> <span id="s60">Now whether it was an explosion or somebody let the soup boil over or whatever happened, I don't know what happened, but they decided to arrest 225 young German Jews.</span> <span id="s61">Not Dutch Jews, German Jews.</span> <span id="s62">And so one night I was coming home.</span> <span id="s63">I came home around four o'clock.</span> <span id="s64">My brother was working, learning the metals trade, and my brother came home about I would say around five-thirty.</span> <span id="s65">We lived on the ground floor in Amsterdam and our bicycles were outside on the window, so people knew that we were home.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">01:10:00 And the door bell rang, and I never gave it a second thought and I walked up to the front door, opened up the door, and two men in brown leather coats pushed their way past me, went into the living room, and came out with a list and they asked me whether anybody by the name of Hans Jürgen(ph) von Halle lived here.</span> <span id="s67">Well, my brother was in the back room and truthfully, I didn't know what to say, and before I could say anything my brother came out of the back room and he wanted to know what was going on and they turned to him and said, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s68">And he said, "My name is Hans Jürgen(ph) von Halle."</span></p> <p><span id="s69">01:11:00 And then they said, "Is there a Gerd Carl von Halle here?"</span> <span id="s70">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s71">They said, "What's your name."</span> <span id="s72">I said, "My name is Gerd Sigmund von Halle."</span> <span id="s73">They said, "Well, that must be the same one."</span> <span id="s74">So they put us under arrest and they pushed us out the front door just the way we were.</span> <span id="s75">We did not have time to say goodbye to our parents.</span> <span id="s76">And they marched us from our house to the Gestapo headquarters in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s77">Now when I say they marched us, we were not handcuffed.</span> <span id="s78">We were just – my brother and I were just walking there individually, and these two Gestapo agents in their leather coats just followed behind about – I don't know – 20 feet behind, and all they did is tell us turn right, turn left, straight ahead.</span> <span id="s79">And so that if you had passed us by on the street, you would never in a million years would you have known that these two young boys were under arrest.</span> <span id="s80">And we arrived at Gestapo headquarters, oh, I would say around five-thirty, six o'clock.</span> <span id="s81">And we were one of the last to arrive, and when I looked around I saw practically all of my friends were there.</span> <span id="s82">There were 226 young German Jews all lined up in that Gestapo headquarters which was a former girls school.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">01:13:00 And we were lined up down in the basement, and we were shouted at and yelled at and, you know, we had to stand at attention.</span> <span id="s84">And we stood at attention from six o'clock until about midnight.</span> <span id="s85">And we weren't allowed to talk.</span> <span id="s86">We weren't allowed to move.</span> <span id="s87">We weren't allowed to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s88">And around midnight the commandant of the Gestapo headquarters stepped forward and said, "Is there anybody here who has a serious and I mean serious illness to report?"</span> <span id="s89">And he explained that anybody who would be fooling him, he explained what the drastic consequences of that would be.</span> <span id="s90">My brother, who was standing next to me, pushed me sort of with his elbow and said, "Step forward."</span> <span id="s91">and I whispered back to him, I said, "What can I, what can I talk about ?"</span> <span id="s92">It so turned out as a child I was, I was not one of the strongest kids on the block.</span> <span id="s93">I suffered a great deal from bronchitis which 5,000,000 other people suffer from, and my brother said to me, "Tell him you have TB" I never had TB in my life, thank goodness.</span> <span id="s94">And I was very, very, very reluctant to step forward because I was afraid of the consequences because they told me what the consequences would be if you lied.</span> <span id="s95">But he sort of insisted on it, and since he was my older brother by a year and almost two years, I stepped forward and I had to go into he took me into a room and he says, "What's the matter with you?"</span> <span id="s96">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And that's all he wanted to know and I – he – I had to step back in line.</span> <span id="s97">As it turned out, there was – I said to you there was 220 – there was 226 young German Jews there.</span> <span id="s98">And the order was to arrest these Jews between the ages of 16 and 21.</span> <span id="s99">Now, this – there was one kid in this group of 226 who happened to be 15, and in typical German fashion when the order said 16 to 21, you only take people 16 to 21.</span> <span id="s100">This kid was 15 and, therefore, around midnight or thereabout, he was dismissed.</span> <span id="s101">The kid happened to be not a friend of mine, but he knew me.</span> <span id="s102">And he went directly from Gestapo headquarters to my parents' home, told my parents what he saw.</span> <span id="s103">My parents could only put two and two together and surmised that probably what I told them that I suffer from TB They in turn went to my family physician, a Jewish Dutchman doctor by the name of Dr. Hertzberger.</span> <span id="s104">Dr. Hertzberger, when my parents told him what had happened wrote out a certificate which I gave to the museum, which states that I am suffering from TB Now, so we're here now back in the Gestapo headquarters in the basement and around midnight or l o'clock in the morning we were transported from Amsterdam in buses to a camp called Schoorl.</span> <span id="s105">That's spelled S-C-H-O-O-R-L, which is near Alkmaar in North Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">01:18:00 This was a camp surrounded and protected by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s107">And we stayed there for approximately, oh, I would say, somewhere in the neighborhood of six to eight weeks.</span> <span id="s108">Our treatment now certainly wasn't good but it wasn't brutal to the degree that you know, we learned later on what happened in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s109">We were subjected to all the harassment and so on, but nobody was killed there.</span> <span id="s110">One day I was called into the commandant's office, and as I went into the office I snapped at attention and in front of his desk and I looked down on his desk and I saw a letter.</span> <span id="s111">I could see it even though it was upside down.</span> <span id="s112">I could see it was a letter of Dr. Hertzberger.</span> <span id="s113">And the commandant says to me, "What's wrong with you?"</span> <span id="s114">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And this man seemed to be the kind of individual that certainly did not want to be in the presence of anybody who had a contagious disease and he said to me, "Get out of here and get and get out of the camp immediately."</span> <span id="s115">So I ran back to my barracks.</span> <span id="s116">I said goodbye to my brother who was with me there, and I was released that day.</span> <span id="s117">And now there were 224 boys left.</span> <span id="s118">These 224 boys that same day were sent from this local concentration camp to probably one of the most infamous concentration camps of all called Mauthausen in Austria.</span> <span id="s119">I came back from camp.</span> <span id="s120">I arrived, I had no money.</span> <span id="s121">I hitchhiked my way back to Amsterdam from there, and I was very, very busy going around seeing all of the parents of my friends who had been there and telling everybody that everybody was doing well under the circumstances etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s122">We received a card from my brother from the concentration camp Mauthausen which is – now remember, we're talking about the year 1941.</span> <span id="s123">That was in the early part of the war.</span> <span id="s124">We received a letter, a post card from him, which was a sort of a printed post card.</span> <span id="s125">It just said, "I,” then he filled in his name, “Hans Jürgen von Halle, born May 7th, 1921, am in concentration camp Mauthausen as of such and such a date as prisoner number so and so in barrack number so and so, etcetera.”</span> <span id="s126">Now it was very unusual to receive a letter like this, but the reason why we received it because as I said before, it was still 1941.</span> <span id="s127">We also received two letters from him.</span> <span id="s128">The letters I also gave to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s129">We were not a sentimental family.</span> <span id="s130">Somehow we were brought up in the – I don't know how to put it.</span> <span id="s131">In the – well we were not brought up sentimentally.</span> <span id="s132">And when we saw the letter with my brother which started off – he wrote in German because they had to pass the, the what do you call it?</span> <span id="s133">The censor.</span> <span id="s134">He wrote in German, “Liebe, liebe, Eltern,” “Dear, dear parents.”</span> <span id="s135">Now that is not the way my brother would speak.</span> <span id="s136">He does not say, "Dear, dear parent."</span> <span id="s137">That is not his language.</span> <span id="s138">And that was not my language.</span> <span id="s139">And then he goes through the letter and in the letter you can see – when you read the letter, you can see the absolutely desperation that these boys were in, that he was in.</span> <span id="s140">We received two letters and that was it.</span> <span id="s141">Shortly after the last letter arrived, I got a – I don't remember whether it was a call or a notice from the Gestapo headquarters in Amsterdam that somebody from the family had to report to Gestapo headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">01:24:00 And my parents wanted to go and I didn't allow them to go and I went there.</span> <span id="s143">And what happened is they showed us a list of all 224 boys.</span> <span id="s144">Everyone of them had died of “pneumonia” quote unquote.</span> <span id="s145">Needless to say, from what I understand Mauthausen was one of the most cruel concentration camps.</span> <span id="s146">They didn't have a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s147">They didn't have to have a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s148">This was a stone quarry, and from what I understand these boys were just lined up at the top of the quarry and just pushed down into the quarry which was – whatever it was, a hundred feet lower below and just pushed to their death.</span> <span id="s149">Very efficient way of killing people without bullets, without gas, without anything.</span> <span id="s150">Well, I came back home and this was probably one of the most difficult things for me to tell my parents that their – let's see, my brother was maybe 21 or 20, he was 20 – that their 20 year old son, six foot tall, broad shoulders, never been sick in his life, had died of pneumonia.</span> <span id="s151">My, my mother who was the strong party in the family stood up very well.</span> <span id="s152">My father absolutely disintegrated.</span> <span id="s153">He absolutely disintegrated about the news.</span> <span id="s154">Couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s155">Couldn't hack it.</span> <span id="s156">And my mother really sort of was the, as you might say, the Starke.</span> <span id="s157">And so that was the first chapter in the story.</span> <span id="s158">We then – 1941 – we then continued things – after that, things moved quickly.</span> <span id="s159">We were of course Jews were not allowed to go on the street car.</span> <span id="s160">Jews were not allowed to have radios.</span> <span id="s161">You had to turn them in.</span> <span id="s162">Jews weren't allowed to have silver.</span> <span id="s163">You had to turn them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:27:00 Then came the yellow star.</span> <span id="s165">Everybody had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s166">And I'll tell you quite frankly, wearing a yellow star, even though I was certainly very proud to be a Jew, but going out into the street with a star about the size this big with the word Jew or in Dutch Jood, J-O-O-D, printed on it is a very, very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s167">Very strange indeed.</span> <span id="s168">It's not the kind of a thing that, if you've never experienced it, it's like going on the street today and saying I have, you know, I'm a prisoner or going out on the street with a prison uniform.</span> <span id="s169">It's almost the same comparison.</span> <span id="s170">More arrests and more arrests and more arrests and before you knew it, these friends were taken prisoners and these friends were taken prisoners.</span> <span id="s171">In the meantime, in order to be able to escape from deportation, I took a job learning the shoemaker's trade.</span> <span id="s172">You were becoming a shoemaker to the Jewish population and for a limited period of time that exempted you from being deported, so I became a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s173">And realizing, of course, that this was strictly a limited kind of thing.</span> <span id="s174">This was not going to be anything of longstanding and I one day, I said to my parents, "This can't go on.</span> <span id="s175">There are too many people have been arrested.</span> <span id="s176">Our turn, if it's not today, it will be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s177">If it's not tomorrow, it will be next week.</span> <span id="s178">We have to get out of here."</span> <span id="s179">And so we decided one day, actually from one day to the next we decided to leave our house.</span> <span id="s180">And I want you to know that we just left the house just the way it was, with the pictures on the walls and the food in the refrigerator and the clothes in the closet and, and, and nothing was taken.</span> <span id="s181">The only thing we did is we gave the key to our apartment to one of our neighbors who we knew and trusted and these were two ladies which I will come back to later on in my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">01:30:00 And they had a key to the apartment.</span> <span id="s183">But we just left.</span> <span id="s184">I only attended college for one year.</span> <span id="s185">And one of the college professors.</span> <span id="s186">His name was Mr. In't Hout, I-N-apostrophe-T H-O-U-T.</span> <span id="s187">In't Hout, that was his name.</span> <span id="s188">I called him and I told him what our situation was.</span> <span id="s189">And without blinking an eye, without hesitating for one minute, he says, "Come right over."</span> <span id="s190">And so we walked out of the apartment and we went to Mr. In't Hout's apartment and it was just a small – was a family of four, a husband and wife and two children, a boy and girl about my age.</span> <span id="s191">And there was no room for three people.</span> <span id="s192">There were only two – it was, it was a three-bedroom apartment and one room was occupied by the parents and one room was occupied by the girl and one room was occupied by the boy, and what they did is they put the boy and the girl together in one room and gave me the third room and their brother-in-law took my parents.</span> <span id="s193">Now the problem was, now that we are no longer officially in residence in our regular home, we now no longer have access to rationing cards.</span> <span id="s194">Rationing cards is the lifeline to food.</span> <span id="s195">And these two ladies who were living above us, they belonged to the Dutch underground, and they supplied us with rationing cards.</span> <span id="s196">And so we stayed in that my parents at the in-laws, in the brother-in-law's house and I in Mr. In't Hout's house.</span> <span id="s197">We stayed for a couple of months ‘til they found a quote permanent residence for us, which was on a farm house in the south of Holland, a small village maybe couple of hundred people in the whole village.</span> <span id="s198">The name of the village was Alrijksdaal(ph).</span> <span id="s199">A small town not known for anything except they make church bells.</span> <span id="s200">We went to Alrijksdaal(ph), and we went to this farm house and it was a great relief because whereas in Amsterdam we had to stay within this one room, in the farm house at night at least, I could go out into the garden and so on and walk around in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s201">And everything was pretty pleasant there ‘til one day a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn(ph) arrived also, another Jewish couple.</span> <span id="s202">And Mr. Kahn(ph) was a very nice little gentlemen.</span> <span id="s203">You might call him in English, in the American slang, you might call him, he was a milky toast.</span> <span id="s204">A nothing individual.</span> <span id="s205">Very nice, lovely person.</span> <span id="s206">His wife, the exact opposite.</span> <span id="s207">His wife was a beautiful lady, a tremendous flirt, and before you turned around, she took up an affair with the farmer who had a wife who had children.</span> <span id="s208">And I guess the farmer's wife was not quite happy about the situation.</span> <span id="s209">And in desperation when to the authorities and told them that there were Jews in there – in this house.</span> <span id="s210">Unbeknown to us, of course.</span> <span id="s211">And so one night we were sitting at the dinner table, which was downstairs, facing the street and as I'm looking out the window, I all of a sudden see a small car, small German army car pulling up with four German Gestapo agents jumping out of the car and running into the house.</span> <span id="s212">Well, as we saw the car arriving, we, everybody went different ways.</span> <span id="s213">My father went up into the attic.</span> <span id="s214">Mrs. Kahn(ph) went out the back door into the woods.</span> <span id="s215">Mr. Kahn(ph) went into the bedroom, in his bedroom.</span> <span id="s216">My mother went into our bedroom and hid in a closet, and I went into a toilet and behind the toilet there was a little ledge and I sort of crouched behind the ledge.</span> <span id="s217">And before I even could turn around I could hear the Gestapo agent arresting my father because I could hear him talking to my father.</span> <span id="s218">And Mr. Kahn(ph) was arrested immediately.</span> <span id="s219">And the farmer was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">01:36:05 So what they did is they took all of the suitcases from Mrs. Kahn(ph), Mr. and Mrs. Kahn(ph) and they put them into our bedroom.</span> <span id="s221">And our suitcases were in the bedroom.</span> <span id="s222">And they put the suitcases all in front of my mother's closet where she was hiding.</span> <span id="s223">And every closet in the house was opened up except that one closet.</span> <span id="s224">Why?</span> <span id="s225">Because they themselves barricaded that one closet and so that was the reason why they didn't get in there.</span> <span id="s226">They left with the prisoners, with my father, Mr. Kahn(ph) and the and the farmer, and they sealed the room.</span> <span id="s227">They sealed the room in which my mother was hiding.</span> <span id="s228">The put a wax seal on it and they said they would be back two hours later to get, to get the goodies.</span> <span id="s229">And as soon as they left, I got out of my closet, out of my little hiding place in the, in the toilet and I spoke to my mother over the phone.</span> <span id="s230">And I'll tell you quite frankly in all my life I have never made a more difficult decision than I did at that point.</span> <span id="s231">My mother came out of the closet and we are now discussing what to do next.</span> <span id="s232">We couldn't get out of the house because the house was surrounded.</span> <span id="s233">If there were 200 families – if there were 200 people in the, in the village, I think all 200 hundred were standing around the house.</span> <span id="s234">So there was no way to get her out through the window or anything like that.</span> <span id="s235">Beside the window was up on the second floor.</span> <span id="s236">So the question was really should you stay in the closet or should you go under the bed.</span> <span id="s237">That was the only two alternatives in that little room.</span> <span id="s238">And I decided, based on nothing, based on gut feeling if you want to call it, that I wanted her to go under the bed.</span> <span id="s239">So she went under the bed and I went back into my little hiding place there.</span> <span id="s240">And sure enough, couple of hours later they came back and they opened the room and they emptied out every closet, every suitcase.</span> <span id="s241">They took the suitcase, put it on top of the bed.</span> <span id="s242">Actually only two men came back.</span> <span id="s243">Originally they were four.</span> <span id="s244">Now, they only had two men came back.</span> <span id="s245">One was standing on one side of the bed.</span> <span id="s246">The other guy was standing on the other side of the bed.</span> <span id="s247">And they emptied out the suitcases.</span> <span id="s248">And I remember like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s249">I had the first electric razor that ever was made.</span> <span id="s250">Not that I was the first one, but it was one of the first razors ever made by Phillips.</span> <span id="s251">And all of a sudden I hear my razor going.</span> <span id="s252">And well these guys had never seen an electric razor.</span> <span id="s253">And so, “That was good for me.</span> <span id="s254">I'll take the razor."</span> <span id="s255">And then they pulled out a suit, and "Well, that suit fits my brother-in-law."</span> <span id="s256">And "That dress, that's good for my girlfriend."</span> <span id="s257">"And that thing."</span> <span id="s258">The entire thing was divided up between these two characters while my mother was under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">01:40:00 I would say they must have spent a minimum of an hour and a half in that room dividing up the loot.</span> <span id="s260">If you analyze it, you think about it, here is a woman under the bed.</span> <span id="s261">If she had as much as coughed, sneezed or anything!</span> <span id="s262">The difference between – what we sometimes forget is the difference between being caught and not being caught is the difference between being alive or dead.</span> <span id="s263">That's the difference.</span> <span id="s264">There is no, there is no – you know, if you can always, say, "Well, I got caught.</span> <span id="s265">You know, I stole, I stole an apple and the cop on the corner caught me and he put me in a jail for a week and then I got out again."</span> <span id="s266">This was not the case.</span> <span id="s267">Here if you got caught, that's the end of your life.</span> <span id="s268">It's a death sentence.</span> <span id="s269">So my mother was – and I might say one other thing.</span> <span id="s270">While my father – when my father was arrested and he – you know, he was up in the attic he came down in the they put him into the bedroom where my mother was in the closet in the beginning and he – they must have left him alone for maybe 30 seconds or so.</span> <span id="s271">He took off his ring, his wedding band and threw it into the closet and that ring I still have to this day.</span> <span id="s272">That was his wedding band that he gave to his wife, my mother, and, and that was the only thing that we saved.</span> <span id="s273">So after they took all the, the loot, they couldn't fit it all into their car.</span> <span id="s274">They took what they could, sealed the room for the second time, and said they would come back the next morning.</span> <span id="s275">So after they left, here's my mother back in that room, sealed and unable to get out.</span> <span id="s276">I decided at that point that she had to get out.</span> <span id="s277">Come hell or high water, she had to get out of that room because she was lucky twice.</span> <span id="s278">First in the closet where they didn't see her, then under the bed where they didn't see her.</span> <span id="s279">This will not last for the third time.</span> <span id="s280">So around midnight after all the people around the village had gone home and everything was quiet, I put a ladder up against the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">01:43:00 I went up on the ladder and she came out of the window and put her feet on my shoulder and we sort of – which ever way, we finally made it downstairs and now where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s282">Now the farmer had a very, very tall haystack.</span> <span id="s283">When I say haystack, one of these huge haystacks with a roof over it.</span> <span id="s284">And we decided that we're going to go up on the haystack and see where we're going from there.</span> <span id="s285">We didn't know what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s286">So we climbed up on the haystack with a ladder which it certainly was not too uncomfortable – was a comfortable place to relax ‘til about a couple of hours later we got word from the underground that the Gestapo had found out that there were two more Jews left in the house.</span> <span id="s287">And the Gestapo was on their way back to get both my mother and I. Well, with that message in hand, we had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s288">Where we're going from here?</span> <span id="s289">Here we are in the south of Holland.</span> <span id="s290">We decided – I was told also by the underground that the railroad station of Alrijksdaal was surrounded by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s291">And so therefore we could not go there.</span> <span id="s292">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s293">So I knew that the next railroad station was further south and I didn't know exactly how to get there but I knew in what general direction I had to go, so I took my mother by hand and we walked – I would say we walked somewhere in the neighborhood of probably five to six hours through the woods and probably more than that, ‘til we finally reached the next town at the railway station.</span> <span id="s294">And we boarded a train and my mother and I both in the same compartment although we did not sit together because if one of us got arrested we didn't want both of us to be arrested.</span> <span id="s295">So I sat there with a newspaper in front of me so that my face would not show up.</span> <span id="s296">My mother was sitting on the other side of the railroad.</span> <span id="s297">And we took off and the next railroad stop was Alrijksdaal.</span> <span id="s298">I looked out the window and sure enough, there they were waiting for us, and we just sort of went to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s299">When I got back to Amsterdam, I got on the phone and I called my teacher, the only person I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">01:46:00 Not the only person I knew, but the only person I knew who might be able to help us.</span> <span id="s301">And I called him on the phone and I said, "Here we are.</span> <span id="s302">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s303">My father was arrested.</span> <span id="s304">My mother and I are here."</span> <span id="s305">And again without thinking for one second, he says, "Come right over."</span> <span id="s306">So this is 1943.</span> <span id="s307">We are walking clear across Amsterdam from the railroad station and we wind up back at Mr. In't Hout's house – home.</span> <span id="s308">Here again, this little apartment – it's a city apartment.</span> <span id="s309">We were there and we stayed in one room.</span> <span id="s310">My mother and I stayed in that room for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s311">Never left the room.</span> <span id="s312">Never saw fresh air, it's a strange feeling.</span> <span id="s313">You know even a prisoner is allowed every day to exercise.</span> <span id="s314">We could not exercise.</span> <span id="s315">We were in that room and so here we are.</span> <span id="s316">Then the following year, Mrs. In't Hout died.</span> <span id="s317">Of natural causes, she died.</span> <span id="s318">And which was a difficult time because now there were a hundred people coming to the apartment and nobody was allowed to know that we were in that little apartment so we stayed in that room and somehow they put some chairs in front of the doors so that nobody would walk into that room where we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s320">What was it like living in that one room?</span> <span id="s321">How did you keep yourself occupied during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s323">We did get the underground newspaper which was called Het Volk, V-O-L-K.</span> <span id="s324">We read that.</span> <span id="s325">These were very religious people.</span> <span id="s326">They were Protestant people and they read a great deal about the New Testament and the Old Testament and truthfully, I learned a great deal about the Old Testament and the New testament.</span> <span id="s327">I took up sketching.</span> <span id="s328">I got some paper and a pencil and I did some sketching and I still have those sketches.</span> <span id="s329">I saved them.</span> <span id="s330">It's very difficult and then, of course, every day we were always aware.</span> <span id="s331">Every time the door bell rang.</span> <span id="s332">Every time I heard somebody coming up the stairs, not to our apartment, but up the stairs in the apartment house you could hear.</span> <span id="s333">You always worried.</span> <span id="s334">Who is this?</span> <span id="s335">Who's coming up the stairs.</span> <span id="s336">So we decided to – there was a closet and I decided to cut a hole into the roof of the closet.</span> <span id="s337">I cut a hole, oh, what would you call this?</span> <span id="s338">Two feet?</span> <span id="s339">It was about two feet.</span> <span id="s340">I cut a, cut a hole two square feet into the attic.</span> <span id="s341">And got a ladder up there.</span> <span id="s342">Looked in and there I was in the attic.</span> <span id="s343">However, so here this is this bare attic.</span> <span id="s344">And then I saw at the end of the attic there was a wall, a brick wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">01:50:30 And what I did, I took a hammer and a screwdriver and slowly I took out brick by brick by brick, I took out a small section of that wall.</span> <span id="s346">Just a triangle, just big enough and every time I took out the brick, I marked the brick with a number one, two, three, four, five, etc.</span> <span id="s347">And so what happened is when I took out he brick you got into the next attic and there in the next attic, when I was in that attic, I took the bricks and put them back, one, two, three, four, five, and so it almost became a solid brick wall again.</span> <span id="s348">And whenever there was any kind of a problem, my mother and I would go up into this two by two hole, crawl into the – crawl into that attic, into the annex and then put the bricks back in again, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s349">What else did we do during?</span> <span id="s350">Well we – I must say, just about every day we practiced.</span> <span id="s351">Practiced going up there, making sure that we knew how to do it, and how to do it the quickest way.</span> <span id="s352">We became expert.</span> <span id="s353">I tell you we were just experts in climbing up the ladder and going through the hole and putting back the bricks, I knew every brick by, by, by sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">01:52:00 And it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s355">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s356">Two and a half years in one room without leaving that room.</span> <span id="s357">You, you have a tendency of, of – you know, you could lose your mind, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s358">Then on top of it, of course, all of Holland – now the, the invasion of Holland took place, the invasion of Europe took place in 1944.</span> <span id="s359">D-Day, that was 1944.</span> <span id="s360">And the American forces and the British forces and the Canadian forces so on, they liberated every part of Europe, including Berlin.</span> <span id="s361">There was one little piece that was not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s362">They liberated Arnhem.</span> <span id="s363">You may recall the story of the bridge at Arnhem where the Americans lost a tremendous number of people.</span> <span id="s364">Well Arnhem, you know, the whole south of Holland, Holland is a small country.</span> <span id="s365">The whole southern part of Holland was already liberated.</span> <span id="s366">We were still up to the last day, we were still under occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Let me go back a little bit to, to the room.</span> <span id="s368">How, how did your mother handle being in that room for two and a half year?</span> <span id="s369">And the interaction between you and your mother and the pressure that came from being in that one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Well, my mother and I, we were well matched.</span> <span id="s371">We were we were easy going people.</span> <span id="s372">You might think that living together in one room would present – and especially between a parent and a, and a child – would present a lot of difficulties.</span> <span id="s373">I cannot recall that we had any major difficulties.</span> <span id="s374">It was very difficult for her, but she was a very understanding individual.</span> <span id="s375">She was.</span> <span id="s376">She did what she was told to do.</span> <span id="s377">She never complained.</span> <span id="s378">Never, never complained.</span> <span id="s379">I have never heard my mother complain.</span> <span id="s380">She was a very, very, very disciplined individual.</span> <span id="s381">Very disciplined!</span> <span id="s382">It's difficult.</span> <span id="s383">It's difficult.</span> <span id="s384">It's thank goodness, both of us had a strong background in, in we were disciplined individuals.</span> <span id="s385">And every morning that you wake up you thanked God that you were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">01:55:00</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Let's bring you back to that funeral story that you started to talk about before we got into the room.</span> <span id="s388">Can you pick that story up?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: The funeral story?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: When the wife died?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Well, the wife died, as I said, of natural causes, and she had, you know, she had to the funeral people had to come in and, and with the casket and the whole thing and take her out.</span> <span id="s394">And then the family had – this In't Hout family, they had a large circle of friends and a large circle of family.</span> <span id="s395">And all of these people would come to pay condolence calls.</span> <span id="s396">And here's this small city apartment of a college professor, not a – you know, on a, on a fixed salary who – with 50 people at one time.</span> <span id="s397">And here we are and of course, you cannot – even though this is family and even though these are friends, you cannot afford to tell anybody that you are hiding Jews because even though they may not on purpose want to tell anybody else, these stories go around and before you know it you have a problem.</span> <span id="s398">And so it was very difficult to make sure that nobody would walk into our room there.</span> <span id="s399">And nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: How did you get how did the food come to you every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Well, the food come to us.</span> <span id="s402">Well, the food was a big, big problem.</span> <span id="s403">The last year of occupation was the worst we have had.</span> <span id="s404">The hunger was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s405">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s406">Period!</span> <span id="s407">There was in Holland in that part, there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s408">We ate, we ate sugar beets after the sugar had been extracted.</span> <span id="s409">And with sugar beets you extract the sugar and you're left with pulp and the pulp you feed to the animals, to the cows in Holland that is.</span> <span id="s410">So this was stuff that you give to the cows.</span> <span id="s411">We ate this pulp every day.</span> <span id="s412">And it was cooked on a small, a tiny little, a tiny little–</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Hot plate?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Well, it wasn't a hot plate.</span> <span id="s415">There was no electricity so you put a little stick of wood in, but it was an ingenious kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s416">You – it was sort of a little, little pot with an opening and you put a little, little piece of wood in.</span> <span id="s417">There wasn't much wood either, and you just cooked this, this pulp, this sugar beets.</span> <span id="s418">It tasted horrible.</span> <span id="s419">Horrendous!</span> <span id="s420">But it's the only thing we had.</span> <span id="s421">And as in fact when the war was finally over, my mother had legs three times the size of her normal legs.</span> <span id="s422">Was like this.</span> <span id="s423">Just from hunger.</span> <span id="s424">And so did I.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: We're going to change tapes now.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">01:58:50 END OF TAPE #1</span></p> <p><span id="s428">TAPE TWO</span></p> <p><span id="s429">02:00:00</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: There was something I wanted to ask you but I missed it a little earlier.</span> <span id="s431">Can you tell me about the arrest of your father by the Gestapo, and the events following that?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s433">Well, as I mentioned to you my father was arrested in the summer of ‘42 in the farm house.</span> <span id="s434">And he was arrested.</span> <span id="s435">It was in the summer so he was just wearing his usual summer clothes.</span> <span id="s436">And he was sent to a concentration camp called s’Hertogenbosch, H-E-R-T-O-G-E-N-B-O-S-C-H.</span> <span id="s437">It was a concentration camp in Holland.</span> <span id="s438">We have letter from him.</span> <span id="s439">We have about a half a dozen letters than he sent from camp, not to us, because he doesn't know where we were but he sent it to these two ladies, our neighbors upstairs and in every letter, he asked for clothes.</span> <span id="s440">He was cold.</span> <span id="s441">My father was a sort of a sickly man slightly built, etcetera, and he stayed there through the fall and then the last letter we received from him was, I believe, in November.</span> <span id="s442">In November he still had no clothes and at one point he was so sick that we got a letter from him.</span> <span id="s443">When I say “we,” again it's the two ladies, got a letter from which they forwarded it to us where somebody else wrote in his name he was too sick to write the letter himself pleading for some warm clothes.</span> <span id="s444">As it turned out, somewhere in the month of December he plus many other people were lined up, we found out through the through the underground later, were lined up at the railroad track there in s’Hertogenbosch and were stripped of all their clothes and were put into cattle cars stark naked and transported clear across Germany.</span> <span id="s445">To where?</span> <span id="s446">Nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">02:03:00 It is obvious to me that he never made it because you can't be naked in a cattle car which is, you know, all open from all sides.</span> <span id="s448">And in the middle of December and not die, especially if you are in weakened condition already.</span> <span id="s449">So I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s450">I have no idea where he died.</span> <span id="s451">At least my brother, I knew he died in Mauthausen so that–</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Let me go back to the annex if I may.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Can you recall any other stories or events that occurred while you were in the annex, in that attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s456">Not much happened in that annex.</span> <span id="s457">We were there over and over and over again, but it was just the two of us.</span> <span id="s458">And we didn't sleep in the annex.</span> <span id="s459">We only went there wherever we heard something which we felt was out of the ordinary.</span> <span id="s460">Footsteps that didn't sound like somebody familiar, we would quickly go into the annex.</span> <span id="s461">We didn't live there.</span> <span id="s462">We only – this was our second hiding place, so to speak and otherwise, we were just in that one room.</span> <span id="s463">That one room which contain, contained – was one of, one of those beds that you push up against when you don't sleep on it, you push up against the wall.</span> <span id="s464">So we had two beds there, and there was a little desk and two chairs, and that was it.</span> <span id="s465">That was all there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Was there any chance that you could be ove– heard by any other people in the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s468">You could, except not us.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: But they could, they could hear you–</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: No.</span> <span id="s471">Because everything was done in a whisper.</span> <span id="s472">You stepped lightly.</span> <span id="s473">You didn't walk normally.</span> <span id="s474">Everything was done in a whisper.</span> <span id="s475">There was no way that anybody could have heard us.</span> <span id="s476">We were fully aware of that.</span> <span id="s477">The problem with all of this hiding was you were just hoping that the next day would come.</span> <span id="s478">And there's one interesting story.</span> <span id="s479">Because of the tremendous hunger, you know, we're talking about hungry people.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">02:06:00 I hope nobody has to go through hunger the way we did.</span> <span id="s481">Hunger is so painful.</span> <span id="s482">I would wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and jump up in bed.</span> <span id="s483">Why?</span> <span id="s484">Because I was dreaming I saw a potato.</span> <span id="s485">That was something that, that was like a nightmare.</span> <span id="s486">I saw a potato and I thought I could eat it.</span> <span id="s487">When, when I woke up it wasn't there.</span> <span id="s488">Just a potato.</span> <span id="s489">Not, not a meal, a potato.</span> <span id="s490">The hunger was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s491">We were – it, it, it was – we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s492">Absolutely nothing to eat!</span> <span id="s493">It was, it was – in fact, I remember our Mr. In't Hout one day, he was on a – he was coming home with one or two potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">02:07:00 He found them somewhere on the road.</span> <span id="s495">Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s496">He can home with these two potatoes.</span> <span id="s497">You thought he had found two diamonds in the street.</span> <span id="s498">They were just two plain potatoes.</span> <span id="s499">The whole family, we were all excited about those two potatoes.</span> <span id="s500">You can't believe what it means to be real hungry.</span> <span id="s501">Mr. In't Hout had a radio receiver which was completely illegal.</span> <span id="s502">And we heard the BBC with earphones.</span> <span id="s503">And I heard messages which were – and I, I only – I remember one message that came over from the BBC to the Dutch underground and it said, "The green cow jumps over the fence."</span> <span id="s504">That is one message that I'll never – what it meant, who it was meant for, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s505">“The green cow jumps over the fence.”</span> <span id="s506">And so we had in the attic, in our hiding place, we had a map of Europe.</span> <span id="s507">We had little flags, and since we were able to hear the BBC, we were able to see how the German army first moved east, and finally thank goodness moved back west.</span> <span id="s508">And we were still – I was still under occupation when Hitler committed suicide.</span> <span id="s509">We were still under occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Can you tell me about the events leading up Mr. In't Hout being caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s512">This was about four weeks, four weeks before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s513">Mr. In't Hout – and I didn't even know it in the beginning, later on I knew it – was also a member of the underground.</span> <span id="s514">He never told me exactly what he did.</span> <span id="s515">I don't know whether he told his children what he did.</span> <span id="s516">I know he didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s517">And four weeks before the end of the war he was out on a mission.</span> <span id="s518">What mission?</span> <span id="s519">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s520">And all of a sudden we get word that he was caught doing whatever he was doing and was executed.</span> <span id="s521">And that was four weeks before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s522">Here we are, two children, teenagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">02:10:00 The mother had died the year before of natural causes.</span> <span id="s524">Their father had just been killed and we had to get out of there in a big, big hurry.</span> <span id="s525">Didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s526">The underground found us another teacher.</span> <span id="s527">Man I'd never met in my life.</span> <span id="s528">So here we are again the last four weeks, we moved from one place to the next place.</span> <span id="s529">And that's when we – and that's when finally liberation came.</span> <span id="s530">I might say to you liberation came, we were so – the feeling that you have, having lived under German occupation, being called names for five years or being – you know, you, you're the lowest animal on this, on this earth.</span> <span id="s531">We were liberated not by the American Army.</span> <span id="s532">We were liberated by the Canadian army.</span> <span id="s533">Attached to the Canadian army was a small detachment of the Palestinian – there was a Jewish brigade.</span> <span id="s534">That's what it was called.</span> <span id="s535">The Jewish brigade.</span> <span id="s536">Well, I will say this to you.</span> <span id="s537">During five years of war, I don't think I have ever cried.</span> <span id="s538">When my brother died and when my father died, I think I never really shed a tear.</span> <span id="s539">But when I saw, for the first time after five years of occupation, I saw Jewish boys in Canadian uniforms with the Star of David, I absolutely broke down.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">02:12:00 I absolutely broke down.</span> <span id="s541">I cried like a little, like a little baby.</span> <span id="s542">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s543">I embraced them.</span> <span id="s544">I kissed them.</span> <span id="s545">I don't know what I did.</span> <span id="s546">Very, very emotional for me.</span> <span id="s547">Basically, you can really say that since the Anne Frank story is so well, well known, my story – you know, Anne Frank and I were both born in Germany.</span> <span id="s548">We both came to Holland in the early ‘30s.</span> <span id="s549">We both went to school in Holland and Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s550">I never met Ann Frank in my life.</span> <span id="s551">We both went into attic.</span> <span id="s552">We both were underground in hiding, just a few blocks from each other.</span> <span id="s553">We both were – had an annex.</span> <span id="s554">We both had everything – Anne Frank's and my story are very, very similar.</span> <span id="s555">Unfortunately for Anne Frank and fortunately for me, the end of the story was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about the surroundings of the last hiding place that you went to for that four week period before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: That was, that was–</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: How you were transported there?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: We walked.</span> <span id="s560">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s561">There was no street cars running any more.</span> <span id="s562">There were no cars running.</span> <span id="s563">Some people still had bicycles if they still had the tires.</span> <span id="s564">Wasn't difficult to have to have bicycles, but the problem was to have tires.</span> <span id="s565">And so we just walked.</span> <span id="s566">We walked wherever it was.</span> <span id="s567">It wasn't that far from where we stayed.</span> <span id="s568">It was within the you know, maybe four, five, six blocks.</span> <span id="s569">And we just walked there and it was again this happened to be a very young couple, no children, and small apartment.</span> <span id="s570">And they again they took us in.</span> <span id="s571">Never met them in my life.</span> <span id="s572">Had no relationship to them.</span> <span id="s573">Marvelous, marvelous people.</span> <span id="s574">I might say the Dutch people in those years were fabulous.</span> <span id="s575">They were really fabulous.</span> <span id="s576">Yes, there were the Dutch – like the Belgians, like the French, like everybody, there was a Nazi party.</span> <span id="s577">And there were Dutch people joining the SS and all of that, but in general the Dutch people were very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s578">Very helpful.</span> <span id="s579">In fact I might mention to you when my brother and I were arrested in 1941, the entire country of Holland went on strike.</span> <span id="s580">There was no railroad running.</span> <span id="s581">There was no street car running.</span> <span id="s582">There was no factory working.</span> <span id="s583">The entire country went on strike.</span> <span id="s584">Under German occupation remember.</span> <span id="s585">We were under German occupation.</span> <span id="s586">For a handful of Jews.</span> <span id="s587">And that really tells the story of what happened you know, how the Dutch people behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Can you tell me what happened after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">02:16:00</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Well, after liberation we – it's a good question.</span> <span id="s591">What, what’ll what'll you do?</span> <span id="s592">Where'll you go.</span> <span id="s593">The first place we went back to our former neighbors, the two ladies who had been supplying us with our rationing cards during the war.</span> <span id="s594">And they had gone and they had the key to our apartment.</span> <span id="s595">And they had taken out quite a bit of stuff from the apartment.</span> <span id="s596">They had taken out, for instance, my bicycle.</span> <span id="s597">And so the most important thing that I got when I got through the five years of war, I had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s598">And let me tell you.</span> <span id="s599">That was valuable.</span> <span id="s600">That's like here, in America, you have a car.</span> <span id="s601">Without a car, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s602">How are you going to get around?</span> <span id="s603">Well, in Holland, I had bicycle.</span> <span id="s604">That allowed me to do what I had to do.</span> <span id="s605">We finally got a room.</span> <span id="s606">We rented a room from a lady who was a widow and she gave us a room for nickels and dimes.</span> <span id="s607">My mother had two brothers in America who had left Germany before the war.</span> <span id="s608">One was a doctor.</span> <span id="s609">One was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s610">And, and they both married American women, and so when the war finally was over, we wrote to them and they sent us, you know, some dollars so that we could at least buy some food and so on.</span> <span id="s611">The strange thing happened.</span> <span id="s612">We were – as I said we left Germany in 1933, and we lived in Holland all these years, you know.</span> <span id="s613">We never became citizens.</span> <span id="s614">Not because you didn't want to become citizens but in Holland you did not – it was very, very, very difficult to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s615">It's not like in American, after five years you can become a citizen.</span> <span id="s616">So therefore we were foreigners in Holland.</span> <span id="s617">After the war, well the reaction of the Dutch people to the Germans was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s618">The hate that had built up over the years was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s619">They wanted to tear them apart whenever they saw a German.</span> <span id="s620">They really were ready to tear them apart.</span> <span id="s621">Here we were, after the war, my mother and I had just gone through five years of war.</span> <span id="s622">The next thing we find out we're in this little room from this lady.</span> <span id="s623">Next thing we have – there is a ring on the door bell rings.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">02:19:00 Dutch police arresting my mother and I.</span> <span id="s625">Why?</span> <span id="s626">Because we were German.</span> <span id="s627">According to the passport or whatever.</span> <span id="s628">So we were arrested.</span> <span id="s629">We were taken to a school where they, where they put all these people temporarily.</span> <span id="s630">And who are in that school?</span> <span id="s631">All Germans.</span> <span id="s632">And here my mother and I, we are put together with the same people that had haunted us, killed us, and we were in the same prison with them.</span> <span id="s633">Well, thank goodness, it didn't take very long and we were released because they realized, you know, what, what the situation was.</span> <span id="s634">And let me tell you, that was, that was a strange feeling to be in the same prison with the people who, who murdered your family.</span> <span id="s635">Highly emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How did you come to the United States after you contacted your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, we had actually applied in 1938.</span> <span id="s638">In 1938, we had applied to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s639">And all of those papers are also given to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s640">And if the war had started instead of in May of 1945, in June of ‘45 or maybe July ‘45, we would have been in the United States before the war, but the war just broke out before we had a chance to get there.</span> <span id="s641">So in 1945, after the war we had to go through the whole procedure again applying for permission to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s642">And we finally with the help of my two uncles and two aunts, with their affidavits and so on we came to the United States in the in the late, the last part of 1945.</span> <span id="s643">And I guess the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: How did – how is it to adjust to life in the United States.</span> <span id="s645">How did, how did you feel when you got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Well, the difference in life style, of course, is tremendous from Europe to the United States.</span> <span id="s647">I happened to love it.</span> <span id="s648">I, I, I had made up my mind from the minute I got off the boat.</span> <span id="s649">I came on a troop carrier.</span> <span id="s650">I came on a Dutch troop carrier.</span> <span id="s651">A troop carrier that brought Dutch merchant marine sailors over here to bring back since the Dutch had lost all of their ships through U-boats and so on, they purchased new ships here in the United States and these sailors brought the ships back to Holland and I was on that ship.</span> <span id="s652">And as I got off the boat, I came to this country, I had I think I had five dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s653">I had no money.</span> <span id="s654">I came here and my first residence was with the Stephen Wise refugee center in Manhattan , off Central Park West.</span> <span id="s655">Rabbi Stephen Wise had a refugee center where they put the refugees who came from Europe after the war, so I stayed there for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s656">And I might just mention to you.</span> <span id="s657">It's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s658">So I get here to this country.</span> <span id="s659">I had no money – five dollars.</span> <span id="s660">And but I knew about one thing.</span> <span id="s661">When you come to this country, you buy the New York Times.</span> <span id="s662">The New York Times has all the ads for jobs.</span> <span id="s663">So I remember my very first day, I went from Central Park to 59th Street – 59th Street in Central Park South.</span> <span id="s664">Central Park West and Central Park South.</span> <span id="s665">And there is a kiosk.</span> <span id="s666">It's still there today.</span> <span id="s667">There is a kiosk selling newspapers.</span> <span id="s668">And I bought the New York Times for a nickel, and I put the newspaper under my arm and I went to Central Park.</span> <span id="s669">And I went into Central Park and I sat down on a bench and I looked at this newspaper.</span> <span id="s670">Well, I've never seen anything in my life – I've never seen anything like this in my life.</span> <span id="s671">The newspaper was this thick.</span> <span id="s672">In Holland, we have a newspaper that is two pages.</span> <span id="s673">Here, you know, it took me 10 minutes to find out where the personnel ads are.</span> <span id="s674">So I finally sat down.</span> <span id="s675">And my English was very poor.</span> <span id="s676">And then I read the ads, and everything was abbreviated.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">02:25:00 I couldn't read English, never mind the abbreviated English.</span> <span id="s678">So I took my newspaper under my arm again and I said to myself, "I'm going to sat down at a bench where somebody else is sitting."</span> <span id="s679">So I went, took my newspaper, went to another bench and there was a man sitting there.</span> <span id="s680">So I opened up the newspaper and I turned to him and I said to them, "Could you tell me?</span> <span id="s681">What does this mean?"</span> <span id="s682">He says, "I not speak English."</span> <span id="s683">I thought, "Wait a moment?</span> <span id="s684">What is this?</span> <span id="s685">I'm in the United States and the man doesn't speak English?"</span> <span id="s686">I couldn't understand, I thought everybody….</span> <span id="s687">So I took my newspaper under my arm again, I go to another bench.</span> <span id="s688">Sat there and I opened up the newspaper and I turned to this man and said, "Can you explain to me?</span> <span id="s689">What does this mean?"</span> <span id="s690">He says, "I not understand."</span> <span id="s691">I said, "I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s692">I can't believe it."</span> <span id="s693">I'm in the United States and they don't under– they don't speak English.</span> <span id="s694">Well, to make a long story short, I finally got my first job at Gimbels.</span> <span id="s695">This was before – this was just before the Christmas – this was just when the Christmas season started.</span> <span id="s696">And I went to Gimbals’ employment department and they said – the young lady said to me, "What are you looking for?"</span> <span id="s697">I said, "What pays the most?"</span> <span id="s698">Well, the most right now is we need some wrappers.</span> <span id="s699">I said, "Well, whatever you need.</span> <span id="s700">I'm here."</span> <span id="s701">So they put me to work as a wrapper in the toy department.</span> <span id="s702">And everything went very fine until l day I dropped a toy, and the toy broke.</span> <span id="s703">And the manager came over.</span> <span id="s704">It was one of these expensive toys.</span> <span id="s705">He says, "Well, this is the end of you."</span> <span id="s706">They transferred me from the toy department to the rug department.</span> <span id="s707">They figured the guy can't do too much harm in the rug department.</span> <span id="s708">So I went to the rug department and I, I – these huge rugs, and I was 130 pounds in those days.</span> <span id="s709">So I worked and worked and worked and then I learned my first lesson.</span> <span id="s710">My first thing in America.</span> <span id="s711">I learned what a pink slip was.</span> <span id="s712">Never knew that.</span> <span id="s713">Christmas was over, and the day after Christmas I had a pink slip in my envelope.</span> <span id="s714">So that, that was my first job in the United States.</span> <span id="s715">But I also – you know, had made up my mind, as I got off the boat, the one thing, the one thing I wanted more than anything else, I wanted to become an American.</span> <span id="s716">When I say “an American,” I wanted to be an American like a real American.</span> <span id="s717">I didn't want an accent.</span> <span id="s718">I didn't want to sound like a refugee for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s719">And the one ambition I had in life is to speak and talk and act like an American and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">02:28:00 And that's what started my journey in America.</span> <span id="s721">I was a it was a tough beginning.</span> <span id="s722">My second job was in a dental lab.</span> <span id="s723">And I was offered a job.</span> <span id="s724">My first job I was making 20 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s725">And, and that's how I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: With the benefit of hindsight, how do you think the war and your experiences in the war have impacted on your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Well, I lost, of course, I lost five years of education.</span> <span id="s728">I lost the most important years of my life.</span> <span id="s729">When the war broke in 1940 I was 18.</span> <span id="s730">The war ended in 1945.</span> <span id="s731">I was 23.</span> <span id="s732">From 18 to 23, I basically did nothing but hide in a room, run away from the Germans and my entire education was interrupted.</span> <span id="s733">And when I came to this country, I couldn't afford to go to school.</span> <span id="s734">I had to make a living.</span> <span id="s735">I had five dollars.</span> <span id="s736">When I walked to Gimbels I didn't take the, the subway which was at that time only a nickel.</span> <span id="s737">I didn't have it.</span> <span id="s738">I walked there.</span> <span id="s739">And I walked back.</span> <span id="s740">And whatever I did, I walked because that five dollars was the only thing I had in my pocket.</span> <span id="s741">Until I got my first paycheck, it had to last.</span> <span id="s742">So, my education was – and you know, the most important years in anybody's life are really the years when you, you know, your college years is, you know, where the average person enjoys and gets what he needs for his future life.</span> <span id="s743">I never had that.</span> <span id="s744">Basically, I had a high school education.</span> <span id="s745">I had one year of college and that was a technical college because my father wanted me to become an architect like he was and I didn't want to become an architect so we settled on engineering school.</span> <span id="s746">So I went l year to engineering school.</span> <span id="s747">That was it.</span> <span id="s748">I never was able to really get back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Did your mother come to the United States with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s751">My mother followed me about four months later.</span> <span id="s752">She couldn't – this troop carrier that I came on, it was strictly for men.</span> <span id="s753">That was, you know, all sailors.</span> <span id="s754">And my mother came in 1946 and she came by airplane which was fabulous in those days.</span> <span id="s755">And she landed here.</span> <span id="s756">Now my mother was a trained baby nurse from, from Germany.</span> <span id="s757">And obviously she hadn't worked in oodles of years because she was raising a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">02:32:00 She was a housewife.</span> <span id="s759">When she came here, she back into nursing, and she did private nursing.</span> <span id="s760">Baby nursing.</span> <span id="s761">And she worked, she loved it.</span> <span id="s762">She loved children.</span> <span id="s763">She worked for the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations.</span> <span id="s764">She brought up the children of Senator Javits and situations like that.</span> <span id="s765">My mother's life was a very, very tough life.</span> <span id="s766">All her life.</span> <span id="s767">After all, in 1933, she was married maybe 12, 13, 14 years from that point on when she left Germany, she was the bread winner.</span> <span id="s768">My father wasn't allowed to – we were allowed to live in Holland, but he wasn't allowed to work in Holland.</span> <span id="s769">So we rented out rooms and my mother, you know, she was – she worked all her life until the end.</span> <span id="s770">Was a tough life.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: You mentioned before that you came to Holland because your father had a sister there.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did she survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: She, she did survive the war.</span> <span id="s775">Her husband died during the war.</span> <span id="s776">Her daughter died during the war, but she survived.</span> <span id="s777">An interesting story.</span> <span id="s778">However, she was extremely sick.</span> <span id="s779">She was she had cancer.</span> <span id="s780">And she had to go to the hospital back and forth for treatment.</span> <span id="s781">But there is – there are no ambulances.</span> <span id="s782">There are no cars.</span> <span id="s783">Nothing.</span> <span id="s784">But I had a bicycle, so I put her on the back of my bicycle and I drove her back and forth from her house to the, to the hospital and so on, on the back of my bicycle.</span> <span id="s785">That's where the bicycle came in.</span> <span id="s786">Very, very important.</span> <span id="s787">And, and then she died shortly after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: From the years since the end of the war, have you kept in touch with the children of the man who you stayed with for two and a half years?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">02:34:42</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s791">As a matter of fact, the son whose name was Dick.</span> <span id="s792">First name was Dick.</span> <span id="s793">D-I-C-K In't Hout.</span> <span id="s794">He came to visit us here in the United States and, you know, I took him around and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s795">The daughter married a, a Episcopal priest or something and they had children and so on.</span> <span id="s796">Very, very lovely people.</span> <span id="s797">Very religious people.</span> <span id="s798">Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Needless to say, you ask me, you know, the needless to say I, I just hope that what we have experienced – I just hope that 6,000,000 Jews didn't die in vain.</span> <span id="s801">I just hope so!</span> <span id="s802">I hope that the world will have learned something from this experience.</span> <span id="s803">It's too difficult.</span> <span id="s804">It was too difficult at the time.</span> <span id="s805">Too many lives were lost.</span> <span id="s806">Too many tears were shed.</span> <span id="s807">and I just hope that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren will live the kind of life that we hoped all of us should have.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
