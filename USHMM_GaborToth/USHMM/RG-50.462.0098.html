younger sister Yohanna.</span> <span id="s5">[whispers: What's going on here?]</span></p> <p><span id="s6">EA: Were you always Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">SS: Sylvie.</span> <span id="s8">Zylvie.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">EA: Zylvie, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">SS: Sylvia being an English family name.</span> <span id="s11">Actually it was a very unusual name in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">EA: Yes, I didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SS: I..</span> <span id="s14">.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">EA: How did you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SS: The same way it was [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s17">EA: With a Y?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">SS: With a Y.</span> <span id="s19">In fact one of my teachers always called me Zylvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">EA: Yes, [unclear].</span> <span id="s21">How did your parents find those names for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">SS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s23">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s24">Because my sister's name was Ruth, and Yohanna, which was more common then.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EA: Right.</span> <span id="s26">It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s27">Your parents also were from Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">SS: My mother came from what was at the time Poland, a small town near Krakow.</span> <span id="s29">It was actually a spa.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s31">SS: I have forgotten the name, but it might occur to me.</span> <span id="s32">My father came from Belgium, and before that from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">EA: He was born in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">SS: I believe so.</span> <span id="s35">And his parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s36">EA: Where did they meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">SS: In Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">EA: What was he doing...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">SS: I think the marriage was arranged.</span> <span id="s40">My grandfather was a very old-fashioned man, and their marriage was arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">EA: Your maternal grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">SS: My maternal grandfather.</span> <span id="s43">My paternal grandparents I never knew.</span> <span id="s44">I once met my paternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s45">She came to visit from Belgium.</span> <span id="s46">And she was quite senile, so I really never got to know her.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">EA: But your maternal grandfather heard about you father?</span> <span id="s48">How?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">SS: And I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">EA: Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">SS: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s52">I know that he was at the time in Cologne.</span> <span id="s53">My father was at the time in Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">EA: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">SS: He was a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">EA: Hmm.</span> <span id="s57">Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">SS: Oh, languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SS: My father spoke many languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">EA: Obviously Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">SS: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">EA: Belgian?</span> <span id="s64">Flemish?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">SS: Flemish, German, and I don't know how many other.</span> <span id="s66">I think seven all together I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">EA: Oh really.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">EA: You don't remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">SS: I remember him very vaguely.</span> <span id="s71">I but, I remember him somewhat, yes.</span> <span id="s72">I remember him, I remember what he called me, "Schäfchen."</span> <span id="s73">He called me, "Schäfchen"...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EA: Oh, not little lamb?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">SS: Which means, little lamb.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">EA: Too complimentary.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">SS: Little lamb.</span> <span id="s78">Little lamb.</span> <span id="s79">Yes.</span> <span id="s80">And, and also zylbucha [my pet Zylvie].</span> <span id="s81">That was because I cried very easily.</span> <span id="s82">I was a cry baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">EA: You were built near the water.</span> <span id="s84">[German idiom]</span></p> <p><span id="s85">SS: Near water.</span> <span id="s86">Yeah.</span> <span id="s87">And so I have strong memories of those two.</span> <span id="s88">[noise]</span></p> <p><span id="s89">EA: Actually gaps are O.K. because it's a conversation of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s91">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">EA: You know, everything is…</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s94">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">EA: So they were more or less the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">SS: Similar.</span> <span id="s97">[tape off then on] Similar in ages, yes.</span> <span id="s98">Very emotional!</span> <span id="s99">Requested to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">EA: How old roughly were they when they met, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">SS: No.</span> <span id="s102">I just know how old, approximately how old they were when their children, when we were born.</span> <span id="s103">I think my mother and father both were born somewhere around the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s104">I don't know if it's a year or two before or after.</span> <span id="s105">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s106">I think before.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EA: Did your mother already have a profession or...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">SS: My mother was very artistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s110">SS: Yes, she did dress designing and dress making, was very good with her hands, did needlework, art needlework.</span> <span id="s111">Kunstgewerbe it was called a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">EA: Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EA: Did you inherit that?</span> <span id="s115">Are you artistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SS: I think I probably am somewhat.</span> <span id="s117">I think I would have been had I had the training.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">EA: You had the interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SS: Yes, I do a lot of needlework.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">EA: Do you.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">SS: And I have done some painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">EA: How about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">SS: My daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">EA: Your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">SS: No, she in that sense is more like her father.</span> <span id="s126">But, although she has done a little.</span> <span id="s127">She does needlework beautifully, actually.</span> <span id="s128">Beautifully, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EA: How about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s131">I was wrong.</span> <span id="s132">She has inherited some of it, yes.</span> <span id="s133">Also, I think I inherited my love of music and literature from my mother.</span> <span id="s134">I don't know what I inherited...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EA: Was she a performer?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">SS: No.</span> <span id="s137">No.</span> <span id="s138">But she was known never to go anywhere without a book under her arm when she was young.</span> <span id="s139">She was very studious.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EA: And your father of course taught.</span> <span id="s141">What kind of a system did he work in?</span> <span id="s142">In the school system or the university system or...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SS: I am not sure.</span> <span id="s144">I have so little recollection of my father, unfortunately, be cause I, he was, I knew him only until I was about five or six.</span> <span id="s145">And then he became ill with tuberculosis, and I only saw him once again, in Poland, some years later.</span> <span id="s146">So, at that part of my life I saw, I remember very little of him.</span> <span id="s147">Let's put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">EA: But you must have some memories.</span> <span id="s149">He was young and [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s150">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s151">They are isolated memories but, and they are quite strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">EA: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SS: And I also know that he was a very affectionate man.</span> <span id="s154">Both my parents were affectionate.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">EA: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">SS: There was a lot of hugging and kissing going on in our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">EA: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s160">SS: We were very, I felt very loved as a child, by both my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">EA: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">SS: And there was great affection between me and my older sister.</span> <span id="s163">My younger sister died as a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">EA: How small?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SS: I think she was under two.</span> <span id="s166">She died of pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">EA: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">And my mother lived in constant fear of course of our being tubercular because of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">EA: And of course that was the time before antibiotics were...</span></p> <p><span id="s171">SS: Yes, exactly, yes.</span> <span id="s172">And, but actually we were quite healthy, the two of us.</span> <span id="s173">My older sister, Ruth, and I, were quite healthy children.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s175">Good.</span> <span id="s176">Do you have that fear still now or...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">SS: No.</span> <span id="s178">No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">EA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">SS: I don't remember having any such fear ever, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">EA: That's good.</span> <span id="s182">That's good.</span> <span id="s183">So what do you remember about your home life?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">SS: I remember going to school.</span> <span id="s185">I remember being ill as a child actually.</span> <span id="s186">I remember being in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EA: Oh?</span> <span id="s188">For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">SS: Pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">EA: Oh, you also had it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">Yes.</span> <span id="s193">But I recovered.</span> <span id="s194">I was sent to the country to recover.</span> <span id="s195">I already...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">EA: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">SS: I went to Bad Kreutznach which...</span></p> <p><span id="s198">EA: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s199">SS: Is a spa I suppose you would call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">EA: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">SS: A resort.</span> <span id="s202">And there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">EA: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">SS: I was in a convalescent home there.</span> <span id="s205">And that was a..</span> <span id="s206">.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">EA: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">SS: I loved it.</span> <span id="s209">Actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">EA: Did you!?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SS: Yes, I thought it was lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EA: With other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SS: I don't remember being with other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EA: You were away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SS: I was away from home, after being in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EA: Right, alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">SS: Alone.</span> <span id="s218">My mother came to visit me at the hospital of course, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">EA: In the hospital, but not in Bad Kreutznach.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">SS: Bad Kreutznach, no.</span> <span id="s221">I wasn't there a great length of time.</span> <span id="s222">I think I was there four or five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">EA: That's a long time for a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s225">But I wasn't, I was really well treated and I was not a, I don't remember being really unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">EA: Hmm.</span> <span id="s227">So who did you play with or, how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">SS: I was four, between four and five.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EA: Can you imagine now?</span> <span id="s230">A four-year-old being sent away for four to five weeks alone, to a convalescent home, with adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">SS: Well, it apparently was considered necessary at the time I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">EA: But you had no detrimental memories of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">SS: I had no bad memories of it, because I think my home life was very secure at the time.</span> <span id="s234">So I didn't feel a, I knew my mother was there and she visited.</span> <span id="s235">And I knew I was going home.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">EA: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">SS: I had not started school yet.</span> <span id="s238">When I came home my sister was already in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s239">No, actually first grade.</span> <span id="s240">My sister was in first grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">EA: Was that the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">SS: Public school.</span> <span id="s243">It was a Jewish school, not a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">EA: Oh, a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">SS: A Jewish school.</span> <span id="s246">Yes, well at...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EA: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">SS: That point, well, it was 1933, '34.</span> <span id="s249">And it was 1933 or 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">EA: Why did you have to go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">SS: Because it was, Hitler was already in power, and we were segregated.</span> <span id="s252">Jewish children were not to mix with Christian children.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EA: Was that a law?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SS: It was a law, yes [unclear].</span> <span id="s255">The Christian children were not to be contaminated by us.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">EA: Now, how much of that did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">SS: Oh, I was well aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">EA: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">SS: I was well aware of it.</span> <span id="s260">I was aware of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">EA: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">SS: Because my mother was a very modern woman, and life went on, and very little was kept from us.</span> <span id="s263">She tried once, when I was shopping with her, and we saw an old Jewish man being arrested.</span> <span id="s264">And he was dragged, physically dragged out of his shop and pulled along the street shouting, "I haven't done anything!"</span> <span id="s265">And my mother tried to push me into a store.</span> <span id="s266">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s267">I had already heard, seen everything.</span> <span id="s268">She tried to hide me.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">EA: To hide you.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">SS: And it was too late.</span> <span id="s271">I had seen it, had heard.</span> <span id="s272">I was terribly, terribly shocked by it.</span> <span id="s273">It is a very vivid memory.</span> <span id="s274">It's my first vivid memory of the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">EA: Did you ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">EA: You...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">EA: Were free to ask your mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">SS: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">EA: What's going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">EA: What did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">SS: Well, I was told to be quiet, bec--out of fear.</span> <span id="s285">I was told to be very, very quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">EA: Did you bring it up at home again?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">SS: No.</span> <span id="s288">I don't remember bringing it up, but from then on I was aware.</span> <span id="s289">My sister and I were both aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">EA: Do you remember talking about any of these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">SS: I remember hearing my family talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">EA: In hushed voices or loud so that you could hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">SS: No, it was hushed because it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s294">We were aware that one must talk quietly at home, and never outside the home about Hitler or anything to do with the regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">EA: So you knew to be quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s297">I remember feeling, I suppose you would call it a split.</span> <span id="s298">There was one life at home, and another life outside the home.</span> <span id="s299">One was relatively safe behind our doors.</span> <span id="s300">But out in the world it was extremely dangerous.</span> <span id="s301">And this was 1935, 1936.</span> <span id="s302">It was very early in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">EA: That's early all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">EA: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">SS: I was born in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">EA: So you were seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s309">My sister was a year older.</span> <span id="s310">My sister Ruth was a year older.</span> <span id="s311">There was only about, there were fifteen months between our ages.</span> <span id="s312">She was fifteen months older than I. And very soon we were no longer able to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">EA: Even to the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">SS: To the Jewish school alone, we had to be accompanied.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">EA: Well it wasn’t safe there.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">We went for a while just the two of us.</span> <span id="s318">And then we picked up, on the way we picked up a distant cousin who then walked with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">EA: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">SS: She was also our age.</span> <span id="s321">Her name was also Sylvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s323">SS: Interestingly enough.</span> <span id="s324">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">EA: So the three of you...</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SS: The three of us would...</span></p> <p><span id="s327">EA: Would go to school...</span></p> <p><span id="s328">SS: Go to school and back.</span> <span id="s329">Then one day on the way home from school we had dropped off, the cousin had left, and we continued our way home.</span> <span id="s330">And there, it began, the Hitler Youth began to taunt us.</span> <span id="s331">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">EA: Children or...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">SS: Men, young children.</span> <span id="s334">I would say teenagers, early teenagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">EA: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">SS: They began to shout at me, "Don't go with a Jew!"</span> <span id="s337">I did not look Jewish, being fair, red headed, fair skinned.</span> <span id="s338">My sister was the opposite, very dark, and looked Jewish where I did not.</span> <span id="s339">And there was, in the beginning it, they said, "Get away from the Jew!</span> <span id="s340">Don't have anything to do with her!"</span> <span id="s341">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">EA: But they only shouted.</span> <span id="s343">They didn't physically...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">SS: At that point it was just shouting.</span> <span id="s345">And we became very, I became very frightened by that.</span> <span id="s346">My sister was much braver, at least I thought she was.</span> <span id="s347">And perhaps she was, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">EA: In what way?</span> <span id="s349">Did she answer them back or how did she react?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">SS: No, no, it's, well I think it's, well the reason I thought she was braver is because I didn't know what she was feeling.</span> <span id="s351">I just knew what I was feeling, [chuckles] which perhaps explains that.</span> <span id="s352">Also she was an older sister, and I always thought of her...</span></p> <p><span id="s353">EA: Fifteen months?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">SS: I know, but she was always more serious, and I remember her as being the clever one.</span> <span id="s355">I was the cute one, and she was the clever one.</span> <span id="s356">This is the memory I have.</span> <span id="s357">I don't know how much truth there was.</span> <span id="s358">Probably quite true.</span> <span id="s359">And one day, on the way home, from, we were being chased by some of these Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s360">And we just couldn't run fast enough.</span> <span id="s361">And my sister was hit on the head, and fell backwards, and hit the back of her head on the curb stone...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EA: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">SS: Of the sidewalk, and lay there bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">EA: Were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">SS: And I cou-...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">EA: With her?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">SS: I was.</span> <span id="s368">I couldn't find anyone to help her.</span> <span id="s369">And so when she was able to get up, I had to walk home with her, holding my handkerchief over her head.</span> <span id="s370">And my mother took her to the doctor.</span> <span id="s371">She was stitched up.</span> <span id="s372">And then we forgot about it, until...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">EA: Could you go to any doctor at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">SS: Well, we went to Dr. Auerbach, who was a Jewish doctor and lived around the corner from us.</span> <span id="s375">I assume that he was our family doctor.</span> <span id="s376">I remember going to him ever since I could remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">EA: Do you think you could have gone to any doctor, the nearest doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">SS: I..</span> <span id="s379">.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">EA: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">SS: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s382">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">EA: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">SS: Again, Jews just didn't do that.</span> <span id="s385">Also...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">EA: Was it a written law do you think or an unwritten?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">SS: At that point I suspect it was unwritten.</span> <span id="s388">But of course within a very short time notices began to appear in shop windows.</span> <span id="s389">By this time, I think it was 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">EA: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">SS: Juden unerwünscht, Jews Are Not Wanted Here, which meant not only that they were not wanted.</span> <span id="s392">It meant that they were not allowed, basically.</span> <span id="s393">I do know that some of our local shops did not want these signs in their windows, but they had no choice.</span> <span id="s394">Or they claimed they had no choice.</span> <span id="s395">And although they told my mother, "You can continue shopping here," my mother did not.</span> <span id="s396">I think not out of fear at that point, but out of pride.</span> <span id="s397">And I learned that she was a very proud person.</span> <span id="s398">Later on, it seemed that we were constantly being harassed by Gestapo, who would knock on the door morning, noon, night, any time, and when the door was opened would shout at my mother, "Heil Hitler!"</span> <span id="s399">And my mother would answer, "Good morning," or "Good afternoon," whatever the case would be.</span> <span id="s400">And they would repeat, "Heil Hitler!"</span> <span id="s401">And she would say, "Good morning," until I, cowering in the corner would say, "My God", I would say to myself, "Why doesn't she just say Heil Hitler so they'll stop?"</span> <span id="s402">And I was terribly frightened, and not very courageous at all, not like my mother.</span> <span id="s403">But she continued to say, "Good morning," and eventually at that point they just asked for her passport or what it all, whatever they came for.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EA: Is that what they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">SS: They wanted to see her passport, papers of some kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">EA: Why should she have a passport in 1936 or seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">SS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s408">I was not old enough to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">EA: Was your father home at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">SS: No, he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">EA: Were they asking for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s413">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s414">I hid.</span> <span id="s415">I was terrified of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s416">Then I remember in 19--early in 1938 I think it was now, and of course all of this is being said as I remember it.</span> <span id="s417">I..</span> <span id="s418">.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">EA: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">SS: Time may be not, you know, the dates may be somewhat wrong when I say '37 it could be '38 or...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">EA: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">SS: I remember coming home from school and getting caught in a tremendous mob of people.</span> <span id="s423">And when we looked up in the distance, we saw very, very clearly a car, an open car.</span> <span id="s424">And in it was a standing figure, Adolf Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">EA: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">SS: He was coming through Cologne, yes.</span> <span id="s427">And we tried of course to run away, but the crowd was so tremendous we could not, we were actually caught up in it.</span> <span id="s428">We couldn't move.</span> <span id="s429">It was a, really a mob scene.</span> <span id="s430">And the physical...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">EA: Were you curious, like everybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">SS: No.</span> <span id="s433">We were terrified, and wanted to get away and go home where it was safe, or relatively safe.</span> <span id="s434">No of course we weren't curious.</span> <span id="s435">We were far too terrified to be curious.</span> <span id="s436">We lived in a state of fear.</span> <span id="s437">And everyone was, their hands were up in the salute, shouting, "Heil Hitler!</span> <span id="s438">Sieg Heil!</span> <span id="s439">Sieg Heil!"</span> <span id="s440">And, my sister looked at me and I looked at her, and her hand came up and so mine came up with relief, and of course we raised our hands, because we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">EA: [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s442">SS: [unclear] we were afraid not to.</span> <span id="s443">We would have been killed.</span> <span id="s444">I think we would have, I mean the mob was so frenzied that we didn't dare not.</span> <span id="s445">I think that, I would not have done it unless my sister had.</span> <span id="s446">I took my cue from her at all times.</span> <span id="s447">And once she did, I did too.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">EA: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">SS: And I remember feeling disloyalty and guilt, but we did it.</span> <span id="s450">We had to, actually.</span> <span id="s451">There was really no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">EA: You remember those feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">SS: I remember exactly what I felt, exactly what I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">EA: What a dilemma for a young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">SS: Yes, it was, really it was.</span> <span id="s456">I remember we did not tell at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">EA: You did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">SS: No.</span> <span id="s459">That's the one thing I remember not telling.</span> <span id="s460">I think it's because my mother was so courageous, and I was ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EA: Oh, you didn't tell that you didn't put, that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">SS: Had...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">EA: Saluted.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">EA: But you did tell her that the crowds were there...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">EA: Before Hitler and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s469">Yes.</span> <span id="s470">But we did not tell that we saluted.</span> <span id="s471">Because I remember how many times the Gestapo said, "Heil Hitler," and my mother did not say, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s472">So how could I possibly admit that I raised my hand in such a salute?</span> <span id="s473">I didn't dare.</span> <span id="s474">I felt too ashamed.</span> <span id="s475">Both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">EA: Well, that's interesting, yes.</span> <span id="s477">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">SS: I was in constant, constant fear.</span> <span id="s479">I mean we absolutely lived in fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">And yet physically, except for that Hitler Youth incident with Ruth, you had not personally...</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SS: No, except that we heard at home such and such happened to so and so.</span> <span id="s483">We knew what was happening, because we had friends who were taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s484">My father was missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">EA: Oh?</span> <span id="s486">Missing how?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">SS: He had gone to see his mother in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">EA: Regularly, with a regular ticket and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s490">And he did not return.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">EA: What year was that, Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">SS: This was in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">EA: Did not return?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">SS: And my mother was sure that he was in a concentration camp or something had happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">EA: There was no communication even?</span> <span id="s496">No letters?</span> <span id="s497">No phone?</span> <span id="s498">No nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">SS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s500">No.</span> <span id="s501">We did meet him again later, but I'll come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s503">Oh my God and no phone call?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s505">No.</span> <span id="s506">We could not find out where he was at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">EA: Now your grandmother was living in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">SS: My grandparents, my maternal grandmother, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">Your maternal grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">SS: My paternal, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">EA: Paternal, yeah, his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">SS: His mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s514">EA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">SS: Was living in Belgium.</span> <span id="s516">My grandparents, my grandmother had died in the meantime in 1933.</span> <span id="s517">But I remember her extremely well.</span> <span id="s518">I was five when she died.</span> <span id="s519">But my grandfather was still alive in '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">EA: Then you...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">SS: And they lived in Cologne, my maternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">EA: That is your maternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s524">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EA: But we're now talking about your paternal, your father's...</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SS: Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">EA: Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EA: Was living in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">SS: In Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">EA: What city?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">SS: In Antwerpen.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">EA: And he just went to see her, and was she living alone or...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">SS: I think so.</span> <span id="s535">I think so.</span> <span id="s536">I'm not sure, but as far as I know she was living alone then.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">EA: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SS: And I don't remember what happened, I don't know what happened to her, actually.</span> <span id="s539">I don't know.</span> <span id="s540">So then we were existing in this way.</span> <span id="s541">And one day, in October of 1938, to be exact it was the 28th of October...</span></p> <p><span id="s542">EA: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">SS: We went to school, oh, in the morning, first thing in the morning at about 6:00 the Gestapo came again, asking to see my mother's passport, and left.</span> <span id="s544">We went to school, where we began to hear terrible rumors of people being taken away.</span> <span id="s545">And finally we were told to go home immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">EA: This is amongst the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">EA: They were telling about their relatives and...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">SS: There were rumors that something was happening in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">EA: On the 28th of October already.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">SS: I don't know where they, October, in 1938, yes.</span> <span id="s552">And we came home and we were told that we had to go to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">EA: Now when you say, "We were told," do you remem-...</span></p> <p><span id="s554">SS: Oh, the Gestapo came.</span> <span id="s555">One of, a Gestapo person came to the door and said that we were to come to the police station, and we would be going home, you know, coming back almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">EA: They did assure you of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">SS: Uh huh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">EA: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">SS: No, of course.</span> <span id="s560">I've never been home since.</span> <span id="s561">That's the last time I ever left the house.</span> <span id="s562">I've never been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">EA: There and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">SS: There and then.</span> <span id="s565">No clothes, no suitcase, nothing.</span> <span id="s566">We were just asked to come to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">EA: You went.</span> <span id="s568">You...</span></p> <p><span id="s569">SS: My sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">EA: And Ruth, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">SS: And my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">EA: The three of you went there.</span> <span id="s573">As you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">SS: As we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">EA: How did you get to the police station, Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">SS: Do you know I cannot remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">EA: I believe you.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">SS: I remember walking out of my apartment, walking downstairs, and walking out.</span> <span id="s579">But the next thing I remember is being at the police station.</span> <span id="s580">And I remember being put in a--some kind of conveyance.</span> <span id="s581">I suppose, it wasn't a bus.</span> <span id="s582">I don't know whether it was a truck or a..</span> <span id="s583">.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">EA: Was it green?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">SS: Some kind of [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s586">EA: What color was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">SS: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s588">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">EA: Probably the "Grüne Minna" [Green Maria]</span></p> <p><span id="s590">SS: Could very well be.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">EA: Does that mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">SS: Like the black maria, huh?</span> <span id="s593">Something like that, yeah.</span> <span id="s594">Like a..</span> <span id="s595">.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">EA: A green, yes.</span> <span id="s597">A [unclear] and it's green...</span></p> <p><span id="s598">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">EA: That was the famous [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s600">SS: And the next thing I knew we were taken to the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">EA: Wait a minute, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s602">You were at the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">EA: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">SS: And then we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">EA: Were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">SS: With my parents.</span> <span id="s608">A lot of other people were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EA: With your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">SS: Yes, with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">EA: Right?</span> <span id="s612">Mother and Ruth and you.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">SS: Yes, my mother and sister, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">EA: O.K. So, and other people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s616">There were people there.</span> <span id="s617">That's when we went into the conveyance and were taken to the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">EA: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">SS: We were taken to the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">EA: Right there and...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">EA: Did you have winter clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">EA: My--you were taken to the railroad station by a police conveyance.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SS: By the police, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">EA: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">SS: And we were put on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">EA: Do you know where?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">SS: Where to, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">SS: Well I just know where we ended up.</span> <span id="s632">I don't know where...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">EA: You had no idea...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">SS: I had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s635">I don't know where, I assume my mother might have had some idea.</span> <span id="s636">I don't know.</span> <span id="s637">I don't think she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">EA: How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">SS: Thoroughly frightened.</span> <span id="s640">Very frightened.</span> <span id="s641">As time progressed I got more and more frightened, because we began to see more and more terrible things.</span> <span id="s642">We began to see, from a few people, it became hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s643">Every time we stopped, the train stopped, hundreds of people were put on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">EA: Oh, were you stopped a number of times?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">SS: We stopped constantly.</span> <span id="s646">After all, we were in the, in Cologne.</span> <span id="s647">And we crossed the whole of Germany.</span> <span id="s648">And, we ended up, I remember at one station, we ended up at the end of the day at a station where another train pulled in opposite our train.</span> <span id="s649">And there were a lot of people there who were very disturbed, and apparently had been travelling perhaps even longer, because they had had, well none of us had had any food all day.</span> <span id="s650">And there was a, some organization came with bread.</span> <span id="s651">And I think we ended up with a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">EA: Were they German organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">SS: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s655">EA: Somebody gave you some food.</span> <span id="s656">You don't know who the people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">SS: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s658">I have no idea who they were.</span> <span id="s659">I assume it was a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s660">But by that time we became aware of talking to other passengers, that all of us had Polish passports, every one of us.</span> <span id="s661">So it seemed as if all Polish citizens were being deported to Poland.</span> <span id="s662">This is what we thought.</span> <span id="s663">And to some degree we were quite correct.</span> <span id="s664">Now, you have to realize that in Germany, when a child was born, it was not automatically German.</span> <span id="s665">You took on the nationality of the mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EA: Of the mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">SS: Or the father, I don't know.</span> <span id="s668">It must have been the, well, I think it must have been the mother, because my mother had a Polish passport.</span> <span id="s669">And we were Polish, according to the Germans we were Polish, not according to the Polish, Poles.</span> <span id="s670">Of course they didn't agree with that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">EA: That's interesting, because you mentioned that your mother was from Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">EA: And your father was born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">SS: I believe my father was born in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">EA: O.K., that's interesting, isn't it?</span> <span id="s676">Because you would think it's a patriarchal system.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">SS: Well, of course you have to realize my father wasn't there, my mother was.</span> <span id="s678">And here were two children.</span> <span id="s679">Do you follow me?</span> <span id="s680">I don't think the German cared very much, the German state cared very much about having two children left alone there.</span> <span id="s681">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EA: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">SS: And so, there we were.</span> <span id="s684">I know that we were never considered German.</span> <span id="s685">Because birth didn't mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">EA: Particularly if you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s688">You know.</span> <span id="s689">So, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">EA: You traveled by train in...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SS: Train to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s692">EA: To the Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">SS: [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EA: And what were the Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">SS: To the, towards Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">EA: To the Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">SS: We arrived I think at night.</span> <span id="s698">And we were dumped at a place called Zbaszyn, which was a no-man's land.</span> <span id="s699">It was not German, and it was not Polish.</span> <span id="s700">It was on the border, as I recall.</span> <span id="s701">And there we were dumped at the railroad station and there were many people already there.</span> <span id="s702">And there were people still arriving.</span> <span id="s703">And this went on all night.</span> <span id="s704">It was bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s705">We had no place to even sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">EA: What was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">SS: There was a railroad station, a waiting room.</span> <span id="s708">You can imagine, there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s709">EA: A waiting room.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">SS: Thousands of people.</span> <span id="s711">And that night somebody covered me with an overcoat and I slept on a table in the waiting room, on top of a table.</span> <span id="s712">They asked people to let the children, some of the children, lie down.</span> <span id="s713">The following morning organization began.</span> <span id="s714">There was an old abandoned mill, and we were allotted where to put the bed.</span> <span id="s715">We had little areas, and to sleep on we had a bunch of straw, and our family was, you know, put together.</span> <span id="s716">We had, it was a very tiny amount of space.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">EA: Men, women, children?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">SS: Everybody together, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s719">They were, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s720">EA: But you were together with your mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">SS: Yes, for a while.</span> <span id="s722">Eventually the children were separated from the parents, in another building, I think a church.</span> <span id="s723">There were also some barracks there.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">EA: What kind of barracks?</span> <span id="s725">Soldiers'?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">SS: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s727">I'm not sure whether they were for soldiers or whether they had been stables.</span> <span id="s728">It was that kind of very rough kind of thing.</span> <span id="s729">And we were getting some food.</span> <span id="s730">There was a convent nearby and I think we were getting some food from that source.</span> <span id="s731">I'm not too familiar, being so very young, and not concerned too much with that kind of organization.</span> <span id="s732">I haven't...</span></p> <p><span id="s733">EA: Of course not.</span> <span id="s734">Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">SS: I haven't got enough information.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">EA: But there weren't, you don't remember nuns in uniform coming, you know, in their habits?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">SS: Just vaguely, but only in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s738">After that, some other arrangements were made.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">EA: What were, who were...</span></p> <p><span id="s740">SS: What apparently happened was that the Germans deported us, and the Poles refused to let us in.</span> <span id="s741">And this became our home, these dreadful conditions.</span> <span id="s742">It was the beginning of November by then, and it was terribly cold in that area.</span> <span id="s743">Poland, after all, was freezing.</span> <span id="s744">We had inadequate everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">EA: Did they have blankets?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">SS: No, straw we had beneath us...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">EA: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">SS: Eventually...</span></p> <p><span id="s749">EA: Left in October, therefore...</span></p> <p><span id="s750">SS: The end of October, by the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s751">EA: You had no clothing with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">SS: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s753">And the conditions were unbelievable, just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s754">On top of which, people were going mad.</span> <span id="s755">I remember one man went absolutely berserk.</span> <span id="s756">He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s757">He went completely berserk.</span> <span id="s758">People became violent.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">EA: Towards each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">SS: No, I think they became violent in terms, they were mentally ill.</span> <span id="s761">They became mentally ill.</span> <span id="s762">I remember one or two children, frozen to death, later.</span> <span id="s763">[weeping] It was just so terrible.</span> <span id="s764">It was absolute hell.</span> <span id="s765">And people constantly, in the middle of the night, having nightmares.</span> <span id="s766">People screaming for their parents.</span> <span id="s767">Crying, "I want to go home!"</span> <span id="s768">There were husbands separated from wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">EA: How was your mom?</span> <span id="s770">Was she comforting towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">SS: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">EA: Your mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SS: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s774">As supportive as she could be.</span> <span id="s775">I do remember feeling, “How can my mother manage?</span> <span id="s776">We have her, but who has she got?</span> <span id="s777">She's got no one.”</span></p> <p><span id="s778">EA: She had you.</span> <span id="s779">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s780">SS: No, for security, you see.</span> <span id="s781">We had her.</span> <span id="s782">I felt, I remember very strongly feeling, “Thank God I have my sister and my mother is with me.</span> <span id="s783">They are my security.”</span> <span id="s784">We were children.</span> <span id="s785">“She'll take care of us.</span> <span id="s786">Who's going to take care of her?”</span></p> <p><span id="s787">EA: Did you remember thinking that?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">SS: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s789">This was my constant worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">EA: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">SS: I felt that we were, we had more safety than she did, because she was our emotional safety, but who did, she had no one.</span> <span id="s792">She did, however, have a sister in Krakow, who was married to a Polish Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">EA: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">SS: And she managed to get word by mail to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">EA: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s797">And, well we were in this place during the winter.</span> <span id="s798">There was no running water.</span> <span id="s799">One had to go to a pump and get water.</span> <span id="s800">And the conditions were so terrible.</span> <span id="s801">And we talked at first, you know, the talk was all about going back, going back home.</span> <span id="s802">But of course after a while that became impossible.</span> <span id="s803">We spent the entire winter there, in these dreadful conditions.</span> <span id="s804">All of '38...</span></p> <p><span id="s805">EA: '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">SS: End of '38 into 1939, my sister, who was born in January, her birthday was there.</span> <span id="s807">So I know we were there January.</span> <span id="s808">My birthday's on the 4th of May, and I remember my birthday there, my eleventh birthday I spent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">EA: So you were there from October...</span></p> <p><span id="s810">SS: Until...</span></p> <p><span id="s811">EA: Until after May.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s813">May 4th was my birthday.</span> <span id="s814">I remember my mother somehow getting a birthday present for me there, an orange.</span> <span id="s815">I had no idea how she got it.</span> <span id="s816">I know it was the most precious thing, and that I hid it so that I wouldn't have to share it.</span> <span id="s817">Because I had not seen anything like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">EA: Have you any idea where she got it from?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">SS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s820">It was just, it appeared by magic!</span> <span id="s821">And, this orange, I kept saying, "I'll eat it tomorrow.</span> <span id="s822">I'll eat it tomorrow."</span> <span id="s823">[crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EA: It's O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SS: And in the end it was rotten and I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s826">I couldn't bear to eat it, because I wanted to save it.</span> <span id="s827">I saved it so long that I could no longer eat it.</span> <span id="s828">I don't know why this was so traumatic to me, but it was.</span> <span id="s829">I think it's pathetic.</span> <span id="s830">I think it hurts me more in retrospect...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">EA: I'm sure of that.</span> <span id="s832">It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">SS: Than it really did at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">EA: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">SS: You know, I think that's why I'm so upset by it now.</span> <span id="s836">Because it seems so sad, that I could not even enjoy such a tremendous treat, something that I never saw again until I came to England.</span> <span id="s837">And even then, hardly.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">EA: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">SS: So it was really, it was awfully sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">EA: In those days of course there wasn't the import and export like we have it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">SS: No, no, an orange was a..</span> <span id="s842">.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">EA: [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">SS: Was a very precious thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">SS: It was a [unclear], particularly when we ate basically potatoes and when, and we even saved the peels and cooked that when there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s847">I mean, everything was...</span></p> <p><span id="s848">EA: Did you cook in Zbaszyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">SS: There was a like a field kitchen set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">EA: Who were the responsible people?</span> <span id="s851">Were the men?</span> <span id="s852">Women?</span> <span id="s853">Soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">SS: I think men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">EA: Oh, of...</span></p> <p><span id="s856">SS: We...</span></p> <p><span id="s857">EA: Of these...</span></p> <p><span id="s858">SS: You know Jews, they manage to organize everything.</span> <span id="s859">They were put to work, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">EA: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s861">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">SS: So you'd keep some kind of order there and to, eventually even they tried to have some classes for the children and occupy them.</span> <span id="s863">But I remember long, long periods of inactivity and too much thinking and worrying and wondering, “Are we going to get out of here?”</span> <span id="s864">And rumors, and fear, terrible fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">EA: Do you remember being with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s867">Yes, there were other children.</span> <span id="s868">We were eventually put in a different area to sleep.</span> <span id="s869">I think it's because there was, we saw too much as children.</span> <span id="s870">I mean people lived as man and wife, and we were so in the middle of everything.</span> <span id="s871">We were not, there were no walls.</span> <span id="s872">Everything was visible.</span> <span id="s873">And you know, people when they are so insecure and so frightened and so worried, they, there is a great deal of comfort in sexual intercourse between husband and wife.</span> <span id="s874">And these things did occur, and we as children were just, we shouldn't have been there.</span> <span id="s875">And so we were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s876">EA: You were eleven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">EA: So you really had...</span></p> <p><span id="s879">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">EA: Your sexual awareness very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">SS: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s882">And so the children were eventually put in a separate area.</span> <span id="s883">I think that there was an old, it had been a, it was an unused church.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">EA: But you were with Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">EA: Were the conditions a little better there for the children, or did you still sleep straw?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">SS: No, we still slept on straw.</span> <span id="s888">My aunt sent us a package, which came through once, and I remember getting a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s889">Oh, it must have been in the parcel.</span> <span id="s890">And this toothbrush...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">EA: Could you have gone to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">EA: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">SS: The Poles wouldn't let us in.</span> <span id="s895">That's why we were on the border to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">EA: So you did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">SS: We did eventually get to Krakow though.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">EA: Oh, all right.</span> <span id="s899">I'm sorry I interrupted.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">SS: It's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">EA: You got a package?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">SS: And I remember getting a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s903">And this toothbrush was my only possession.</span> <span id="s904">And it became my identity.</span> <span id="s905">[both chuckle] Yes.</span> <span id="s906">I remember I, every morning when I woke up, the first thing I looked for was my toothbrush.</span> <span id="s907">And one day, in the middle of, one day, one night, my mother came to where we were sleeping, which she never did, because the children were separate, and she woke us up.</span> <span id="s908">I think this was at the end, towards the middle or end of May.</span> <span id="s909">That's about as close as I can get it.</span> <span id="s910">Actually, it might have been the end of May, perhaps even the beginning of June.</span> <span id="s911">But I think it was the end of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">EA: In '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">SS: Yeah, '39, yes.</span> <span id="s914">My mother woke us up in the middle of the night and told us to be very, very quiet, that we were going to go out, and we were not to make any noise or wake anyone.</span> <span id="s915">Everyone was sleeping.</span> <span id="s916">And there was a man with her.</span> <span id="s917">He looked like an official.</span> <span id="s918">He had a uniform.</span> <span id="s919">I think he might have been a Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s920">I don't know.</span> <span id="s921">And I immediately groped, in my sleep, or in my still sleepy, I groped for my toothbrush.</span> <span id="s922">And I couldn't find it immediately.</span> <span id="s923">And my mother said, "Come quickly, quickly, and quietly."</span> <span id="s924">And I couldn't leave until I finally found my toothbrush.</span> <span id="s925">Then I was able to go with her.</span> <span id="s926">I couldn't leave my toothbrush behind.</span> <span id="s927">It would be like leaving part of myself behind.</span> <span id="s928">And we left.</span> <span id="s929">We were taken to the railroad station, just my mother and my sister and I.</span> <span id="s930">We went on a train.</span> <span id="s931">We were on the train during the night.</span> <span id="s932">And my mother told us we are going to Tante Ghetti in Krakow, but to be very, very quiet.</span> <span id="s933">I think, I don't know whether she told me, but I have a strong conviction that we were illegally.</span> <span id="s934">My mother somehow got someone to get her out of there.</span> <span id="s935">Or my aunt, perhaps, in Krakow, had managed it.</span> <span id="s936">But we did get out of Zbaszyn, at a time when no one had got out.</span> <span id="s937">And we went to Krakow to my aunt.</span> <span id="s938">And I remember arriving there.</span> <span id="s939">And I had three cousins, girls, three beautiful girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">EA: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">SS: My aunt and uncle, my uncle was very religious.</span> <span id="s942">He did not get on with my mother, apparently, because she was, although we had come from a religious background and had a kosher home, my mother became suddenly very anti-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">EA: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">EA: You as a little

this?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">SS: Yes, of course I do.</span> <span id="s957">Yes, yeah, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">EA: That is beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">EA: Because there was singing, your, you said there was music and your mother was somebody who would sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">SS: My mother,

cousins.</span> <span id="s973">And we could not leave the house, because we didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s974">For safety we were given three phrases to learn by heart, Polish phrases, in case anyone ever, by some accident we were discovered.</span> <span id="s975">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s976">EA: Do you remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">SS: No.</span></p>

right, "I'm going to my friend's."</span> <span id="s987">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">SS: That's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">EA: Did you have to use it at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">SS: No, no, because we never left the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">EA: Because you didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s992">SS: Yes.</span> <span

Well, let's see, it was May, the end of May.</span> <span id="s998">In June, no, early July, my mother had been trying to get us on a Kinder transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">EA: And, was that from Zbaszyn already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">SS: Oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">EA: Oh, you mean from Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">SS: [unclear] from Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">EA: From Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">SS: We had heard even in Zbaszyn about the Kinder transport.</span> <span id="s1005">But she had to try again from Krakow because we were no longer in Zbaszyn, and if we were called, we would not be able to answer.</span> <span id="s1006">So she continued trying to get us on from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1007">And finally we were told we were going.</span> <span id="s1008">My mother took us to the train station, took us to Warsaw, where we, from where we went to a place called Otwock [Otwock is near Warsaw], which was near Gdynia, and where these children were naturally awaiting a ship to Eng--to go to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">EA: From Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">SS: Yes.</span> <span

we were going to be met.</span> <span id="s1017">I remember being on the train with lots of other children, in Warsaw, whose parents were also putting them on the train.</span> <span id="s1018">And I remember some of the mothers grabbing their children back.</span> <span id="s1019">They couldn't let them go.</span> <span id="s1020">And part of me wanted my mother to come and drag us back as well.</span> <span id="s1021">Part of me wanted to go into safety.</span> <span id="s1022">And part of me was rather upset because she wasn't crying.</span> <span id="s1023">I thought, “What is this?”</span> <span id="s1024">And then as the train began to go, my mother turned, and I saw the tears coming down the side of her face.</span> <span id="s1025">And I felt relief.</span> <span id="s1026">She did care.</span> <span id="s1027">Now why I thought she wouldn't I don't know, but you know, children have strange thoughts, and fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">EA: Isn't that interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">SS: And there was something about being put on a train which makes one question.</span> <span id="s1030">I, perhaps I didn't realize how close the war was, or, it really was, or how really necessary it was.</span> <span id="s1031">But I never felt, so many of my friends have told me they felt they were going on an adventure.</span> <span id="s1032">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">EA: You did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1035">I was terribly aware of what was happening in Germany, and in Poland.</span> <span id="s1036">I was aware of all this dreadful antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1037">And I was aware of the danger we were in.</span> <span id="s1038">I was age 11.</span> <span id="s1039">I was, and long before.</span> <span id="s1040">I seemed always to have been so terribly aware of the danger, and full of fear, terribly full of fear.</span> <span id="s1041">And so I knew it was important to get away.</span> <span id="s1042">However, my mother continuously told us that she would come too.</span> <span id="s1043">She was making every effort to come, and that she was going to start learning English.</span> <span id="s1044">I think this was all done to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">EA: Release your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">SS: To comfort us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">EA: But do you know that she didn't make, or do you know that she didn't make inquiries about getting out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">SS: For herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">EA: Did any adults...</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">EA: Did any adults have a chance to get out, Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">SS: There was, no.</span> <span id="s1053">No.</span> <span id="s1054">Not at that point.</span> <span id="s1055">At least my mother didn't.</span> <span id="s1056">She had no opportunity to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">EA: And you knew nobody in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">SS: My, my...</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">EA: In England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">SS: In England, no.</span> <span id="s1061">No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">EA: Did you have relatives anywhere in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">SS: My mother had an aunt in America who would not help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">EA: She tried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">SS: She wrote to them continuously, in 1937, 1938.</span> <span id="s1066">And this woman wrote back and said, "It doesn't go with speed."</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">EA: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">SS: “Es gait nit mit.”</span> <span id="s1069">It doesn't go with speed.</span> <span id="s1070">This all takes time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">EA: And she took all the time you didn't have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">SS: Took too much time.</span> <span id="s1073">We didn't make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">EA: And how about your father's family?</span> <span id="s1075">Did they have any relatives in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">SS: I, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">EA: Anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">SS: Knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1079">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1080">I don't believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">EA: And at that time adults were not allowed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">EA: There was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">SS: No, one needed someone to bring you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">EA: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">SS: By that time it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">EA: I think maybe for the children we need to get something in there, because there were definite immigration laws, were there not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1089">I think that with my father being missing, my mother dared not go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">EA: She had, she wanted to find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1092">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">EA: And the other thing is that you were on the Polish quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">EA: Every country had a quota for emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">SS: But we weren't in the Polish quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">EA: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">SS: We were illegally in Poland, in Krakow, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">EA: You had no passport of your own, did you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">SS: No, not in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">EA: What sort of papers did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">SS: Well, when I came to England I had a Certificate of Identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">EA: Proof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">SS: That I, proof that I was a human being.</span> <span id="s1105">That's all.</span> <span id="s1106">Really no proof of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">EA: Date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1109">It did give my date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">EA: Did it have a place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">EA: Who authorized that, or who wrote it out?</span> <span id="s1113">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">SS: I think it was written out when I arrived.</span> <span id="s1115">No, it was written out by the refugee committee that got us to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">EA: Oh in these...</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">SS: And that was made out at...</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">EA: Certifi--in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1119">That was only made out...</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">SS: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">EA: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1123">Where we...</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">EA: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">EA: So, all the time that you were between Köln [Cologne] and Zbaszyn and so on, you had no papers whatsoever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">SS: I didn't, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">EA: You had no identity, did you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">SS: No identity at all.</span> <span id="s1130">No.</span> <span id="s1131">I didn't get an identity until many years later, in 1947, when I applied for American citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">EA: No, you got your first identity...</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">SS: Five years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">EA: I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">SS: It wasn't till 1951...</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">EA: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">SS: When I became a citizen of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">EA: Isn't that interesting.</span> <span id="s1139">But then you were very aware of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">SS: Oh, I was more aware than any, than many of the friends that I had spoken to.</span> <span id="s1141">I was really extremely aware, for such a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">EA: So you were on the train with Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">SS: And we arrived at this place where we met some of the children that we knew in Zbaszyn, who had already from there been sent to this place, to this orphanage.</span> <span id="s1144">It was an orphanage.</span> <span id="s1145">It had been an orphanage.</span> <span id="s1146">There were no orphans there.</span> <span id="s1147">We were the only children there.</span> <span id="s1148">And when the ship came in, to be, you know, to be loaded with these children, names were called.</span> <span id="s1149">And in mid-July, the names, the list came.</span> <span id="s1150">Everyone was terribly excited.</span> <span id="s1151">There were, I don't know how many children were there, but more than would fill a ship.</span> <span id="s1152">And this was in July of 1939.</span> <span id="s1153">It was getting quite late.</span> <span id="s1154">And the roll call came.</span> <span id="s1155">And of course it started with the A's, and since we began with B, it didn't take long before we heard Balbira, Ruth.</span> <span id="s1156">And then it went on.</span> <span id="s1157">And it went on.</span> <span id="s1158">And it went on.</span> <span id="s1159">And I said, "My God, what about me?"</span> <span id="s1160">And she said, "I'm not going without you."</span> <span id="s1161">And I said, "But you must go."</span> <span id="s1162">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1163">We were going to be parted, and I was going to remain there all alone.</span> <span id="s1164">And I was terrified.</span> <span id="s1165">And that's exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1166">My sister went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">EA: Oh, you're kidding!</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1169">And I remained there.</span> <span id="s1170">Yes.</span> <span id="s1171">I wrote to my mother, and she wrote back, and assured me that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">EA: Where did you write?</span> <span id="s1173">To your aunt's...</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">EA: And uncle's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1177">And of course there was correspondence between my mother and the two of us in this orphanage.</span> <span id="s1178">I have the letters that she wrote, and I have letters written to my sister that since, in England.</span> <span id="s1179">Ruth arrived in England in July of 1939 and went straight into a Wyberlie [a hostel].</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">EA: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">SS: A hostel, a..</span> <span id="s1182">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">EA: Hostile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">SS: A hostel, called Wyberlie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">EA: Wyberlie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">SS: Yeah, that was the name of it, and it was at Burgess Hill, in Sussex.</span> <span id="s1187">And she corresponded there with my mother and with me.</span> <span id="s1188">And my mother continued to write me at, from Krakow, to the orphanage in Poland, where I was.</span> <span id="s1189">And she told me not to worry, that there would be more transports, and that I would eventually get on a ship.</span> <span id="s1190">And July came and went, August started.</span> <span id="s1191">And it wasn't until the 25th of August that the second roll call came, and my name was on it.</span> <span id="s1192">And I thought...</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">EA: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">SS: “Thank God I'm going and I will be with my sister soon.”</span> <span id="s1195">And, I went on the ship, which ended up the last one to leave, because it was, it left five days before they came marching into Poland.</span> <span id="s1196">And on the 29th of August...</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">EA: Hitler marched into Poland on...</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">SS: On September 1st.</span> <span id="s1199">I left on the 25th of August, five days before, six days, no, five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">EA: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1201">And you went by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1203">And I arrived in London on the 29th of August, which again was four days, or three days before the war started, four days, before the war broke out in England, which was the, you know, which started on the 3rd of September.</span> <span id="s1204">And we were taken to a restaurant in London.</span> <span id="s1205">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">EA: Oh, you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">SS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">EA: You arrived in Dover?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">SS: No, in London.</span> <span id="s1210">We came straight to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">EA: You came...</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">EA: Straight to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">SS: They opened up the bridge, and we came into London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">EA: How about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1217">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">EA: Who met you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">SS: We were taken to a restaurant by a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">EA: What's the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">SS: The 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">EA: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">SS: Of August, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">EA: Oh boy.</span> <span id="s1226">Oh boy.</span> <span id="s1227">Just in time before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">SS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">EA: And you went straight to London, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">SS: To, yes.</span> <span id="s1231">The ship arrived in London.</span> <span id="s1232">We were all taken to a very large restaurant for lunch.</span> <span id="s1233">And there people arrived to take children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">EA: What kind of people came?</span> <span id="s1235">What kind of people arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">SS: Well, English people, who had agreed to take a child into their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">EA: Who found those [unclear] families, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">SS: I think it was Bloomsbury House Committee.</span> <span id="s1239">And from the restaurant, they were taken straight from the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1240">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">EA: You just sat there and waited to be picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1243">Now I don't know what the situation was.</span> <span id="s1244">I have gone through life assuming that these children were picked at random.</span> <span id="s1245">Whether this is true or not I don't know, to this day.</span> <span id="s1246">All I know is that I was left over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">EA: You were left over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">SS: I was the only one left over.</span> <span id="s1249">Whether it was because the person who was to come and get me changed his mind, her mind, or whether everyone picked somebody and I wasn't pickable, or take-home-able, or lovable, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">EA: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">SS: I don't know to this day what the situation was.</span> <span id="s1252">But, I'm, I went through life thinking that I wasn't, that I wasn’t wanted at that point.</span> <span id="s1253">And so the people, the restaurant people, said, "Well, would you like to stay with us?"</span> <span id="s1254">They had not planned to take a child, because they were very busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">EA: There was nobody from Bloomsbury House there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">SS: There must have been.</span> <span id="s1257">There must have been.</span> <span id="s1258">But when I was left over I suppose they didn't know what to do with me, and the Blooms decided to keep me, if I wanted to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">EA: That was a Jewish restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">SS: Yes, kosher restaurant.</span> <span id="s1261">And, I said, "Yes," although [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">EA: [laughs] You had no choice!</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">SS: No choice.</span> <span id="s1264">And, but I desperately wanted to go to my sister.</span> <span id="s1265">I wanted to go where she was.</span> <span id="s1266">And I was terribly unhappy in this, in this home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">EA: Did, you knew where your sister was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1269">She was in Burgess Hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">EA: And you knew her address?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">SS: I knew her address.</span> <span id="s1272">I wrote to her.</span> <span id="s1273">We wrote to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">EA: And you said to the Bloomsbury House, "I want to be with my sister."</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">SS: I said to the Blooms, the people who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">EA: Oh, to the Blooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">SS: Yes, I said, "I want to be with her," and "I'll take.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">EA: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">SS: Well, they took me.</span> <span id="s1280">And they wouldn't accept me, because I had, quote "spots" unquote.</span> <span id="s1281">I had psoriasis.</span> <span id="s1282">They didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1283">They would not accept me.</span> <span id="s1284">So back I went with the Blooms.</span> <span id="s1285">I cried day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">EA: But you saw Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">SS: I saw her, which only made it worse because I was terribly unhappy then without her.</span> <span id="s1288">And I cried day and night and I was so, I cried so hard that they actually heard me downstairs in the restaurant and sent up one of the waiters to see what was the matter with me.</span> <span id="s1289">And I was too embarrassed to tell him what was wrong.</span> <span id="s1290">I said I had a toothache.</span> <span id="s1291">Of course I was taken to the dentist, and, who couldn't find anything wrong with my tooth.</span> <span id="s1292">And I kept pointing to a tooth, and so he took it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">EA: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1294">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1296">I lost two teeth that way.</span> <span id="s1297">After that I thought, "Well, I can't go on like this.</span> <span id="s1298">I'll have to tell the truth."</span> <span id="s1299">So I told Mr. Bloom that I was so unhappy without my sister.</span> <span id="s1300">I wanted to be with her.</span> <span id="s1301">And so he said, "Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.</span> <span id="s1302">I'll just take you there and tell them I can't keep you anymore and leave you there."</span> <span id="s1303">He said, "Would you like me to do that?"</span> <span id="s1304">I said, "Yes."</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">EA: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">SS: And so they drove me there and said, "We can't keep her."</span> <span id="s1307">And that's how I got to be with my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">EA: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1309">But you knew that that was just an excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1311">He told me that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">EA: That, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1314">In fact, I mean, he sent me parcels.</span> <span id="s1315">I always got, you know, food parcels and sweets from them for many, you know, many months.</span> <span id="s1316">And then I was with my sister.</span> <span id="s1317">I was upset by the institution atmosphere, and a very strict matron who was terribly feared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">EA: Do you, was she German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">SS: No, she was English, but she was an absolute horror.</span> <span id="s1320">She was a dreadful person.</span> <span id="s1321">We were not allowed to speak anything but English.</span> <span id="s1322">Anyone who spoke German was punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">EA: Oh my word!</span> <span id="s1324">How many children were there in the hostel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">SS: About 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">EA: 60!?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">EA: 60 children?</span> <span id="s1329">All refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">EA: And that was run by a, who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">SS: By this matron and her little helpers, who were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">EA: Do you think you were paid for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">SS: No, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">EA: Are you sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">SS: I imagine so.</span> <span id="s1337">I mean I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">EA: Did you have anybody come and visit you from the Bloomsbury House or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">SS: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">EA: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">SS: We went to school, to the local school.</span> <span id="s1342">Up until then I had not gone to school, because all the time I was in London.</span> <span id="s1343">This, also and everything was evacuated.</span> <span id="s1344">But I remained there, because I, there was no place to send me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">EA: What part of London did the Blooms have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">SS: They lived in the east end of London, where their restaurant was, and their factory.</span> <span id="s1347">They were very wealthy.</span> <span id="s1348">And they had a very beautiful apartment, which took up the entire upper floor of the restaurant, and was very elegant, as I remember.</span> <span id="s1349">And they had two German girls who were about seventeen or eighteen, German refugee girls who did the cleaning, who came to clean.</span> <span id="s1350">Because that's all they could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">EA: Here we, on the domestic visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">SS: Visa, yes.</span> <span id="s1353">And the interesting part was that both these girls were from Cologne.</span> <span id="s1354">They knew me, they knew my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">EA: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">SS: And they hated me and were very unkind to me, because I was what they called, "The Princess."</span> <span id="s1357">I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1358">And I was taken care of while they had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1359">So, from the very beginning I was, I was never made to feel very welcome or happy.</span> <span id="s1360">The Blooms had a daughter whose name was also Sylvia.</span> <span id="s1361">And so of course I lost my name.</span> <span id="s1362">She didn't lose hers.</span> <span id="s1363">And I was not even called by my own name.</span> <span id="s1364">I was called Ginger, because we couldn't have two Sylvias now, could we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">EA: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">SS: And, there was another loss.</span> <span id="s1367">I mean it was just continuous trauma.</span> <span id="s1368">There was no end to it.</span> <span id="s1369">Anyway, by now I was in, at Wyberlie with my sister.</span> <span id="s1370">And this terrible matron who was always threatening to cut people's hair off, cut their braids off, and she was really awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">EA: Sadistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1373">She was really not nice, and I was very unhappy there, but I was glad to be with my sister.</span> <span id="s1374">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">EA: Approximately [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">SS: In a huge town it was a large house.</span> <span id="s1377">It had been a convalescent home and was made into a hostel for us.</span> <span id="s1378">Then, I think it was about February of 1941.</span> <span id="s1379">We were transferred from Wyberlie.</span> <span id="s1380">We couldn't stay there any longer.</span> <span id="s1381">We had, there were a lot of raids, air raids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">[voice interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">SS: The air raids, I don't know when the air raids started.</span> <span id="s1384">I know that we went through quite a few of them before we were moved from there.</span> <span id="s1385">And I must say, even though we were very frightened by the bombs flying around us, it was a different kind of fear, for me, anyway.</span> <span id="s1386">It was, it was we were with the good guys.</span> <span id="s1387">Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1388">We were afraid, but it was a different kind of fear.</span> <span id="s1389">It was not a terror.</span> <span id="s1390">We weren't being terrorized.</span> <span id="s1391">Somehow, it was different.</span> <span id="s1392">As dangerous as it was, we felt a different kind of danger, and it wasn't quite as--it wasn't as terrifying a danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">EA: It wasn't such a personal threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1395">Well, the threat was to our lives, but that's all.</span> <span id="s1396">[chuckles] Not to our way of life.</span> <span id="s1397">We were safe in terms, we weren't being persecuted, personally.</span> <span id="s1398">If we were going to be killed it was by something very impersonal like a bomb.</span> <span id="s1399">And that was less frightening to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">EA: Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">SS: In any event, we were then split up.</span> <span id="s1402">Some of us went to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1403">To a, I keep calling it a hospital.</span> <span id="s1404">A hostel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">EA: A hostel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">SS: A hostel, in Tunbridge Wells, at Kent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">SS: The Beacon.</span> <span id="s1409">In fact we all went there for about two weeks, and from there we were moved.</span> <span id="s1410">My sister and I were moved to a family in Rutherfield in Sussex, in a little village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">EA: Together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">SS: Together.</span> <span id="s1413">And we went to the same family.</span> <span id="s1414">It was an old couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">EA: Hmm!</span> <span id="s1416">That must have felt good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">SS: No, it didn't.</span> <span id="s1418">It was the worst thing that could have happened to me.</span> <span id="s1419">It was a dreadful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">EA: Ah, well, but you were with Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">SS: Yes, but that didn't last either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">EA: Oh no!</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">SS: It lasted about a week and when they decided they didn't have room for both of us.</span> <span id="s1424">It was a tiny little cottage, without a toilet, without a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1425">I mean it just was very, very primitive, no electric light.</span> <span id="s1426">It was all with gas.</span> <span id="s1427">And I think it was either that way or had just been converted.</span> <span id="s1428">It was really very bad.</span> <span id="s1429">And my sister was then taken by another family.</span> <span id="s1430">And she was quite happy there.</span> <span id="s1431">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s1432">The husband was an attorney, a lawyer, and they treated her very well and were very fond of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">EA: That was also in Rutherford?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">SS: In Rutherfield, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">EA: Rutherfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">EA: Where is Rutherfield?</span> <span id="s1438">In Kent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">SS: It's in Sussex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">EA: In Sussex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">SS: On the border, really, near Suss--near Kent.</span> <span id="s1442">And there we went to the village school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">EA: Wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s1444">Ruth went to the attorney.</span> <span id="s1445">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">SS: I stayed with this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">EA: You stayed with this couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">SS: Couple.</span> <span id="s1449">Yes.</span> <span id="s1450">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">EA: Oh boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">SS: And I hated them.</span> <span id="s1453">They were, they tried, they were the couple who tried to convert me.</span> <span id="s1454">They wanted me to become Christian.</span> <span id="s1455">And I was very frightened by it, and I didn't know what to do for quite a long time, because they threatened me.</span> <span id="s1456">They threatened that if I did not do as I was told, they would complain to the committee to say that I was untidy, that I was dirty, that I didn't wash, that I didn't brush my teeth.</span> <span id="s1457">I, who couldn't live without a toothbrush in a camp, you know.</span> <span id="s1458">It was rather ironic, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">EA: It was ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1461">And however, I mean, having come from a religious Jewish family there was no way I could be persuaded to become Christian.</span> <span id="s1462">And I went to the, to a woman who had, who was sort of in charge of this group of children in Rutherfield with the different families.</span> <span id="s1463">There were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">EA: Oh there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">SS: There were about a dozen of us, in different homes.</span> <span id="s1466">And there was this one woman who had one child.</span> <span id="s1467">But she was the person to go to if you had a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">EA: Oh you, so you did have somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1470">She was an English woman, a very strict Catholic, but a very understanding person.</span> <span id="s1471">When she heard that I was, that they were trying to convert me--I never told that they threatened to say that I was dirty and untidy, but I did tell her that they tried to persuade me to convert.</span> <span id="s1472">And she immediately found me a teacher, a Hebrew teacher, a Miss Lazarus, who taught me you know, religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">EA: And that what, that's to counteract?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">EA: You didn't complain about your conditions of that couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1477">There was an, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1478">I was absolutely afraid.</span> <span id="s1479">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">EA: Did Miss Lazarus come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">SS: No, I went to this woman, Miss Trouten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s1483">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">SS: But then Miss Lazarus came there to teach me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">EA: To her house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">SS: A really, yes, when I say to teach me, I mean I did come from a very Orthodox Jewish background, so this was just to keep me in touch with my religion.</span> <span id="s1487">And I think she was trying to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">EA: Counteract...</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">SS: Counteract.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">EA: This.</span> <span id="s1491">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1493">I also asked Miss Trouten if I could come and have a bath at her house, because there was no bathroom.</span> <span id="s1494">All I got was a bowl of water, and, to wash with in the morning.</span> <span id="s1495">And she let me come to have a bath there once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">EA: She did not offer to take you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1498">She had one child already, and she did not offer to take me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">EA: Did you know that child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">SS: Yes, she's still a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1501">We are...</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">EA: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">SS: Still very close, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">EA: Did you go to the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1506">We went to the same school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">EA: And you are still friends with her now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1509">In fact I've known her since Zbaszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">EA: Oh my!</span> <span id="s1511">That's great!</span> <span id="s1512">Wow!</span> <span id="s1513">"I was afraid to complain."</span> <span id="s1514">That's the name of this stor--game, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">EA: You were at their mercy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1518">So, I continued school till I was 14, then I was told, "It's time to go to work.</span> <span id="s1519">We can't support you any longer."</span> <span id="s1520">So they found me a job working in Tunbridge Wells, which was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">EA: How far was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">SS: In Kent, not very far.</span> <span id="s1523">But, and I was to live at the Beacon Hostel.</span> <span id="s1524">I was paid a minimum amount of money which I had to give up to the hostel, and I was allowed to keep a tiny amount of pocket money, six pence I think, or a shilling.</span> <span id="s1525">And it was in a lingerie shop, where I worked as an, what was called an apprenticeship, which meant I cleaned the floor.</span> <span id="s1526">I polished the floor.</span> <span id="s1527">I ironed the things that were to go into the window.</span> <span id="s1528">And the owner was a dreadful old woman, came in once a week to change the window, and make sure that everything was all right.</span> <span id="s1529">And I worked with another woman who was a manageress, who lived in Tunbridge Wells, who was a wonderful, wonderful person, and with whom I stayed in touch until she died two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">SS: Who was somebody very special in my life.</span> <span id="s1532">The only person at that time who had any care, who cared at all for me.</span> <span id="s1533">She was very kind.</span> <span id="s1534">She knew I had only one dress, and so she made me a dress but didn't tell me it was from her.</span> <span id="s1535">She said that the owner of the shop had a rule that anyone who came got a new dress.</span> <span id="s1536">This was totally untrue.</span> <span id="s1537">She did this out of the kindness of her heart.</span> <span id="s1538">And this, always very tactful.</span> <span id="s1539">And she knew I didn't really get enough to eat at the Beacon, and so she used to send me down the road to the bakery for some buns.</span> <span id="s1540">And we would have them with a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s1541">And I don't remember her ever eating one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">EA: [laughs] So we had a tea break, but you ate!</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">SS: It seems that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">EA: Wonderful!</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">SS: I really never had anything that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">EA: Was she English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">SS: An Englishwoman, yes, a wonderful, wonderful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">EA: Do you know I think, since you, we've started talking, except for your mother, your father, that's the first kind person...</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">SS: Yes, I think you're right.</span> <span id="s1550">I think you're right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">EA: You're talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">SS: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">EA: That you felt there was a bond of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">SS: Absolutely, yeah.</span> <span id="s1555">And I was grateful to her for the rest of her life, and will be for the rest of mine, I'm quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">EA: And you really became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">SS: Friends, yes.</span> <span id="s1558">I still go to see her husband, and I spend a day with her son when I'm in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">EA: They're still in Tunbridge Wells?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">SS: Her husband is in Tunbridge Wells.</span> <span id="s1561">Her son is in London, and I go to visit him.</span> <span id="s1562">And he's a very lovely person, a very fine...</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">EA: Did you know him then?</span> <span id="s1564">He was probably a child also then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">SS: He was a, yes.</span> <span id="s1566">He's only a year older than I am.</span> <span id="s1567">He was just a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">EA: Did you like him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">SS: At the time I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1570">I don't think I had anything to do with him at the time.</span> <span id="s1571">He'd come into the shop occasionally, but we never spoke.</span> <span id="s1572">I was extremely shy, and perhaps he was too.</span> <span id="s1573">I, of course, assumed he didn't like me, but that was natural for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">EA: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">SS: So, but I find that, him to be a very compassionate and a very fine person, which is not surprising, with such a mother.</span> <span id="s1576">So, obviously my thinking he didn't like me was my problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">EA: Well, you were only 14 anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">EA: Were there boys and girls at the Beacon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">SS: No, just girls.</span> <span id="s1581">So, then, this was, actually, this was in September of 1942 that I started there.</span> <span id="s1582">I was there for nearly two years, and living at the Beacon at the time.</span> <span id="s1583">Then, in August of 1944--again I'm giving these dates and I'm not sure of them--I went to complain.</span> <span id="s1584">I met a Mrs. Bethel, who was the committee, one of the committee, she was employed by the committee.</span> <span id="s1585">She was not a part of the committee.</span> <span id="s1586">And I said that I was unhappy with what I was doing and I felt that I should learn something and would it be possible to get a course in shorthand and typing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">EA: Good!</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">SS: And she said, "I will try."</span> <span id="s1589">She said, "It's very difficult."</span> <span id="s1590">I was also aware that there were some children at the Beacon who were even having piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1591">And I thought, "What is this?</span> <span id="s1592">I'm slaving away here, for ten shillings a week, cleaning floors, while somebody else is getting piano lessons!</span> <span id="s1593">There must be some money somewhere!"</span> <span id="s1594">And so, Mrs. Bethel said she would do her best.</span> <span id="s1595">And she was a Canadian woman, who I had a very strong rapport with, a very good rapport with.</span> <span id="s1596">And somehow she managed.</span> <span id="s1597">There were people in, there was a school, it was called York House.</span> <span id="s1598">And I went there and I got--and all this time I was separated from my sister, by the way, because she was studying to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s1599">She was in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">EA: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">SS: Training to be a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">EA: Where did she go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">SS: She went to, somewhere near Croydon.</span> <span id="s1604">And we were in touch.</span> <span id="s1605">I wrote to her when I had money for stamps, which was very rare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">EA: Now, who paid for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">SS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1608">Obviously the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">EA: But that's what she wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">SS: That's what she wanted to do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">EA: O.K. Well, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1612">That was already in '41 also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">SS: This was in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">EA: '42, yeah, that was war work.</span> <span id="s1615">They had free training at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">SS: Ah, that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">EA: Because it was the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">SS: The war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">EA: And they needed nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">SS: O.K. I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">EA: So they had special courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">SS: Well that's what she was doing.</span> <span id="s1623">And I then could not stay at the Beacon because I couldn't pay.</span> <span id="s1624">So, in Rutherfield they found me a woman, and, my second good experience, a Miss Goffey.</span> <span id="s1625">A very old lady who agreed to have me while I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">EA: So you went back to Rutherfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">SS: I went back to Rutherfield, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">EA: Did she know your first couple who you lived with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">SS: Yes, I'm sure she did, because he was the local hairdresser.</span> <span id="s1630">But I never mentioned them again because I couldn't bear to even think about these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">EA: Miss Goffey was a kind person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">SS: Miss Goffey was, yes, she was very kind to me.</span> <span id="s1633">She was an educated woman.</span> <span id="s1634">She was a--I believe she was titled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">EA: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">SS: Or her family was.</span> <span id="s1637">She lived in a beautiful old stone cottage.</span> <span id="s1638">And I really had a very nice room there.</span> <span id="s1639">And she was very kind to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">EA: Good!</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">SS: She actually asked me, she said, "You're going to have to have a cereal every morning.</span> <span id="s1642">You might as well tell me which kind you like."</span> <span id="s1643">She actually let me choose, which was extraordinary to me.</span> <span id="s1644">And also, since it was wartime and everything was in such short supply, she kept a couple of chickens in the garden.</span> <span id="s1645">And when they laid an egg she would come in and say, "We have an egg!"</span> <span id="s1646">Not, "I." She actually said, "We," which to me was just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">EA: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">SS: So marvelous.</span> <span id="s1649">She also had a large amount of books, which was wonderful for me, because I was able to read all these wonderful English literature, all this wonderful literature, which I've always been interested in since.</span> <span id="s1650">I liked her very much.</span> <span id="s1651">She was very kind to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">EA: Never married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">SS: Never married.</span> <span id="s1654">And I lived there until I finished my course.</span> <span id="s1655">I did extremely well, and then when that was completed, by that time it was July or June of 1945.</span> <span id="s1656">I went to Hove, Sussex.</span> <span id="s1657">I went to stay with a Mrs. Immanuel, who was a philanthropist, and used to have children from hostels for Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s1658">She was a woman from Frankfurt, a very Orthodox Jewish woman, a widow.</span> <span id="s1659">She had two sons.</span> <span id="s1660">And I'm still in touch with her son, a very nice...</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">EA: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">SS: Very nice man, and whose wife has become a very dear friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1663">I was not fond of Mrs. Immanuel.</span> <span id="s1664">She was very cold.</span> <span id="s1665">But, since she knew I was going to have to find a place to live and work she asked me if I'd like to rent her attic room.</span> <span id="s1666">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1667">And there was a job found for me with a building society which I suppose you would call, a building society in England is an insurance company.</span> <span id="s1668">I went to work as a typist there, and I paid Mrs. Immanuel--she thought it would be good for my character.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">EA: [chuckles] And her pocketbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">SS: She didn't need the money.</span> <span id="s1671">I don't know why she charged me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">EA: Well, probably...</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">SS: She said it built character.</span> <span id="s1674">I had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1675">I didn't have clothes or anything.</span> <span id="s1676">I mean, I couldn't afford a thing.</span> <span id="s1677">But, be that as it may, I wasn't used to being treated well, so it didn't really mean very much to me.</span> <span id="s1678">It didn't matter to me.</span> <span id="s1679">Everything else had been bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">EA: Do you remember what you earned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1682">I think it was over a pound at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">EA: What, a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">EA: A whole pound!</span> <span id="s1686">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">EA: And how much money did she make you pay for...</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">SS: Rent?</span> <span id="s1690">Probably half.</span> <span id="s1691">Maybe more.</span> <span id="s1692">I know I got to keep very little, so little that I couldn't use my clothing coupons to buy clothes.</span> <span id="s1693">And I couldn't use my sweet coupons to buy sweets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">EA: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">SS: And I walked to work, whether it rained or not, because it was quite a walk into Brighton.</span> <span id="s1696">However, I was used to that too.</span> <span id="s1697">I started there and lived with Mrs. Immanuel in her attic room.</span> <span id="s1698">And one day I had gone for a walk along the seashore.</span> <span id="s1699">And when I came back she called me into her drawing room, and she said, "I have to talk to you."</span> <span id="s1700">She said, "Your sister is very ill."</span> <span id="s1701">I said, "My sister died.</span> <span id="s1702">Tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s1703">Did she die?"</span> <span id="s1704">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1705">And I just went crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">EA: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">SS: Well, she explained to me that she had gone to her supervisor and said that she had a headache, a severe headache.</span> <span id="s1708">Could she go to the nurses home, which was across the lawn, and lie down.</span> <span id="s1709">And they said, yes, she could go.</span> <span id="s1710">And she collapsed on the way, across this lawn, and died.</span> <span id="s1711">They did an autopsy and I was told that she died of an aneurysm, a blood clot caused by an old injury.</span> <span id="s1712">And here we go back to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">EA: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">SS: The old injury which was the time when she was hit on the head.</span> <span id="s1715">That was the only injury.</span> <span id="s1716">They asked me if I knew of any injury to the head, and of course I did.</span> <span id="s1717">And so in the end she was a victim of the Nazis as well, wasn't she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">EA: She certainly was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1720">Well, I suddenly found myself [weeping] quite alone in the world.</span> <span id="s1721">And so I didn't think I could bear it, especially since I remembered thinking so often, I had many friends who were alone, who didn't have sisters or brothers, and were alone.</span> <span id="s1722">And I thought, "Thank God I have a sister and I am not alone.</span> <span id="s1723">I don't know what I would do if I were alone."</span> <span id="s1724">Well, I was finally alone, and I didn't know what I would do.</span> <span id="s1725">I made many plans to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">EA: Did you go to the funeral or did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">SS: Yes, Mrs. Immanuel took me to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1728">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">EA: Did she have friends by then, from Croydon, from the nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">SS: The only person who came was Mrs. Immanuel and the two people who were notified, the lawyer that she lived with for a short time in Rutherfield, and his wife was not there because they had been divorced in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1731">So it, there were about four people at this grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">EA: Who arranged the funeral, Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">SS: Bloomsbury House Committee.</span> <span id="s1734">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">EA: Where was she buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">SS: She was buried in Golders Green, in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">EA: In Hoop Lane?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">SS: Hoop Lane, no, not the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1739">Across the street...</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">EA: No, but the, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">SS: On the opposite side, in Temple Fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">SS: That's by Golders Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">SS: There is a cemetery...</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">EA: I know.</span> <span id="s1747">I lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">SS: One side is the Sephardic cemetery, and the left side is the Ashkenazi, and she's in the Reformed cemetery.</span> <span id="s1749">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">EA: But Mrs. Immanuel was, she was supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">SS: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">EA: But she did come with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">SS: She was a very cold person.</span> <span id="s1754">And she did come with me, of course.</span> <span id="s1755">Mrs. Immanuel did everything for appearances.</span> <span id="s1756">And for appearance sake she, of course, came with me.</span> <span id="s1757">Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but I always felt her a very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1758">And of course I sat shiva, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">EA: You sat shiva where?</span> <span id="s1760">At the Immanuels'...</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">SS: At Mrs. Immanuel's.</span> <span id="s1762">And I was in no physical or emotional condition to go to work, and after two days I was fired because I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1763">I was told, you know, my leave was up, and they had given me the second day without complaining, and now I had to go find another job.</span> <span id="s1764">So, I wasn't too concerned about that, actually, at that point.</span> <span id="s1765">I just to, go to bed.</span> <span id="s1766">Oh, I remember, I remember very distinctly wondering the next morning how the sun could come up [weeping] when I had no sister.</span> <span id="s1767">How was this possible?</span> <span id="s1768">And how could things continue?</span> <span id="s1769">How could people walk in the street?</span> <span id="s1770">How could the lines full of soldiers pass by?</span> <span id="s1771">And how could they shout, "Hi, hey Ginger," when this terrible thing had happened to me?</span> <span id="s1772">And I thought, "I could just go to sleep and never wake up again it would be so wonderful."</span> <span id="s1773">But I didn't have this luck.</span> <span id="s1774">So I had to carry on, and I found another job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">EA: Who helped you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1777">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1778">I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">EA: Where were we?</span> <span id="s1781">On the other side we...</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">SS: I got another job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">EA: Got another job and, where did you get another job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">SS: I worked for an English sea captain who was writing a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">EA: Huh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">SS: And I was typing, I typed the manuscript.</span> <span id="s1787">And until the book was finished, I had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">EA: A nice man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">SS: A, well a typical English, reserved sea captain.</span> <span id="s1790">But it was a, the job was fine.</span> <span id="s1791">I liked it well enough.</span> <span id="s1792">And after that was done I worked for a plumber in a plumbing concern.</span> <span id="s1793">I typed invoices and sent bills.</span> <span id="s1794">It was very, not a very good job, not a very nice job.</span> <span id="s1795">But, by that time I was already on my way to America.</span> <span id="s1796">I found...</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">EA: How did you think about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">SS: They...</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">EA: America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">SS: I didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">EA: I mean, England...</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">SS: I didn't think about America.</span> <span id="s1803">America thought about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">EA: Oh!</span> <span id="s1805">Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">SS: I had an aunt, a sister of my mother's, whose husband had gone to America, and they were waiting, when we went to Zbaszyn, his wife, my aunt, and her children, were in Cologne waiting for papers to go.</span> <span id="s1807">Now I had an...</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">EA: For an affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">SS: For an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1810">I had no idea whether they had gotten to America or not, before I left.</span> <span id="s1811">But it seems, and of course they did not know where I was, or whether I had survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">EA: So how was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">SS: So one day I got a letter from Bloomsbury House, to say that they had had a letter from a Mrs. Weiss, who said she's an aunt to Ruth Balbira.</span> <span id="s1814">She was looking for my sister and wanted to know if they could help her.</span> <span id="s1815">They apparently wrote back to her to say that my sister had died.</span> <span id="s1816">However, if she was interested there is a Sylvia.</span> <span id="s1817">And if she wanted to be in touch with me, they would let me know.</span> <span id="s1818">And if I wanted to be in touch with her, I would write to her, which I did.</span> <span id="s1819">And she said she was going to bring me to America.</span> <span id="s1820">And I of course having no one and nothing decided that was a good thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">EA: Did you know that aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1823">We lived in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">EA: They lived close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">SS: They lived close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">EA: Was that the one with the two cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">SS: With the four...</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">EA: She had two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">SS: She had four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">EA: Four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">SS: Yeah, who I, were my cousins, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">SS: With whom I played as a child.</span> <span id="s1834">And however, I had this terrible fear of another journey, and to another country.</span> <span id="s1835">I was so traumatized by then that I was terrified of another move.</span> <span id="s1836">I had grown roots in England, as miserable as I was, and I really didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1837">I was very frightened.</span> <span id="s1838">But there was really no alternative.</span> <span id="s1839">And I came eventually, to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">EA: Did you have anybody?</span> <span id="s1841">Did you, could you talk to Mrs. Immanuel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">SS: No, no, I couldn't talk to anyone.</span> <span id="s1843">I had no one to talk to really.</span> <span id="s1844">No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">EA: Nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">SS: And I felt I had no choice about going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">EA: And there was no one you could talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1849">I was very much afraid of coming.</span> <span id="s1850">And, but I did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">EA: That was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">SS: This was, well in 1946.</span> <span id="s1853">And it was, by the time I got the affidavit and every thing was organized and I left, it was 1947.</span> <span id="s1854">I left on, well I arrived in New York on the 4th of March, in 1947.</span> <span id="s1855">And my uncle came to the ship to get me, and brought me to my aunt and uncle in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">EA: You went by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">SS: I came by boat, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">EA: From London directly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">SS: From Southampton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">EA: What was the name of the boat, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">SS: Yes, it was the S.S. Washington.</span> <span id="s1862">It was a troop ship which had been sort of converted into a one-class ship.</span> <span id="s1863">I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">EA: They sent the ticket?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">SS: Terribly ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">EA: They sent the ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">SS: Well, they had to.</span> <span id="s1868">I had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">EA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">SS: They absolutely had to.</span> <span id="s1871">Of course when I got here and got a job I paid if back, because they were very poor and could not really afford to, you know, to pay for me.</span> <span id="s1872">And it was very difficult for me at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">EA: [unclear] aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">EA: They lived where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">SS: In Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">EA: Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">SS: We lived all together in a relatively small apartment.</span> <span id="s1879">And my cousins were of course daughters.</span> <span id="s1880">I was a niece.</span> <span id="s1881">Again, I felt the outsider.</span> <span id="s1882">And yet, there was a, there was a feeling of family, yes.</span> <span id="s1883">But I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">EA: You were an outsider but more of an "innie" than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">EA: In any of the other...</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">SS: In any of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">EA: Because it was a blood relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">SS: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">EA: Is that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">SS: Then I began to have problems with my aunt.</span> <span id="s1892">She apparently had tremendous resentment of my mother, who was an older sister.</span> <span id="s1893">And she would tell me tales of when she was little.</span> <span id="s1894">"Your mommy did this.</span> <span id="s1895">Your mommy did that."</span> <span id="s1896">They were all negative things.</span> <span id="s1897">And I was terribly depressed about this.</span> <span id="s1898">I was depressed anyway.</span> <span id="s1899">I was terribly depressed for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">EA: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1901">We are now in 1947, Sylvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">EA: At that time, what did you know about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">SS: I knew nothing as yet.</span> <span id="s1905">I didn't ask...</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">EA: Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">SS: Any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">EA: You wrote to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">SS: I asked nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">EA: Anybody in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">SS: I wrote to no one.</span> <span id="s1912">I was not prepared to know anything, yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">EA: So you had no one like the International Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1915">I knew nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">EA: Did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">SS: No one told me anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">EA: Did you ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">SS: By they who do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">EA: Your uncle and aunt...</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">SS: Oh, later, yes.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1926">SS: What they knew they didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s1927">And I did eventually ask and they did eventually tell me.</span> <span id="s1928">But at first I didn't ask anything.</span> <span id="s1929">I was trying to adjust to being in a new country and leading a different life.</span> <span id="s1930">I was depressed.</span> <span id="s1931">When everybody was hearing from the Red Cross I didn't hear anything--this is in England--I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1932">Some people found their, found someone.</span> <span id="s1933">I didn't find anyone.</span> <span id="s1934">And at the time I assumed that they were, they had been killed, but I didn't know how and I was not prepared yet to ask any questions.</span> <span id="s1935">But I knew I would eventually have to.</span> <span id="s1936">In the meantime I was listening to all this negative, you know, dislike of my mother.</span> <span id="s1937">I realized that this was, she was not talking about my mother.</span> <span id="s1938">She was talking about her sister, long before she was a mother, or my mother, or anybody's mother.</span> <span id="s1939">But I did take offense and I said to one of the children, "Please ask your mother to stop this.</span> <span id="s1940">I can't take any more."</span> <span id="s1941">And apparently that was done, and no more was said.</span> <span id="s1942">Then when I felt I'm--one of the reasons why I didn't want to ask too many questions about my mother.</span> <span id="s1943">When I finally did ask, I, my aunt had heard from several survivors that my mother had been taken from Krakow to Auschwitz in 1940.</span> <span id="s1944">She was in a factory where they were sewing uniforms for the German soldiers, and from there she was taken to Auschwitz, where she eventually died in the gas ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">EA: Is that a reliable...</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">SS: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">EA: Story, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">SS: I believe so.</span> <span id="s1949">My aunt believed it was very reliable.</span> <span id="s1950">And I..</span> <span id="s1951">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">EA: Did they do any research at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1954">I was so sensitive about this that I believed it, and left it at that.</span> <span id="s1955">I totally believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">EA: At this time, have you since 1947 made any inquiries at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1958">I wouldn't know where to inquire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">EA: Would it make you feel better if you did now know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">SS: Well, I've always felt I knew, you see.</span> <span id="s1961">But, if there is documentation I would like to have it, yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">EA: You would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">EA: How about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">SS: My father, I was told, again by my aunt, from that, from another source, that he died in concentration camp of tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">EA: You had, had he, he died did you say in Belgium?</span> <span id="s1967">What happened to him in Belgium?</span> <span id="s1968">Did he stay in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1970">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1971">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">EA: You don't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">SS: I do know he did show up again in Poland, in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">EA: He did show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">SS: Somehow he got to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1976">And he went to his wife's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">EA: His wife's sister.</span> <span id="s1978">Wait a minute…</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">SS: My mother's sister in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">EA: Where you stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1982">And we at the time were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">EA: Oh!</span> <span id="s1984">You saw your father again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">SS: And I saw my father again, for a moment.</span> <span id="s1986">He was very ill, and my mother did not want him too near us, because of the tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1987">She was afraid, she had always been afraid.</span> <span id="s1988">And so she let us talk to him through the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">EA: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">SS: He also was very, he was on the run.</span> <span id="s1991">He couldn't be caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">EA: But you were in hiding there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">SS: He was hiding.</span> <span id="s1994">We were all in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">EA: You were all in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">SS: We were all in hiding, yes.</span> <span id="s1997">And so I heard my sister say, "No, you're not my father."</span> <span id="s1998">She wouldn't, neither of us recognized him.</span> <span id="s1999">Neither of us recognized him.</span> <span id="s2000">He looked so old.</span> <span id="s2001">He looked like someone's grandfather.</span> <span id="s2002">First he spoke to my sister, alone.</span> <span id="s2003">And then he spoke to me alone.</span> <span id="s2004">And I said, "I don't know you."</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">EA: You did not recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">SS: I did not recognize him either.</span> <span id="s2007">I said, "You can't be my father."</span> <span id="s2008">And he took a picture out of his pocket.</span> <span id="s2009">And it was a picture of my first school day.</span> <span id="s2010">And I remembered the picture very well.</span> <span id="s2011">And so I began to suspect that this might be my father.</span> <span id="s2012">And then he said to me, "I’ve always loved you best.</span> <span id="s2013">You were always my favorite."</span> <span id="s2014">And somehow I began to suspect that he was my father.</span> <span id="s2015">But when I saw how he looked, I became so frightened.</span> <span id="s2016">[pause] Because I couldn't put the words and the picture together.</span> <span id="s2017">He looked nothing like my father, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s2018">I was told he was.</span> <span id="s2019">My mother said he was.</span> <span id="s2020">He said he was.</span> <span id="s2021">And I, there was such a discrepancy in my mind.</span> <span id="s2022">And I've always wished I'd been kinder to him.</span> <span id="s2023">Because it was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s2024">I felt very guilty about it for so long, until I spoke to a psychiatrist who said to me, "Look, you did the best you could."</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">EA: You were a child!</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">SS: I was a child, yes.</span> <span id="s2027">And I learned to live with it.</span> <span id="s2028">I accepted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">EA: You were a child... [crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">SS: I know.</span> <span id="s2031">I know.</span> <span id="s2032">[crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">EA: Who reacted to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">SS: There was really nothing else I could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">EA: A stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2037">And in any case, I feel it's over.</span> <span id="s2038">It's no longer, there's nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s2039">And it, it's over.</span> <span id="s2040">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">EA: Sylvia, you, this is, you hadn't seen your father since, am I correct, 1938?</span> <span id="s2042">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">SS: No, 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">EA: '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">SS: '3--1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">EA: '36 he left for Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">EA: And then it was just before you left, and that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">SS: And that was now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">EA: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">SS: Three years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">EA: Must have been in '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2054">And in three years he had--he must have aged so much that I found him unrecognizable.</span> <span id="s2055">He must have gone through hell.</span> <span id="s2056">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2057">Nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">EA: In Belgium actually...</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">SS: I don't know that he ever reached Belgium.</span> <span id="s2060">We never...</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">EA: You never found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">SS: We never--we don't know.</span> <span id="s2063">I suspect he didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">EA: You never had any idea...</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">SS: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">EA: What had happened to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">SS: No, no one had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">EA: Your grandmother either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2070">No one ever found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">EA: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2072">So, really we are now in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">SS: Yes.</span> <span

uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">SS: I lived with my aunt...</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">EA: And your cousins.</span> <span id="s2080">And it was not too happy an experience.</span> <span id="s2081">Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">SS: I went to work almost immediately.</span> <span id="s2083">Within two weeks I worked, I got a job.</span> <span id="s2084">And I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">EA: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">SS: In Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">EA: So you traveled from Brooklyn to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">SS: To Manhattan.</span> <span id="s2089">And I worked and I helped support the household, and paid back my uncle for the fare that he sent, on a weekly basis, till it was all paid back.</span> <span id="s2090">And I began to, I began to feel more comfortable.</span> <span id="s2091">And my cousins were helpful.</span> <span id="s2092">They became my friends.</span></p> <p><span

eldest.</span> <span id="s2097">And my cousin Sonya is a year younger than I am.</span> <span id="s2098">And my cousin Sylvia is two years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">EA: Oh, so you were the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">EA: Wait, there were four children you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">SS: And then came Esther, who I was very fond of.</span> <span id="s2103">She was fourteen when I, she was four years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s2104">And then Irene, who was ten years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">EA: Oh, so you were the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">SS: I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s2107">And then there was a little boy, whom I'd never met, who was born in this country, who was five.</span> <span id="s2108">But I dated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">EA: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">SS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">EA: Did you meet any, did they, was it, well who were their friends?</span> <span id="s2112">Were they refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">SS: No, no.</span> <span id="s2114">I was not in contact with any refugees really, until much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">EA: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">SS: Although my aunt and uncle had refugee friends, but they were of a different generation.</span>

Who is now my husband.</span> <span id="s2124">No, in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">EA: Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2126">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">SS: Yes.</span> <span

id="s2132">SS: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">EA: I'm not going to let you away with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">SS: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">EA: So you worked in Manhattan...</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">EA: At what sort of a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">SS: Secretarial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">EA: Did you enjoy that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">SS: Well, I've never really enjoyed...</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">EA: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">SS: This kind of work, but it's all I know and I've always done it as well as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">EA: So where did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">SS: I met him, he lived, he was a friend of a friend.</span> <span id="s2145">And my cousin Sonya was actually interested in him, and I said, "Well, I can get you an introduction."</span> <span id="s2146">And when I met him I was immediately attracted and did not want to introduce him to Sonya at all.</span> <span id="s2147">So I said, "You've got to find someone else."</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">EA: [laughs] Right, you've got to find your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2150">And it just flowered and blossomed and within less than a year we were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">EA: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">SS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">EA: Did they give you a wedding, your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2155">Well, actually they really could not afford to.</span> <span id="s2156">My husband's parents made a wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">EA: How did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">SS: Very sad for me.</span> <span id="s2159">Extremely sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">EA: It must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">SS: Oh.</span> <span id="s2162">It was awful.</span> <span id="s2163">I cried through the ceremony.</span> <span id="s2164">I was very emotionally thinking of my family.</span> <span id="s2165">And all I had there was my aunt and uncle and cousins.</span> <span id="s2166">And there were so many people.</span> <span id="s2167">They were all people I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2168">I felt a stranger at my own wedding.</span> <span id="s2169">I kept looking for the bride, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s2170">I couldn't really I couldn’t relate to my own wedding too well, because I was among so many strangers.</span> <span id="s2171">But, I then for the first time had a home of my own.</span> <span id="s2172">It was a tiny little dolls' house as we called it, or a matchbox, a little furnished apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">EA: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">SS: Milton worked in Wall Street.</span> <span id="s2175">He had a job with Merrill Lynch at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">EA: Oh really?</span> <span id="s2177">So he was earning fairly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">SS: Not all that well.</span> <span id="s2179">We were making ends meet because...</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">EA: But you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">SS: We were both working.</span> <span id="s2182">That's why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">EA: Yes.</span> <span id="s2184">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">SS: But it did improve as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">EA: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">SS: And we left...</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">EA: Lived where?</span> <span id="s2189">In the, in Brooklyn or in Manhattan?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">SS: In Brooklyn, in a furnished apartment.</span> <span id="s2191">It was very hard to get apartments.</span> <span id="s2192">But eventually we managed to move to Queens.</span> <span id="s2193">And we found an apartment there which we furnished.</span> <span id="s2194">And eventually our daughter was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">EA: What year was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">SS: She was born in 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">SS: I very much wanted a child, and the day I found out I was pregnant, I, I was just so full of joy.</span> <span id="s2199">And it's, I just, it was as if I was starting fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">EA: You were!</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">SS: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s2202">The only thing is, I wish I had not felt that I was beginning to replace my family.</span> <span id="s2203">Really what I was doing was starting a new family.</span> <span id="s2204">However, the thing is, I fell in love with this baby from day one, long before it was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">EA: That's understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">SS: And I can't imagine anyone ever wanting and looking forward to having a child any more than I did.</span> <span id="s2207">If ever a child was wanted, this one was, and loved, from the day she was born.</span> <span id="s2208">I went through many depressions when she was first born.</span> <span id="s2209">I think that that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">EA: After, post-natal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">SS: Post-natal, yes.</span> <span id="s2212">And I think it...</span></p>

birth in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s2217">I never saw the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">EA: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">SS: Never saw the labor room.</span> <span id="s2220">I went straight, you know, into the delivery room and she was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">EA: A natural birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2223">I had a little help, but it went very well, very quickly.</span> <span id="s2224">And, it was an adorable baby.</span> <span id="s2225">I loved this baby, this child...</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">EA: Was she a gingy?</span> <span id="s2227">[English for red-head]</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">SS: And this adult.</span> <span id="s2229">Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">EA: Was she a

hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">SS: My husband is fair-skinned, dark hair, and my daughter is, has the same color and looks very much like him, but also looks very much like my sister Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">SS: And, there are people who say I re--she resembles me, but not too many.</span> <span id="s2238">People who see her, and have not met my husband will say she resembles me, but once they see her father, they can only see the likeness to him.</span> <span id="s2239">She looks far more like him than she does me.</span> <span id="s2240">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">EA: She has brown eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">SS: No, she has light eyes.</span> <span id="s2243">So does my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">EA: Oh, he has light eyes also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">SS: Yes, they both have hazel eyes.</span> <span id="s2246">And, but he's very good looking and so is she.</span> <span id="s2247">So that's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">EA: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">SS: Yeah, it's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">EA: So are you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">SS: [chuckles] And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">EA: She couldn't go too far wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">SS: No, I don't suppose so, yes.</span> <span id="s2254">And this...</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">EA: Did you [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">SS: Child was the apple of my eye, and is still, of course, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">EA: You never had any more children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2259">I couldn't have any more.</span> <span id="s2260">Within four years I had to have a hysterectomy, and I couldn't have any more children.</span> <span id="s2261">But I don't really feel any regret.</span> <span id="s2262">I'm quite happy.</span> <span id="s2263">I feel so grateful that I have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">EA: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2266">And as I say, this was a very important, the most important thing in my life, this child.</span> <span id="s2267">And I have unfortunately lived in fear of losing her, having lost everyone else.</span> <span id="s2268">I lived in a terrible fear of losing her, and clung to her far too much.</span> <span id="s2269">I finally had to get help, many, many years later, to let go.</span> <span id="s2270">And I, fortunately for both of us I've been able to do that.</span> <span id="s2271">I don't love her any less, but I am able to feel comfortable about her having her own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">EA: When you say you had to get help...</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">SS: This happened after she was married, that I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">EA: Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2275">You had to have help.</span> <span id="s2276">Did you get help when she went to school?</span> <span id="s2277">Did you have difficulty taking her to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">SS: No, no, I had, no, I didn't have any difficulty with any of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">EA: Did she have difficulty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2281">I had difficulty in terms of, when I say letting her go I meant emotionally letting her go, when she had, when she grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">EA: But the schooling and so on...</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">SS: I over protected her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">EA: You're overprotective.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">SS: Of course, yes.</span> <span id="s2286">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">EA: We all are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">SS: I don't think that there's any question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">EA: Have you talked to her about it?</span> <span id="s2290">What did you call her, your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">SS: Melanie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">EA: Melanie.</span> <span id="s2293">That's a beautiful name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">SS: After my mother, who was Mela.</span> <span id="s2295">And my sister, her middle name is Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">EA: Is Ruth, after your sister.</span> <span id="s2297">Beautiful names.</span> <span id="s2298">Does she like the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">SS: Yes, she does.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">EA: Well that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">SS: Yes she does.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">EA: Many children don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">SS: And she seems to have felt over the years an affinity for my sister, which I find interesting.</span> <span id="s2304">Because I see so much of my sister in her, not only in looks, but in personality as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">EA: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">EA: Did you talk to Melanie over the years about Ruth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">SS: Yes, I have.</span> <span id="s2309">Yes.</span> <span id="s2310">And I talked to her about my background as well, up to a certain time.</span> <span id="s2311">Then I, she had difficulty with it, I felt.</span> <span id="s2312">And I couldn't talk to her about it any more.</span> <span id="s2313">It became uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">EA: You felt that she had difficulty or did she say so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">SS: She didn't say so, but I felt that she cut me off when I spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">EA: When was that roughly, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">SS: I think when she became about 12, 13, 14, somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">EA: Well, well she was too busy growing up herself then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">SS: Yes, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">EA: Do you feel that in retrospect maybe you talked a lot about your childhood to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">SS: Perhaps I did too much.</span> <span id="s2322">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2323">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">EA: Did you manage to talk to your husband about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">SS: Very little.</span> <span id="s2326">Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">EA: Did he ask you a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">SS: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s2329">During the years...</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">EA: Of courtship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">SS: I think that he, the reason he didn't ask, I think was the fear of my being upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">EA: When you were courting...</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">SS: We didn't discuss it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">EA: You didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">SS: We hardly discussed it.</span> <span id="s2336">I told him what my background was, but I didn't go into any emotional details.</span> <span id="s2337">I just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">EA: Like we are talking now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">SS: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">EA: Would this now be new to your husband...</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">EA: Even after all these years, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">SS: I don't think so, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">EA: O.K., so it came out in dribs and drabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">SS: Bits and pieces, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">EA: O.K.</span> <span id="s2347">How about with Melanie?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">SS: He was very protective of me, and he can't bear to see me hurting, so part of this is my protection of him in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">EA: Well it's mutual.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">SS: It's mutual, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">EA: Do you think he...</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">SS: But Melanie too is, has difficulty with giving me pain, by talking about this.</span> <span id="s2353">I'm quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">EA: Are you finding it painful now, talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">SS: No, not any more.</span> <span id="s2356">Well, at moments it is, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">EA: And is it very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">SS: Of course.</span> <span id="s2359">It's a highly emotional subject for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">EA: Of course, it's a very, very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">SS: To be honest with you, I've been having great difficulty even in the last few days, before I came to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">EA: With anxiety of talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">SS: Terrible anxiety.</span> <span id="s2364">I have a rash!</span> <span id="s2365">I'm itching from it!</span> <span id="s2366">Yes, I've been taking medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">EA: Did you ever have psoriasis before...</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">SS: I had it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">EA: As a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">SS: Since I am five years old.</span> <span id="s2371">I remember my mother taking me to the doctor with it first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">EA: But that was the time that your daddy and mommy were talking about the unrest...</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">SS: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">EA: And your father going to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">EA: And then you developed a skin rash.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">SS: Well, I think it was before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">EA: Oh well...</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">SS: I really do, yes.</span> <span id="s2380">I seem to have had this many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">EA: Mainly when you're upset?</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">EA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">SS: Not really.</span> <span id="s2385">No, I don't see any correlation.</span> <span id="s2386">I'm not saying there isn't, but I'm not saying there is.</span> <span id="s2387">I don't really know enough, I don't think enough is known about psoriasis really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">EA: Right.</span> <span id="s2389">Well I was thinking...</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">SS: I, many studies are being done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">EA: That you are now, you know, obviously feeling some stress.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">SS: [unclear] it's in my family by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">EA: Oh, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">SS: One of my uncles had it, and I think my grandfather I'm told had it, and my daughter has it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">EA: Does she?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2397">Unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">EA: And she could have chosen something else from you, couldn't she?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2400">I [chuckles] often think that she, as much as she looks like her father I wish she had his nature.</span> <span id="s2401">It's a much easier nature than mine.</span> <span id="s2402">Her life would have been much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">EA: We don’t inherit what we want to give them...</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2405">Her life would have been much...</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">EA: [unclear] they take what they need.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">SS: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">EA: That's what Kahil Gibran said in The Prophet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">SS: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">EA: You should really hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">SS: I've read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">EA: Listen to it again.</span> <span id="s2413">Maybe we'll listen to it tonight.</span> <span id="s2414">I have it on the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">SS: I have the book.</span> <span id="s2416">Yes, [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">EA: So, this is not going to be new to either Melanie...</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">EA: Or your son-in-law or to your...</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">SS: Well my son-in-law perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">EA: Husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">SS: Because I have not talked about it with him.</span> <span id="s2423">I don't know what or if anything my daughter has told him.</span> <span id="s2424">But I know that he's interested, and, which is one of the reasons I'm here.</span> <span id="s2425">And, oh, another reason is, I think my main reason of course is that I want my children to have this.</span> <span id="s2426">And if I… Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">EA: How do you think, Sylvia, your parenting has been affected through your experience, in retrospect?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">SS: Well, as I said before, I think I was over cautious.</span> <span id="s2429">I lived in fear of losing her.</span> <span id="s2430">It seems I'm consciously, everyone I've loved, I've lost.</span> <span id="s2431">Of course I, my husband I haven't lost, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">EA: Are you overprotective of him too?</span> <span id="s2433">Does he have to call when...</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">EA: He's going to be late?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">SS: He does it anyway but that's his way.</span> <span id="s2437">So I've never had that with him.</span> <span id="s2438">If he doesn't call I worry.</span> <span id="s2439">I tend to be a worrier about people I love.</span> <span id="s2440">I can't help it.</span> <span id="s2441">And, perhaps I'm not so unusual in that.</span> <span id="s2442">We all worry about the people we love.</span> <span id="s2443">It makes sense.</span> <span id="s2444">But I think since my husband was an adult when I met him, there wasn't that feeling of protection that you feel for a newborn child.</span> <span id="s2445">And from then on there was always this fear.</span> <span id="s2446">I was always afraid of something happening to her, or, that would cause me to lose her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">EA: But she went to school and she went through school all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2449">And she went to college and she...</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">EA: Did she go to college in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">SS: She went to college in, she went away to college, in New York, but away from home, for one term.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">EA: And how did mommy feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">SS: Not too good, and of course daughter felt even worse.</span> <span id="s2454">She ended up coming back, but this may not be, I think she had difficulties at school.</span> <span id="s2455">I'm not sure whether they had to do with her being away from home.</span> <span id="s2456">But she did come home after the first semester and went to school locally.</span> <span id="s2457">And she had difficulty leaving home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">EA: Hmm.</span> <span id="s2459">Do you think that was for her own reason or maybe because of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">SS: No, I think that may have been because of me.</span> <span id="s2461">I think that possibly I made her fearful, unknowingly, and not meaning to, but I believe I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">EA: So, you think she came home again...</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">SS: In the end...</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">EA: For your sake rather than for her sake?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">SS: No, not for my, no, no, not for my, in fact she quite resented that, I think she, that she was not able to stand on her own two feet away from home.</span> <span id="s2466">And she probably felt it was my fault, somewhere.</span> <span id="s2467">And she's probably right.</span> <span id="s2468">If that's what she felt I'm sure it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">EA: Have you talked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">SS: Some.</span> <span id="s2471">Not a great deal.</span> <span id="s2472">There was a time when it was not so easy for us to talk.</span> <span id="s2473">Now it's, I don't have so much of a problem.</span> <span id="s2474">It seems to me though that we had to help her to leave home.</span> <span id="s2475">She wanted very much to be on her own when she got a job and she was earning money.</span> <span id="s2476">She wanted her own apartment but was fearful.</span> <span id="s2477">And we sort of helped her out of the nest.</span> <span id="s2478">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">EA: When you say, "We," you and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2481">But once it was accomplished, she loved it and was happy, and I think she's slept at home twice since.</span> <span id="s2482">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">EA: So you have adjusted to the empty nest routine as it were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">SS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2485">Yes.</span> <span id="s2486">And it wasn't easy, but I did adjust to it.</span> <span id="s2487">She made it easy for us, because she welcomed us in her apartment, and we were there quite often and I saw her regularly.</span> <span id="s2488">So it was really not as if she were far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">EA: Oh, she got an apartment in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">SS: She, in New York.</span> <span id="s2491">And she wanted me to go with her to choose furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">EA: Oh good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">SS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">EA: So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">SS: We had fun together, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">EA: Great.</span> <span id="s2497">What did she study?</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">SS: Anthropology.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">EA: Huh!</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">SS: She was interested in Anthropology.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">EA: And is she working in that field?</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">SS: No, she's in the advertising field.</span> <span id="s2503">Apparently there is no job for her in the field.</span> <span id="s2504">She was told when she studied it but she still wanted to do it, so she did.</span> <span id="s2505">But then she got a job in the advertising field, and did very well, and decided she'd better get an MBA, which she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">EA: Great!</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">SS: And now she's doing exceedingly well.</span> <span id="s2508">She's got a marvelous job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">EA: Great!</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">SS: And I'm very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">EA: Do you see her often?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">SS: Extremely proud of her.</span> <span id="s2513">Yes, we have lunch, when we were both working in the city, when I was still working, we had lunch on a weekly basis.</span> <span id="s2514">And now since I stopped working it's not quite as often but we talk on the phone and we do see each other.</span> <span id="s2515">I expect to see her this week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">EA: Oh good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">SS: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">EA: Is there something perhaps you find difficult to talk about directly and might like to give her a message with this?</span> <span id="s2519">There are areas sometimes that face to face...</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">SS: I don't know, I..</span> <span id="s2521">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">EA: A message that you would like to give her on her way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">SS: No, I think what I really wanted to give her is this tape.</span> <span id="s2524">I very, very much wanted to give her that, especially since she, when I told her I was going to do this she expressed such interest, which really made me feel so good, that she cared.</span> <span id="s2525">Because I thought perhaps she just wanted to divorce herself from it.</span> <span id="s2526">And just knowing that she was anxious to have this means a great deal to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">EA: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">SS: And so this is what I want her to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">EA: And, you say she's married?</span> <span id="s2530">How long has she been married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">SS: It's almost two years, nearly two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">EA: Oh great.</span> <span id="s2533">So, you're really living, leaving a legacy behind.</span> <span id="s2534">And this is of course going to the archives as well.</span> <span id="s2535">And this is great...</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">SS: Yes, I feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">EA: That you've been able to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">SS: I feel very good about this.</span> <span id="s2539">I feel I, it needed doing.</span> <span id="s2540">I've wanted to do it for so long and didn't know how to go about it, obviously.</span> <span id="s2541">Well, not obviously.</span> <span id="s2542">But I know it would have been impossible for me to do it myself.</span> <span id="s2543">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">EA: It is, you needed somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">SS: And I'm very grateful to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">EA: Tell me something, Sylvia, where is home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">SS: Where is home?</span> <span id="s2548">Oh, home is where the heart is.</span> <span id="s2549">Isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">EA: And your heart is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">SS: My heart is with my family, with my, my own family, with my husband and with my child, and with my now my children.</span> <span id="s2552">I have two children now.</span> <span id="s2553">I have a son-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">EA: That's wonderful!</span> <span id="s2555">You've gained a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">SS: I've gained a son, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">EA: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">SS: I feel that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">EA: He's American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">EA: American born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">EA: What about his parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">SS: His parents I believe are Amer--yes, his parents are American born.</span> <span id="s2565">I'm not sure about his grandparents.</span> <span id="s2566">I suspect they're not but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">EA: Did he have grandparents that he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">SS: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">EA: And so he was enriched by that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">SS: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">EA: Which of course your daughter missed out on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">SS: Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2573">Well, she had one set of grandparents--my husband's parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">EA: And does he have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">SS: He has a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">EA: Is there a close family relationship there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">SS: I think so.</span> <span id="s2578">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">EA: That's good.</span> <span id="s2580">And you were included in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">SS: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s2582">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">EA: Do you feel that you've gained a family, not only a son but also...</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">SS: I think so.</span> <span id="s2585">I'm very fond of him.</span> <span id="s2586">And I'm fond of his parents.</span> <span id="s2587">They're very nice people.</span> <span id="s2588">I like them very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">EA: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">EA: I wonder if they know your story.</span> <span id="s2592">Have they ever asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">SS: No, we don't see that much of them.</span> <span id="s2594">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">EA: They live in New York also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">SS: No, they live in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">EA: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">SS: And while we see them, which I imagine they must know something about my background, because at the, dur--in any case during the wedding ceremony the rabbi referred to it.</span> <span id="s2599">So they must have told him something about...</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">EA: Your background.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">SS: The background, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">EA: They got married in the synagogue also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2604">They got married in a hotel, but under a chupah in a..</span> <span id="s2605">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">EA: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2607">Are they traditional in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">SS: My daughter keeps a kosher home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">EA: Does she really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2611">Yes.</span> <span id="s2612">Her husband requested it.</span> <span id="s2613">They are not religious.</span> <span id="s2614">They are traditionalists, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">EA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">SS: I think.</span> <span id="s2617">And I'm very pleased.</span> <span id="s2618">My daughter lights sabbath candles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">EA: Oh that's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">SS: It gives me great pleasure to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">EA: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">SS: Her, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">EA: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">EA: So, has she drawn you back a little more towards Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2627">I feel very Jewish.</span> <span id="s2628">I mean, I never felt otherwise.</span> <span id="s2629">It's just that I feel Jewish in a traditional way also, not in a religious, particularly in a religious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">EA: During their growing up did you join a temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">EA: You did not give her...</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">EA: Any kind of religious...</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">SS: No really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">EA: Schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">SS: No, no, I did not.</span> <span id="s2638">No.</span> <span id="s2639">I felt very estranged, because of my background.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">EA: You mentioned that.</span> <span id="s2641">But it makes your heart feel good that your daughter...</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">EA: Is traditionally Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">SS: It does, yes.</span> <span id="s2645">And I wish now that I had given her more.</span> <span id="s2646">But it's too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">EA: It's never too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">SS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">EA: Obviously she is...</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">SS: She is now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">EA: Being drawn into it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">SS: She is drawn into it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">EA: And hopefully there will be grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2655">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">EA: And, the traditions...</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">SS: I wish it had come from me.</span> <span id="s2658">But it, since it didn't, I'm glad it came from her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">EA: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">SS: Yes, I'm very pleased.</span> <span id="s2661">It's, it means a lot to me.</span> <span id="s2662">And I'm very grateful to him for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">EA: Do you know we were, we met at the Kinder transport 50th reunion in London this June...</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2665">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">EA: And the main, there were two main themes at the conference.</span> <span id="s2667">One of them is, "What is Our Identity?"</span> <span id="s2668">Do you remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2670">[unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">EA: I'm sure you attended that work--well, it wasn't a workshop.</span> <span id="s2672">It was the address.</span> <span id="s2673">And, how would you describe your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">SS: I would have difficulty with that, I'm afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">SS: It seems that my life has been directed toward doing, early in life, doing what is expedient, in terms of causing the least pain to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">EA: For survival's sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">SS: For survival purposes.</span> <span id="s2679">And beyond that, I really haven't given it too much thought.</span> <span id="s2680">I don't think I have a lot of problem with identity.</span> <span id="s2681">I'm, I have no conscious problems with identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">EA: You mentioned that, well, for one thing, you have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">EA: And, by the looks of you, thank God, very, very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">SS: I've done it fairly well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">EA: You have a Jewish identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">SS: Certainly a traditional one, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">EA: Jewish in whatever way we wish to interpret that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">SS: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">EA: And I think you have a feeling of belonging to the Jewish community at large, as being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">SS: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s2692">Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">EA: So, you are a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">SS: I certainly am very Jewish.</span> <span id="s2695">I feel very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">EA: And, right.</span> <span id="s2697">So that is your identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">EA: I think that's a very, very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">SS: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">EA: Good identity.</span> <span id="s2702">You're a mother.</span> <span id="s2703">You're a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">SS: A wife.</span> <span id="s2705">Yes.</span> <span id="s2706">I don't have any problem really with that.</span> <span id="s2707">You know, I'm an individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">EA: That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">SS: But [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">EA: Can you accept that you now deserve to live, just for being Sylvia Schneider?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">SS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">EA: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">SS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2714">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">EA: Can you, do you think you deserve...</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">SS: I do now.</span> <span id="s2717">Yes, there was a time when I felt I was the one that should not have survived, that the others were better than I was and they should have survived.</span> <span id="s2718">I think they, I still think they should have survived.</span> <span id="s2719">Unfortunately, they didn't, and I did.</span> <span id="s2720">I consider that an accident of fate, and that's all it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">EA: But you deserve to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">SS: Certainly!</span> <span id="s2723">Certainly!</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">EA: Say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">SS: I deserve to live as long as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">EA: That's right, to, deserve to live well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">SS: To live as well as I can, yes, certainly, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">EA: Do you have difficulty treating yourself to things that you…</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">SS: No, not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">EA: Oh, that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">SS: No, no longer do I give away things that are given to me because they're too good for me.</span> <span id="s2732">No more.</span> <span id="s2733">I now enjoy things that are given to me.</span> <span id="s2734">I enjoy buying things for myself when I can.</span> <span id="s2735">And, I like myself, whether or not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">EA: That's great!</span> <span id="s2737">My word, you've come a long way, baby!</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">EA: [laughs] You certainly have, and I wish you so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2741">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">EA: I'm delighted that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">SS: Thank you for helping me with this.</span> <span id="s2744">You've made it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">EA: We've been, had a chance, I'm delighted that we met...</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">SS: You made it possible for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">EA: In London...</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">SS: So am I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">EA: To make this possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2751">Let me give you a hug, Eva.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">EA: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">SS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">EA: This is August the 8th, in Philadelphia, and Sylvia Schneider and Eva Abraham are sitting together having chatted, and I was delighted...</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">SS: So was I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">EA: To have the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">SS: Yes, it's been wonderful for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">EA: Thank you, Sylvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">SYLVIA SCHNEIDER [1-1-] From the
