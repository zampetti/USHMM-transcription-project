father.</span> <span id="s76">My grandfather’s very happy to marry for my mother from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s77">I mean the sisters already were against her.</span> <span id="s78">My grandmother, she was a very strict, very religious person.</span> <span id="s79">[Female voice: And your mother wasn’t].</span> <span id="s80">My mother wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Anthony:

from—she had a title on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s95">A title like, you know.</span> <span id="s96">I forget in Yiddish how they call her.</span> <span id="s97">Like “caballero” in Italian, you know, something.</span> <span id="s98">She had a title in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s99">They were very respected people.</span> <span id="s100">They had very big business.</span> <span id="s101">My father come from a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s102">We make lots of charities.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Anthony: Is this because of the furniture factory?</span></p>

id="s107">We help lots of people.</span> <span id="s108">Not to brag about it, you know, people in Poland used to be Jewish people, beggars.</span> <span id="s109">They used to come to my grandmother, she was like a soldier, she was bitchy, excuse my expression, but she is.</span> <span id="s110">Some of them, they used to come two, three times.</span> <span id="s111">Understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Anthony: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Nathan: But she got all laid down enough charity money for them, everybody.</span> <span id="s114">Even the Christians, they used to

course Yiddish and Hebrew, you know.</span> <span id="s118">In those days a woman in Poland in that time, very few were educated.</span> <span id="s119">She was a very educated woman.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t know if you know Polish history.</span> <span id="s121">Poland has the greatest, biggest illiterate people in the world.</span> <span id="s122">That was Poland until Cuszevesky (?)</span> <span id="s123">(95) came into power.</span> <span id="s124">Then it was a law.</span> <span id="s125">I don’t know today, but you see very few women know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s126">My mother know how to read and write.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Anthony: What kind of school did your mother go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Nathan: Well, I do not remember that where she went.</span> <span id="s129">This I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s130">I don’t know even my father.</span> <span id="s131">I was just a kid, do you understand?</span> <span id="s132">My mother used to go to school, she was a teacher for poor people.</span> <span id="s133">She was very-- [Female voice: very active in school.]</span> <span id="s134">Very active.</span> <span id="s135">She was a very good-looking woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Anthony: I can see in the photo.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Nathan: I can remember like today, she used to have long hair, she was a good singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Anthony: Your mother was a singer?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Nathan: Yes, a very modern type.</span> <span id="s140">Completely different.</span> <span id="s141">My father’s side, they were all very educated, but different type.</span> <span id="s142">They didn’t talk much, but if somebody laughed, they were very serious people; you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Anthony: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Nathan: She met my uncle here months ago, but the same time, well I am very well-known.</span> <span id="s145">If you were to ask people in the United States who come from our town, we were very well-known.</span> <span id="s146">We used to have big orchards, miles and miles of orchards.</span> <span id="s147">My grandpa’s-- Anthony: Your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Nathan: Father’s.</span> <span id="s149">They didn’t know what to do with the money.</span> <span id="s150">Thank G-d I had everything in Poland.</span> <span id="s151">I had in Poland, America.</span> <span id="s152">Not America in the United States, Thank G-d we had everything.</span> <span id="s153">My mother, we had two maids, one was sleeping, one used to come.</span> <span id="s154">I don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Anthony: How did your mother and father meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Nathan: Well, this I don’t know.</span> <span id="s157">I found out, you see, in the United States, They are talking about my mother.</span> <span id="s158">My father went to the army, he don’t lose my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Anthony: He was in the Polish Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Nathan: Polish Army and he didn’t want to lose my mother.</span> <span id="s161">When he went to the Army, he got my mother, he didn’t say nothing to his father, nothing because they didn’t let him.</span> <span id="s162">They went and they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Anthony: So they eloped?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Nathan: They were good after that but it looks like, you know--.</span> <span id="s165">My mother never forgive them, they always came to us, because we were living—see like I live here, I have lots of land, you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Anthony: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Nathan: I always like to live in the suburbs, because that’s how I was brought up.</span> <span id="s168">Next was a river.</span> <span id="s169">We have lots of tree, we have a terrific life.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Anthony: So your father had his own house and his own land?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Nathan: See this house really belonged to one who was a very big shot in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s172">He didn’t want to sell it.</span> <span id="s173">We never owned it—he gave that to us—we paid him.</span> <span id="s174">Mostly private.</span> <span id="s175">Private, he won’t sell it.</span> <span id="s176">He liked my mother, he liked my father.</span> <span id="s177">There were very few people in Poland who talked Polish.</span> <span id="s178">When they needed something, they came to my father’s factory; my father used to help them, so we got the house and we lived there by ourselves.</span> <span id="s179">He didn’t want to sell it.</span> <span id="s180">I was born in that house.</span> <span id="s181">At that time they didn’t go to the hospital, they used to come to the house and deliver the women -- they were midwife.</span> <span id="s182">I was back in Poland after the war.</span> <span id="s183">This is on now, everything what I’m talking here?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Anthony: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Nathan: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s186">I didn’t want to say that.</span> <span id="s187">I was thinking you were asking that.</span> <span id="s188">I didn’t want to say the story about it, this about my father—story—and mother.</span> <span id="s189">This, I wouldn’t like that, you understand?</span> <span id="s190">I’m talking that to you.</span> <span id="s191">If you can cancel that--.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Anthony: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s193">Now your mother, what languages did she speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Nathan: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Anthony: Just Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Nathan: And my father.</span> <span id="s197">Sometimes they talked Yiddish with my father, but we did not know a word in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Anthony: You didn’t?</span> <span id="s199">As a child you didn’t know Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Nathan: No, very little.</span> <span id="s201">But my grandmother, my father was very touchy about it, my mother.</span> <span id="s202">My grandmother used to call us “goyim.”</span> <span id="s203">You know what means that?</span> <span id="s204">Christian type.</span> <span id="s205">My mother was very touchy, because we didn’t know how to talk Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Anthony: Your mother was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Nathan: Oh yes, a good Jew.</span> <span id="s208">She was a good Jew, but that had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s209">She was a very good Jew.</span> <span id="s210">Only she was modern because—now I’m scared to talk, because— Anthony: Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s211">How--?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Nathan: You see my mother used to have polished nails and lipstick.</span> <span id="s213">At that time from my grandmother, my father’s side, she used to say only whores wear that because she was very modern, she was so educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Anthony: It was a generation gap between your grandmother and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Nathan: Yes, as a matter of fact, my father’s sister lived in Breslov (now Braslaw), in Germany and all around.</span> <span id="s216">So she was the only one who would tell her off.</span> <span id="s217">She would say “Ma”, in Yiddish, “Mama, you are not living in modern times.”</span> <span id="s218">Saturdays she used to come from Germany, she used to come direct to me.</span> <span id="s219">She was—.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Anthony: It’s even more modern.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Nathan: My aunt in Germany, she was, how you call that, very rich—[Say the name.</span> <span id="s222">Editor’s note: all bracketed comments from female voice?]</span> <span id="s223">Presnek (187) in Brezlov.</span> <span id="s224">He was a multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s225">After Germany come in, they looked out for him—remember they throw out the Jews from Germany, she was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s226">So they came back and took her; after Germany invaded, they knew exactly where she lived.</span> <span id="s227">They took them right away—Hitler.</span> <span id="s228">She has only one daughter.</span> <span id="s229">She was a beautiful woman, she was 6’6”, my father was too 6’6”.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Anthony: That is how tall he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Nathan: Yeah.</span> <span id="s232">All my family—they all tall from my family.</span> <span id="s233">My grandmother was so little, and my grandfather was very tall and she had 13 kids.</span> <span id="s234">She was like a soldier.</span> <span id="s235">[She had to be with13 kids.]</span> <span id="s236">Oh yes, she was a terrific woman, very-- Anthony: How many brothers and sisters did your mother have?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Nathan: She has three brothers, two brothers they were in Germany and one, where I found out after the war, because I was thinking he was in Russia.</span> <span id="s238">He was a-- His name was Romek.</span> <span id="s239">(181) They didn’t hear from him for many years, because something happened in the family.</span> <span id="s240">He took himself over.</span> <span id="s241">I remember the picture—he was a Cossack.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Anthony: Your older brother was named after him?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Nathan: No, my oldest brother, my ______ (183) [The oldest brother was named--] Anthony: Named after him?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Nathan: I think so.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t know because his name was the same name, but I didn’t hear from him, years and years.</span> <span id="s246">He picked himself up and he left the house after a dispute when he came back from the war or Russia, I don’t remember exactly, but I found out after the war.</span> <span id="s247">He left money in the house, so her sister lived in France, my mother’s sister, and what my grandmother did, she give all the money to her sister as dowry and they gave his money away.</span> <span id="s248">When he found out, he got mad, and he left the house and they never heard from him.</span> <span id="s249">I found out when I was in 1980, I was in Israel?</span> <span id="s250">Or ’81 or ’80, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s251">I went to see my uncle, my mother’s brother and I ask about him.</span> <span id="s252">He told me no, he was in Hamburg, Germany, married a German Christian.</span> <span id="s253">So I may have some cousins there too.</span> <span id="s254">Germans, we don’t know what’s what.</span> <span id="s255">But my mother’s family was a different type, especially at that time, you know.</span> <span id="s256">So that’s how I found out – he told me, he lived in Hamburg, Germany and that his wife was a Christian German.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Anthony: What kind of schools did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Nathan: I attended Polish elementary school.</span> <span id="s259">I went to St. _____ (199) school.</span> <span id="s260">Do you know St. ______ school?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Anthony: So you went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Nathan: Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Anthony: Were you also sent to Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Nathan: Well, no, I went to Hebrew school, but I had a problem.</span> <span id="s265">My father told me.</span> <span id="s266">You see, when I was a kid, I am a very nervous person since a kid, so we didn’t went to Hebrew.</span> <span id="s267">I was already acquired as a Jewish thing, you have to know how to make with the Kaddish, prayers, and like with T’fillin.</span> <span id="s268">You know what T’fillin is?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Anthony: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s270">When you say the prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Nathan: So my father told him, to the teacher, he say, look, he’s a good kid, but remember, he doesn’t know how to talk in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s272">You have to have patience with him.</span> <span id="s273">My brother had more patience, I was a hot temper -- [You still are].</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Anthony: Still is?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Nathan: Yes, and how, very hot.</span> <span id="s276">So when he started he went to Hebrew School, he talked to me, I didn’t understand him, so he used to beat me.</span> <span id="s277">You know, they have a stick, and he didn’t teach me.</span> <span id="s278">Not only that, I couldn’t stand his smell, from the stinking from bad odor in the mouth.</span> <span id="s279">So one day, I told him I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s280">I ran out and took a _____ (218).</span> <span id="s281">He came up and he went to my father and said “What happened?”</span> <span id="s282">My father said, “Listen, I know him, if he done that, you must have done something.</span> <span id="s283">He wouldn’t do that, for nothing.</span> <span id="s284">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s285">I didn’t went any more.</span> <span id="s286">I finished.</span> <span id="s287">____________ (228) That’s all.</span> <span id="s288">Then during the war came a private in the house, because I was supposed to have a Bar Mitzvah, I know.</span> <span id="s289">So he teached me.</span> <span id="s290">I had a problem with him, too.</span> <span id="s291">But I know how to read in Yiddish, I mean Hebrew.</span> <span id="s292">I learned.</span> <span id="s293">That was the problem.</span> <span id="s294">We weren’t that religious, but we had holidays, Passover, all the holidays.</span> <span id="s295">As a matter of fact, every holiday came Passover everybody had new suits, everything.</span> <span id="s296">It wasn’t so easy in Poland.</span> <span id="s297">But I got to my father, we were thick.</span> <span id="s298">My mother wasn’t religious, but she kept up the tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Anthony: Now, you were a big boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Nathan: I was a big boy, tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Anthony: Were you interested in sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Nathan: Yes, I was a good soccer player.</span> <span id="s303">The biggest thing was soccer.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Anthony: Still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Nathan: Still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Anthony: What did you want to be when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Nathan: I want to be a soccer player.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Anthony: You wanted to be a soccer player?</span> <span id="s309">You already were a soccer player.</span> <span id="s310">You were going to be a professional soccer player?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Nathan: Yes, I wanted to be one.</span> <span id="s312">It was very dangerous in Poland with the anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s313">We
