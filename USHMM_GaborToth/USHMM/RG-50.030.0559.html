2008</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Leonard Vis, conducted by Ina Navazelskis, on November 9th, 2008, in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s12">Mr. Vis, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today, about what happened to you before – what kind of life you had before the Holocaust, during and after.</span> <span id="s13">And as we do in all of our interviews, we want to start at the beginning.</span> <span id="s14">Could you tell us a little bit about where you were born, your family, your circumstances, how many siblings you had, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: I can tell you a lot about that, because after all, I’m alive to tell you.</span> <span id="s16">I was born on the 16th of September, 1930 in Amsterdam, Holland.</span> <span id="s17">My family tree goes back to before the French revolution.</span> <span id="s18">It’s important to mention that, because we as Jews generally are somewhat of an errant nation.</span> <span id="s19">But we were very well settled there, we were utterly accultured, and I can truthfully say that Yiddish was fairly unknown to us.</span> <span id="s20">I have a brother who was born in 1934, and a sister in 1935.</span> <span id="s21">My parents, Maurice(ph) and Francisca, my father was born in 1895.</span> <span id="s22">And then – he still belonged to the 19th century, was rather interesting.</span> <span id="s23">And my mother was born in 1901, both in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: How did he belong to the 19th century?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Because he was born in 1895.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Ah, I see.</span> <span id="s27">I thought you meant by the way his world view was, his outlook, his – his –</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, my father wore starched collars, and needed a little hook for the collar to hook into the – into the collar button.</span> <span id="s29">So, he wore high boots, with shoes – with the – with shoelaces.</span> <span id="s30">Yeah, he was – he – well, he was a product of his time.</span> <span id="s31">And he belonged to a very unknown Jewish family.</span> <span id="s32">When my mother got engaged to him, people said oh, what a shame that Francisca is marrying a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s33">But that was mainly because he was not – the family was very small.</span> <span id="s34">My mother comes from a very large family.</span> <span id="s35">Her maiden name is Depaauw, d-e-p-double a-u-w.</span> <span id="s36">And they were affiliated with the Ushers, which was a very important patrician family in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s37">So – and then there was the family of Souget, s-o-u-g-e-t, of which there is an extensive family tree in Jerusalem at the genealogical institute of the University of Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What was the – what was the – what was the world like there?</span> <span id="s39">It was – was – were people connected also by professions?</span> <span id="s40">That is, did they – did they family’s you mentioned also have business interests together?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: The Ushers were in the diamond business.</span> <span id="s42">Souget was medicine insurance.</span> <span id="s43">Vis was textile.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Oh, textile.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: So that was – yeah, that was sort of the – but they were not connected professionally.</span> <span id="s46">It was really at – from what I recall, it was really a family affair.</span> <span id="s47">I inherited the wedding banquet photograph of my parents, 1929, November.</span> <span id="s48">I lost touch with these people when I was about nine, and yet I could mention – I could name, of the 45 people who were invited, roughly 23 – 43, sorry.</span> <span id="s49">Which, for a kid that age – so it was th-th-the – the family impressions that sort of stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What kind of – what kind of childhood do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I had a terrific childhood.</span> <span id="s52">I was a st – a single child for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s53">I was well liked.</span> <span id="s54">I was rather shy, funny enough.</span> <span id="s55">But my mother spent a lot of time with me.</span> <span id="s56">My mother was sort of a frustrated tomboy, I think.</span> <span id="s57">We went swimming together.</span> <span id="s58">She compiled lists of auto makes for me.</span> <span id="s59">We clipped out Rupert, the – the comic strip, Rupert the Bear, from the newspaper and made picture books out of it.</span> <span id="s60">I was allowed to read the newspaper.</span> <span id="s61">The newspaper used to come in in the evening, fall on the mat behind the front door, and I was allowed to read it as long as I was – took – treated it neatly.</span> <span id="s62">And of course, I couldn’t read at three and a half, but I could make out the pictures that were in there.</span> <span id="s63">So I consider that a very good sort of start of l – a sense of literacy.</span> <span id="s64">I’ve always loved reading, I could always be find with a book – be found with a book, and then I went to school at age five.</span> <span id="s65">That was a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s66">I’m born in September, as I said, and I would not be allowed into the first grade, because I became six on the 16th of September.</span> <span id="s67">But as I said, I had a very scrappy mother, who didn’t take this lying down, and who interpreted the – the law that you couldn’t go into the first grade with age five, as saying that you could enter grade two at age six.</span> <span id="s68">There were more mothers like that, and I went to a preparatory first grade, which was quite wonderful.</span> <span id="s69">It must have been expensive, there were all kinds of kids of –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: It’s a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Private school.</span> <span id="s72">Kids of reasonably wealthy, middle class families.</span> <span id="s73">And it was about that time in 1935 that my mother gave birth to my sister.</span> <span id="s74">And I said at that point to my father that I didn’t think it was a good idea that I would go on vacation with mother any longer – I was very politically oriented – because she would need all her attention for my little brother, and her newborn baby.</span> <span id="s75">And my father said, what do you have in mind?</span> <span id="s76">And I said, well, I heard in school there is something like a kinder pensionne, a youth hostel for young children.</span> <span id="s77">[cough] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s78">And I would be very interested in going to a place like that.</span> <span id="s79">The kids in school think it’s terrific.</span> <span id="s80">And my father asked around, colleagues of his in the train, mostly Jewish, and he found a place for me to go to with a colleague of his who needed some extra money, who had a bigger house than he could really afford, and the house was full of kids, and they would have a space for me.</span> <span id="s81">So, come the Christmas holidays, my father took me to a town called Amersfoort, east of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s82">The train was very cold, we did gymnastics, I remember that as of yesterday, in order to stay warm.</span> <span id="s83">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: It must have looked funny having your father do gymnastics.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh yeah, we were hanging from the luggage racks, and things like that, yeah.</span> <span id="s86">And – and it was fun to be together with my father, nobody else on the train.</span> <span id="s87">It was a d – sort of a seminal experience.</span> <span id="s88">And I – so we came there, to this wonderful home, which was full of German kids, émigré kids</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: German Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: German Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s91">Was kosher, the whole place.</span> <span id="s92">We had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s93">We had – let me go back a bit to the home for a moment, we had the maid, a nanny, a lady for rough work, and a seamstress who came every Tuesday afternoon, because we were not beyond having a patch in our pants.</span> <span id="s94">She did the necessary stuff.</span> <span id="s95">So that was sort of the household personnel.</span> <span id="s96">My mother always did the cooking.</span> <span id="s97">She didn’t leave that to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: I’m jealous.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well, if you have a kosher home, you don’t want to delegate that, necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: And anyway, they loved to have me there, I – I remember that they gave me my own bed.</span> <span id="s102">It was a harmonica bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What’s a harmonica bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: It’s a camp cot that collapses, but it was called a harmonica bed, which I had to make every night.</span> <span id="s105">Make my bed, and take off my bedding in the morning, fold it up nicely.</span> <span id="s106">I was only five, yeah.</span> <span id="s107">And so I – or was I six?</span> <span id="s108">No, I think I was five.</span> <span id="s109">And I had to place this bed between two sliding doors.</span> <span id="s110">Much later I realized that these pla – people didn’t have any space for me, that the harmonica bed was sort of an expediency.</span> <span id="s111">That the place bes – the space between two sliding doors sort of happened to be, and they could use the money.</span> <span id="s112">But that didn’t detract from the fun of the situation, had a wonderful two weeks there.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So ye – wa – did they have this sort – kinder pensionne in – in this pla – had they already organized it and it had been fully booked, and that’s why there had been no place, and you came in kind of late, as a registration?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Well, it wasn’t really a registration, the place was packed with these refugee children, and when my father talked to Uncle Jacques, whatevers his name is, wife was Judith, he said, yeah, we c – we can handle that.</span> <span id="s117">You know, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s118">And there was nothing terribly formal about it, but they took me in.</span> <span id="s119">And they were wonderful, they loved kids.</span> <span id="s120">And there was an old grandmother who was also very good with kids, and of course there was a whole stratum of kids; I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s121">The next oldest was seven, which is a yet – humungous difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And did you talk to these kids who were refugee kids much, about where they had come from, and did the adult world in any way –</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Nobody spoke about these things, the kids – kids are kids, they’re – they’re interested in – in the here and now, not in the hereafter, and in the world to come, or what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So, there was no talk about we had to leave Germany and had something like that –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: No, no, everybody tried to speak Dutch as well as they could, and they – we had Shabbas services, and you know, made kiddush at night, for a Friday night.</span> <span id="s126">I don’t remember going to shul, but that didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Just two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yeah, my Christmas vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Why does that stay in your memory, this two weeks, out of – out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I became Monopoly champion at five.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">I don’t know how I did it, but I was pretty good at it.</span> <span id="s138">And – oh yeah, and I remember – no, that was in a – in a autumn vacation later on, we learned to gather mushrooms, which was important, I liked mushrooms.</span> <span id="s139">Chanterelle especially.</span> <span id="s140">And so that was the Christmas vacation, went back to school, and in the f – summer of – I was that – I turned – no, I turned six in the meantime, yeah, so I was six when I went there.</span> <span id="s141">And then I went to second grade, private school.</span> <span id="s142">Same grade, same school that Marion Pritchard went to.</span> <span id="s143">We had the same head of the – head of the school.</span> <span id="s144">We had the same lady who taught us carpentry and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Tell me a little bit about your father, what kind of business was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: He was the representative for a textile firm in the eastern part of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: And his area of operations was essentially the western provinces.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: A Dutch textile firm, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Dutch textile firm, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Dutch textile firm, okay.</span> <span id="s154">So he was a salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: His father had that agency already, and my father was very proud, and he said, you know, Vis and Sons, since 1888.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: So it had been in the family for quite some time.</span> <span id="s158">I have a telephone book of Amsterdam in 1915, and both my grandfathers had telephone, which in those years was rather unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s161">My grandfather on my mother’s side was in the diamond business.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you have any contact with non-Jewish Dutch families in any significant way?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Oh yeah, I went – I went to a mixed school, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: – the school was du – it was a – it was a private school, but it was open to everybody, there was no –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So, it wasn’t a Jewish school, it wasn’t a Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No.</span> <span id="s170">But I was always off on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s171">In those years schools were working – were operating on Saturday morning, so I never went to school.</span> <span id="s172">I did have – and – and the only thing that they graded you on that was done on Saturday morning was singing.</span> <span id="s173">So, every quarter I had to sing very privately, but in public, a song on which I was being graded.</span> <span id="s174">And I remember having the street smarts to sing a patriotic song, so that nobody could accuse me of either being too Jewish, or too whatever.</span> <span id="s175">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Or not Dutch enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Or not – yeah.</span> <span id="s178">I – I sang a song that was sort of the exhilaration of Dutch passion.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Did you like the song?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah, I made sure that I liked the song, but I also made sure that the song –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Was appropriate.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: – was for the purpose that I intended it to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: That’s a lot of thinking for somebody who is a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, yeah, but I think that is also genetically induced.</span> <span id="s185">There’s something about survival, even in civilized circumstances that sort of prepares you for these kind of things.</span> <span id="s186">It – I don’t think I’m supersensitive on that, but I – I do feel that – well, you’re never totally part of the social fabric because the people let you feel that you’re a little bit different.</span> <span id="s187">So, on your own, you try to minimize that difference as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Do you have any memories of how that was – how you felt that, when you were – before the war, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Specific instances, I – I really don’t remember, no, no.</span> <span id="s190">You know, for one thing, Holland was a – a tolerant society in the sense that in 1848 everybody got civil rights, yo – everybody became a citizen.</span> <span id="s191">So you – you – you had voting rights.</span> <span id="s192">And the Jews – the Catholics actually were the last ones to – to get their civil rights, but – so no, there was no particular sense of apprehension.</span> <span id="s193">But you know, you knew sort of intuitively that if you were to – called upon to sing, you didn’t sing the Hatikva even if it was a song that you knew best.</span> <span id="s194">You sang something that was typically Dutch, and extolled the virtue of the nation.</span> <span id="s195">So that was – I stayed in that school until the Germans invaded Holland, that was in 1940.</span> <span id="s196">So for us the war started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What was the date, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yeah, it was the 10th of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I remember it very vividly.</span> <span id="s201">It was just before the Whitsun fa – vacation, Pentecost is Whitsun.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: And I heard planes coming over, and I went to see my parents in their bedroom, and they said that the Germans had invaded Holland, that was on the radio.</span> <span id="s204">And I had a stamp collection of German inflationary stamps from post World War I, and I asked my father if we couldn’t buy these guys off with all these mo – millions of marks that I had of these little stamps.</span> <span id="s205">That I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s206">My f – in – and this is also important, this is actually very important; in – during the Whitsun vacation in 1939, so that is roughly May - June, my mother and my father left for England on a short vacation, and my mother went to Australia house to get visas for us for Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: You anticipated my next question, which was, by the time of that invasion, had there been discussions in your family about –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: – how to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s211">And they got visas for our family.</span> <span id="s212">My mother got visas for her two sisters and their families.</span> <span id="s213">Must have been easy to get that, I suppose.</span> <span id="s214">But my oldest uncle said, we can’t leave, we cannot leave my father-in-law to his own devices.</span> <span id="s215">We can’t leave him alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: That would have been your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: My grandfather.</span> <span id="s218">And my father said, Mother, in times of need, the captain does not leave the ship.</span> <span id="s219">That the ship intended to kick the captain off the bridge was something that nobody was thinking of.</span> <span id="s220">So we didn’t use the visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I want to say that that was never – it was never a point of dispute between my parents, my mother was incredibly loyal.</span> <span id="s225">I do not understand why they didn’t see the danger, because it was being spelled out in capital letters.</span> <span id="s226">If I may refresh your memory, because you’re stu – you’re st – quite a bit younger than I am; it started off with Austria, with Czechoslovakia, then it went all the way to Denmark, to Norway, who were declare – who had declared themselves neutral, and the Dutch government said nothing will happen here.</span> <span id="s227">So this kind of lulling the troops to sleep was something that everybody wanted to believe in.</span> <span id="s228">Just like Islam is a religion of peace, which it isn’t.</span> <span id="s229">But we like to believe it, because it creates a comfort zone for us.</span> <span id="s230">[indecipherable] I was in Germany in 1991.</span> <span id="s231">I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: When the war went up.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: You worked there in 1961 when the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: – when the war went up.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Right, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s238">And I got a telephone call from my mother, and she says, Leonard, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s239">I said, well, my car is filled up.</span> <span id="s240">I have two cans – two jerrycans full of gas in there, two tires mounted on rims, and if anything happens, I’m on my way south to Portugal.</span> <span id="s241">And my mother said, how about us?</span> <span id="s242">And I said, Mother, I’ve never heard anybody fleeing from Frankfurt Main via Amsterdam to Portugal.</span> <span id="s243">Geographically not healthy.</span> <span id="s244">What do you advise us to do?</span> <span id="s245">I said, that’s very simple.</span> <span id="s246">Take some money out of the bank, and get yourself a vacation in Ireland and see how it shakes out.</span> <span id="s247">You think they went?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: They stayed in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: They stayed in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: They stayed in Amsterdam, excuse me, cause of Frankfurt I didn’t understand –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yeah, I lived in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: You lived in Frankfurt am Main?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: And my mother said, what about us?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s257">And they stayed in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: And they stayed in Amsterdam, they didn’t go on an Irish vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: In 1961?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: In 1961.</span> <span id="s261">And we didn’t know which way this cookie would crumble.</span> <span id="s262">So what I’m trying to point out is that either you are a survivor, or you are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: But some people are survivors even when they are lulled.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Then they have more luck than brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: So that was the situation in 1939, my mother saw it very clearly, my mother is a survivor, my father definitely not.</span> <span id="s267">Lovely man, loved him dearly, but he – a product of another century.</span> <span id="s268">Yeah, he’d like to go with my mother to England, and he was pleased that she was successful in getting the visas, but to make use of it is different kettle of fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: On the 14th of May, my father felt that maybe the time would have come to drive to the coast and see if we could get on a ship to England.</span> <span id="s271">Of course, that was totally impossible, there was – there was a tremendous to-do on the coast and nobody could get to the harbor of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s272">And the people who did get – get out, got out earlier.</span> <span id="s273">But it – it was hopeless, and we turned the car around, and we went to a seaside resort, where we saw the Germans enter the country.</span> <span id="s274">Very disciplined, very – very well disciplined, well oiled ma-machine.</span> <span id="s275">And I remember that on the – was the 15th of May, we were waiting to see how the situation would turn out, and my father and I went to a barber to get a haircut.</span> <span id="s276">Not exactly a deed of resistance, but under the circumstances, why not get a haircut?</span> <span id="s277">Then we went to Holland – to – to when we – we went back home to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s278">We resumed our life.</span> <span id="s279">The first measure that the Germans enacted was – and we never speak about Nazis, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Nazis is something that the Dutch do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Tell me why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Because, here in North America there are a lot of loyal Germans.</span> <span id="s284">So we wish to exclude them from the bad Germans, so we call the bad Germans Nazis.</span> <span id="s285">And I explained that to the schoolchildren when I speak at schools, and I give the Hitler salute.</span> <span id="s286">And I said, do you know what percentage of the Germans were card carrying party members?</span> <span id="s287">Five percent.</span> <span id="s288">And they couldn’t have done it by themselves.</span> <span id="s289">And most of them were too high up in the party administration to really bother with Jews.</span> <span id="s290">So th-they understand that, so I never sp – it – it’s not part of my vocabulary.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: To talk about Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah, yeah, no, we call them deutsches(ph), mofa(ph), krauts, if you will.</span> <span id="s293">But never talked about Nazis.</span> <span id="s294">In fact, we – we – the only Nazis that we knew were NSBers, they were Dutch Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you know any personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yeah, they used to come to school in their Dutch Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s297">Kids, yeah.</span> <span id="s298">I mean, they were a bit stupid, you know, they – we didn’t think too much of them, I don’t think they were excluded, but by virtue of coming in to – in their uniform to school, they excluded themselves, really.</span> <span id="s299">Anyway, I finished school, and for the summer vacation my mother came up with a plan and said, we’re leaving – we’re go – I wou – Father has rented a house in Bussum, which is out in the country.</span> <span id="s300">We’re going there for our vacation.</span> <span id="s301">And while we were there, my mother and my father decided to move to Bussum.</span> <span id="s302">At that time you didn’t need a permit to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: How far from Amsterdam was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: 25 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: And we lived in that house.</span> <span id="s307">In the meantime my father emptied the house in Amsterdam, which was rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: That is, he had rented it from somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Okay, it wasn’t oi – his ownership, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, it wasn’t his own house.</span> <span id="s312">He had an own house, but that was where his office was.</span> <span id="s313">But the living house was rented from a man who couldn’t pay his bills in 1930 or 1929, that’s when they started the – it was a very nice house.</span> <span id="s314">So I never saw my bedroom again.</span> <span id="s315">I never said goodbye to anybody in Amsterdam because we were gone temporarily, and that temporarily turned out permanently.</span> <span id="s316">Our nanny came along, but she couldn’t stay too long because Dutch Jews were not allowed to have Gentile personnel.</span> <span id="s317">And in – a young cousin of my mother’s came and helped us.</span> <span id="s318">I mean, after all, she had three kids.</span> <span id="s319">Since my mother pulled this off, her two sisters also moved to Bussum.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So this was your – really your mother’s initiative?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yeah, and she was the youngest.</span> <span id="s322">But she had the better part of what we commonly know – call chutzpah, of which the vernacular translation is brass balls.</span> <span id="s323">Anyway, I went to school there, private school, nice school, upper middle class school.</span> <span id="s324">All these things were organized.</span> <span id="s325">I mean, it was very smooth.</span> <span id="s326">I really didn't feel that – well, a kid looks at these things as adventure.</span> <span id="s327">I – I – I hope that you get that sense from other interviewees.</span> <span id="s328">You know, thinking about yesterday, what’s hap – tomorrow, you know.</span> <span id="s329">So many nights of sleep before your birthday, you never say so many nights after your last birthday, you always go forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Oh I – I have a 13 year old daughter, that’s exactly still –</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: – you know, my birthday is going to – is in octo – her birthday is in October, she just had it and all of a sudden she’s unhappy again because it’s such a long time until the next birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s334">And the moment she is 13 and a half, she’ll let you know.</span> <span id="s335">I’m very close to my childhood, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s338">I think I am still very inquisitive, optimistic, fast, impatient, can’t wait for things to be fixed, I’d rather fix it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: But it also sounds like you’ve had a happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: You know, that’s – that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I’m still hap – I’m still a very happy person, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: How did your brother and sister – I mean, they were so much younger than you were, how did they absorb this?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I do not really know my brother and sister.</span> <span id="s345">It’s as – yeah, this is a very – it’s a bit of a tender subject, in a way.</span> <span id="s346">My brother is very different from me.</span> <span id="s347">We were in hiding a little bit, a little time together, he and I.</span> <span id="s348">But we operate on a totally different wavelength.</span> <span id="s349">And I love my brother, but I don’t like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s351">That happens in families.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s353">But I will not bring the situation to a head, I am very cordial with him, with his wife, but I will – I do not wish to have a closer relationship than we currently have.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And, I don’t want to pry in – in that in – in – in any way, simply, was it your natures that made you this way, were there events that made this –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: There were events, there were issues, and I would want to discuss those issues, but it would be very detrimental to him.</span> <span id="s356">I’ve invented something, I talked about it yesterday at one of the sessions, that is called the lock tight syndrome.</span> <span id="s357">Lock tight is a schmear that you put between a nut and a bolt.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: You tighten it, it creates a gasket, and nothing rattles.</span> <span id="s360">And now we’re going to talk about something, and the lock tight is being removed, and then I leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And it happens –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: – and there’s no more lock tight.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: So you’re – you’re concerned –</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I would – I would undo a s – a sense of security that I could not reintroduce.</span> <span id="s365">I’m very sensitive to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And is – and is that – is that related to what the Holocaust did, or is it related to other types of things with you and him?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: It’s related to other things, too, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, it – actually, it’s not related to the Holocaust at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: It is something that – that started to happen, oh I’d say about 15 - 20 years after the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, no, it – it’s definitely an adult discrepancy that occurred and I – and I wish to leave it like that, because – I explained it to his wife.</span> <span id="s374">I don’t want to provide him with the feeling that everything is hunky dory, but I also don’t want to give him the feeling that we’re sworn enemies.</span> <span id="s375">He just had a vacation in the United States with his wife, they had a camper.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Do they li – do they live in the Netherlands, or do they live in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They’re living in – in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: In Holland, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And he sent me a card for my birthday, yet, he didn't call.</span> <span id="s381">He went to see Niagara Falls, Toronto is not too far away, we offered to meet him in Niagara Falls, but that also implied that we really didn’t want him – to receive him in our home.</span> <span id="s382">So I think he read the signal right.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: That’s sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: It’s very sad, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: It’s sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you share anything of a childhood together though, that was different than this?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: I loved him, I mean, he was really, he was the little brother I always wanted.</span> <span id="s389">I had an imaginary brother until he came.</span> <span id="s390">In my fantasy I spoke with him, and I knew where he lived.</span> <span id="s391">And I forgot about him the moment my little brother ra – arrived physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Arthur.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Arthur.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: And your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Anita.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Anita.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Is Anita still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: She lives in Israel and she has 16 grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Well, she has three boys, and the boys are fertile – nubile [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s406">They are wonderful guys, I’m very good with them.</span> <span id="s407">I’m – actually, my salvation does not rest with my contemporaries, it rests with the people who come after my contemporaries.</span> <span id="s408">My brother’s kids, my sister’s kids, my cousin’s kids.</span> <span id="s409">They’re terrific.</span> <span id="s410">They – they love me.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: How nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s413">And my wife is included, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s415">Do you have kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No.</span> <span id="s419">As my wife said, it never happened.</span> <span id="s420">But I was not very happy with the world, I think, all along, and I really don’t mind that I don’t have any kids.</span> <span id="s421">Having kids is also something of a curiosity, you would like to see what are they – what it looks like.</span> <span id="s422">My mother, whose favorite child I’ve always been, said to m – and who would have, of course, kvelled herself to death about a grandchild from Dorothy and from me, said to me towards the end of her life that she really respected the fact that I didn’t have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: She understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: She understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Let’s go back to when you were at the summer house with your – your family, and then your aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And – well, all of a sudden, the immediate family of my mother relocated outside of Amsterdam and we had a good time, and we saw each other regularly.</span> <span id="s429">In June – i-in September of 1941, we had to go to Jewish schools, so my coo – my oldest cousin went to a Jewish high school.</span> <span id="s430">And my younger cousin also, and I went with my brother and my sister to the Jewish public school, or Jewish grade school.</span> <span id="s431">That was a very deceptive thing really, because the kids from my public school really didn’t keep in touch with me.</span> <span id="s432">The general attitude in those years was that, let’s see how this thing shakes out.</span> <span id="s433">Typical Dutch saying is let us not burn out hands in cold water.</span> <span id="s434">That means, take absolutely no risks.</span> <span id="s435">And the kids heard this from their parents, and goodbye Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So – so that meant that when you left Amsterdam, there was no one who ever called or said, how are you doing, where are you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No.</span> <span id="s438">And when I went this one year to the school in Bussum, where we lived then, nobody kept in touch with me after I was removed from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, one day my father came home and he said, I got a letter from the counselor for science and education, and he says that you’re no longer supposed to go to your proper school, you have to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s441">And well, as kids go, tha – here’s another page of – of interesting something or other.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Did you feel at the time hurt that nobody followed up, or is this something upon reflection later?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No, that is upon reflection later on, yeah, because you don’t have time to be hurt, you have to sort of find out what’s going on and – so that – that – I went there for a year, my brother and my sister, too.</span> <span id="s444">And – and actually my sister went to a – sort of a – I don’t know what it was, a kindergarten of sorts, I think.</span> <span id="s445">And then we were told – no, then, in the fall of ’41, my father could no longer work, because he could not use public transportation, and he decided to spend a bit more time with my brother and me.</span> <span id="s446">And on Saturday morning we used to go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s447">And one morning in the fall of ’41, we came back from shul, and a man stepped out of his house, crossed his garden path and positioned himself in front of my father and said, I’d like to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s448">And that was a dicey thing because you didn't know who the hell the guy was and he could denounce you.</span> <span id="s449">And he said – and my father said, okay, ask the question.</span> <span id="s450">And he said, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s451">And my father said yes.</span> <span id="s452">He said, I thought so.</span> <span id="s453">I see you come by there every Saturday morning with your two sons, nice thing to see.</span> <span id="s454">I know a bit about Jews because I used to live in Amsterdam, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s455">He said, but that’s not really – that’s not really why I wanted to ask you that question.</span> <span id="s456">I would like to know what are you going to do about the resettlement of the Dutch Jews in the east?</span> <span id="s457">There had been discussions that the Dutch Jews were going to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s458">That was an emigration department of the Jewish council, and the resettlement would take place in the east, where that was, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Do you mean east Holland, or east Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: East Europe, yeah.</span> <span id="s461">And it could have been Germany, which was not really eastern Europe, but it certainly was east of the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s462">And my father said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s463">I – my Gentile friends are not talking to me.</span> <span id="s464">They want to see how this thing evolves, and my Jewish friends in the same boat as I am.</span> <span id="s465">And my brother and I were standing there, you know, seeing how this thing evolved.</span> <span id="s466">And this man said something that is quite incredible when you think about it, he said, may I help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: And this man knew about discrimination, he was a hunchback.</span> <span id="s469">And he felt that his time had come.</span> <span id="s470">There’s certain people who rise to the occasion at the appropriate and almost pre-ordained time.</span> <span id="s471">And this man, who had been discriminated against all his life, married to a very nice woman, felt that this was his opportunity to shine.</span> <span id="s472">To be in charge of something, despite his handicap.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Did your father accept?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Not right away.</span> <span id="s475">He said that I don’t want you to endanger yourself.</span> <span id="s476">I mean, he didn’t know which way this whole thing was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: He didn't know who he was talking to.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: That’s exactly.</span> <span id="s479">And the man said, may I come to your house and discuss this with you?</span> <span id="s480">So my father said, sure.</span> <span id="s481">And that’s how we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s482">I wasn’t privy to the discussions, I wasn’t privy to anything that happened, except that one day in June of 1942, after we had been resettled in Amsterdam, Amsterdam was going to become a big ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So you were back from Bussum?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: From – back from Bussum to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s485">In my father’s office, he had two floors there.</span> <span id="s486">And above the two floors there were three more floors, which had tenants.</span> <span id="s487">And I think my father made a deal with the tenants somehow to keep the place in good repair until he came back from hiding, because that was the idea behind our [indecipherable] discussion with this man whom I shall – shall call Uncle Bill.</span> <span id="s488">He got the medal from Yad Vashem by the way, he survived it all.</span> <span id="s489">And so in June of 1942, a lady came to the house and said, I’ve come from Uncle Bill, and come to pick up the kids.</span> <span id="s490">And it’s – it just was absolutely unbelievable, the Jews stand accused of not having been in the resistance against the Germans.</span> <span id="s491">You know, we were supposed to – supposed to have been led to the slaughter like sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Well, there are – there – there is that kind of talk.</span> <span id="s493">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: – one hears and reads things like that, but – but there’s more than enough to disprove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s497">It happens – I have to watch my time here, ooh.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yeah, I said at three o’clock I will meet somebody at the movies.</span> <span id="s500">But we can always continue later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: We can always continue, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: So let’s talk until you have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: So, we’ll – we’ll talk up to in going into hiding.</span> <span id="s505">So the lady came and she – she asked for the kids, and only much later in life have I realized that first my parents resisted the Germans physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s506">Secondly, that they divested themselves of their children, without any hope whatsoever.</span> <span id="s507">Or maybe with only hope that they would be treated right, that people would like them, that they would be fed properly, in the hope that they would see them again.</span> <span id="s508">I don’t wish that on any parent.</span> <span id="s509">It is the most abhorrent thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Do you remember the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: In June, no, I remember when I went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: That’s what I mean, that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Okay, that was in August, it was the 12th of August.</span> <span id="s514">I know that because the 10th of August was the birthday of my cousin, and I went to his birthday party.</span> <span id="s515">And I went the 12th of August.</span> <span id="s516">After my brother and sister left, my father broke down and cried, and asked me if I would look after the kids in the event that he came to grief – after the kids and my mother.</span> <span id="s517">So there you stand, 11 years old, you know, what do you say?</span> <span id="s518">Yes, Pa.</span> <span id="s519">And so I was taken to – by the same lady, to a shack in the woods.</span> <span id="s520">The summer of ’42 was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s521">And I had to look after my own breakfast and my own lunch, and in the main house, the people who owned the shack, they got my dinner.</span> <span id="s522">My brother spent a brief time with me there, he was in between two addresses and it was nice to see him.</span> <span id="s523">And at that time, there was something going on in Holland.</span> <span id="s524">I can’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Were they in Amsterdam, was this place in Amsterdam, outside the ci –</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, they were out in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: South of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s529">That was a very interesting thing that I’ve only later diagnosed or evalued.</span> <span id="s530">And that is that there was a saying the war will be over by Christmas.</span> <span id="s531">And there is corollary to that, that if the war is not over by this Christmas, then it surely will be over next Christmas.</span> <span id="s532">It meant that every Jew in hiding had a window of opportunity of 365 days, with an automatic renewal, because if anybody had asked will you take Leonard Vis in, from August ’42 til May ’45, you would have had a resounding no.</span> <span id="s533">So this crazy Christian notion, because wars have to be end around Christmas with peace on earth and all this kind of stuff, was very beneficial to us.</span> <span id="s534">Of course it’s a crazy Christian notion, but to we – it was to our advantage.</span> <span id="s535">And that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Wait, did you stay in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, because the place with the – the shack wasn’t winterized.</span> <span id="s538">So in November of ’42, I was taken to a very nice family with a big house.</span> <span id="s539">And we can talk about that in the st –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Subsequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: – second part of our interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s543">We will do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s546">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Leonard Vis, on November 9th, 2008 in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s550">So, Mr. Vis, where did we leave off?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I left off when winter came, and the shack that I was living in was not winterized, and my handlers decided – these were friends of Uncle Bill – my handlers decided that I had to be moved to a more clement environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Were they kind?</span> <span id="s553">Were the people that you came into contact with now, were they kind, or were they indifferent, or how were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: They were very casual about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s555">To them I was just a kid who needed a place to stay.</span> <span id="s556">The Jewishness sort of didn’t figure in too much.</span> <span id="s557">I think it was important to them that I could lead my own life, they were very intellectual people; he was a journalist and she was a screenwriter.</span> <span id="s558">And they had a young son, and they lived their life in the main house, and I lived my life in the wooden shack, and you know, like everybody else, they also thought that the war would be over by Christmas, and that the Tommys would be coming.</span> <span id="s559">We hadn’t really thought about the Americans, but the Tommys were close by, and the Tommys could do everything.</span> <span id="s560">And the interesting thing was that they really – you know, they lulled themselves to sleep.</span> <span id="s561">They thought you could rid of the Germans just like that, and that the persecution of the Jews, I suppose was – was one of those things that are part of the war, and you have to take that in stride.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t think that after I left they were engaged in any other illegal activity, but at the time they did what they felt, and they felt good about it, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: I mean, but were they indifferent to you?</span> <span id="s564">I mean, sounds like pretty much – it’s a certainly – not an – not even a two class system, but here is the upper house, and here way down low –</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: – you’re there with –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: – it was a fairly segregated existence, which I didn’t mind, quite frankly.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: But it’s the first time you’re really s-separated from your family’s fa – i-it’s new –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, I’ve been – I had been to the children’s pensionne, and this was, to me, an extension of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So in a way it was an adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Absolutely, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: How did you keep yourself occupied in that shack?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Reading, crossword puzzles.</span> <span id="s574">My mother taught me years ago, long before I went into hiding, that crossword puzzles are a good thing, it’s part of my literacy situation.</span> <span id="s575">I still do them.</span> <span id="s576">And reading.</span> <span id="s577">And of course I was out in the open, so there was a bit of investigation of nature.</span> <span id="s578">I knew a little bit about mushrooms that I’d learned in the children’s pensionne, so it –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did anybody come talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s581">A young man joined me there in, I guess, October.</span> <span id="s582">Very nice young man, he – for the longest – I knew that his first name was Joe.</span> <span id="s583">For the longest time I really didn’t remember his last name, his omer – his honest last name.</span> <span id="s584">Everybody had sort of an alias.</span> <span id="s585">But thanks to a wonderful database that has just become public in Holland, I found out who he was, and pretty well what happened to him.</span> <span id="s586">He was caught and deported, but he didn't die in Auschwitz for some reason or other, he died somewhere else, in a work camp.</span> <span id="s587">And the only reason that I found him was that I remember the street on which he lived in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s588">Q: He had told you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: And 60 years later I look on the database – was some 70 years later, I look on the database, I type in the name, and there I fi – the name of the street, and there I find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s592">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: How much older than you was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: He was – I think he had just turned 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So he was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: So that was a – sa – I had some a – that was to – actually very nice.</span> <span id="s601">And my brother came in sept – not in oct – and my brother came in October, I think, just briefly.</span> <span id="s602">He was in between places, and we both were – we both had s-sores on our skin, which had to do with the richness of the food that we used to get at home.</span> <span id="s603">They called them gall pimples, they – they came from your – excessive gall bladder movement or whatever.</span> <span id="s604">They – it all cleared up as the diet became more sparse, these pimples went away, so – but I remember when he came to me, and it was nice to see him.</span> <span id="s605">It was also good to see him leave.</span> <span id="s606">I have always felt that I’m better to be alone, because it doesn’t cramp my style.</span> <span id="s607">Not that I’m a – that I’m a loner, I’m very gregarious, but I find it difficult to be in a strange environment and – and having to look after my st – after somebody else in addition to myself.</span> <span id="s608">Anyway, I left the shack and we were taken to a large home in Huizen, which was nearby.</span> <span id="s609">The shack was in Blarikum.</span> <span id="s610">It’s all happens in – in an area of Holland called the Troy(ph), which is southeast of Amsterdam, a commuting area.</span> <span id="s611">And there was a father, a mother and four children.</span> <span id="s612">Big house.</span> <span id="s613">The father was Jewish, and he did something that no proper Dutch burgher would ever do.</span> <span id="s614">When he was asked if he had four Jewish grandparents, he lied.</span> <span id="s615">He said no.</span> <span id="s616">He was married to a non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s617">He lived in Huizen as I said before.</span> <span id="s618">His name was Isaac, and he got away with it because he said no, he didn’t have a J in his identity card, he didn’t wear a star, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And nobody did any kind of investigation to prove him wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Nothing at all, no.</span> <span id="s621">In fact, we should have taken more risks in those days, but we didn’t, because we were very law abiding.</span> <span id="s622">You didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s623">If the government asked you for something, you responded.</span> <span id="s624">He – but in the summer of ’42 – oh yeah, th – let me tell you what he did.</span> <span id="s625">He was into magnetism.</span> <span id="s626">He was sort – some kind of a mature [indecipherable] lettre.</span> <span id="s627">He felt that he had precious magnetic powers –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Magnetic fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yeah, and if you had a headache, then he could sort of – as you can imagine, it was not a well paid position.</span> <span id="s630">And he was not unhappy when his sister called and said, I got my papers to report for resettlement in the east, can I sit this thing out with you?</span> <span id="s631">And he took her in with her husband.</span> <span id="s632">It was his oldest sister, Rochelle.</span> <span id="s633">And shortly thereafter his brother Sam called with his wife, and said they got their papers and could they come to him, and he said okay.</span> <span id="s634">And then two younger sisters of his called, each with a son, and he said okay.</span> <span id="s635">And then I came and – well, of course, his – he was – all of a sudden he was the proprietor of a B and B and L and D, bed and breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And the pe – guests weren’t paying.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, the ge – well, the guests were paying a little bit towards the upkeep.</span> <span id="s640">I mean it – we didn’t pay him for the danger, we paid him for the groce – it was grocery money that we contributed.</span> <span id="s641">I don’t know how I – wh-who paid for me, but that went through Uncle Bill, he had these arrangements.</span> <span id="s642">I – I didn’t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s643">At any rate, he – he liked it, the house was buzzing, and at the cert – and, oh yeah, and I have to tell you that what is very important, you have to have reliable suppliers, because if the family of six persons buys six rolls of toilet paper every other week, and all of a sudden the lady of the house comes in and needs 24 rolls of toilet, people start to talk.</span> <span id="s644">More Jews lost their lives through loose lips than through all the Germans, collaborators and what have you.</span> <span id="s645">The Jews in hiding, that is.</span> <span id="s646">So he had very good suppliers for milk, for vegetables, for groceries, for medications.</span> <span id="s647">The suppliers were beyond reproach, they were good, as we used to call them.</span> <span id="s648">You’re either good or you’re wrong.</span> <span id="s649">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And there you were on an equal level.</span> <span id="s651">You weren’t re-relegated to a shack, were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, I had a proper bed and – and there were – there was a younger boy, a nephew of his at the same age as I was.</span> <span id="s653">And then people came in with two daughters, and we had some more youthful – a more youthful element in there.</span> <span id="s654">I learned to sing g – French chansons.</span> <span id="s655">I learned to appreciate Dixieland music, Swing.</span> <span id="s656">This was still the era of Swing.</span> <span id="s657">I was 12 and I was really being formed in a very adult environment, I – I was still a kid, but my interests became rather advanced.</span> <span id="s658">Isaac – Isaac’s cash flow improved.</span> <span id="s659">It was a funny thing with a man’s eyes, when the cash flow improves, his eyes start to wander.</span> <span id="s660">And he got himself a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s661">And his wife condoned that, she says, you know, the pressure on him is hard enough.</span> <span id="s662">And Isaac brought the girl in, it was a nice lady, and you know, she wa – became sort of a friend of the family, I don’t know how amorous the interest was, but of course it must have been at one point.</span> <span id="s663">And Isaac felt yeah, maybe this was not the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s664">By that time there were about 28 people in the house, and Isaac said to the girl that, you know, we really should sever the relationship because – apparently she loved him a lot, maybe he was good in bed, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s665">But she said, if you want to get rid of me, I’m going to get rid of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: And she walked to the nearest police station and denounced him and said, he has 28 Jews in the house.</span> <span id="s668">That was a very lucrative denoun – dénouement, denouncement, because for every Jew that you denounced, you got the equivalent of five bucks in Dutch money, seven and a half guilders.</span> <span id="s669">That’s all we were worth.</span> <span id="s670">So, 28 times five.</span> <span id="s671">Anyway, she lost out; we were warned that there was going to be a raid on the house.</span> <span id="s672">The Dutch police came with two guys from the Sicherheitsdienst, and they found the hiding place that we had.</span> <span id="s673">But before they came in they had notified us – notified Isaac that they were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So some of the Dutch police, or one of the Dutch police –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: One of the Dutch police gave us warning, and one guy left, Eddie.</span> <span id="s676">Eddie was engaged to a Dutch girl who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s677">So he knew that when he showed up at her home and rang the bell, that the door would open.</span> <span id="s678">None of us had that privilege.</span> <span id="s679">So we waited.</span> <span id="s680">And I’m beginning to underst – I began to understand now what they mean by mesmerized.</span> <span id="s681">You just can’t move.</span> <span id="s682">It’s a – it’s a frightening thing, it has happened to me one time later in life, that you are absolutely frozen.</span> <span id="s683">Anyway, they came in and they found us, they didn’t even have to threaten to shoot into that hiding place, you know, they knew where the door was, the girl had told them everything.</span> <span id="s684">And there we were, 27 Jews, and they didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s685">This was the weekend – this was a Thursday, Thursday the 30th of September, 1943.</span> <span id="s686">Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s687">This year als – this year by mere chance, Rosh Hashanah is also on Thursday on the 30th of September.</span> <span id="s688">Calendars seem to repeat themselves.</span> <span id="s689">And so they took us in a moving van to a prison in Haarlem, and only on the Saturday did they move us to the Jewish theater in Amsterdam, that was a collection point.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: You had been with Isaac for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: From December ’43 til se – to say – til September – no, sorry, from December ’42, til December – til September ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So almost nine or 10 months, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And had you had any contact with your parents at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So they knew where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: They did not know where I was, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: They didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s700">I got a parcel from them on my 12th birthday, and – with all kinds of good stuff in there.</span> <span id="s701">That’s where my street smarts – did I tell you that before the interview?</span> <span id="s702">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s703">Let me go back to the 16th of September, 1942.</span> <span id="s704">I got a parcel from my parents for my birthday, had all kinds of good stuff in it.</span> <span id="s705">And I’m allowed to send a thank you note.</span> <span id="s706">And my thank you note ran, dear Father and Mother, thank you so much for the lovely parcel with, colon; I enumerated what I had received, so that they could check it off against what they had put in.</span> <span id="s707">Because I figured in my primitive mind, that when you take a parcel for somebody, you want to know what’s in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And maybe a few things disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: And maybe the person who opens it up says, what does a 12 year old need to do with dried apricots?</span> <span id="s710">Anyway, nothing had been removed.</span> <span id="s711">They were extremely proud of me, they kept the note against all proper judgment, and I have it to this very day.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: They kept it throughout their hiding period, yeah.</span> <span id="s714">They thought it was absolutely brilliant.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Well, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: They didn’t tell me, but that’s what they told me afterwards.</span> <span id="s717">So that is when street smarts sort of started to surface.</span> <span id="s718">I mean, it – it was developed in the children pensionne, it was honed further in looking after myself and using my brain a little bit.</span> <span id="s719">Anyway, that’s how long I was with Isaac, from December ’42 til, say, October one, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: So you got the parcel only a few weeks before –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No, because I turned 13 in September ’43.</span> <span id="s722">They had a Bar Mitzvah party for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Okay, so you got the parcel –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Just after I started being in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Oh, I see, it wasn’t at Isaac’s house that you got –</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, no, no, no, still in the shack.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Okay, you’re still in the shack.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: And on the 29th of September, 1943, there was a – the largest roundup of Jews in Amsterdam took place.</span> <span id="s731">Everybody who was somebody, including the Jewish council, were rounded up and taken to the Jewish theater.</span> <span id="s732">So they couldn’t have another 27 people move in, and that is why we were sent to the prison in Haarlem, where they kept us for two days and then Saturday morning the moving van went to Amsterdam because the Jewish theater had been pretty well emptied on Friday night.</span> <span id="s733">They always did things on Jewish occasions, the Germans.</span> <span id="s734">They were very good, very respectful.</span> <span id="s735">They kicked us out of the sowber(ph), out of the Jewish theater every Friday night.</span> <span id="s736">They loved it when there was a Jewish holiday that they could impose some sanctions.</span> <span id="s737">For this they were – they were very –</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: So this –</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: – in tune with making life as miserable as they possibly could.</span> <span id="s740">I – I sometimes say to people, and not even quite in jest, that an awful lot of Jews have contributed to the survival to an awful lot of Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: If you were busy with the Jews, you didn't have to go to the front.</span> <span id="s743">Anyway, I – we arrived at the Jewish theater, had a huge electric door.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t know why that stays in my mind, it wa – it was sort of – it was sort of a finality of things, the – a chapter was being closed, and the door was electrically operated, and you couldn’t get at the button, so you were in there.</span> <span id="s745">Adults to the right, adults register their children, children to the left.</span> <span id="s746">On the left was a – sort of a barracks room for kids.</span> <span id="s747">There were chil – cots and beds there.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Aside from the 27 people who you were there with, when you got to that big theater, were there any others that you recognized, that you knew from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Well, I come to that.</span> <span id="s750">I’m still in – I’m still in the lobby.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You’re in the lobby, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: And I’m going to the children’s barracks room.</span> <span id="s753">I put my satchel down, I had some, you know, some travel gear in there, toiletry stuff, a pair of socks, maybe even a pair of shoes, but not much else.</span> <span id="s754">Underwear, I remember.</span> <span id="s755">And I go into the main auditorium, the seats have been removed.</span> <span id="s756">The balcony has been closed off completely, because people were jumping to their death from there because they didn’t want to leave Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s757">And there I see my Uncle Henry and my Aunt Betsy.</span> <span id="s758">They were not really an aunt and uncle, but they were friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s759">And they – yeah, they were such good friends that you called these people aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s760">They were very surprised to see me.</span> <span id="s761">They asked me how things were going with the family and I hush-hush told them that I guess everybody – everyone is all right, but I have been caught.</span> <span id="s762">So, Uncle Henry says, well, let me find out what your status is here; if I am a punishment case, or if I am a regular arrival, or how did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Did anything happen to Isaac, by the way, for having harbored so many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Isaac was interrogated by the Sicherheitsdienst, and to the best of my knowledge, he agreed to become a fowman(ph), that is, a – a confidence man for the Sicherheitsdienst.</span> <span id="s765">In other words, he would betray other people.</span> <span id="s766">But I’ve never heard that he actually engaged in anything.</span> <span id="s767">He was not deported either, to the best of my knowledge.</span> <span id="s768">But I did not seek any contact with him after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I really didn’t even know how to do that, how to position myself.</span> <span id="s771">And so Uncle Henry came back from the administration of the Jewish theater, and said, they’ve never heard fr-from you, about you or of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: So you weren't on any pieces of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I was on no piece of paper.</span> <span id="s774">I was a victim of German administrative rigor.</span> <span id="s775">If you have children, they must have parents with them.</span> <span id="s776">I had no parents, and thank God nobody volunteered to register me.</span> <span id="s777">So I was there totally illegally, I had no business being there.</span> <span id="s778">And Uncle Henry said, we have to get you out of here post-haste, because if we don’t, then we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s779">You are in trouble.</span> <span id="s780">If your – they empty the place on Friday night, if they find you here on Saturday morning, they say hey, who are you?</span> <span id="s781">Leonard Vis.</span> <span id="s782">Never heard from.</span> <span id="s783">Oh, we must have overlooked you, they put you on the list and your turn is next Friday.</span> <span id="s784">How to get out?</span> <span id="s785">Uncle Henry had a plan.</span> <span id="s786">He said, find yourself a young boy your age, become friendly with him.</span> <span id="s787">And when these people are being called out on the Friday night, midnight, the Germans want to get this over with really quickly, they don’t count the members of the family.</span> <span id="s788">As long as the family moves, that’s fine with them.</span> <span id="s789">Schnell, schnell und schnell.</span> <span id="s790">Aunt Betsy and Uncle Henry had a visa for Cuba.</span> <span id="s791">Of course, no boat in his right mind was going to Cuba in those days, but it helped, because Germany was not at war with Cuba and Cuba was not at war with Germany.</span> <span id="s792">They also had a special privilege in that their maid could bring a pot of hot food every day to the theater.</span> <span id="s793">Not only that, both Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy got a hardboiled egg each.</span> <span id="s794">And Aunt Betsy put a note in the dirty pan and asked the maid to put in three hardboiled eggs from now on, because one was for me.</span> <span id="s795">I do not like hardboiled eggs.</span> <span id="s796">I really am not a great egg fan.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t like the smell of eggs.</span> <span id="s798">I mean, if an egg is scrambled, it’s fine, but a hardboiled egg, I’m definitely not a friend of.</span> <span id="s799">However, I found a nice kid.</span> <span id="s800">I asked him where his parents were, he had two brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s801">And I said, do you like an egg?</span> <span id="s802">Oh, he would love an egg.</span> <span id="s803">So, every morning thereafter, you know, we found each other and I gave him my egg, which made for a very good friendship.</span> <span id="s804">So, on the Friday night, was Kol Nidrei, the eve of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s805">We were preparing to be moved from – those who were eligible for expulsion, let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s806">Not Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy.</span> <span id="s807">But we who were eligible for expulsion made ourself ready to be taken by streetcar to a railroad emplacement, and from there, in a nice, third class carriage train to Westerbork, which is on the Dutch-German border, which had a transit camp for further processing.</span> <span id="s808">So, midnight, I’m hanging around the place where my young friend is as well.</span> <span id="s809">They call out the name of the family, the family storms out of that room.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No.</span> <span id="s812">Don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s813">Very strange.</span> <span id="s814">Been – been trying to, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s815">I could fake it, but I honestly don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s816">It was all too intense, I think, you know, you had to – to process in your little brain in – whatever information you could.</span> <span id="s817">Anyway, outside a streetcar is waiting.</span> <span id="s818">It’s midnight.</span> <span id="s819">There’s a curfew in Holland from 10 in the evening til six in the morning, so there are no people watching.</span> <span id="s820">The streetcars take us to the railroad emplacement.</span> <span id="s821">There’s a train waiting and I ge – I lost my friend and his family in that process, because everything has to run and schnell and soldiers there, police there, and I end up in a compartment and I tell the people once we’re all seated, that when the train leaves the station, I will jump from the train.</span> <span id="s822">And the reason that I could do that, I explained to them, was that I’m not on anybody’s list.</span> <span id="s823">The roll call will not be impaired, nobody will miss me, nobody doesn’t even know that I’m here, but this is the only way for me to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So you’re in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: This is all still in the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Still in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s828">I had an address in Amsterdam of people who I had – a woman who I’d met at Isaac’s, who said, if there’s ever any problem, you can come see us.</span> <span id="s829">I had her address.</span> <span id="s830">That address I remember, because that was critical information.</span> <span id="s831">So the train starts off, it’s about three o’clock in the morning, it’s pitch dark, Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s832">And it’s a choo-choo train, doesn’t start up that quickly.</span> <span id="s833">So, a little bit outside of Amsterdam, I decide to make my getaway, I land fortuitously.</span> <span id="s834">I land on a – on a – on a – on the railroad bed at – on the side of the bed, and I roll down.</span> <span id="s835">I wasn’t a big deal.</span> <span id="s836">But I’m stay put, I check my limbs, I have a pee, because I’m nervous as hell.</span> <span id="s837">That much I remember.</span> <span id="s838">And then I have to wait until it starts to dawn, because I need daylight.</span> <span id="s839">I have my trusted Swiss army knife with me, they existed in those days.</span> <span id="s840">Not stainless steel, but regular steel.</span> <span id="s841">And I’m not looking in the Swiss army knife for the knife, but I’m looking for the scissors to take off my star from my coat, from my jacket, from my sweater –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: – even had the star – star – I had to sew it on myself, th – so I made sure that it wasn’t all too tight, but it was – it would pass a cursory inspection.</span> <span id="s844">I had money in my pocket, and I decided to wait – I also had a watch, and I decided to wear Omega watch.</span> <span id="s845">One of the big, round jobs.</span> <span id="s846">Grandfather’s watch, sort of.</span> <span id="s847">And I decided to wait til around nine o’clock, because before that time, what would a young kid walk around there for?</span> <span id="s848">So I walked back and there was a – the end point of a streetcar, and ma – you know, I’ve lived in Amsterdam, so I knew where to go.</span> <span id="s849">And I arrived at number 12 [indecipherable] at the family Bon, b-o-n.</span> <span id="s850">They were happy to see me, and they said th – you’re just in time because we are going to a soccer match this afternoon and we have a spare ticket.</span> <span id="s851">And as a child in hiding, you are compliant.</span> <span id="s852">You don’t make waves, you don’t say anything nasty, you don’t refuse anything, if they –</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: You don’t say, I don’t feel like going to a soccer match.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s855">You always feel like doing whatever they want you to do.</span> <span id="s856">They also called me Theo, that was my hiding name.</span> <span id="s857">My name is Leonard, Leo in Dutch, and they felt that Leo was too Jewish.</span> <span id="s858">Who am I to dispute that?</span> <span id="s859">So I was Theo.</span> <span id="s860">My brother’s name is Arthur.</span> <span id="s861">I always thought it was a rather Gentile name, but they thought it was too Jewish, they called him John.</span> <span id="s862">So I was Theo.</span> <span id="s863">And years later you wake up, and you find out that there have been 13 Popes called Leo.</span> <span id="s864">Much too Jewish, you know, much too Jewish.</span> <span id="s865">I’m telling you that – it’s an illustration of a certain depersonalization.</span> <span id="s866">They know everything, I am nowhere.</span> <span id="s867">I am living a known life.</span> <span id="s868">I am living a known existence.</span> <span id="s869">They have all the knowledge about life, I have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: You feel that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Oh yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s872">If they say that Leo is a Jewish name, then Leo is a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s873">There’s nothing I can do about it.</span> <span id="s874">I’m totally dependent on them.</span> <span id="s875">I mean, it was a nice soccer match, and nobody caught me, but it was, of course, the stupidest thing to do.</span> <span id="s876">I’ve done other stupid things in order to please my caregivers, but I won’t go into that, it’s not that important.</span> <span id="s877">I survived it at any rate.</span> <span id="s878">I stayed there for about a week, and they send out word to my handlers that I needed a place to go into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Were they kind to you, or were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Very, very nice.</span> <span id="s881">Wonderful people, absolu – and no money changed hands, they were first-rate.</span> <span id="s882">The father worked for – the father of the lady worked for a chocolate milk factory, so every day I got my ration of chocolate milk.</span> <span id="s883">I don’t know how he did it, but – and I – and the neighbors were very nice, they – they lived, I think the second story of a house.</span> <span id="s884">And there was a balcony that went along the second story to the house next door second story.</span> <span id="s885">So, if there was any kind of a round-up, you could move via the balcony, by a coal bin from one apartment to the next.</span> <span id="s886">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Did they point out – that out to you, or did you figure that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No, they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s890">The reason – you know, one of the reasons I ask this is that when you’re talking about how they wanted you to – to call you Theo, it’s with a certain, you know, tone of – I wouldn’t – don’t know what the right word is, but it’s not a positive word.</span> <span id="s891">And maybe, in their minds, they were very sincere.</span> <span id="s892">That –</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: – that they thought there would be greater danger.</span> <span id="s895">Whether it’s true or not, maybe they sincerely believed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s897">I understood it to be a de-Judai-Judaization of my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Not for any – not to change my identity, but to un-Jew my identity.</span> <span id="s900">In other words, Theo sounds Gentile, whereas Leo sounds Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: In any other time, in any other circumstance, that could be offensive.</span> <span id="s902">But in that circumstance, where they don’t want you to be caught, then anything that could save you from being caught –</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I agree.</span> <span id="s904">I mean, I’m not against it, but the funny thing is that Leo is a very Catholic name.</span> <span id="s905">So what do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Yes, I know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: – the irony, and the silliness, perhaps –</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: They could have called me Derek or something –</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: – you know, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Or – or not.</span> <span id="s915">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Or not, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Or not, because if it’s that kind –</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: I-I-It’s ju – that’s why I asked, were in other ways they kind?</span> <span id="s920">It – because there would be some people who might have just not liked Jews –</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: – and wanted to –</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I just finished watching the movie about Walter Süskind.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: And the – the rescue of the children from the crèche.</span> <span id="s926">When I came into the – into the theater, the crèche was already closed.</span> <span id="s927">And there was a comment about the rescuers, all young people, young students, that there was a sense of cowboys and Indians among them.</span> <span id="s928">And I think that sort of permeated the – this sense of renaming me.</span> <span id="s929">Could be, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: So the call went out for people to take me in, and the greengrocer stepped forward.</span> <span id="s932">He was 25, she was 23, they had a four year old boy, and she was pregnant with her second child.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: My.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: And he said – he didn’t even consult with his wife – they knew me from where I had been caught, and he came home at night and said, Theo is coming to stay with us.</span> <span id="s935">She didn't even know that I had made it back, he explained to her that I was available for adoption.</span> <span id="s936">And she said, when is he coming, she says, tomorrow?</span> <span id="s937">He said no, not tomorrow.</span> <span id="s938">He said, why?</span> <span id="s939">He says, tomorrow’s my birthday and I want to have an unencumbered birthday.</span> <span id="s940">I don’t want to have a kid here that I have to hide.</span> <span id="s941">Why was that?</span> <span id="s942">The house that they lived in was – the rent was two dollars a week.</span> <span id="s943">The house was one of five houses in a little – round a little courtyard.</span> <span id="s944">And I asked the school kids, is there anybody here who knows or can guess what you would not get for two dollars a week in a little house like that?</span> <span id="s945">And eventually someone says, a bathroom, Mr. Vis.</span> <span id="s946">I said, you got it.</span> <span id="s947">And what do we have instead of a bathroom?</span> <span id="s948">In Canadian parlance, an outhouse.</span> <span id="s949">And an outhouse can wreak havoc on the kishkas – on the innards of a kid in hiding.</span> <span id="s950">But they found something for that, because I could piggyback on the four year old’s potty for my little business.</span> <span id="s951">But as far as my big business was concerned, my innards could not become active until well after sundown.</span> <span id="s952">Because in order to use an outhouse, you have to go out, and I was not allowed to go out unless it was dark.</span> <span id="s953">Under the cover of darkness, with a little hand dynamo so I could – hand dynamo so I could see where I – where I was going.</span> <span id="s954">And so I tell the kids that, I said, you have a freedom that you’re not aware of, a very important freedom.</span> <span id="s955">And that’s taking a shit when you bloody well want to.</span> <span id="s956">And that cracks up the lot.</span> <span id="s957">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: – and I said, you’ll think of me tonight.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: But you know, that’s tough f-for anybody and especially tough for a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah, exactly –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: It’s very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: – because you want it all now.</span> <span id="s964">So I’ve learned – you also learned patience in that respect, you know, regulate yourself somewhat.</span> <span id="s965">Wonderful people, absolutely first rate.</span> <span id="s966">He was 25, she was 23.</span> <span id="s967">She is exactly 10 years and one month older than I am.</span> <span id="s968">So, I arrived there on the 17th of October, 1943, and I had been exactly 17 days out of circulation.</span> <span id="s969">Or, 17 days in the open before I went back into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: And what happened to the people who were in the theater?</span> <span id="s971">To your uncle –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: My group?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: – to your uncle and aunt who were family friends –</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Uncle Henry and Aunt Betsy ended up in Belsen, and where they perished.</span> <span id="s975">Perishing is the right word, they were not necessarily murdered, although you can call it murder, because food was withheld.</span> <span id="s976">The people that I was caught with were all murdered in Auschwitz on the 23rd of October, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: I’m the only survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Oh my, from that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Do you know the name of the woman who was the girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: So she has that many souls on her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Maybe more.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: You know something?</span> <span id="s987">Revenge was the furthest of any Jews mind after the war.</span> <span id="s988">There were some people who went out to kill some people, but they had a extremely valid reason.</span> <span id="s989">Who was I?</span> <span id="s990">Lucky to be alive and keep moving.</span> <span id="s991">At any rate, I had a very wonderful time with these people, they were very good to me.</span> <span id="s992">I shared a bed with a young boy, four years old, who could not tell anybody that he had a 13 year old pseudo brother parachuted into his bed.</span> <span id="s993">Played with his cousins in the street, in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s994">Saw his grandparents, who lived around the corner, regularly, his aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s995">This is little fishing village, you know, in Holland, where everybody knows each other.</span> <span id="s996">And he had his nervous breakdown at age 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: And you think there’s a connection between that and that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: It proves, you know, that there is no free lunch.</span> <span id="s1001">That’s all it proves.</span> <span id="s1002">He was offered some psychiatric help, but he knew how it came about, and he knew what he had to conquer and he did it his way, and he is fine now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Did he make those connections?</span> <span id="s1004">Did – is he the one who said it’s because I had to keep quiet when I was a – when I was a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: We think that that was – he doesn’t really talk about it, he n – he knows what it is, and I know what it is, yeah.</span> <span id="s1006">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1007">No free lunch, not even for a four year old kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: But that a four year old kid could manage that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: That was the miracle.</span> <span id="s1010">Kid was a miracle, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And so even grandparents didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1013">Only his mother’s oldest sister knew, who was into underground work herself, and her youngest brother knew.</span> <span id="s1014">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s1015">Who also had people in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: But that’s i – it’s an amazing feat.</span> <span id="s1017">Because if you had – given the – the geographic – how you describe it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: The geography was – was a killer in a sense, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1021">And he went to school, and he – and his mother had instructed him, and she had said that if they find out that Theo is here, the Dutchers will co – the Germans will come and get him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: And he protected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Did your parents know where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: My father was in terrible shape in the f – around Christmas ’43.</span> <span id="s1026">He was underfed, he was depressed, and he really needed a change of décor, change of environm –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Were they still back in the – in his own office building?</span> <span id="s1028">You know, when you – when you had left –</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No, no, we – no, they went into hiding a week after I went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1031">Together with your brother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: No, they went first, they went in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1034">Oh, that’s right, they went in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I went in August, and my parents, I think, went in September, or beginning of September.</span> <span id="s1036">And my parents stayed together, my sister went to her – on her own, and my brother went on his own.</span> <span id="s1037">Anyway, my father was very depressed, and his – and I call them handlers, it’s sort of the easier way to describe them – came to my war father and said, listen, Leonard, or Theo’s father is really in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1038">Can you put him up for a couple of weeks?</span> <span id="s1039">And there came my father, who was so undernourished that he was almost paranoiac about things.</span> <span id="s1040">And they got him good food, there was always plenty to eat there, because the man was a vegetable –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Grocer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: – grow – not – vegetable merchant.</span> <span id="s1043">Potatoes.</span> <span id="s1044">And they gave him some booze, which he never drank, my father, but that sort of cheered him up a little bit, and we had a wonderful Christmas and New Years.</span> <span id="s1045">And I enjoyed being with him, or he enjoyed being with me, and he deferred to me.</span> <span id="s1046">Whenever he wanted something, he used to come to me first, and said, do you think this is okay, can I do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: That’s a big burden for a young child –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Because I was the landlord, in a sense, you know, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: You were stronger than him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1051">Well, that came about, because when he broke down after my brother and sister left, which I referred to in this interview, he asked me if I wanted to – if I could look after Mother and the children if he perished.</span> <span id="s1052">And of course I said yes, what else can you say?</span> <span id="s1053">But it changed my relationship with him very profoundly, in that I became more of a daughter to him, when I can define care between a woman and a man, a man cares differently.</span> <span id="s1054">A man is sort of hey guy, how are you, with a knock to the shoulder, whereas a daughter is more kind, softer.</span> <span id="s1055">And my relationship with my father absolutely became that of a father and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1056">I – I looked after him.</span> <span id="s1057">I’ve traveled with him, I’ve washed his shirts.</span> <span id="s1058">It was a most unusual relationship.</span> <span id="s1059">With my mother I’ve always been a buddy.</span> <span id="s1060">My mother and I operate on the same plane.</span> <span id="s1061">We’re tough, we’re street smart.</span> <span id="s1062">My father is totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: But you had a lot of growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Oh yeah, pretty fast.</span> <span id="s1067">Anyway, I – he left be – middle of January, fortified, cheered up, and that was well, the main thing.</span> <span id="s1068">And then I was sent out of the house in May because my war mother gave birth to a little girl.</span> <span id="s1069">And I came back after three weeks with a very intellectual family, which I relished.</span> <span id="s1070">There was music, there was intelligent conversation, which I didn’t have with my war family, which they sensed.</span> <span id="s1071">And my war mother said to me, in the beginning that I was there, that of course I came from a different milieu, and they would try and find another place for me.</span> <span id="s1072">And she told me that story, I have completely – completely wiped that out of my mind, and I must have said I’m very happy here.</span> <span id="s1073">You don’t have to do anything.</span> <span id="s1074">But the offer was made – they were sensitive to the fact that I did, indeed come from a different intellectual milieu.</span> <span id="s1075">My father was not a greengrocer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I must have been very shocked by that offer, so I – and I declined, I said it’s absolutely not necessary, I’m very happy here.</span> <span id="s1078">That’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s1079">Not that it was so easy to move a child, especially a dark haired Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1080">Circumcision played a big role, because regular kids were not circumcised.</span> <span id="s1081">So I came back and my war mother said, well, here she is.</span> <span id="s1082">And I learned how to look after a baby, and except for breastfeeding, I did everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: The kid grew up to be a magnificent girl.</span> <span id="s1085">She’s now grandmother of six kids or something, has four children of her own.</span> <span id="s1086">And we’re very close.</span> <span id="s1087">She’s very proud, I’m her older brother, not the – not her oldie – her oldest brother, I am.</span> <span id="s1088">And she’s very proud of the fact that I looked after her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And how long did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Til May ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: So actually, from the ti – from October 17th, 1943, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: For another year and a half, you were with them until liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s1098">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: They were very good to me.</span> <span id="s1100">They – towards the end of the war, well, in – in the winter of ’44, my parents and my sister came to stay – my father came to stay with me again, and they found a place for my mother and my sister to sleep, but living was all in that little two dollar house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: At what time had the place been – the – the countryside been liberated already by the – the allies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Well, there was a partial liberation from beneath the big rivers, and that was in September ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And you were above those rivers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: We were above the rivers, yeah.</span> <span id="s1105">We were not really liberated, we were surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s1107">Ah.</span> <span id="s1108">Okay, so you still had danger until May ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: My father, may he rest in peace, said on the day of liberation, nobody leaves the house.</span> <span id="s1110">Because a stray bullet can undo whatever we have been trying to preserve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: I think that’s very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: My friend who is here, his father got caught up in some kind of a wild melee of joyful, festival celebrants, and was pushed under a streetcar, lost his leg.</span> <span id="s1113">So my father was very, very wise at that moment, he – actually, he did a fantastic job in – in reestablishing the family, I’m beginning to see that now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: What happened then, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Well, the general feeling was that – and I speak about that, every returning Jew presented an economical miscalculation.</span> <span id="s1116">Oh, are you still around?</span> <span id="s1117">We were not welcomed.</span> <span id="s1118">It was a very cold and chilly wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: How awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">The queen had said that to her every Dutchman was the same except, of course, there were certain Dutch people who had suffered more and differently than other Dutch people.</span> <span id="s1122">That was not taken into consideration.</span> <span id="s1123">I’ve just finished a talk to an Anglican church, where I was asked to speak about my happenings during the war, and I find that among adult audiences, the Holocaust has been beaten to death a little bit.</span> <span id="s1124">So I decided, after consultation with a friendly minister in the United Church of Canada, and director of the Anglican church, that I would rather speak about the holocaust after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1125">And the heading of my talk was, I have been liberated, but am I free?</span> <span id="s1126">Because the war against the Jews continues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Tell me about those experiences, though.</span> <span id="s1128">Did your father have difficulty in reestablishing his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: My father had to face an unfriendly bureaucracy, to get a house, to get bedding, to get furniture, to get stuff in order to put his family under a roof.</span> <span id="s1130">Instead of three children, he all of a sudden had four children, because we took in a cousin whose parents had been killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1131">He had to put four children in school by September one.</span> <span id="s1132">And last but not least, he had to restart his own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: That – the place where his business was, did he get that property back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: He got – that property was kept by the tenants, yes.</span> <span id="s1135">But, you have to have merchandise in order to do [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: That’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: You know, that didn’t – an-and you couldn’t travel.</span> <span id="s1138">He didn’t – he didn’t have a car [interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Okay, he didn’t have a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: So he – my father had a hell of a task.</span> <span id="s1141">He is not a strong man, he is a very civilized, almost meek individual.</span> <span id="s1142">And I never thought all that much of what he had to go through until a friend of mine, Isaac Lipschits wrote a book in Dutch called, “The Little Shoah,” in which he really details, as a professional political scientist and historian, what happened to the remnant, and how did the remnant cope.</span> <span id="s1143">There were people didn’t want to have anything to do with Holland, hightailed it off to Palestine and that was it, if they had the permit to do so.</span> <span id="s1144">So my father reestablished us.</span> <span id="s1145">I don’t think we ever gave him the credit for it.</span> <span id="s1146">I’m sure I gave him the love, but it wasn’t based on what he had done, it was really based on our relationship.</span> <span id="s1147">But this interview comes to a very nice note, because in 1951 my war parents had another son.</span> <span id="s1148">They had two go – daughters in between – no, they had one daughter in between – two daughters in between, yeah, they – then they got a son.</span> <span id="s1149">They named him Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Rather than Theo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Rather than Theo, yeah Theo was – went overboard very rapidly, yeah.</span> <span id="s1152">So, there is – yeah, and Leo Hoyer(ph), that’s his last name, has a son who is called Michael Leonard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: That’s very nice.</span> <span id="s1154">You maintained contact with them after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And your parents, did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Well, no, there was a time when I was not in contact with them, and they didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1158">They fi – these people were actually, for the – the social status that they had, uncommonly bright.</span> <span id="s1159">They were not on my case.</span> <span id="s1160">If they heard from me it was wonderful, and if they didn’t hear from me, they would ask my parents what’s wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: How is he doing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: So they were very good to me in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: And your parents, were they – did they have good relations with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Oh yeah, excellent.</span> <span id="s1167">Yeah, he was – he went into the army after the war.</span> <span id="s1168">He was three years in Indonesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: And he could do that because he knew that my father would look after his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: When the war ended, you were then how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: I was 14 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: 14 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: So you were in the middle of your teenage years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Do you remember what you felt in those pors – postwar years?</span> <span id="s1178">Di – when you went to school, did you feel that kind of coldness at school?</span> <span id="s1179">Did you feel from neighbors and from – did you know – meet people you had known before –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No.</span> <span id="s1181">I – what happened with school, my mother, ambitious as she was, said well, because of the – the winter, you w – everybody got a year free, and she managed to get me into the second year of high school, which was not right, in retrospect.</span> <span id="s1182">She didn’t want me to lose too much time.</span> <span id="s1183">But it didn’t work out that way, I was a very fidgety chi – fidgety child.</span> <span id="s1184">I had trouble concentrating, I had – I was very fearful of – [interruption] So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: You were fidgety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: You were fidgety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: I was fidgety, I did not finish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Were you unhappy during those times, those – when you were saying you were fidgety, was it the – after all of that sort of like close brushes with death – you know, there’s this phenomenon, when people finally are in safety, everything that held them together during the times of crisis –</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: – kind of – you – then you allow yourself to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Well, I – no, there were some good times.</span> <span id="s1193">I became a member of the sea scouts, which I enjoyed hugely.</span> <span id="s1194">Since I had not had physical pleasures, being a scout was wonderful, travel was wonderful, doing things was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1195">Cerebral stuff was not part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: And you were growing up, actually, in postwar Europe, which is unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Not many people stayed around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: And I sense that you don’t have great warmth for Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: No, I have – I can truly say that I have a culinary homesickness, but that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1202">I worked in Holland after I got married.</span> <span id="s1203">My wife married me on my decent face and good character, whatever was visible.</span> <span id="s1204">But I – I was rather fearful of that and – that she’d know where I came from.</span> <span id="s1205">So, we went to Holland, I spent seven years in Holland, in the advertising business, which was at that time my – my business.</span> <span id="s1206">And those were not – those were happy days when I was allowed to run my own agency.</span> <span id="s1207">They were not happy days when I was part of the personnel.</span> <span id="s1208">Because their style – you see, th-the – the problem with Holland was that the Dutch did not go through a renewal.</span> <span id="s1209">They wanted restoration.</span> <span id="s1210">And there, that is the crucial difference.</span> <span id="s1211">Renewal is opening the windows and letting in a fresh breeze.</span> <span id="s1212">Restoration is, let’s go back to the status quo ante.</span> <span id="s1213">And that is what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: And some things, you can’t go back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Well, they tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: When did you leave Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: In ’54.</span> <span id="s1218">I finished my military service, and I wrote – while I was in the military, I wrote – and I loved the military.</span> <span id="s1219">I was a damn good soldier.</span> <span id="s1220">I – I was good.</span> <span id="s1221">I c – physical again, you know, I could improvise, I could st – use my street smarts.</span> <span id="s1222">And I wrote to an uncle of my cousin in Australia, and to a cousin of my father’s in the United States, if you – they would sponsor me, and the cousin in the States came through first.</span> <span id="s1223">So that’s why I went to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Where did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: In Westchester, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: And how long did you live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Until I went into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: U.S. Army, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: So you went – you’ve been in the Dutch army and the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: What was – what was your – what was your – what military branch did you go into?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Well, I ended up in the military police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Because I’m literate and my German was good, I was stationed in Austria and in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And what years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: ’55 - ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Oh, those are very interesting times in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: And very – still very [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Hungarian – Hungarian revolution, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1244">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: And, can you tell me a little bit about how – I mean, this is not that much long after the war.</span> <span id="s1246">What – what kind of impression did you have of this Germany of the 1950s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Well, of curse – course, no German had ever been a Nazi, and – and that is, of course, true, because only five percent of the Germans were card carrying Nazis.</span> <span id="s1248">I did come away with a bit of an appreciation for wie haben es nicht gewusst.</span> <span id="s1249">We didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1250">But there is also very ti – because you cannot really sense that two blocks down the road they have a roundup of people, they – they – it’s too f – too far removed.</span> <span id="s1251">[interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: – or towards, you know, in the first –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah, I had no problem being in Germany or in Austria.</span> <span id="s1254">I had been with the Dutch army on maneuvers in Germany.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t know, I – I don’t think I – I was anti-German at all.</span> <span id="s1256">I love the German language, for one.</span> <span id="s1257">To tell you the truth, wa – a-and my holocaust is limited to Holland.</span> <span id="s1258">I’ve given all my books about Schindler and all of that to the Jewish library at the Holocaust Center in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1259">My knowledge o – my holocaust took place in Holland.</span> <span id="s1260">And the reason that Holland had such a large loss percentage, is really due to the civil service, which carried out its orders to the letter.</span> <span id="s1261">To the police, to the burgomasters, to the officials in the civil registry, I think the Jewish council that is being blamed in – all over the place, had very little to do with whatever there was.</span> <span id="s1262">If they hadn’t been there, it would have – it would have taken place anyway.</span> <span id="s1263">So, I – I like to exonerate the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s1264">They brought a lot of solace to a lot of people who were destined to die anyway, and they – they did the best they could under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1265">You are not trained to survive these kind of things.</span> <span id="s1266">You learn on the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: You’re absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Yeah, so it – and I told you about the lock tight syndrome.</span> <span id="s1269">I don’t like to ask people about what they went through.</span> <span id="s1270">If they want to tell me, fine.</span> <span id="s1271">I’m not volunteering – I’m not trying to in – to induce them to volunteer information.</span> <span id="s1272">I am on a number of boards.</span> <span id="s1273">I am on the board of Dying with Dignity.</span> <span id="s1274">I am on the board of my professional Financial Planners Association.</span> <span id="s1275">I am on the board of The Holocaust Center of Toronto.</span> <span id="s1276">I am 78 years old.</span> <span id="s1277">I don’t look too bad and I don’t feel too bad, and life’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: This concludes the United
