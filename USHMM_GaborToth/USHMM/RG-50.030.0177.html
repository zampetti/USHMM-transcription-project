you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak.</span> <span id="s14">Now, my name is Bernard.</span> <span id="s15">It went from Belle to Bernard.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in a place.</span> <span id="s17">It was Martimorish (ph).</span> <span id="s18">It's in Romania, and the city is Visho.</span> <span id="s19">In Visho, when Romania was there it was Vishosimos.</span> <span id="s20">And also, they called that city Feldesisho because the Hungarians were there.</span> <span id="s21">The area where I was born was surrounded with mountains around.</span> <span id="s22">We had high peaks of mountains over there which there was snow almost all year around.</span> <span id="s23">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back.</span> <span id="s24">The area was a beautiful area surrounded with water.</span> <span id="s25">We had water.</span> <span id="s26">We had everything over there.</span> <span id="s27">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s28">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians.</span> <span id="s29">We all had areas, different areas.</span> <span id="s30">The Jews had their Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s31">The Rumanians the other quarter, the Germans the other quarter and the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s32">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in Germany.</span> <span id="s33">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name.</span> <span id="s34">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great.</span> <span id="s35">In the city, in the Visho, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the Shobot comes, three times.</span> <span id="s36">The first whistle meant close the store.</span> <span id="s37">The second whistle meant you should be home by now, and the third one to light candles.</span> <span id="s38">That was the greatest thing to happen.</span> <span id="s39">We also had a ________ there which children were coming from all around learning and that ________ by us.</span> <span id="s40">We had five schools.</span> <span id="s41">They named them number one, number three, number four and five.</span> <span id="s42">We also had about four or five shulls, and we all belonged to different area.</span> <span id="s43">Everybody had a different way to go wherever he wanted to go.</span> <span id="s44">We were assigned to go to school number one which it was I would say about a half a mile.</span> <span id="s45">The area there -- there was no transportation like you have over here.</span> <span id="s46">We walked to school.</span> <span id="s47">The school wasn't so bad to walk except there were hills when you got to the school there.</span> <span id="s48">Also there was another system too over there.</span> <span id="s49">We went to Hebrew in the morning until 9:30, from 7:00 until about 9:30.</span> <span id="s50">At 9:30 we went to the Romanian school.</span> <span id="s51">We had lunch a little bit, about a half an hour, and then in the afternoon until 4:00.</span> <span id="s52">4:00 we went back to Hebrew school until about 8:00.</span> <span id="s53">Now, what did we do over there all this time, you know, with the children when they're grown up?</span> <span id="s54">Industrial life, there was only how should I say, wood factories.</span> <span id="s55">We had a lot of wood.</span> <span id="s56">All the time, when the Hungarians were before the First World War, and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there, very great.</span> <span id="s57">On the beginning on the 18th century, the beginning of the 18th century, the first Jew came over from Poland.</span> <span id="s58">He settled in Martimorish because there wasn't such a good life there so they kept on coming and coming.</span> <span id="s59">They settled.</span> <span id="s60">But after the Romanians took over, after the first world war, the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there.</span> <span id="s61">Their lives started to be very poor, but what we grew over there and the mountains, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little farm.</span> <span id="s62">We stored away the food for the wintertime.</span> <span id="s63">We put it in basements, whoever had basements and we kept on going day by day.</span> <span id="s64">We had no telephone of course.</span> <span id="s65">We had no radios and things like this.</span> <span id="s66">It was like in the early 1900 century.</span> <span id="s67">It didn't change much, the life.</span> <span id="s68">There was a lot of poor people in the area also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people.</span> <span id="s69">The father only had the work over there.</span> <span id="s70">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children.</span> <span id="s71">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way.</span> <span id="s72">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there.</span> <span id="s73">It started with beatings.</span> <span id="s74">No matter what you do, you got a beating.</span> <span id="s75">You went to Hadre, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating.</span> <span id="s76">You walked in the street, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating.</span> <span id="s77">You went to school which the principal from the school, his name was Hugar.</span> <span id="s78">He was standing in the steps just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed.</span> <span id="s79">Then we went in the school.</span> <span id="s80">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately.</span> <span id="s81">Now, the teacher came in.</span> <span id="s82">When the teacher came in, you could drop a pin, and it was so quiet nobody made a move.</span> <span id="s83">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating.</span> <span id="s84">So, that's the way life was in school.</span> <span id="s85">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty.</span> <span id="s86">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties.</span> <span id="s87">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick.</span> <span id="s88">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work.</span> <span id="s89">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm.</span> <span id="s90">But there was no other way.</span> <span id="s91">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand.</span> <span id="s92">It's the same thing with the food.</span> <span id="s93">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand.</span> <span id="s94">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand.</span> <span id="s95">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand.</span> <span id="s96">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a tin smith and he only had to shear with right hand shears.</span> <span id="s97">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears.</span> <span id="s98">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day.</span> <span id="s99">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s100">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s101">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s102">Life would be different.</span> <span id="s103">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know.</span> <span id="s104">This is a different type of Hungarians.</span> <span id="s105">All right.</span> <span id="s106">In the beginning it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s107">A year or two or something, it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s108">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party.</span> <span id="s109">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar.</span> <span id="s110">Koozer and Googar.</span> <span id="s111">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to Visho because we know they're coming to Visho to make the pogrom.</span> <span id="s112">What happened when it came to the area, the Visho left, they turned right and they went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s113">They burned the whole town.</span> <span id="s114">They killed a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s115">They destroyed everything over there.</span> <span id="s116">That was in the late thirties.</span> <span id="s117">At that time, the anti-semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to school any more.</span> <span id="s118">All my schooling was four years.</span> <span id="s119">I could not go to school any more due to the fact that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s120">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing.</span> <span id="s121">My father was a singer on the weddings.</span> <span id="s122">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the area.</span> <span id="s123">They used to call him all around the area for states to sing and things.</span> <span id="s124">He used to put words together.</span> <span id="s125">If he would have been here in this country he would be the greatest man in the country as a singer.</span> <span id="s126">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and wagon, which almost everybody had that thing.</span> <span id="s127">We had a little farm there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life.</span> <span id="s128">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s129">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work.</span> <span id="s130">So, I went to work.</span> <span id="s131">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too.</span> <span id="s132">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work.</span> <span id="s133">The people who had stores think like this.</span> <span id="s134">I used to get paid and go to work.</span> <span id="s135">What was the work?</span> <span id="s136">Most of the work was preparation for the war.</span> <span id="s137">We went out to work on the volleys.</span> <span id="s138">We dig big holes.</span> <span id="s139">We put trenches around the tanks should not come through.</span> <span id="s140">The Russian tanks should not be able to come through the area.</span> <span id="s141">So, we worked day in and day out.</span> <span id="s142">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days.</span> <span id="s143">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years.</span> <span id="s144">They took away everything whatever we had.</span> <span id="s145">If somebody had a cow, they took it away.</span> <span id="s146">If they had a horse, they took it away.</span> <span id="s147">They left you flat with everything.</span> <span id="s148">The area where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way.</span> <span id="s149">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person.</span> <span id="s150">There was not such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: This was from what period?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s153">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said.</span> <span id="s154">They needed the wood and there was a wood factory.</span> <span id="s155">I worked in the mountains where they sawed the wood and we cleaned off, you know around the wood they had that black thing around the wood, we chopped it off to clean the wood to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood.</span> <span id="s156">So, it was a very hard life.</span> <span id="s157">We got paid very little.</span> <span id="s158">We got paid --talking about child labor.</span> <span id="s159">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day.</span> <span id="s160">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the Ghetto, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe.</span> <span id="s162">Did they know what was happening?</span> <span id="s163">Did they know about concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A. After, I would say in '43, we already it got very, very bad in general.</span> <span id="s165">Very bad for everybody for every Jew.</span> <span id="s166">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the street, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them.</span> <span id="s167">No reason.</span> <span id="s168">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up.</span> <span id="s169">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s170">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from Poland and she wrote a letter.</span> <span id="s171">She was in Poland and her husband was in Visho.</span> <span id="s172">They couldn't get together because the war started already.</span> <span id="s173">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there.</span> <span id="s174">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s175">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there.</span> <span id="s176">She wrote like this.</span> <span id="s177">There is _________________ that means money, ________ is no more.</span> <span id="s178">It doesn't exit any more.</span> <span id="s179">So we know from that two words we started to figure out what's going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s180">There was no radio or any other communication.</span> <span id="s181">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s182">Later on, the situation got very bad.</span> <span id="s183">We heard, first of all before the state came, they called to the Army.</span> <span id="s184">They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time, who were 17, 18 19 to go to the Army.</span> <span id="s185">In the Army they used those Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s186">They used them to bring ammunition to the front line to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army.</span> <span id="s187">The Army -- they had uniformed Army, they had yellow around the arms -- armband, yellow.</span> <span id="s188">This way they recognized them as Jews.</span> <span id="s189">There was also another group where they had white arm bands.</span> <span id="s190">That means they were not pure Jews.</span> <span id="s191">The mother was Jewish or the father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s192">So, they had two type of things.</span> <span id="s193">I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time, my father says to me, you don't have to go, let's go together because we don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s194">He also told me something -- he told me it looks like something is going on terrible in the world.</span> <span id="s195">I don't think you're going to be a Hungarian soldier.</span> <span id="s196">I think you are going to be some other place.</span> <span id="s197">Then, we all got together.</span> <span id="s198">They called us.</span> <span id="s199">How did they get the people together?</span> <span id="s200">There were drums.</span> <span id="s201">If you know when sometimes they have a drum and they bang on the drum and they got the people together, that was a sign that the whole town to get together because there is some news to tell.</span> <span id="s202">Then they tell us that everybody there's going to be a round up and they have to go in this and this area like but us on the street.</span> <span id="s203">There was the Jewish street and they started making the Ghetto all around.</span> <span id="s204">The Jewish street over there and the Romanian street's name was __________, the number was 25.</span> <span id="s205">The Hungarian name was _____________ 32.</span> <span id="s206">So, the reason is because I tell you this is because when they got us all together they told us which street to get in together.</span> <span id="s207">So this was the word the guy was using to get us there.</span> <span id="s208">And the same thing they got all around the town all around the little towns and they got all these people together and they bring them in and that's street around the area.</span> <span id="s209">We had so many people in the room that there was no room where to sleep or where to go or what to do anything because one was on top of the other one.</span> <span id="s210">The time wasn't too long in there.</span> <span id="s211">We was about a month in there.</span> <span id="s212">They were-- who was watching the Ghetto was the Hungarians and the Germans, the local people was watching in there.</span> <span id="s213">The food was very scarce.</span> <span id="s214">There was no food in there.</span> <span id="s215">My father used to know all those big shots in there from the town and he used to help a lot of people out.</span> <span id="s216">If they were having a problem, he used to help them out.</span> <span id="s217">He used to go there, so he went over to one of those guards and he said, "look we are all together in one place.”</span> <span id="s218">Those people they had farms - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time.</span> <span id="s219">They have them in the basement there.</span> <span id="s220">Let's bring it in.</span> <span id="s221">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow.</span> <span id="s222">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around.</span> <span id="s223">I got permission to go out of the Ghetto and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better.</span> <span id="s224">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them.</span> <span id="s225">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s226">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out.</span> <span id="s227">They put us in the line, find out how many people there are and they made four transports.</span> <span id="s228">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?"</span> <span id="s229">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer.”</span> <span id="s230">Do you have a _____ -- well, he didn't do anything he just bypassed and to find out that information.</span> <span id="s231">They made like I said four transports.</span> <span id="s232">We had two stations train stations.</span> <span id="s233">One stations they called it the small station where the train used to stop and drop off people, and the one station was a bigger station where the railroad came in.</span> <span id="s234">I also want to say that before all those things, I worked for the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s235">We took apart the tracks, the Romanian tracks, you know from the trains, and we send them into Hungary.</span> <span id="s236">So, I was loading and unloading the tracks.</span> <span id="s237">There was two Hungarian officers and they are not supposed to hire Jewish children for the job.</span> <span id="s238">When I went in there and applied for the job, he asked me the name, he asked me what your name, I said Bernard Pasternak.</span> <span id="s239">He said that sounds too Jewish, so he changed my name for Pasteronish.</span> <span id="s240">That's a real Hungarian name, and I got the job.</span> <span id="s241">They paid very good.</span> <span id="s242">We had it very good for a few months.</span> <span id="s243">The job only lasted for a few months because there wasn't so many tracks to pick apart and we loaded them.</span> <span id="s244">We did not load them in the same town, in Visho from the same city, we had to go about 50 miles away where they loaded those tracks.</span> <span id="s245">So we went with the big trucks and we unloaded.</span> <span id="s246">That was before the Ghetto and all those things happened.</span> <span id="s247">We -- due to the fact they were short on box cars, so they made four transports and we were going on the fourth transport.</span> <span id="s248">When they got together everybody, they told them don't take anything, just take what you could take with you because you have on other things over there and you wouldn't need them.</span> <span id="s249">To that point, we didn't know what was going on -- absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s250">As a matter of fact, they told us we were going to working camps until the war is over for security reasons or whatever they want.</span> <span id="s251">We arrived with the fourth transport.</span> <span id="s252">With the other three transports, I mean it was about two days apart, so the other three transports left.</span> <span id="s253">When we got to our transport, I saw the box car and we saw all those things what happened.</span> <span id="s254">People on there with small children crying throwing packets down on the Hungarian soldiers and the collaborators pulling the bags out of the family they are taking away everything.</span> <span id="s255">They didn't need it anyhow, but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s256">So finally, we went in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s257">I don't know, probably must have been 20 or 30 boxcars in there.</span> <span id="s258">We went in that car.</span> <span id="s259">He push you in, maybe seventy, eighty people.</span> <span id="s260">You can't tell how many you have with children, older ladies and things like this, and then they close the door and they locked it with a lock on the outside.</span> <span id="s261">The only air you had in that boxcar was if you see a boxcar, the ones you see in the Holocaust Museum, the same boxcar was the same one they were taking away.</span> <span id="s262">All you could see _____ is the same thing you see there.</span> <span id="s263">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the door for everybody and says there is water in the station here because those days all the trains were going with water, so they had to pump in the water.</span> <span id="s264">So, they opened the door and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the car and go fill up with water for the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s265">It happened I was the one and my father was the one.</span> <span id="s266">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other cars, and then my father saw a hatch on the boxcar, because every boxcar had a hatch probably for the _________ .</span> <span id="s267">He took that _____ so nobody should see it.</span> <span id="s268">We finish with the water, then close the boxcar and we started going.</span> <span id="s269">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a hole in there.</span> <span id="s270">Let's break the floor there to make a facility.”</span> <span id="s271">We worked quite a while.</span> <span id="s272">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a facility there to go out like a _____________ thing.</span> <span id="s273">Everybody was using this.</span> <span id="s274">We were putting something around there so people would have a little privacy.</span> <span id="s275">It took quite a few days before we got to Auschwitz, but the middle of the way there was a few guys in the boxcar they told me, if you could pay attention, are we turning left or right and Hungary.</span> <span id="s276">I says to the guy, no we are turning left, he says that's bad news because right is to Hungary, left is to Poland.</span> <span id="s277">It's the one other area.</span> <span id="s278">I don't remember if it took five days or six days.</span> <span id="s279">When we got off in Auschwitz, first of all in that time when I was taking the water there was a couple of dead children already, which I took them out and there was somebody going through with a carriage or wagon and I put them in the wagon because there was a lot of sick children already and they caught already.</span> <span id="s280">Nothing in there was no food, no nothing, very little things whatever we had.</span> <span id="s281">And the car, like my mother will know something.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: I want to ask you some questions about the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Who gave you permission to leave, or did you sneak out?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span> <span id="s286">You couldn't sneak out because the Ghetto was surrounded by corroborators to make sure nobody was out.</span> <span id="s287">And besides that, which I did not mention, you already had the yellow star.</span> <span id="s288">You had the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing the yellow star you were finished.</span> <span id="s289">So, right away they know you.</span> <span id="s290">And I think all the things that my father knew so many of those guys and they hand picked a few of the people to go out of the Ghetto to bring in the stuff.</span> <span id="s291">It wasn't -- the neighborhood was quite a ride, maybe thirty, forty miles in some area until we got all the food together and brought it in in the tank.</span> <span id="s292">Like I was saying, in the car, my mother put her hands around and squeezed me.</span> <span id="s293">She said, "I hope you remember me.”</span> <span id="s294">I did not know what she meant because we were so naive we didn't know what's going on until the last minute.</span> <span id="s295">When we got off of the train, first what I saw it was sickening just to see.</span> <span id="s296">Our boxcar had the only one facility from all the 40 or 50 wagons, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s297">They opened the door, all the dirt came out when they opened the door.</span> <span id="s298">People were half to the waist with that dirt around from the train because there was no other way.</span> <span id="s299">You had to go from so many days.</span> <span id="s300">Only one time I remember they opened for water and after that they did not open for water.</span> <span id="s301">The trains were going so fast.</span> <span id="s302">Usually in those days a train in Romania those days was going about 30 miles an hour.</span> <span id="s303">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the water in, the coal, all those things.</span> <span id="s304">It took a very long time for those trains until they reached the destination.</span> <span id="s305">But when we went in those boxcars, the trains were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours.</span> <span id="s306">We thought the train is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there.</span> <span id="s307">What difference does it make what happened to the train.</span> <span id="s308">Now, when we arrived already in Auschwitz, there was a lot of people over there came to the train.</span> <span id="s309">People were already in the camp.</span> <span id="s310">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady.</span> <span id="s311">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother.</span> <span id="s312">He said, "Give it to your mother.”</span> <span id="s313">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one side.</span> <span id="s314">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this.</span> <span id="s315">After I find out there was _______.</span> <span id="s316">I didn't even know who that is.</span> <span id="s317">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things.</span> <span id="s318">He selected them.</span> <span id="s319">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing.</span> <span id="s320">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work.</span> <span id="s321">They put them in another area for work.</span> <span id="s322">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the Ghetto, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work.</span> <span id="s323">That's what happened after.</span> <span id="s324">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?"</span> <span id="s325">And I said yes, what's going on over there?</span> <span id="s326">What are they doing there?</span> <span id="s327">He says, "They're burning people there.”</span> <span id="s328">I said, burning people?</span> <span id="s329">He said yes, they call it a crematorium and they're burning people over there.</span> <span id="s330">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there.</span> <span id="s331">This is the people who were there already.</span> <span id="s332">We went from there, we went in the camp from there.</span> <span id="s333">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the corner there.</span> <span id="s334">I took my coat and I throw it in the corner there.</span> <span id="s335">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back.</span> <span id="s336">It never happened.</span> <span id="s337">So, then we went to the camp.</span> <span id="s338">We went in the inside where they told the people what to do, where to go.</span> <span id="s339">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out.</span> <span id="s340">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s341">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians.</span> <span id="s342">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be.</span> <span id="s343">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing.</span> <span id="s344">My father says to me why go over.</span> <span id="s345">Let's be all together.</span> <span id="s346">Let's go together.</span> <span id="s347">The people in the barracks they were saying, why don't you let him go as a mechanic.</span> <span id="s348">Why -- suppose we go in another place.</span> <span id="s349">We could see already what's going on.</span> <span id="s350">Let him go over there.</span> <span id="s351">So finally my father says okay, go ahead.</span> <span id="s352">We went to another place in the camp there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s353">The whole thing was only a few days.</span> <span id="s354">We went to another place and then all those mechanics they had we got round up and we were taking by big trucks to ______________.</span> <span id="s355">We did not know at that time they took us to _____________.</span> <span id="s356">We figured there is the mechanics thing and there we were going to work.</span> <span id="s357">We arrived in __________.</span> <span id="s358">There was a camp over there already prepared.</span> <span id="s359">You got your place over there and everything and then we find out we're going to work in a coal mine.</span> <span id="s360">That's what they did with all of the mechanics.</span> <span id="s361">They put us in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s362">The next day we went already to work which they were putting it --- there was three shifts.</span> <span id="s363">There was a morning shift, a noon shift and a night shift.</span> <span id="s364">We went to the coal mine there and there was two types of mines in there.</span> <span id="s365">First one was about 1,000 feet and one was about 1500 or 1600 feet.</span> <span id="s366">I was working in the lower one, about 1500 feet.</span> <span id="s367">We came down there.</span> <span id="s368">They give you a light.</span> <span id="s369">They give you a light to go to be able to see because it's so dark.</span> <span id="s370">They gave me a lantern.</span> <span id="s371">The number was 4400.</span> <span id="s372">Also, when I go back, when I was in Auschwitz the time before I went to the camp, they give me they tattoo it, I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the people they sent to work they put a tattoo in my arm.</span> <span id="s373">I got the tattoo and I was so naive at that time.</span> <span id="s374">I was there with my cousin and we still didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s375">I saw they give numbers and I saw some people get smaller number and bigger number and I went to where they give a bigger number.</span> <span id="s376">Because we were naive we said let's have a bigger number.</span> <span id="s377">What they did to my cousin, I got 84 whatever I got number and he got a number after mine and something went wrong there and they put his head in a drum of water and they drowned him and he died on the spot over there.</span> <span id="s378">You never lasted more than a day over there in the camp.</span> <span id="s379">Then when we were going back, we went down to the coal mine --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Wait, let's go back once more.</span> <span id="s381">When you were in Auschwitz and you were going through registration, you were still with your father in registration, and did you know what had happened to your mother then?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, we did not know what happened to my mother until after I find out a few days later.</span> <span id="s383">Even they pointed out to us, we could not believe it.</span> <span id="s384">Then some people were talking about the people and who worked in the crematorium, they call it the ________________.</span> <span id="s385">They were saying to me, that's the ____________ living in that barracks over there, they have everything over there because they are doing such a special job.</span> <span id="s386">Well, we did not know after a while they got rid of the _____________ and took new people.</span> <span id="s387">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s388">Then we find out after what happened and who the ____________ was and what they did after a while.</span> <span id="s389">With my father, I was there after the first line up, the first appeal after that.</span> <span id="s390">Then, I went to the place where the coal mine was and my father wasn't at that place, and I never heard from him after.</span> <span id="s391">I never heard what happened.</span> <span id="s392">We went down in the coal mine, like I said, my lantern was 4400 and we were working with civilian Polish people.</span> <span id="s393">The light --my light had a red stripe around and the civilian had white.</span> <span id="s394">We also to recognize us, in the center of the hat there was a cut in straight, this way they recognize you right away in case you run away someplace.</span> <span id="s395">They put me to work in the coal mine, which I never heard of a coal mine.</span> <span id="s396">I never saw a coal mine.</span> <span id="s397">A coal mine is this way.</span> <span id="s398">The one I was it was approximately four or five feet high.</span> <span id="s399">That doesn't mean there's coal in the whole thing.</span> <span id="s400">The coal is only about two feet in the middle.</span> <span id="s401">In order to get the coal out, you have to have some kind of supporters to hold up, to be able to take the coal out.</span> <span id="s402">They dynamite the coal and if you wouldn't have had supporters, the whole thing would fall down.</span> <span id="s403">So, you had to have special supporters to hold up and then to dig the coal out to get the coal out.</span> <span id="s404">Once we got the coal out from there, you took it out with a shovel and there was something not far from where you throw the shovel there, it was something, it was going up and down, five inches up, five inches down, you know it was shaking until the coal went down, because it was a little down hill over there.</span> <span id="s405">There was one day when they come to inspect it looks like the Germans didn't get enough coal and they came to inspect the mines.</span> <span id="s406">What happened how come there is no more coming out.</span> <span id="s407">I saw some people from far away, but I didn't pay much attention who they are, but they did look to me like they're civilians, Polish civilians, work in the mine.</span> <span id="s408">They come around and they stop everybody over there who were working there.</span> <span id="s409">Some of them they said report to the office, which I never saw those people again anymore.</span> <span id="s410">So they took them off the line and they got new people.</span> <span id="s411">Then I was told they eliminated them because they didn't do the job.</span> <span id="s412">Somehow, for some reason I don't know I always worked very hard all my life and I saw there is no way out.</span> <span id="s413">You really have to work if you want to survive.</span> <span id="s414">So, I picked up work, kept on working the right way and they come around, the inspectors, the Nazi inspector, they came around and they checked me out, how I worked.</span> <span id="s415">Then the guy asked me, what is your number.</span> <span id="s416">I showed him my tattoo and so the other guy says to me, you know you're going to have a lot of problems because they took your number down like the other guy.</span> <span id="s417">No, it was the other way around, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s418">They gave me a premium of a bottle of wine because I was a good worker.</span> <span id="s419">I took the bottle of wine and turned it in for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s420">I gave it to one of the kapos inside.</span> <span id="s421">They gave me a piece of bread for it, which I wouldn't drink it anyhow.</span> <span id="s422">Also, for the good workers, they also give two cigarettes a day.</span> <span id="s423">I also turned in my cigarettes for a little soup or whatever they could.</span> <span id="s424">There were some people who were chain smokers, they give away their food for the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s425">There was quite a few prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war, and most of them they give away the cigarettes for the thing.</span> <span id="s426">What did we eat when going into the mine?</span> <span id="s427">In the morning, we had black coffee with a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s428">Of course there was no lunch.</span> <span id="s429">Lunch you were at the mercy of the civilians.</span> <span id="s430">If you find a good civilian there, he'd throw you a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s431">If you find a civilian who didn't have or he didn't care, you were there with bread, without a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s432">Somehow, someway I managed to recognize the guys a little bit, I always had a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s433">We were working until 6:00 at night.</span> <span id="s434">From 8:00 in the morning until about 6:00 at night.</span> <span id="s435">Something like that.</span> <span id="s436">Like I was saying, there was a morning and a noon shift and a night shift.</span> <span id="s437">The night shift, the people who brought the SS who escorted the morning shift had to take back the noon shift from the camp.</span> <span id="s438">They always took back a shift because we didn't walk back to the camp without a Nazi guard, which I would say it was a 15, 20 minute to half hour walk.</span> <span id="s439">At night they had to take us back, they brought another shift and they had to take us back to the camp there.</span> <span id="s440">What happened?</span> <span id="s441">We had something to finish and those Germans did not wait for us.</span> <span id="s442">We were sitting in that coal mine until the next evening.</span> <span id="s443">No food, absolutely no food, no nothing, only the mercy, whatever the civilian throw you a piece of bread of things like this.</span> <span id="s444">I also, on Sunday we did not work.</span> <span id="s445">We worked six days a week.</span> <span id="s446">On Sunday I also volunteer to clean the barracks a little bit for that I got another little soup.</span> <span id="s447">I always tried to manage somehow to get a little more.</span> <span id="s448">When we went in the coal mine, the kapos they were carrying the lights to see where to go.</span> <span id="s449">I used to carry it for them or for that when I went back to the camp they give me another little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s450">So, I was trying to look around to see how I should be able to get a little bit more than I could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: When you were working in the coal mine, if you missed the SS going back to the camp, and you spent the whole night in the coal mine, were there guards there that you couldn't have left a night, you were locked in the coal mines?</span> <span id="s452">Did you work if you got stuck there?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, you did not work when you got stuck there and you couldn't leave the coal mine because you had 1500 feet to go up by elevator.</span> <span id="s454">The lift took you down, so you couldn't leave anyhow and there was guards over there and a lot of corroborators.</span> <span id="s455">You couldn't go no place and you had to stay right in there.</span> <span id="s456">It was pretty cool too, it was July, August and it was pretty cool.</span> <span id="s457">There was horses and wagons in there.</span> <span id="s458">There was little wagons not with the train, you pushed it by hand the railroad train.</span> <span id="s459">There was a lot of things going on in that mine.</span> <span id="s460">When you came out of that mine, you know it almost blinded you.</span> <span id="s461">I had to keep my hand for a few minutes on my eyes because down in the mine, I saw very well like it was daylight, once you get used to it.</span> <span id="s462">Then when you came out, you have to be prepared otherwise you would lose your eyes.</span> <span id="s463">When we went back to the camp, like I said, you have to take a shower every night.</span> <span id="s464">The place, I would describe it, it wasn't a dirty place.</span> <span id="s465">Really, they kept it very clean and we were forced to keep it clean.</span> <span id="s466">In the morning when we get up, we had to make our bed.</span> <span id="s467">It was a three bunk bed and when you make the bed the one was helping the other one.</span> <span id="s468">If there was a little bit uneven they came they take it apart and you have to go all over again.</span> <span id="s469">Sometimes you couldn't even mix a little piece of bread with coffee, black coffee, because you had to make sure the bed is all right.</span> <span id="s470">When we came home, we took a shower and in this camp there was also other people who did not work in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s471">They called them _________________.</span> <span id="s472">That means they were working outside in the fields.</span> <span id="s473">We were getting different soap than the __________________ was getting.</span> <span id="s474">They got a little piece of white soap, and we got a piece of yellow soap.</span> <span id="s475">The white soap did not take off the dirt, the coal dirt, because when we came out from there we were black, coal black.</span> <span id="s476">We were --for two or three days we were spitting black.</span> <span id="s477">So, this yellow soap was very good soap.</span> <span id="s478">It did the job.</span> <span id="s479">It cleaned everything off.</span> <span id="s480">Somehow, we got together with some people over there and we saw that piece of yellow soap, I would describe it it was about four by three inches and maybe one inch thick.</span> <span id="s481">Four by three approximately.</span> <span id="s482">And that soap was written a R-I-F.</span> <span id="s483">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s484">We always said one to the other one give me RIF soap, give me a piece of RIF because it's better.</span> <span id="s485">You also had to be careful because they only give you a certain time, they give you the soap it should last you a certain time, but when you bend down, you know, sometimes they stole the piece of soap.</span> <span id="s486">That soap, the civilian used to buy it.</span> <span id="s487">You know, you could put it in the pocket and bring it out, you got an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s488">So, you had to be very careful it shouldn't be stolen.</span> <span id="s489">But later on, I was told that the R-I-F meant ___________ fat, pure Jewish fat.</span> <span id="s490">That was what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Who told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: The people who were watching in there in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s493">They told us that at the end already.</span> <span id="s494">Now, the situation, in that camp in there by the coal mine in ____________.</span> <span id="s495">The situation when we were not working on Sundays, we had three meals a day.</span> <span id="s496">In the morning, like I said, we had a piece of bread and coffee.</span> <span id="s497">Lunch we had a little soup, no bread, and in the evening we had soup and a piece of bread when we came from the coal mine.</span> <span id="s498">If you knew a kapo, like I was carrying his lamp and things like this, so he couldn't do much for me, the only one thing when he dig in the spoon to put it in my plate, the food, it was full to the top so I already got awarded.</span> <span id="s499">I had a little more food in there.</span> <span id="s500">Once in a while there was some kind of a piece of a meat.</span> <span id="s501">I don't think it weighed a tenth of one ounce.</span> <span id="s502">So, sometimes I take two pieces of that thing because I was carrying the light.</span> <span id="s503">We had a lot of shooting around the area.</span> <span id="s504">We had a lot of bombs dropping in there and then we figured something is going on.</span> <span id="s505">We saw a lot of planes coming around, flying over.</span> <span id="s506">We saw a lot of captured pilots when we looked out of the thing, they brought them in.</span> <span id="s507">Then we know something is going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Can we go back to some of the details.</span> <span id="s509">This period of time that you're talking about in that coal mine is from probably May through December.</span> <span id="s510">Tell me about what you had to wear and tell me about how hot it was or how cold it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Are you talking about in the mine?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: In the mine and in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: In the barracks we had that stripe uniforms like everybody else.</span> <span id="s514">They were clean.</span> <span id="s515">We cleaned them.</span> <span id="s516">There was laundry things.</span> <span id="s517">They were clean.</span> <span id="s518">In the mines when we come in we had to change clothes.</span> <span id="s519">The next day we had another pair of clothes.</span> <span id="s520">They were pretty clean.</span> <span id="s521">So, it wasn't cold.</span> <span id="s522">I don't remember being cold in the barracks at that time.</span> <span id="s523">We were very important workers because they.</span> <span id="s524">needed the coal so bad and the trains were coming and going back and forth so that mine was working 24 hours so they want to keep us in good shape.</span> <span id="s525">When the inspectors came and they didn't like who somebody was they took them off and they put new people, then we find out that they eliminated those people.</span> <span id="s526">They took them out of camp.</span> <span id="s527">Sometime they could pick out 50 to 100 people in one day.</span> <span id="s528">The next day you saw brand new people around.</span> <span id="s529">So, too many old people under six months were in there, only those who did their day's work, did more than a day's work they could work and the others they just picked them up like they were nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: You were about 20 at this time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, I was about 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What was the age range of the people who were in that camp, and do you know about how many people went with you every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: There was I would say at least 100 150 people at one time going.</span> <span id="s534">There was of course, when we moved out from the camp, from the barracks, we went to the mine.</span> <span id="s535">We walked, and there was SS on both sides watching us.</span> <span id="s536">You also, you didn't walk the right way, you walked like a soldier.</span> <span id="s537">You know you had to go, the steps had to be even, if you didn't pay attention, it just happen you didn't pay attention to the step the guy came over and put his leg between the leg and you fall down, you know in the face, then you know right away you didn't go on the step.</span> <span id="s538">All the way, most of the time you used to say "one two, one two ___________".</span> <span id="s539">That's what they kept us to make the step there.</span> <span id="s540">The SS they did not come in in the barracks.</span> <span id="s541">They stayed on the outside until we get in the barracks.</span> <span id="s542">So, we came to the barracks and music was playing.</span> <span id="s543">We walked in.</span> <span id="s544">There was a band and we came in and there was right away ___________ they called it, they counted the people.</span> <span id="s545">A lot of the time there was a disappearing too because there was local, let's say people, who knew the language, the Polish language, who know that language at that time.</span> <span id="s546">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s547">The thing was if they caught someone who ran away, they make you watch the hanging.</span> <span id="s548">They were hanging them on the spot.</span> <span id="s549">They got him, and then they would -- let's say we got home at 6:00 at night and then this they put you around and the hanging thing was in the center and you couldn't put your head down because they knocked your teeth out.</span> <span id="s550">You had to look straight up the way they were hanging the people.</span> <span id="s551">There was quite a few hangings over there.</span> <span id="s552">I only remember one guy that before they hanged him he said in Polish "__________", that's what it is.</span> <span id="s553">And I never forget that voice what he said.</span> <span id="s554">There was about three or four hangings in that evening.</span> <span id="s555">And then we went to our business like go to the shower and go to the food and like this.</span> <span id="s556">But most of the time when we came home, we said oh boy another hanging, you know.</span> <span id="s557">They put, if you ever watch those movies the way they hang things like this, you have to wait until the guy is blue, you could not put down your head for five or ten minutes until the guy finished when they figured he was real dead they let us go to our business.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: In your time in the Ghetto and in your time in the coal mines and the camp, did you form friendships?</span> <span id="s561">Did you have relationships with people that were especially close to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Are we talking about the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Well, in the Ghetto, most of the people we know from the area.</span> <span id="s565">We had a pretty close relationship with most of the people in there.</span> <span id="s566">I wouldn't say one had the other one thing like this because it was a thing like disaster thing, you know everyone was trying to cooperate and see whatever we could work out.</span> <span id="s567">Like home where I was, my mother she had the kitchen there so there was I go in one day I see two three, four women in there they are all cooking in the same place.</span> <span id="s568">You were cooking there with wood.</span> <span id="s569">You had to chop wood and all those things, light up the wood and things like this.</span> <span id="s570">Of course, the whole kitchen was full of smoke in the beginning until the wood started burning a little bit.</span> <span id="s571">But I would say most of them cooperate one with the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: What about prayer?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Prayer is this way.</span> <span id="s574">Most of which the religion was so great it was one of the main things in the town is the religion.</span> <span id="s575">Everything, whatever the rabbi said, things like this, had to be from the religion.</span> <span id="s576">As a matter of fact, in the late thirties there was a lost of pioneers, they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s577">That day it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s578">They went at that time they got all together, and I also was in Batar (ph).</span> <span id="s579">The Batar, you know that's the right wing body.</span> <span id="s580">I was there, and I was ready.</span> <span id="s581">I went to meetings, and I was ready to emigrate to Israel, because I am one -- there are a lot of people like this, which I love Israel and I love Zionist.</span> <span id="s582">I love the things.</span> <span id="s583">I was ready to emigrate to Israel, but our rabbis said you cannot go to Israel, to Palestine because there's strife over there and your a non-Jew over there so they forbid us to go to Israel in those days.</span> <span id="s584">So, we just had to take our things whatever and we had to stick with whatever they told us.</span> <span id="s585">There was a few people who didn't listen and they went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Do you remember if people prayed in the cattle cars in the first transport, did they know where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well afterwards I said you turn right you go to Hungary, you turn left and you go to Poland.</span> <span id="s588">That time we know something is wrong, that they are taking us some place.</span> <span id="s589">Yes, there were people, they had little bibles in the pocket.</span> <span id="s590">As a matter of fact, there was one guy with me from Czechoslovakia he had a little bible.</span> <span id="s591">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s592">It must be seven by seven by two, a very thin one and he asked me -- it was on Rosh Hoshanna -- he asked me if I wanted to pray and I said yes, I took the little bible and we were praying.</span> <span id="s593">He was passing around that thing.</span> <span id="s594">I don't know if there were any more but people were praying, the religion was one of the greatest things.</span> <span id="s595">Everybody was doing, just following the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Were you punished for that in the camp if they found out, or was that not part of it in the camp.</span> <span id="s597">You had so many different people?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well, most of the people in the camp, in the coal mine, there wasn't only Jews, there was a lot of people, a lot of prisoners of war, a lot of French prisoners of war a lot of other type of prisoners of war, and the camp we could did pray a little bit.</span> <span id="s599">As a matter of fact, there was one day I remember on Yom Kippur we got all together in a corner and someone was leading the services between all the people.</span> <span id="s600">The Germans didn't come in.</span> <span id="s601">The Nazis weren't there and the way how we got our food in the camp is they took your number down.</span> <span id="s602">One guy -- his name was Max, he was French, a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s603">I don't know.</span> <span id="s604">He had a board and he put down all the names from the barracks.</span> <span id="s605">We were there maybe 5200 people in the barrack, he put down all the numbers from everybody, and when you went to get the food, he just looked at you.</span> <span id="s606">He knew exactly your number and he marked it off.</span> <span id="s607">If he didn't know your number, he asked you.</span> <span id="s608">Is this and this your number and then you pass by him and he marked you off on that board.</span> <span id="s609">So, the relationship inside I wouldn't say -- we had some Greeks there, some Greek prisoners of war because I heard so many different languages.</span> <span id="s610">That's the way I picked up a little Russian a little Polish things like this.</span> <span id="s611">When the Hungarians came in in 1940 I speak very little Hungarian, almost nothing.</span> <span id="s612">Now, I'm very good in Hungarian and also of course Romania.</span> <span id="s613">I went to Romania school and then German, I had German when the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s614">After the war, I was in Italy.</span> <span id="s615">I picked up Italian and then I picked up Spanish.</span> <span id="s616">I picked up about six or seven languages now which I could talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Tell me more about whether you think your parents knew more than they told you.</span> <span id="s618">Do you think they protected you from knowing?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No.</span> <span id="s620">I don't think my mother knew but I think my father had a very good idea of what's going on.</span> <span id="s621">It's a possibility he was told from his friends what happened.</span> <span id="s622">He didn't pass it on.</span> <span id="s623">I could just tell you one more time.</span> <span id="s624">My father was one of the greatest man there was in that area with his knowledge and smarting.</span> <span id="s625">I don't think there was a second man.</span> <span id="s626">Anyone had a problem or something, they used to go to him.</span> <span id="s627">He spoke perfect Hungarian at that time, which he was in the Army.</span> <span id="s628">He was an officer in the Army.</span> <span id="s629">Then, it looks like the Germans find out in the camp that he was an officer in their Army in World War I.</span> <span id="s630">They sent him to _______________.</span> <span id="s631">___________________ was like a model of the camps they said in Germany.</span> <span id="s632">He was there with a friend.</span> <span id="s633">He was a druggist.</span> <span id="s634">So, between both of them, the friend who was a druggist which my father know about horses, they became a veteran doctor for the German horses in the camp.</span> <span id="s635">It wasn't too bad until about a month before, which we keep the _____________, that's the day when he dies is the first day of ______________ after Passover.</span> <span id="s636">The first day after Passover.</span> <span id="s637">Why do we know?</span> <span id="s638">Because people who liberated from there they told us exactly all those things which I tell you now.</span> <span id="s639">How did he die?</span> <span id="s640">The bombs.</span> <span id="s641">There was such a tremendous bombing at that time and he got killed with the bombs because probably they wanted to wipe out Germans.</span> <span id="s642">They had a lot of military things in there and they wiped him out.</span> <span id="s643">He was going to work, and other ones were going to work, so they all got killed, one month before the liberation.</span> <span id="s644">That's why we know exactly that date.</span> <span id="s645">We keep that date and time.</span> <span id="s646">We have the tablets from his memorial thing.</span> <span id="s647">We have it in Israel.</span> <span id="s648">There's a rabbi ______________.</span> <span id="s649">We grew up together.</span> <span id="s650">We helped him build the schull over there and we put all the memorial tablets in his schull at ___________.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Let's now, I think we covered the coal mine.</span> <span id="s652">When do you think the death march began?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Tell me how you knew it was coming, or did you know, or was it just sudden?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: When we saw so many bombs falling --- during the night, during the day we only heard boom, boom, boom, you know.</span> <span id="s656">You couldn't even sleep.</span> <span id="s657">If you wanted to sleep you couldn't sleep because you heard so many bombs falling, so many shots and things like this.</span> <span id="s658">Then we figured we know it's the Russians at that time because we know it from home that the Russians were invading at that time and we know what happened.</span> <span id="s659">So, we know that the Russians are close.</span> <span id="s660">So, they closed off the camp and at that time, they got everybody together and we started moving out.</span> <span id="s661">It was December or January.</span> <span id="s662">We started walking.</span> <span id="s663">Whoever had a good pair of shoes had a good pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s664">Whoever had most of the time we had that wooden shoe on.</span> <span id="s665">That's most of the time you were wearing.</span> <span id="s666">But sometimes, some people had regular pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s667">I don't know how they got it, but they got it so we were walking most of the time with a wooden shoe.</span> <span id="s668">We start up it was I could tell you now it was in the evening during dark.</span> <span id="s669">We started walking.</span> <span id="s670">I would estimate 5,000 people, 6,000 people.</span> <span id="s671">We started walking.</span> <span id="s672">Walked all night.</span> <span id="s673">We walked all day, no stop.</span> <span id="s674">On the afternoon of the second day, they took us in to a farm, a farm area and they scattered us all around there in an open field where nobody could run away and they had all the SS surrounding us.</span> <span id="s675">I also heard the SS talking Romania, some were talking Hungarian, some were talking Polish, most were corroborators.</span> <span id="s676">So, when we got in that open field, I saw a place where there was a lot of hay and the farms packed it up over there probably for their animals, things like this.</span> <span id="s677">I went in that hay.</span> <span id="s678">I made myself a little hole in there.</span> <span id="s679">I went in there, the first thing I did I took the shoes off I put my feet in the hay, I took my shoes off and the socks were soaked and wet and frozen.</span> <span id="s680">I put it around my waist all around and tried to dry them off a little bit.</span> <span id="s681">I kept them there for an hour or so, two hours, and then put them back on and started looking for food, whatever you could find.</span> <span id="s682">There was a lot of fields with different type of food packed up over there.</span> <span id="s683">They put it away for winter.</span> <span id="s684">Some people broke in, they took it out, they never came out.</span> <span id="s685">They killed them.</span> <span id="s686">I was lucky somehow over there which I find some dry beets things like this, whatever is left and things like this and that's what I ate the next day.</span> <span id="s687">Now, if you don't eat for so many days you get weak and weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s688">The order looks like it was from the commanding officer there.</span> <span id="s689">Anybody who could not walk, you had to eliminate them.</span> <span id="s690">And those collaborators with the Germans they did a good job.</span> <span id="s691">Anybody who could follow, they shoot them.</span> <span id="s692">They kill them on the spot.</span> <span id="s693">At the time when we walked, we saw so many dead bodies on both sides, females, male, when we saw those things we tried to pull off a pair of shoes, things like this and that's the way I got my shoes in there.</span> <span id="s694">I took it off of a dead body.</span> <span id="s695">I took a coat off, some kind of a blanket, so, we kept on walking.</span> <span id="s696">We walked for another few days.</span> <span id="s697">We --when I say walk, we did not walk.</span> <span id="s698">We dragged the legs because you could not raise your leg more than an half an inch.</span> <span id="s699">There was no strength to raise your feet a little bit, so you were dragging him until you came in Czechoslovakia to a railroad station and they were looking for boxcars.</span> <span id="s700">It was January at that time already and Europe is very cold this time of the year.</span> <span id="s701">So, they were looking for boxcar and they came around the Germans they say the language I had no problem because I spoke the language.</span> <span id="s702">So they said there is no more boxcars we had to go in open cars.</span> <span id="s703">So there was some open cars over there and there was some snow then maybe two feet of snow was inside in those cars.</span> <span id="s704">It looks like they didn't use them for a long time.</span> <span id="s705">The first thing we did was a few guys over there with the little strength we had we pushed the snow to the center a little bit.</span> <span id="s706">We went in maybe eighty ninety people in that open car.</span> <span id="s707">Some of the people you know we were all around, sitting all around that car but some of the people had no room to get in there so they were staying in the center of the car, of that boxcar.</span> <span id="s708">We were leaning one to the other one just to try to get a little warm in there.</span> <span id="s709">We were going maybe another day or so then we stopped in the station and then one guy was hollering from down there he asked is there anybody that could hear us or see us, so with a little strength I had I went up and looked down.</span> <span id="s710">So, he was saying in German how many people are in that car.</span> <span id="s711">I counted and there was I think 82 or 84, but I remember counting.</span> <span id="s712">I told him how many people.</span> <span id="s713">They told them I would say approximately about a pound of bread, a little loaf of bread, the same thing about a pound of margarine.</span> <span id="s714">When I give it out to everybody, there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s715">It was exactly what I said.</span> <span id="s716">So, we were going for another few days, we were driving in the car for another few days and the only food we had was like a piece a bread and the margarine.</span> <span id="s717">The margarine was so hard that I was nibbling in the margarine.</span> <span id="s718">It was hard.</span> <span id="s719">We didn't know where we were going, of course.</span> <span id="s720">Finally the destination was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s721">We arrived at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s722">Came to the railroad station and there is everybody out from the 80 people I think 20 went out.</span> <span id="s723">The rest of them froze to death on the car there.</span> <span id="s724">We went out from that car where we could.</span> <span id="s725">We went in the camp there.</span> <span id="s726">They had some soup for us, arrived in there, which I remember we had some soup.</span> <span id="s727">We went in there, we got a little soup.</span> <span id="s728">They give us showers over there.</span> <span id="s729">Of course, they cut our hair.</span> <span id="s730">Cut everything, you know, undress completely, cut everything.</span> <span id="s731">Went under the shower and then they give us a new number because the Auschwitz number, the tattoo number was no good for Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s732">So, they give us a new number, and we have to go by the number now because nobody had a name.</span> <span id="s733">My new number 117,682 so wherever you went you had to know the number because that was your life.</span> <span id="s734">There was a few days we were over there in Buchenwald, so we rested a little bit.</span> <span id="s735">The barracks wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s736">In there, it was a little warm in that barrack at that time, and we had a little soup, things like this.</span> <span id="s737">We were able to stand on our legs.</span> <span id="s738">There came big trucks and they took us to ___________ to another camp _____________.</span> <span id="s739">That camp wasn't the same camp where we were in the coal mine thing.</span> <span id="s740">That was one of the filthiest camp in there.</span> <span id="s741">It was so bad in there there was no where to lay down in there.</span> <span id="s742">You had to sleep and go lay down wherever you could in there.</span> <span id="s743">The lice were eating you up.</span> <span id="s744">You could take them away with your hand.</span> <span id="s745">You could take a whole bunch with one hand and push them away.</span> <span id="s746">Wherever you turn around, it's like mosquitos, where you go in a place with mosquitos around.</span> <span id="s747">That's the way the lice were around you.</span> <span id="s748">So, they got us together again and they put us to work in the next town.</span> <span id="s749">The next town's name was ____________.</span> <span id="s750">We went to work there in a mine, a stone mine.</span> <span id="s751">We were digging stones, we were digging dirt out.</span> <span id="s752">That's the job they gave us.</span> <span id="s753">I don't know really what they were doing over there, but we were working in the mine in there, taking stones out.</span> <span id="s754">Then I saw there were little wagons in there and there was a lot of _______ and I said to myself you know, maybe I could find out if they had any mechanic work over here and I shouldn't have to dig and shovel rocks out of there.</span> <span id="s755">I went down there.</span> <span id="s756">You couldn't run away because you had Nazis all around watching you.</span> <span id="s757">You couldn't go far.</span> <span id="s758">You could only go where you were working.</span> <span id="s759">I went over there and there was two guys, one German, heavyset guy.</span> <span id="s760">He was as bad as hell.</span> <span id="s761">But there was another guy, a shorter fellow, his name was Max.</span> <span id="s762">I said to him in German, I said, I am a mechanic and you have so many of those guns, the drill guns, maybe you want me to help you out with this.</span> <span id="s763">So, there was a Russian guy also, a prisoner of war, and that guy, he understood that kind of work.</span> <span id="s764">He got the job.</span> <span id="s765">So, this guy says to me, this guy Max, he says, you know what, he says he's better in this, I have another job for you.</span> <span id="s766">Go back up to the mines and whatever you see needs a little oil, a little fixing, so be the mechanic there and make sure everything runs smooth.</span> <span id="s767">I was very happy he gave me some tools.</span> <span id="s768">I don't think the tools weighed two pounds.</span> <span id="s769">I couldn't even carry the tools.</span> <span id="s770">I was so weak I couldn't even carry those tools, but some how, some way I carried the tools up there, and I was trying to fix whatever I can until the day passed, and then we walked back to the camp whatever, the way we could walk back.</span> <span id="s771">We went back to the camp which it was ____________ because we were working in _________________.</span> <span id="s772">We passed a lot of the town.</span> <span id="s773">We walked through the town, which it was written in some hotel, this hotel is only for people who want to gain a little weight.</span> <span id="s774">In German it was written.</span> <span id="s775">That hotel is known for _______________.</span> <span id="s776">It was written over there in the town.</span> <span id="s777">When we went through the town, the Germans, they came out and they brought some food for the SS.</span> <span id="s778">They feed them food.</span> <span id="s779">God forbid if one was trying to grab the food.</span> <span id="s780">He didn't make it back to the camp.</span> <span id="s781">We went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s782">It went on for a little while going back and forth.</span> <span id="s783">Then we saw a lot of bombs, airplanes with a lot of things flying around.</span> <span id="s784">Then we say, something is going on and something will happen.</span> <span id="s785">From there, it wasn't a long time -- it was only a few months in that camp.</span> <span id="s786">Then we started walking back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s787">That was the second death march.</span> <span id="s788">That was the most miserable death march anyone could witness.</span> <span id="s789">We left a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s790">The way we left and the way we were going.</span> <span id="s791">I don't think we arrived a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s792">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s793">On the way we were going, the bombs were so great and the artillery fired was so severe, things like this, the Germans were so afraid that they are going to kill them.</span> <span id="s794">At that time, we had the striped clothes and of course we had some coats, too, striped coats.</span> <span id="s795">While you were walking, the way you were walking and the planes they come so low, they could have picked you off with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s796">The Germans I had two Germans under my coat.</span> <span id="s797">They were hiding under really my coat they shouldn't be able to be picked up.</span> <span id="s798">They survived that way, too.</span> <span id="s799">I wasn't the only one.</span> <span id="s800">Only the other people were the same way, they did to the other people the same thing.</span> <span id="s801">We were hiding.</span> <span id="s802">I saw on the way the supply landing strip, with trucks, with food burning.</span> <span id="s803">We were running to the truck to see if maybe there was some kind of a food leftover, which did not burn.</span> <span id="s804">When you run to the truck, the Germans killed you.</span> <span id="s805">You couldn't even go to the truck.</span> <span id="s806">There was also a lot of farm there was a lot of food from the farm.</span> <span id="s807">There was apples things like this on both sides.</span> <span id="s808">If you run down to grab an apple the Germans killed you.</span> <span id="s809">You didn't have to wait for the Nazis to kill you, they killed you once you stepped out of line.</span> <span id="s810">It came to a point, I was so weak, I really could not go any more.</span> <span id="s811">I saw a truck over there where they picked up, it was in town, they picked up all the people who could not walk anymore, really could not walk, they tell them to go in the truck and they carry them in the truck and they put them flat in a German flat truck.</span> <span id="s812">When I went over there, I got a beating from the Germans with a rifle.</span> <span id="s813">I got hit over the head and I got hit in the stomach and the side and he says to me in German ___________________.</span> <span id="s814">I still could walk.</span> <span id="s815">We walked for another few hours.</span> <span id="s816">That truck, which I'm supposed to be on they blew it up with grenades out of town.</span> <span id="s817">They blew the whole truck up with all the people inside there.</span> <span id="s818">Finally, we arrive in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Who blew it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: The Germans, the Germans blew it up.</span> <span id="s821">When I saw, before we arrived in Buchenwald, I never saw a plane how it looks until it came so long, which actually, they waved at us the people over there.</span> <span id="s822">That low they came down.</span> <span id="s823">I really couldn't make out what kind of a plane they were, whether they were British or which Allies they were, but I did find out.</span> <span id="s824">They were American planes.</span> <span id="s825">I did find out that after the war.</span> <span id="s826">Then finally we arrived in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s827">In Buchenwald when we arrived it was one of the miserable things that ever happened to anybody in there.</span> <span id="s828">You arrived in there.</span> <span id="s829">You were laying flat.</span> <span id="s830">You go in there and first of all you couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s831">You were laying in there.</span> <span id="s832">You were sick.</span> <span id="s833">All kind of sickness you had in there.</span> <span id="s834">Then a day later they were giving you some soup.</span> <span id="s835">Now, you had to stay in the line to get some food.</span> <span id="s836">There was no such thing anymore about names and numbers.</span> <span id="s837">You went over to get the soup.</span> <span id="s838">You were lined up a few thousand people because there was camp from before.</span> <span id="s839">They brought in other camps in that center camp.</span> <span id="s840">You lined up by the time you took the food -- when they give you the food, by the time a few feet away, they grabbed it from you already.</span> <span id="s841">The people themselves, the hungry people, they grabbed you.</span> <span id="s842">You had to be very lucky to eat the food they give it to you over there because somebody would grab it.</span> <span id="s843">When I saw what happened when it came to my turn, as soon as they put it in, I swallowed it on the spot.</span> <span id="s844">I didn't even carry it further down.</span> <span id="s845">Sometimes I was lucky and I went twice in the lines.</span> <span id="s846">Sometimes I could go twice.</span> <span id="s847">A few days later we heard again shouting and we saw planes flying on top of us.</span> <span id="s848">We heard a lot of shouting going on and that's the time the Germans already came into the camp, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s849">They already came into the camp and they started grabbing everybody because there was one place which was still in German hands.</span> <span id="s850">They wanted to get the people there.</span> <span id="s851">They were still grabbing people and whoever they could, they came in with a gun, and whoever couldn't make it, they shot him on the spot, which before, like I said, a German never came into the camp.</span> <span id="s852">And they shot so many people on the spot over there, I saw what happened.</span> <span id="s853">It came to my mind very fast.</span> <span id="s854">I had a _____ in my nose, which it was bleeding all the time.</span> <span id="s855">I had to touch my nose it was bleeding.</span> <span id="s856">So, I was laying down on the ground and I touch my nose and whatever blood I had I had in my mouth, put it in my mouth and lay down flat on my back with the eyes turned over.</span> <span id="s857">I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s858">I don't know how many pounds I have, maybe 50, 60, 40.</span> <span id="s859">I don't know how many pounds I had.</span> <span id="s860">I was laying and then I saw the dead bodies how they look, so I was imitating the dead bodies over there.</span> <span id="s861">When the Germans came, two, three, four.</span> <span id="s862">They all come around, and they first they shot all around whoever made a little move.</span> <span id="s863">When they came around and the guy was loading the guns he says here's another one.</span> <span id="s864">The other said, don't waste your bullets he's _____________.</span> <span id="s865">He shouldn't shoot anymore.</span> <span id="s866">I was laying there, maybe an hour, an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s867">I didn't even want to open my eyes to see who was around.</span> <span id="s868">Then a guy walks around and says whoever can get up get because the Germans are gone, the Americans are here, at that time.</span> <span id="s869">Now we tried to get up whatever we could.</span> <span id="s870">I saw American soldiers.</span> <span id="s871">Several of them were speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s872">They came around and they talk in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s873">That was one of the greatest things.</span> <span id="s874">American soldier to come over to me and say in Yiddish, is there more Jews around?</span> <span id="s875">I said they're all Jews.</span> <span id="s876">Most of them are all Jews around.</span> <span id="s877">They were trying to do whatever they can.</span> <span id="s878">They did not touch us because we were all sick.</span> <span id="s879">Not to get any disease from that thing.</span> <span id="s880">I see more soldiers and more soldiers coming around and checking out what's going on.</span> <span id="s881">Later on, a while later I find out that guy who was watching and looking there it was General Patton's third army.</span> <span id="s882">Those people liberated us.</span> <span id="s883">It took a little while until everybody come to himself.</span> <span id="s884">It was one of the biggest mistake that our own people in the camps did.</span> <span id="s885">They went and emptied out all the food that the Germans had accumulated.</span> <span id="s886">They brought it in to the camp.</span> <span id="s887">Nobody told us be careful, your stomach has shrunk.</span> <span id="s888">We started eating whatever we could.</span> <span id="s889">I got a hole in a box of dog dishes and I kept on eating dog dishes until I got typhus.</span> <span id="s890">I got so sick they took me in a hospital, in the camp hospital, which it was a Nazi hospital and guess who was the doctor?</span> <span id="s891">The Nazis.</span> <span id="s892">The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me, they are the ones that treated me in the camp because they were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s893">It took quite a while until I came to myself but I could tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s894">I had a headache for five years.</span> <span id="s895">I couldn't get rid of the headache day and night from that typhus.</span> <span id="s896">What happened to the other people?</span> <span id="s897">Most of them died from overeating after the war.</span> <span id="s898">They were eating -- there were so many things to eat it was a very few people who understand.</span> <span id="s899">Then the German doctor told me in German, don't eat so much because your stomach is not strong enough.</span> <span id="s900">We felt a little better.</span> <span id="s901">We went out of the city which the next city near Buchenwald was Vilmar.</span> <span id="s902">That's a city.</span> <span id="s903">We saw so many American soldiers over there.</span> <span id="s904">I don't know, there were thousands and thousands.</span> <span id="s905">And they all were trying to help us, to give us something.</span> <span id="s906">One guy was giving candy, another guy a box of chocolate.</span> <span id="s907">What they did over there was trying to help us out to stay on our legs.</span> <span id="s908">That wasn't so good either.</span> <span id="s909">You wouldn't get it, we would get sick with so much food.</span> <span id="s910">I got a hold of a box of chewing gum.</span> <span id="s911">I took the box of chewing gum and I take one and oh, that tastes good.</span> <span id="s912">I take another one, that tastes good.</span> <span id="s913">Then I took four or five at the time and oh, that tastes good.</span> <span id="s914">I swallowed it.</span> <span id="s915">I must have swallowed a few hundred chewing gums.</span> <span id="s916">Then I had the stomach cramps.</span> <span id="s917">I went back to the hospital and they had to pump my stomach because it was full of chewing gums.</span> <span id="s918">Then the American comes over, a Jewish soldier comes over and he says to me in Yiddish, _______________________, you chew that thing, you don't eat it.</span> <span id="s919">I said how do you chew it.</span> <span id="s920">So he showed me how you chew it.</span> <span id="s921">When I went out again in the city, I saw so many people chewing that we recognize right away our people because they were chewing so funny.</span> <span id="s922">We know right away from looking around everybody wanted to be an American to chew the gum at that time.</span> <span id="s923">So we were over there I'd say about a month or two months.</span> <span id="s924">Then they had lists over there of where your family and friends from other camps.</span> <span id="s925">You could go in there and take a look and if you recognize anybody.</span> <span id="s926">I saw my three sisters in a camp not far from there, in _____________.</span> <span id="s927">There was busses provided by the Americans.</span> <span id="s928">Inside there was no more room, so I was riding on the roof, on top.</span> <span id="s929">So, I got there to ___________ it's a city.</span> <span id="s930">______________ half of the ____________ was the American side.</span> <span id="s931">So, finally I found then my sisters went to the Berger-meister to the mayor in there and my sisters told him -- I went there with another friend from my town.</span> <span id="s932">So the Berger-meister made sure that we had food and he gave us a place over there, and he put over there in another place so this was the way we were all together at that time.</span> <span id="s933">So that time we were together with three sisters, and I ask my sisters, because we had four sisters.</span> <span id="s934">One sister I know, the younger one, they went with my mother I know.</span> <span id="s935">So, I asked my other one, I said where is Esther, my younger sister?</span> <span id="s936">So, she says, she died of the typhus, and they kept her where she was dead.</span> <span id="s937">So, I saw we were together and then we made all the preparation to go back to Romania to find out to see maybe somebody is left to see us start life out again.</span> <span id="s938">That is the time they made the agreement the way how Germany between the British, the Americans and Russians.</span> <span id="s939">Due to the fact that the Russians were in Berlin, so the Americans had to go there too, so they gave up all the area over there to the Russians.</span> <span id="s940">And the Americans pulled in.</span> <span id="s941">We was still in the camp in ____________ because we wanted to make preparation to go back to Romania to see who's left.</span> <span id="s942">As the gang comes over, Jewish soldiers, and they said to us, all right, let's go in because we're going to leave the area and this is the Russians.</span> <span id="s943">When we were children we were told how good communism, how good the Russians are, how good everything is so you could have such a nice life.</span> <span id="s944">You don't have to work, you get everything for nothing.</span> <span id="s945">When the guy told us this, I said what are you talking about.</span> <span id="s946">We were told how good it is by the Russians.</span> <span id="s947">Why should we leave them.</span> <span id="s948">They're in the area we're going to stay.</span> <span id="s949">That Jewish captain, because he had some stripes, he says it's not what they told you, it's what it is.</span> <span id="s950">We were there.</span> <span id="s951">The Americans left.</span> <span id="s952">Boy were we sorry the next day what happened.</span> <span id="s953">That comes around, a bunch of Russians, dirty with watches on their arms, five or six watches, running after the girls which they couldn't stand on their legs how weak they are, saying if you step out of the line, we'll send you to Siberia.</span> <span id="s954">That was the thank you when they saw us over there.</span> <span id="s955">We're going to send you to different type of work now, if you don't behave and things like this.</span> <span id="s956">So, we started making preparations to go back.</span> <span id="s957">We took trains, whatever they had the trains, from one place to another one.</span> <span id="s958">It took weeks and weeks from Germany to Czechoslovaks to _________ and to Budapest.</span> <span id="s959">We arrived in Budapest.</span> <span id="s960">We find already some collaborators from our town, and we tried to turn them in to the Russian.</span> <span id="s961">We told them what happened with them and then we kept on ____________ and we went back to Romania.</span> <span id="s962">We went back to my home town.</span> <span id="s963">There was nothing left in there in my hometown, just a few people came back.</span> <span id="s964">We tried to see what we could do.</span> <span id="s965">We couldn't work it out.</span> <span id="s966">We packed up whatever we had and we turned back.</span> <span id="s967">The turning back was not so easy because you had to go out of the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s968">We went in -- from Romania we went into Hungary.</span> <span id="s969">We were staying in the field all day long because the Russians should not catch us to take us back to Siberia.</span> <span id="s970">Finally we went into Hungary and from Hungary we went to Budapest and Budapest there was already operating a kitchen from ________.</span> <span id="s971">We had food in there.</span> <span id="s972">We had shelter in there.</span> <span id="s973">Our destination was not Budapest.</span> <span id="s974">Our destination was further down to Israel, whatever we go.</span> <span id="s975">So, we went to the border by Austria-Hungary border.</span> <span id="s976">There was a Russian guy.</span> <span id="s977">His name was Sashka.</span> <span id="s978">We sold something home in Wishno, whatever we had, and we got a little money in there.</span> <span id="s979">This guy Sashka had truck and for a fee he took you over to Austria, because he couldn't cross the border.</span> <span id="s980">This guy filled up a truck with people like cattle flat down, and we went across to Austria.</span> <span id="s981">We went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s982">When we went to Vienna there was already in the American zone, and we had to stay there a little bit in Vienna until they got all the trains ready.</span> <span id="s983">Then we went to Saltzburg.</span> <span id="s984">When we went through the border, the Russians had to examine everybody.</span> <span id="s985">If they're not some of them were running away from the Army, which there was a lot of Russian Jewish officers.</span> <span id="s986">They came with us because they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s987">So, they wanted to see if there were any deserters and things like this.</span> <span id="s988">So, we said we were all Greeks.</span> <span id="s989">We went on that plane as all Greeks from the war.</span> <span id="s990">They came around _______________ no, we're Greek.</span> <span id="s991">So, finally we cross the border and went into Lenz.</span> <span id="s992">From Lenz, that's right over the border and we went over to Saltzburg.</span> <span id="s993">Then we settled in Saltzburg.</span> <span id="s994">I had one sister, she did not leave Romania so my brother went back from Saltzburg to bring him back into Saltzburg.</span> <span id="s995">We were in Saltzburg for a little while.</span> <span id="s996">In the meantime, I was training myself to be a soldier, and Israeli soldier.</span> <span id="s997">I was training _____________.</span> <span id="s998">I was very good in the training thing, which they told me I do very good.</span> <span id="s999">My sister find out from my aunt, we had a few aunts, a couple aunts in New York.</span> <span id="s1000">She remembers the others where they are, so she wrote a letter to them, and they got back a letter with some money in the envelope in there.</span> <span id="s1001">He says, don't go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1002">You have time to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1003">First come to America and then you go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1004">Let's come over here first and settle.</span> <span id="s1005">I was ready to go to Israel, so we had a big debate, and she told us how good America is.</span> <span id="s1006">They said they have everything you could find even money on the street.</span> <span id="s1007">I said to myself and to my brother, I said listen, look they have the Marshall plan, they got everything for nothing.</span> <span id="s1008">Couldn't you imagine if you get everything over here for nothing.</span> <span id="s1009">Couldn't you imagine if you go to the source.</span> <span id="s1010">So, finally we decided we go to America.</span> <span id="s1011">I came with the boat with General Greeley.</span> <span id="s1012">It was an American boat.</span> <span id="s1013">I came in December 1949.</span> <span id="s1014">It took over a week to get to the country.</span> <span id="s1015">I worked in the ship, also.</span> <span id="s1016">I worked in the kitchen, which I couldn't work too much because I was so seasick for a few days but then I felt better and I went to work.</span> <span id="s1017">We arrived in New York which the aunts picked us up.</span> <span id="s1018">So I was in a hotel, and also when they picked us up there was a taxi driver and he put six in the taxi to take us over.</span> <span id="s1019">I was the last one to get out of the taxi and I looked down and I looked all over and so the guy asked me in Yiddish he says, ____________, what are you looking for.</span> <span id="s1020">I said I look for dollars.</span> <span id="s1021">He says, boy if you come for that, he says you don't know how you're going to get here until you get a dollar.</span> <span id="s1022">That was the hello in America.</span> <span id="s1023">So, then I went to the hotel, and then I got through friends, I got a job.</span> <span id="s1024">I was in the hotel only a few months.</span> <span id="s1025">There's a lot I left out.</span> <span id="s1026">When we went back with the trains to ride back into Budapest, there was no room inside of the trains.</span> <span id="s1027">We were riding on the slate roofs on top of the trains for days.</span> <span id="s1028">When a bridge came, you had to lay down flat before you know, you could get killed and things like this.</span> <span id="s1029">To go back, we arrived in New York, like I said, I got a job.</span> <span id="s1030">I got a job in the metal factory.</span> <span id="s1031">First I did odd jobs all over and then I got a job in a metal factory.</span> <span id="s1032">I was doing pretty good for about a year or so.</span> <span id="s1033">It was very hard work, and then the boss came over to me.</span> <span id="s1034">He looked at me and he says whatever I do, I just happen to do right.</span> <span id="s1035">He calls me over and he says how would you like to take over the area, to be the lead man.</span> <span id="s1036">I was in the union at that time.</span> <span id="s1037">So, I says, I'm in the union, they give you pension, all those things.</span> <span id="s1038">I started with the union.</span> <span id="s1039">He says, I'm not going to touch your union, just take over the job as a lead man.</span> <span id="s1040">I took over the job as a lead man, and I corrected a lot of mistakes in the department and that department started booming.</span> <span id="s1041">The boss comes again and he says, how about doing this and this and things like this.</span> <span id="s1042">So, finally I became the research and the developing machinery.</span> <span id="s1043">I know that because I was a mechanic so I had a lot of knowledge of machinery.</span> <span id="s1044">I was the one who went to buy machines all over the country for cleaning machines, cleaning special metal.</span> <span id="s1045">Like a metal engineer.</span> <span id="s1046">They even give me the title metal engineer.</span> <span id="s1047">I traveled all over.</span> <span id="s1048">I got machines in there.</span> <span id="s1049">As a matter of fact, there was one time, one of the bosses was a German Jew decent and he went to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1050">He bought a machine there, and I had to go there and check out that machine there in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1051">Which I said I'd never go back there, but I said a job is a job so I went back to Germany, checked out the machine on its progress and everything worked out good.</span> <span id="s1052">There was a time when I had over 200 people taking care over there.</span> <span id="s1053">There was an operation working day and night, brought in a lot of machines.</span> <span id="s1054">Then the place was sold to another corporation that wasn't so good, everything.</span> <span id="s1055">Then a few years later, I figure it's already time for me to look around.</span> <span id="s1056">I was already in my late 20s.</span> <span id="s1057">I start to look around and get married and bring up a family.</span> <span id="s1058">So, I went to places where young people got together, especially all the people who came from the other side.</span> <span id="s1059">We had a place.</span> <span id="s1060">There was the Hotel Diplomat and other places we used to get together.</span> <span id="s1061">So, I went there with some friends and I asked my friend, who is that girl over there.</span> <span id="s1062">Oh she said, my friend, would you like to know her?</span> <span id="s1063">I go over there and I start talking a little bit and I asked her where she comes.</span> <span id="s1064">She also comes from the area where I came, and she became my wife.</span> <span id="s1065">We got to know each other.</span> <span id="s1066">She became my wife, so we got married.</span> <span id="s1067">We lived in the Bronx in New York for a little while and then we moved to Yonkers, which I still there but in different places.</span> <span id="s1068">We grow up we have three sons now.</span> <span id="s1069">They went to school.</span> <span id="s1070">They all went to Hebrew university.</span> <span id="s1071">They went to chivas.</span> <span id="s1072">All their lives they went to school.</span> <span id="s1073">I worked at least 12,14 hours a day, and when I came home, my wife was a real estate broker, she went to work, so a lot of times we only saw each other a few hours.</span> <span id="s1074">We worked very hard to educate the kids and it worked very good.</span> <span id="s1075">My three boys they are all attorneys, which one lives in the Washington area.</span> <span id="s1076">One lives in New Jersey and one is still home, not married.</span> <span id="s1077">We have two grandchildren, two little girls in Jersey and we have a boy and a girl here in the Washington area, and they all are doing very good.</span> <span id="s1078">We are very happy the way it worked out.</span> <span id="s1079">Now, I'm retired and have a lot of happiness with my grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Now, I want you to talk to me for just a few more minutes about the legacy that you and the other survivors bring to us.</span> <span id="s1081">What is that legacy.</span> <span id="s1082">What is it that you want the world not just the people that are here now, but children, your children's children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I would like very much this information to be passed on for schooling to students to see what happened and also to be passed on for other generations because they should see whatever happen at a time like this when one of the most civilized countries in the world could do something like this to another human being.</span> <span id="s1084">I want people to see it.</span> <span id="s1085">I want people to know it, and the bottom line I want never never to forget and just to keep on showing it, looking and see whatever happened to the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: What are you say to the people who deny that it ever happened, what do you say about that?</span> <span id="s1087">People say it didn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: The people that are denying that it never happened, who are we talking about?</span> <span id="s1089">Skinheads, Nazis?</span> <span id="s1090">What are we talking about.</span> <span id="s1091">Most of the world they know it happened.</span> <span id="s1092">Most of the world knows what happened.</span> <span id="s1093">They all see it.</span> <span id="s1094">It's just a few of those people which make all the problems for everybody else.</span> <span id="s1095">I wouldn't even pay attention what they say.</span> <span id="s1096">You can't even convince those people because they're always going to tell you it not happen.</span> <span id="s1097">Prove it to me, even if you prove it to them, they will say it never happened.</span> <span id="s1098">Even if you take them there they're going to say they died from a disease or something like this.</span> <span id="s1099">You cannot convince those people.</span> <span id="s1100">Those are a little minority, just a few of those people, so I don't say you shouldn't pay attention to them because from a minority could grow a majority, so you have to keep a check not to let it go out of hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: What about the scale of what happened that was begun by a civilized country but then was perpetrated by a whole continent became involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Well, you know, the thing is this, if anyone was looking for adventures, that was the time for other countries to look at the adventurous things.</span> <span id="s1103">The corroborators because at that time they had a free hand they could do anything they wanted, and most of the time which it causes those problems.</span> <span id="s1104">Then you take other governments, they became Nazis and all those things because for adventurous things, for their own adventures.</span> <span id="s1105">Then they picked out really the most the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1106">They picked them out because they know they're not going to fight back because their religion was so great that you're not supposed to fight back even.</span> <span id="s1107">You're not supposed to say anything.</span> <span id="s1108">You're supposed to do the right thing all the time.</span> <span id="s1109">You're supposed to be a good man all the time.</span> <span id="s1110">You're not supposed to -- that's why it make me go to the ___________, because if you see something that is not right, stand up for it.</span> <span id="s1111">Don't let it go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Now, the tape that you brought, is that the kind of music your father did or is that different music?</span> <span id="s1113">Let's talk for just a minute and I don't know if we're going to -- tell me about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: My father was a singer at the weddings.</span> <span id="s1115">Anybody -- I mean if people get married and things like this, they used to call him to sing.</span> <span id="s1116">He used to put words together all the time.</span> <span id="s1117">I have some music over here which they were playing in those days exactly the same type of music they were playing at weddings.</span> <span id="s1118">This music goes back to the thirties and the early forties.</span> <span id="s1119">So, my father was not only the singer, he was a comedian too.</span> <span id="s1120">He was known all over Romania and Hungary.</span> <span id="s1121">He was called all the time to perform all the things.</span> <span id="s1122">He also knows some famous people and he also did a lot of good things for the Jewish community in the time when we had the big problems all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: This is the music you heard now as the type of music they used to play in the weddings in Visho from where I came.</span> <span id="s1126">Also, this is the type of music they were playing all around the area, which my father was one of the greatest entertainers in the area.</span> <span id="s1127">He was called around Romania around the state when it was Hungary he was called around the state to perform weddings.</span> <span id="s1128">He was singing not only in Yiddish, he was singing in all kinds of languages.</span> <span id="s1129">The way he put the words together was the words match one with the other one it was amazing to hear.</span> <span id="s1130">He had one of the nicest voice to sing those things.</span> <span id="s1131">He also was a good _________ when he was in the schull.</span> <span id="s1132">So, it was something, the greatest thing if they could get my father to perform at the wedding because he had so many invitations to go around and perform ceremonies those kinds of weddings that he couldn't make them all.</span> <span id="s1133">And also, the transportation wasn't the right way.</span> <span id="s1134">If you had to go forty miles away, it took you a couple of days to get there.</span> <span id="s1135">Most of the traveling was done by horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s1136">They also had a train.</span> <span id="s1137">The train used to take you from one place to another one.</span> <span id="s1138">The trains if you see the old type of trains you have to put water in and locomotive you have to put the coal in.</span> <span id="s1139">You have to wait until it heats up good enough.</span> <span id="s1140">On the train it was written 45 kilometers an hour.</span> <span id="s1141">That's about 30 miles, a little less.</span> <span id="s1142">But it never made that much.</span> <span id="s1143">Sometimes you feel like you could run faster than the train.</span> <span id="s1144">This is part of the music which I'll stop for a couple of seconds, I want you to listen to that type of music, you can't get it no place and only in the ___________ places.</span> <span id="s1145">That's the time when they went around the bride, going around the bride and pick up you know you call it in Jewish ________________.</span> <span id="s1146">The husband comes around and looks at the bride and uncovers her and then covers her, leaves the cover on again.</span> <span id="s1147">That's gypsies Hungarian music.</span> <span id="s1148">When they had a wedding in those days, it started in the afternoon and it went on late late at night.</span> <span id="s1149">What type of music they were playing, because they had no notes, they are playing straight without notes and it sounds so beautiful.</span> <span id="s1150">Not only the Jewish wedding, my father was also called to other types of weddings because like I said he knows all kinds of language to put those words together.</span> <span id="s1151">He was like his own songwriter from the head.</span> <span id="s1152">He never had to use a piece of paper to write a song or think like this.</span> <span id="s1153">It just came out straight.</span> <span id="s1154">That's the time when they went to the _________.</span> <span id="s1155">Due to the fact that my father was such a music lover, I think of him as music.</span> <span id="s1156">I'm retired now and my hobby is music.</span> <span id="s1157">Different type of music, Hebrew music, international music.</span> <span id="s1158">I could listen to music 24 hours and never get tired.</span> <span id="s1159">Sometimes I take music before I take the food.</span> <span id="s1160">This picture is when I'm in the second grade.</span> <span id="s1161">All those children around me, they did not survive.</span> <span id="s1162">The teachers which I'm standing near the teacher her name was ________________.</span> <span id="s1163">She was one of the meanest teachers we ever had.</span> <span id="s1164">There probably was in that class a few hundred children, but she was so mean that there wasn't one day that I did not get beaten up.</span> <span id="s1165">I got beaten up day by day.</span> <span id="s1166">It wasn't only me, it was everybody else, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: About what year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: On the second grade let's say, it's in the thirties, the early thirties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Which person are you in the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: I am over there with the white shirt and tie.</span> <span id="s1171">What happened was there was a special day in Romanian history and everybody had to get dressed with a white shirt and with something to look like a special person.</span> <span id="s1172">The reason I had that was my neighbor had it and my sister went in to borrow it and then I got it to wear it to school.</span> <span id="s1173">I was so afraid of the teacher that I shouldn't get a beating I told my sister when I came back I wish I wouldn't have that white shirt, I wouldn't have to stay near the teacher, because that much I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">(Showing pictures on the video) It's a possibility that some of them which I don't know may survive and live in different places and different countries, but I wouldn't know for sure that.</span> <span id="s1175">But it's a good possibility that some of them are in other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Are most of them Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Most of them are Jewish but not all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: How about the teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: The teacher wasn't Jewish, with a name like this.</span> <span id="s1180">No, she was wasn't.</span> <span id="s1181">I look at the picture now more and there is one guy which I recognize and he's in New York, one fellow.</span> <span id="s1182">I also was told another fellow, the girl on the left side I was told she is in Uruguay but I have no information.</span> <span id="s1183">This picture was made in 1936, I would say I was in the fourth grade over there.</span> <span id="s1184">The fellow on my left side I think he's around in the New York area, which when I came to this country I talked to him.</span> <span id="s1185">I saw him.</span> <span id="s1186">The other people I don't know if they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: So tell me about this class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: This class I would say it's mixed, half Jews, half all types like Hungarians, Romanians, Germans and the teacher is right there in front.</span> <span id="s1189">She wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s1190">She only beat me up a couple times a week compared to the other one which she beat the kids every day, twice a day or more than that too.</span> <span id="s1191">This teacher's name was _____________.</span> <span id="s1192">She was also a good teacher for learning.</span> <span id="s1193">This picture was taken before the war in Visho.</span> <span id="s1194">I'm standing in an area.</span> <span id="s1195">Somebody passed over their head a camera and asked if he wanted a picture, say yes, so he took the picture.</span> <span id="s1196">It was already cold.</span> <span id="s1197">So, this picture was taken before the war, before the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: You were maybe 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I must have been 17 or 18 something like this, nothing more.</span> <span id="s1200">This picture was also taken before the war.</span> <span id="s1201">I'm on the right side and my brother, Israel was on the left side, the left side of my hand.</span> <span id="s1202">It was also taken in Visho.</span> <span id="s1203">My brother is here.</span> <span id="s1204">He lives in Elmont.</span> <span id="s1205">This was my sister, it was my sister Rose and my brother __________.</span> <span id="s1206">My sister Rose was in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1207">She got liberated too, and we all came together to Budapest, but in that time she was so sick already from all the suffering they got reunited with her husband in Austria.</span> <span id="s1208">They had a child before the war which is the child I said she gave to my mother and she died about 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s1209">1972 she died.</span> <span id="s1210">This picture was also taken just before we went into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1211">I was working.</span> <span id="s1212">That's the time I was working for the Hungarians and we took the train so we were working in the railroad but the railroad we took all the tracks off and we send them into Hungary so there was a few children, three or four children we were working and that was the uniform I was wearing at that time when I did the work over there.</span> <span id="s1213">This picture was taken in the Visho Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1214">If you look close, you can see the yellow star that we were wearing already.</span> <span id="s1215">The two girls on the two sides are in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1216">They were from another town.</span> <span id="s1217">When they brought them in the Ghetto they were in our area over there, so we were taking this picture.</span> <span id="s1218">When I went back I found that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Was there torture in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: No, there was no time.</span> <span id="s1221">It was one month time.</span> <span id="s1222">We only had problems from the local people.</span> <span id="s1223">This was my father when he was in the Hungarian Army as an officer.</span> <span id="s1224">This picture when we came to the United States, some relative of ours had that picture and they gave it to us and we enlarged it a little bit and that's the only picture we have of him as a soldier, as an officer.</span> <span id="s1225">This is my father.</span> <span id="s1226">It was taken just before the deportation time, before the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1227">It also was a little picture we got it here in the United States from some relative, small, and we enlarged it.</span> <span id="s1228">I want to say something.</span> <span id="s1229">It's my father I was told, I don't remember, he had a blue eye and a brown eye, which it is very unusual for a person to have two types of eyes.</span> <span id="s1230">I wanted to tell you he had beautiful eyes, blue and brown.</span> <span id="s1231">This is my mother and she was a real Jewish mother trying very hard to raise a family of seven.</span> <span id="s1232">If you see the hair, that's a week because the religion as you know, you have to cut your hair once you're married.</span> <span id="s1233">This is my grandmother, my mother's mother, which we didn't live far one from the other one.</span> <span id="s1234">My grandfather he was used to make clothes and this is the way my mother knew how to sew.</span> <span id="s1235">She learned it from her father.</span> <span id="s1236">She used to sew her own clothes for the children.</span> <span id="s1237">She did a lot of things, repairing clothes.</span> <span id="s1238">She was one of the greatest mom's I had.</span> <span id="s1239">This is my original document after the liberation in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1240">That was the first day I got back my name.</span> <span id="s1241">I did not go by number, which the number at that time was 117,682.</span> <span id="s1242">All the stamps you see there are from the United States Army.</span> <span id="s1243">Twenty-fifth of May 1945.</span> <span id="s1244">In Europe they put the day first, before the month, that's why you see 25, May, 1945.</span> <span id="s1245">That was the liberation day, which you can see Buchenwald right in the top there.</span> <span id="s1246">My father is there on top of the carriage.</span> <span id="s1247">The fellow riding in the carriage when we went back to our city a few years back, he gave us a small picture and we enlarged it a little bit.</span> <span id="s1248">As a matter of fact this is the only picture of him being in that carriage over there.</span> <span id="s1249">This is the carriage, the transportation carriage we went from one place to another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Your father is driving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: My father is the driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Soon we arrived in Auschwitz after it was the selection and they already told me that I'm going to work as a mechanic which it was not true.</span> <span id="s1255">They put me in the coal mine and the first thing they did was they tattoo my arm.</span> <span id="s1256">So they had different types of tattoos.</span> <span id="s1257">Smaller and larger things and I went to the place where the bigger one is because I didn't even know what it was all about.</span> <span id="s1258">When they started tattooing, it was such a painful a lot of people collapsed in there and some of them never even got up.</span> <span id="s1259">When they got through with the tattooing my arm was so swollen but a little while later it came down and it's something there which ever goes away.</span> <span id="s1260">My tattoo number is A 9384 and it looks like I live forever with this kind of number.</span> <span id="s1261">Each time I go down from bath or whatever I do, I take my shirt off, it reminds me of the past whatever happened to me.</span></p> <p><span
