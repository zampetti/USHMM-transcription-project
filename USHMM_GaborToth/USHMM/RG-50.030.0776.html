kosher, not strictly.</span> <span id="s55">But we – we appeared to – the – we – we belonged to synagogue, and we never had seafood, or – or – or non-kosher food, but as time went along – went on, we – we sort of dropped kosher and – and – although we – we’d – she – my folks would – would deal with kosher markets.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: But I wasn’t – I’ve never eaten treyf, I still don’t.</span> <span id="s58">And I met my wife in Washington – well – well in – let me – let me get – backtrack.</span> <span id="s59">As I said, I grew up, I have a – I had two brothers.</span> <span id="s60">I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s61">My middle brother is about seven years younger than me, and my younger brother was about 13.</span> <span id="s62">He died in the – well, let’s s – let’s say, after I – wh-while I was in the service, my folks moved from Baltimore to Washington.</span> <span id="s63">They took over a cleaning store in south Washington.</span> <span id="s64">So when I returned from the service, I moved, of course th – moved to Washington, and after a few years, I met my wife, and we got married and had th – we had – we have two sons, Philip and Arthur.</span> <span id="s65">And they eventually married and had families.</span> <span id="s66">And they live in Florida, both families.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Let’s go back to your childhood for just a moment, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: You said you sort of fell away from kosher slowly – or at least not strictly observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Well, as I remember – let me see, I’m – I’m trying to remember now whether my folks died here – yi – well, of course they died – died in the Washington area.</span> <span id="s71">I – I would say, not strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s72">Well, the – I didn’t – I didn’t – I don’t remember – well, I’ve never eaten treyf food.</span></p>

decision on the part of your family and your family alone, or did you feel certain pressures from assimilation?</span> <span id="s80">Did you feel anything –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No – as far as food?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I would say they stayed kosher throughout.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: So I guess it wasn’t til I came to Washington, that when I married, I – I wasn’t strictly kosher.</span></p> <p><span

you – did you like your childhood?</span> <span id="s95">Was it rough and tumble and urban, or was it more, perhaps sheltered and quiet?</span> <span id="s96">Or how would you – overall, how would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Normal.</span> <span id="s98">I had friends, and through school I – I had none non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s99">In – when I was around 10 years old, we licked – lived in a mixed area, and I recall that we had – we had ballgames between Jews and Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: And I didn’t really socialize with non-Jews, and I guess I grew up in a normal – normal way.</span> <span id="s102">As I said though, but I was always helping my – my parent earn a living, and so I got through.</span> <span id="s103">Nothing – nothing outstanding, it’s just a normal – a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: I’m curious about the ballgames.</span> <span id="s105">How did they end up?</span> <span id="s106">Did – did – did – did the Jews and the Gentiles sort of split the wins and the losses more or less evenly, or di – were you the dominant team, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, I was very good, whether it was baseball or football.</span> <span id="s108">And I guess it was a mixture.</span> <span id="s109">Sometimes we won, sometimes we lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s111">So, you’re working as a jobber, distributing undergarments, socks, things of that nature –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: – to various shops, more or less in the Washington, D.C. area, or did you have a large geographic area that you were responsible for?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: This is when I was living in south Baltimore.</span> <span id="s115">We had some customers in – in the area, the north – northwest Baltimore, but I recall I would go to the eastern shore, and there were stores in eastern Maryland.</span> <span id="s116">And where else?</span> <span id="s117">What – what’s another large – I – I would have customers in different parts of – of eastern shore.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did you travel by car, or ca –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yeah, I had a car.</span> <span id="s120">And I had big suitcases, and I would take orders with whatever items they – they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I guess around 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And how long did you carry on that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Until I went into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s128">When – were you conscripted, were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I – I was drafted in November of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: When I became 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Fair enough.</span> <span id="s133">Now, the war itself, when –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: – did you first become a-aware?</span> <span id="s136">Were you – when did you first become aware, if at all, that this – Jews in Germany and throughout Europe were specifically being targeted for harassment and violence?</span> <span id="s137">Did you know before going in the service, or did you know ab – when did that – exactly did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Let’s go back to conscription.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Were you given the option of the European or Pacific theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Well, let’s – first of all, I was drafted into elev – a – a new organization called 11th armored division.</span> <span id="s145">And we originated in Louisiana.</span> <span id="s146">I was in the 42nd tank battalion of the 11th armored division, and I trained as a tanker.</span> <span id="s147">And because of my written tests that I took, plus the – the training I got, I was – I – I – I cou – I could have become a – an officer.</span> <span id="s148">At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service, specifically in – in the area that I was training as a tanker.</span> <span id="s149">And I had some anti-Semitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to headquarters of 42nd tank battalion, and so that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s150">And I became assistant to the adjutant there.</span> <span id="s151">And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on – and as I was – I was – I was transferred to the – the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so that was my title, although I didn’t – when we went overseas, I didn’t do any typing or anything.</span> <span id="s152">I w – I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion commander gave instructions – wanted instructions to the – the adjutant.</span> <span id="s153">And of course, my being the noncom, I did the – whatever had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Let’s go back to the – the na – the anti-Semitism that you experienced inside the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Talk about that, the nature of it.</span> <span id="s157">How did you feel it, how were you exposed to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, what happened was, a – a incident, for example, during the growing of th – of the – of the division, of the company, the battalions.</span> <span id="s159">People were transferring in and out, and there was a – a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and the – several of – of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew.</span> <span id="s160">At that point I said, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s161">They couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s162">I didn’t look Jewish, my name wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s163">And I says, well, you didn’t – you don’t see the horns coming out?</span> <span id="s164">At any rate, I – I had a different feeling with – with these soldiers, who were part of my tank – tank company.</span> <span id="s165">And so I didn’t feel comfortable going to officer training, coming back, and dealing with – with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s166">So, that was – that was why I transferred to the company.</span> <span id="s167">And course we didn’t have any – I didn’t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion headquarters.</span> <span id="s168">So that was – that was the experience I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s170">Do you recall when and how you received your call-up notice?</span> <span id="s171">Where were you, how did you receive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I was in Baltimore on my 21st birthday.</span> <span id="s173">As I said, I was working for this jobber, and I got notice that I – I’m in – I’m drafted into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I took it in stride.</span> <span id="s176">I knew I had to go, and so I had –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Where did you first go to training?</span> <span id="s178">Where was your initial training?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: In Louisiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Camp Polk.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, course it’s all new.</span> <span id="s184">As I said, I was in a tank battalion and I was in the – I was in C company, if I recall.</span> <span id="s185">And trained with others, learning all about tanks, and the armaments, and I was an expert with – with a submachine gun.</span> <span id="s186">Got a medal there, and I learned the 75 millimeter cannon.</span> <span id="s187">And I also trained, or learned the .45 pistol.</span> <span id="s188">And I learned my – I learned the armaments very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, it’s – it’s practice, a lot of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So wa-was it a physical challenge, a mental challenge, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well, it’s both physical and mental.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s194">But you did well.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s197">Certainly well enough to be solicited for officer training.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: But I turned that down, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Cause I didn’t feel comfortable if I came back as an officer.</span> <span id="s203">Although I recall there was a Jewish officer that was in one of the companies, and I don’t recall many Jewish soldiers after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: How did you cross over to Europe, by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: We went – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: When and where did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, let’s see if … ah, we went over in December of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And that was by ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: By boat, yes, by ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And what harbor did you leave, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, we went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: We landed in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did you stay in England for any length of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah, we stayed in England for quite a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What were you doing there, training and –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: We were training, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What did you think of the English?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I had no problems with them.</span> <span id="s220">If I recall, I even – I even dated a – a Jewish girl, and invited to – invited to the home, and – but that wasn’t anything more.</span> <span id="s221">And then, of course, we went over to France.</span> <span id="s222">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s223">On December 16, 1944, the Germans lonc – lanced a – a counterattack 50 mile radius in the Ardennes.</span> <span id="s224">And let’s see – okay, and then when – wh-when we went into France, our first assignment was to guard the – hold the section of the Moose River, where the German attack was expected, but on the t – the ti – December 26, the fourth armored broke through the German lines, and we leave Bastogne, where the 101st airborne had been – had surrendered, and – and so the evening of December 31st, ar – our division went to – had a 250 mile, or 150 mile march to – to Bastogne, where we were involved with the – the – the ban – Bastogne – what was it called?</span> <span id="s225">The – the – let’s see, where we became part of General Patton’s Third Army, and we were in the combat command A, and we went to – we – we went to Rechrival, Belgium.</span> <span id="s226">That was our first area, and it snowed very heavy.</span> <span id="s227">And a patrol discovered over 101 infantry bodies dead.</span> <span id="s228">They brought back an SS officer to our headquarters, and – and understanding Yiddish, I attempted to interrogate him, but I wasn’t too successful with the German, so they brought over interpreters from headquarters that took over, and – and – and interviewed – inter – interrogated him.</span> <span id="s229">I noticed the captain of D company was angered with the discovery of the American dead bodies, and he took some prisoners, lined them a – on the wall, and killed them.</span> <span id="s230">And I recall that I – I had to take the bodies and put them in – in bags.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did – i – what was upsetting to command and staff about the American bodies?</span> <span id="s232">Was it the nature?</span> <span id="s233">Did they appear to have been executed, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: When you said that you found de – the – the-the bodies, the American bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And that upset people.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Wi – was it – did they die as the result of an – of a – of a combat engagement, or did they appear to have been captured and then executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: That’s wa – wa – they – they captured and executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Okay, so this is what –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: – got everyone –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Including yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s250">So you saw both the Americans, and then the subsequent round-up of the Germans as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">Of course, our line companies did the – you know, captured the Germans and so forth.</span> <span id="s255">I was in headquarters –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: – and so I wasn’t directly – although – although once – once we captured the – the soldiers is – I was aware of what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did you identify those parti – was it thought that those particular German soldiers who were captured were the ones who were responsible for the execution of the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I don’t – I – I don’t think I felt that way.</span> <span id="s262">I – I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: But they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And you were angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s270">Do you real – hang on just for a moment, before we press on.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Do you recall your very first engagement with the enemy?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I suppose it was when – when we captured a officer, and th – and the – the – my battalion commander asked me to interrogate the – he knew I was – he knew I was Jewish, and he thought maybe I had a – a – I was very versed in speaking German, which I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s276">So, I – I – I can’t tell you how I felt at the time.</span> <span id="s277">I think things lead up to what happens, and you take it as a matter of stride, I – I ge – I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Would you say retrospectively, looking back, when you’re there in Europe, the war in on proper, you’re part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did you feel that your training up to that point equipped you to deal with war?</span> <span id="s281">Did you feel as if you were prepared?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s283">Yes.</span> <span id="s284">As – as all the members of our division were.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What – did you form an opinion of the enemy?</span> <span id="s288">Were they good soldiers, sloppy soldiers, were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha – we set up a camp.</span> <span id="s290">I recall that we had some German soldiers that we made KP, and I-I-I was guarding – at one point I was – I was guarding – I – I did a various – various things.</span> <span id="s291">But one – at one time I – I was guarding prisoners, I recall telling this German that he wasn’t doing a good job of cleaning the large soup vats, and he tried to – he says, I’m doing the best I can.</span> <span id="s292">And – and that ended that conversation.</span> <span id="s293">But I – I didn’t really have any direct contact, as such, with – with – with the German soldiers, other than, as I said, at one time I was there.</span> <span id="s294">O-Other times I would – I would go into a burnt out tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn’t want to leave any s-soldiers behind, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So these were Americans that you had to extract?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: These are – th-these are American, yeah.</span> <span id="s297">One of the tanks of – of one of our companies.</span> <span id="s298">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: That had to have been extraordinarily traumatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s301">Yeah.</span> <span id="s302">Everything there was – it’s a – but we took things in stride.</span> <span id="s303">Soldiers did their job.</span> <span id="s304">We – we – we did well, and after – after we left bast – Bastogne, we – we traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Were you engaging the enemy as you’re going along?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s307">We’re all fighting, as i – as i – as – as I remember, the main force of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there’s still plenty of fighting going on, and we ge – our – our division fought and engaged the enemies as we went down.</span> <span id="s308">And then when we got down to – near Austria, as a – as I told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and – and instructions were that we weren’t supposed to go into Austria.</span> <span id="s309">But Patton didn’t like – didn’t – didn’t like that, and so we went into austr – Austria also.</span> <span id="s310">And that’s where – okay, and as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the – Austria, and – and Patton didn’t like the – the Russians either.</span> <span id="s311">And so li – going down, one of our companies, one of the companies was making – was doing reconnaissance, and on the road – on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa – the commander of – of – of the – of – of the camp, was coming towards them, a – with a white flag, and they surrendered.</span> <span id="s312">And it turns out he was telling them of the – of the – of Mauthausen, that i-it was – it was five miles back.</span> <span id="s313">And the reason they – they wanted – they – they gave up to us, is they didn’t want the Russians, because the Russians would – would – would just kill them.</span> <span id="s314">And so that was how we learned of – of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s315">The next morning, I went with the battalion commander and the adjutant into the camp.</span> <span id="s316">That was my first seeing it.</span> <span id="s317">And of course, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things.</span> <span id="s318">And course, lot of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s319">And then I went into the – into the camp, and I went into a particular – wait a minute, I’m – I’m losing words.</span> <span id="s320">But I went in and I spoke with some of the survivors.</span> <span id="s321">And I asked, is there anything that –</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Now, hang on just for a moment –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: You spoke with some of the survivors because you spoke Yiddish –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: – you were speaking in Yiddish –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: – not – not – not English, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah, English, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Okay, so tell me about your conversations with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: And so, I said, is there anything I can do.</span> <span id="s332">And I recall several coming to me and saying, could you write a letter to my relative in Chicago, if I remember that – that was – that particular situation.</span> <span id="s333">And so I took the information, and I did write a letter to I – I don’t recall having an-any copies, so I – I don’t know, bu-but this is my memory, that I wrote a letter and told of that – that this person was safe.</span> <span id="s334">And so that stood out in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What did you think as you were approaching the camp?</span> <span id="s336">Before you entered the camp proper, did you know what its purpose was?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So as you’re approaching it, what do you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, I saw – what – what happened was, the German – there was a big quarry, and the Germans got cement out of there.</span> <span id="s342">And what they – they used, they set up this – th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that – that had to work in – in the quarries.</span> <span id="s343">And that is – that is how the camp came about.</span> <span id="s344">And the – the prisoners worked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha – wi – wi – the – w-with – wi – which would be the cement that they would be making.</span> <span id="s345">So what was my first – I-I – this has been a long time, so I – I really – I really can’t remember how I felt in – in seeing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Were there still Germans – and then ba – by that I mean soldiers, inside the camp, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, what we did, wa – we – we – tho – our – our line companies went in, and of course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course.</span> <span id="s348">And of course our – our company – companies took them out, and we eventually took them back to headquarters.</span> <span id="s349">But as I said, I was in the headquarters of the battalion, and I didn’t physically get involved with – with the soldiers there.</span> <span id="s350">We – we had our other – you know, others that were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Once you and the battalion were inside the camp proper, what did you have to do?</span> <span id="s352">Did you have to start giving medical attention, did you start distributing food?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s354">We have a – a medical battalion with us, and so they went in and did what they had to do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And did you feed the prisoners, or was that not in your – did you – did you give them food, did you give the prisoners food, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I-I – I can’t tell you, but the – th-the company – the soldiers in the – in the various companies did what you had to do.</span> <span id="s357">So I didn’t – I personally wasn’t involved with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s359">But you understood, if no – if for no other reason than language, that a very large number of them were Jewish?</span> <span id="s360">The prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Y-Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Did you – do you recall how you felt about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Well, I was angry learning of what’s happened, but I – I can’t – I can’t tell you my feelings at the time.</span> <span id="s364">It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: You said in your written testimony –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: – that at a certain point, as you are advancing through the camp, you came to the crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s369">Here’s a picture of – of the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Now, this is the one that you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: And as I said, when my father had this bread route, and – and – and breads and challahs and so forth, I used to go to the bakery and they had ovens.</span> <span id="s374">That’s where they made the challahs and so forth.</span> <span id="s375">And when I saw this, it it – it made it – it brought me back to mind of the ovens in – in the bakery.</span> <span id="s376">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did you understand when you saw that, what it was used for, and why it was being used?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Was it physical obvious?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I – I learned – I learned as we went in what was – what was happening, and what they – what did – the Germans had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And was it the prisoners who you we – that were telling you this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Do you recall how long you spent inside the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: I was there maybe just several hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: As I said, at the time, we were still fighting in – in – in – where was that?</span> <span id="s389">In – in – in Austria.</span> <span id="s390">Anyway, no, we – we had to leave.</span> <span id="s391">But we left behind soldiers that would be doing what they had to do, clean-up and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s393">But you were still in pursuit of the enemy, so had to move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Oh yeah, we were fight – we were fighting in – in a town in – in – in Austria now.</span> <span id="s395">What – if – if you want to take these papers –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Sure, of course.</span> <span id="s397">Thank you.</span> <span id="s398">Did that experience, this experience of being in the camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: – after leaving the camp, you had to, as you say, go in pursuit of the enemy –</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: – who was in a full retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Did it change your understanding of why you were fighting the war?</span> <span id="s405">Did it change that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No, we knew we had to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s407">I did learn of – of what they were doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s408">Of course, I didn’t know at the end of the year – at the end of the – how many Jews were killed, and I wasn’t – I wasn’t happy with – with what I’d learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Of course not.</span> <span id="s410">As you’re pursing the enemy deeper into Austria, at some point, relatively soon, you get word that the war is over.</span> <span id="s411">How and when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: While we were still in that town.</span> <span id="s413">We stayed there until the – the war was – then we got news of the war ending.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Do you recall how that news was transmitted?</span> <span id="s415">How did you learn that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I’m sure my adjutant, my commander learned of it, and I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s417">I guess word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Were you excited, happy, or relieved to – how would you describe your emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: My emotions were – I was very happy, but we had already – we felt that we had captured the enemy in – in – in Austria, and just – just biding there until the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: How much longer did you spend in Europe after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s422">I think – I think our division went back – you know, I don’t recall – the last I remember is being in the – in this town in Austria and telling that the war is over, but I don’t remember how we – how I got home.</span> <span id="s423">Whether we – we went to England – I don’t know, ma – maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Sure –</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: – maybe that tells us –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: It’s quite all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: – I don – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: It’s quite all right if you don’t remember.</span> <span id="s429">Do you

id="s539">A: I don’t know if they were soldiers, or otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: But that therapy helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Just the experience of talking it out, and sharing, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I – I guess that’s – that’s what helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A:
