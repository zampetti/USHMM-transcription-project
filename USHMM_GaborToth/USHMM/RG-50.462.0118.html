one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">PS: This is Philip Solomon of the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College, interviewing Mr. Albert Miller.</span> <span id="s3">The date is October 14th, 1994.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Miller, can you tell us where in Europe and in what unit you were serving prior to your capture?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">AM: I was with the 303rd Bomb Group, 358th Squadron of the First Air Force located in Mulsworth [phonetic], England.</span> <span id="s6">We flew out of there with the 41st bomber wing and we flew 35 missions before we were shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">PS: Starting about what date, Al?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">AM: August the 4th was my first mission to the Pas-de-Calais in France.</span> <span id="s9">We hit some of the robot bomb bases there.</span> <span id="s10">And we were shot down on November 21st, 1944, 35 missions later.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s12">So you flew combat strategic flights August, September, October, until...</span></p> <p><span id="s13">AM: Bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">PS: Yeah, November.</span> <span id="s15">Now during this period, Al, your targets were mostly, this was, in other words, D-day was June the 6th, 1944, so you were flying a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">AM: June the 6th, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">PS: June, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s18">So your flights started, your combat missions, roughly about two months after the invasion of the French coast of Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">AM: August the 4th.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">AM: Approximately [unclear] weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">PS: Yeah, and at that point the, I guess the British, Canadians and Americans and French had advanced pretty close to the German border, I would think, at that point in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">AM: Well they had already crossed the Maginot Line if I’m not mistaken...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">AM: You know, the Siegfried Line.</span> <span id="s26">I think Patton was pretty well into Germany by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">AM: And the incidents that occurred prior to that that caused a lot of problems for the United, for the Allied forces, was when McNair was involved with that smoke screen that was laid down as a barrier between friendly lines and the enemy lines.</span> <span id="s29">And the wind blew...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">AM: The smoke screen.</span> <span id="s32">And unfortunately our bombers hit our own lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">PS: During the period, Al, that you were, between the time that you started your flights, combat missions, and when you were shot down, did you during that period observe anything from the air that would have given you or any members of your crew some evidence of the existence of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">AM: Well I think I made it clear that we flew at approximately twenty to twenty-five thousand feet, or probably higher at times, depending on the weather.</span> <span id="s35">I had very little opportunity to look down below.</span> <span id="s36">We were concerned mainly with fighters.</span> <span id="s37">I as the radio operator, discharged chaff, which was a metalized strips that combated ack-ack, their cameras and their instruments to pick us up.</span> <span id="s38">But other than that I had no knowledge whatsoever of anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">PS: Your action on the B-17 bomber, was it, you were navigator?</span> <span id="s40">Bombardier?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">AM: Radio operator gunner.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s43">Do you know, now neither you or anyone in your crew had ever observed anything that would have given you any kind of inkling of what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s44">Out of your base, were there any reconnaissance flights, like photo reconnaissance flights being flown?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">AM: We were a bomber group, Phil, and what we got as far as observation was in our briefings, we were told how well we hit the target, how well we missed it.</span> <span id="s46">But there were no other reconnaissance that was reported to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s48">And you were, there was never anything mentioned about targets to hit or targets to beware of, that is a possible existence of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">AM: It never entered into...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PS: Either to--hit approaches, railroad tracks?</span> <span id="s51">There was a pattern I understand, a pattern that showed up, you know, in all concentra--the pattern of railroad tracks going in?</span> <span id="s52">There was nothing said about the existence of this, either to go after it?</span> <span id="s53">There was never a mission to your knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">AM: Marshaling yards and railroad yards, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">AM: Came under target, our strategic bombing.</span> <span id="s57">But nothing that concerned concentration camps or...</span></p> <p><span id="s58">PS: Right.</span> <span id="s59">And during this period, either before your shipment overseas to England or prior to that, did you have knowledge, did you hear of the existence of what later became known as the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">AM: Well, I was a civilian until March, or until April the 26th, 1943.</span> <span id="s61">And we had exposure through different speakers and filming that was brought to our synagogue and to our Jewish groups as to what was going on as far as they had knowledge of.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PS: With this knowledge then, when you flew, when you started to fly combat, and always the possibility of being captured, being shot down and captured, you carried, did you carry anything that would identify you as being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">AM: I carried my dog tags, of course, and I insisted that I would keep them.</span> <span id="s64">Because we were briefed that if we were caught without any identification, we could be held as spies.</span> <span id="s65">We could be held as political prisoners.</span> <span id="s66">So I did not give them up at all.</span> <span id="s67">I kept them right through my imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">PS: And during the period that you were flying combat, and knowing that if shot down and captured alive you would be identified as being Jewish, did you give very much thought to the results, the consequences of being a Jewish prisoner in the hands of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">AM: I did, well I gave it thought.</span> <span id="s70">We all did, what would happen to us and how we would fare.</span> <span id="s71">But if I can take a moment now to give you an incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">PS: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">AM: It never occurred to me that I would be identified as Jewish and stamped as such and handled accordingly.</span> <span id="s74">I thought I was an American soldier doing my duty as they had people who were captured by our Allied forces.</span> <span id="s75">So what happened, when I was picked up after being shot down, we were brought to what they call a Dulag1 loop [phonetic] for interrogation.</span> <span id="s76">And as I sat in front of the off--well it was just a field, a sergeant, Feldwebel as they call them, who interviewed me, and he started to poke questions at me as to what we were flying and what bombs we were carrying, other military information that he sought, and I kept repeating, “My name is Albert Miller, technical sergeant U.S. Air Force.</span> <span id="s77">My serial number is 35777588.”</span> <span id="s78">And I didn’t go beyond that.</span> <span id="s79">And he kept poking and firing the questions at me.</span> <span id="s80">And he got madder all the time as I refused to answer them until with a sudden shot, with a mighty big, he was a big six-foot-five man, he hit the desk with a terrific shot and I almost fell out of my chair.</span> <span id="s81">But he said, “Do you know Sergeant Miller, we do not like the Jewish people here!</span> <span id="s82">And we will give you to the Gestapo if we don’t get the information that we want.”</span> <span id="s83">I said, “You can do whatever you want, threaten me, whatever you want.</span> <span id="s84">My name is Albert Miller, technical sergeant,” and so forth.</span> <span id="s85">And that’s as far as I went.</span> <span id="s86">And that’s the only threat I ever had as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">PS: You were shot down over Germany, Al?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">AM: Our target was Merseburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s89">And it was synthetic oil plants.</span> <span id="s90">We had dropped our bombs, followed the information off the target, and then we were hit.</span> <span id="s91">We were hit over Merseburg, and then we limped westward towards the Allied lines by ourselves.</span> <span id="s92">We fell out of the formation.</span> <span id="s93">We were down to about 14,000 feet and our navigator who was, actually the bombardier who was flying as navigator, made a mistake in his navigation and he took us right over the city of Frankfurt, Germany.</span> <span id="s94">14,000 feet over the city of Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s95">It’s like being over Philadelphia with 300 anti-aircraft guns firing at one plane.</span> <span id="s96">That knocked us out of the sky, and that’s when we were down and captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">PS: Was your crew captured intact?</span> <span id="s98">How many members were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">AM: Well, there were nine members flying.</span> <span id="s100">As I recall, when I was picked up and marched to a shelter, an underground shelter where we were held all and banded together, I recall seeing about six of our members.</span> <span id="s101">And I was told that our ball turret gunner never was recovered.</span> <span id="s102">Our tail gunner came through, but they didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s103">They saw his chute open.</span> <span id="s104">And the third was our navigator, who, as I was told, when he left the plane as it was falling and breaking up, pulled his chute too quick.</span> <span id="s105">The plane got ahold of his chute and burned him up and he fell to the ground.</span> <span id="s106">And the proof was that when I was interrogated, his dog tags were laying on the interrogator’s desk right in front of me.</span> <span id="s107">William Coucher, New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">PS: When you hit the ground, were you first recovered by German civilians or German military?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">AM: It’s a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s110">I came down in a field behind some farmhouses.</span> <span id="s111">There’s a town called Oberursel, right near Frankfurt, Germany.</span> <span id="s112">I landed in a muddy field.</span> <span id="s113">It had rained a day or two before that.</span> <span id="s114">And the chute fell all around me.</span> <span id="s115">I struggled.</span> <span id="s116">I had a terrific wound.</span> <span id="s117">I was hit across the forehead.</span> <span id="s118">And I bled profusely, but it had coagulated and caked up on me.</span> <span id="s119">And I staggered to my feet.</span> <span id="s120">As I turned around to see where I was, and I looked around to see, try to get my bearings a little bit, I saw a crowd of civilians coming up with sticks in their hands, and starting to throw rocks and stones at me.</span> <span id="s121">And I turned around with the idea of running away from them as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s122">And there were three German soldiers coming up towards me with their rifles and their bayonets on.</span> <span id="s123">And they surrounded me and kept the crowd away.</span> <span id="s124">And from that point on they marched me to this shelter and then we went on to the Dulag and on to the Stalag [Stammlager, POW camp for enlisted men].</span></p> <p><span id="s125">PS: Were you alone at that point?</span> <span id="s126">Were any other members of your crew...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">AM: I was alone when I was captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">AM: They had all strung out all over the sky.</span> <span id="s130">I didn’t know where they were or if they made it.</span> <span id="s131">But when I was marched to this shelter, we came around what was a little abutment, or a little wall I think.</span> <span id="s132">And I walked right into these six buddies of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">PS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">AM: All sitting there with very disgruntled, frustrated expressions, looked very scared.</span> <span id="s135">And I looked at them and we hugged each other and then kissed each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">Were there any other Jewish boys in that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">AM: Not in my group.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s140">You jumped at roughly about 14,000 feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">AM: We were shot up, blew out of the sky completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">AM: And God was with me all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">PS: So as you descended in the parachute, could you observe your other, the other members of the crew?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">AM: Prior to being shot up as badly as we were, I could see chutes that they had left the plane...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">AM: And that were all over the air.</span> <span id="s148">I could see about five or six chutes.</span> <span id="s149">But then all of a sudden all hell broke loose and fragments of the plane were flying up at me.</span> <span id="s150">I guess some of the ack-ack gun fire was all around me.</span> <span id="s151">And I got hit and was pretty dazed.</span> <span id="s152">I just held on to the shroud lines as tightly as I could.</span> <span id="s153">And as I came down, I was warned not to, to dodge whatever trees might be coming, I might be coming down to, because I could get hit in the groin and get hit pretty badly.</span> <span id="s154">So I started to pull up my legs with that thought in mind, but the ground was coming up so fast.</span> <span id="s155">Depth perception absolutely is nil when you’re in that position.</span> <span id="s156">It came up so fast I just straightened my legs out, hit the ground.</span> <span id="s157">And I had my air boots on which are this thick.</span> <span id="s158">I hit the ground with a thud and a thing, and I just fell backwards and then rolled forward.</span> <span id="s159">And it took me a minute or two to pull myself together to see what was going on, as I said.</span> <span id="s160">I got rid of the chute all around me.</span> <span id="s161">And I started looking around me.</span> <span id="s162">And I saw the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">PS: Had you ever parachuted before?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">AM: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">PS: Either forced or just in...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">AM: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: Practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">AM: Never.</span> <span id="s169">This was the first experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">PS: So really the three members of the German, they were Wehrmacht?</span> <span id="s171">German Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">AM: They were German military, and they came up, they actually protected me from the crowd.</span> <span id="s173">And then in their German they said “Haben Sie Pistole?”</span> <span id="s174">which meant do I have a pistol?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">PS: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">AM: And I said, “Nein, nein, nein.”</span> <span id="s177">And he said, “Kommen Sie, kommen Sie, mit mir.”</span> <span id="s178">[Come with me.]</span> <span id="s179">And they marched us, as I said, they marched me to this shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PS: And it was there that you met your, what, six other members of your...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">AM: I met my buddies from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">PS: The crew?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">AM: The did I say the ball turret gunner wasn’t there?</span> <span id="s184">The bombardier wasn’t there, and the waist gunner wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PS: They were both officers and...</span></p> <p><span id="s186">AM: The bombardier was an officer.</span> <span id="s187">The other ones, the ball turret gunner was a staff sergeant, and the waist gunner was a staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">PS: Then, from that point on, now if you would care to tell us a little bit about the processing, the procedure.</span> <span id="s189">At what point were you--did the subject of religion come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">AM: Well, when we were taken to--we were at this shelter.</span> <span id="s191">They finally gathered us together with the remnants of our parachutes, which they put into a wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s192">And our engineer, who was a technical sergeant, was--his shoes came off.</span> <span id="s193">He was ordered to push that wheelbarrow through the muddy streets.</span> <span id="s194">There was a little snow around and ice.</span> <span id="s195">But they are muddy, rocky streets.</span> <span id="s196">And he had to push that wheelbarrow in his bare feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">PS: How far was it from that point of that, to your point of interrogation and...</span></p> <p><span id="s198">AM: I would say it was two miles.</span> <span id="s199">He pushed that, and he was staggering and falling over.</span> <span id="s200">So I went over to him and tried to help him a little bit.</span> <span id="s201">The, one of the guards who was walking with us, one of the German guards that is, took the butt of his rifle and hit me across the back and said, “Geh weg!”</span> <span id="s202">which meant of course, “Get away from him.</span> <span id="s203">Let him push it himself.”</span> <span id="s204">But he struggled through and he got this chute there, not that it meant anything.</span> <span id="s205">I don’t know what they did with it.</span> <span id="s206">But it was about a two-mile walk.</span> <span id="s207">We got there into the place of interrogation.</span> <span id="s208">They walked us in there, stood us around for a few minutes, and then they put us each in a separate, solit--room in solitary.</span> <span id="s209">And then we were called in for interrogation little by little, one by one.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">PS: At that point when they marched you the few miles to the point of interrogation, had many German civilians gathered out of curiosity?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">AM: They were all along the roadways throwing stones at us and spitting at us and calling out the German curse names.</span> <span id="s212">“Schweinehund!</span> <span id="s213">Tot,” [dead] which of course you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">PS: You [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s215">AM: And it was not a pleasant thing but we struggled through it and...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">PS: And you feel had it not been for the German military that they probably would have attacked you and God knows what could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">AM: Because they had sticks and big clubs and they had rocks.</span> <span id="s218">After all, we had just bombed their homes!</span> <span id="s219">Of course, it was in the Merseburg area, but it was an enemy plane.</span> <span id="s220">And look how long they had been undergoing that steady bombing between the British at night and the American and Allies during the day.</span> <span id="s221">So they were pretty well upset, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">PS: Al, you say the town was Merseburg?</span> <span id="s223">That was your target?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">AM: Merseburg was our target, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">AM: The synthetic oil plants in Merseburg...</span></p> <p><span id="s227">PS: Could you spell that for us, Al?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">AM: M-E-R-S-E-B-E-R-G [Merseburg]</span></p> <p><span id="s229">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">AM: Merseburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">PS: And you were shot down over, in a town close to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">AM: Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s233">It was the big town of Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">AM: It’s one of the metropolises in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s237">So, where you had the interrogation, can you repeat to the points of, in your interrogation the first time that religion was mentioned, was when the sergeant, the interrogator, he was speaking English, of course, right?</span> <span id="s238">And he made mention of the fact that you were, that he knew that you were Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">AM: I had my dog tags with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s241">And his, he made threats to you which you ignored as far as acceding to his commands.</span> <span id="s242">Then from there, Al, the other members of your crew who parachuted along with you were in other rooms within the same building.</span> <span id="s243">Was your group then rejoined after interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">AM: No, we were--I was in solitary confinement for eleven days.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">PS: Well, at that same building?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">AM: Same place, yes.</span> <span id="s247">What their system apparently was, was to put us through these pretty rough military people who were not officers and not refined to a point that they could talk with a little bit of diplomacy.</span> <span id="s248">They were just rough.</span> <span id="s249">They were challenging us and they, at least me, and they threatened me with that one incident there where they would turn me over to the Gestapo if I didn’t reveal.</span> <span id="s250">But of course I stuck to my guns come what may, and about four or five days after that, they had me taken into an office where I could see it was a far different thing, where it was an officer, a Major.</span> <span id="s251">And he sat in an elegant office there, and he offered me a drink, and he spoke to me like a gentleman.</span> <span id="s252">And he says, “Sergeant, we know that you have a daughter that you have never seen.</span> <span id="s253">We know that you have a lovely family.</span> <span id="s254">And I know you want to get back to see them as quickly as you can.</span> <span id="s255">And being a prisoner, the possibility of repatriation is very great, and all we want is a little cooperation.</span> <span id="s256">And if you can tell me what your bomb load was, what your original target was, at what height you would attack that, drop the load, bomb.”</span> <span id="s257">Then he asked a few more questions like that.</span> <span id="s258">I says, “Major, you’re a gentleman, the first gentleman I met in Germany,” I said, “but I cannot reveal anything.”</span> <span id="s259">I am technical sergeant Albert Miller and my serial number is so-and-so.</span> <span id="s260">And that’s as far as I can go.”</span> <span id="s261">And he tried again and again, but after two or three days he let it go.</span> <span id="s262">And he says, “Sergeant, you’ll go back to your room and then we’ll see what develops.”</span> <span id="s263">And that’s the last I saw of him or any other interrogator.</span> <span id="s264">From that point on, about, as I said, eleven days elapsed.</span> <span id="s265">And we were all brought together into one big room.</span> <span id="s266">And [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">PS: Oh, this was your crew.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">AM: Our crew and...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">AM: Other captives.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">PS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">AM: And I could see our crew.</span> <span id="s273">I could see some other fellows from the group who were shot down.</span> <span id="s274">And from that point on they had sought--but one of the most thrilling things that I encountered at that particular meeting--is it O.K. to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">PS: Go on, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">AM: Was a limey, one of the English--apparently an officer of an English crew--who addressed us.</span> <span id="s277">And he says, “Gentlemen, I want you to realize that you are Allied soldiers.</span> <span id="s278">And these son-of-a-bitches cannot touch you or harm you in any way within their laws of the Red Cross, Geneva Convention, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s279">So I want you to realize that and keep your strength.</span> <span id="s280">Keep your face up.</span> <span id="s281">Keep your head up.</span> <span id="s282">Show these sons-of-a-bitches that we’re gonna beat the hell out of ‘em!”</span> <span id="s283">It was a [unclear] speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">PS: And yet, despite that assurance...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">AM: Right, with all the Jerries [Germans] standing around there, “We’ll show these bastards!”</span></p> <p><span id="s286">PS: And yet Hitler, I think it was after the bombing of Dresden, the saturated bombing of Dresden, where Hitler actually gave out the order that all airmen held captive be executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">AM: I couldn’t, couldn’t relate to that.</span> <span id="s288">I really wou--probably at the time I was a captive.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">PS: Oh this is, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">AM: We were liberated May the 1st by the Russians.</span> <span id="s291">So I--whatever that time was around.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">PS: Yeah, well this was right after the saturated bombing of Dresden, when Hitler enraged, gave the order that all, I think, all airmen held captive be executed.</span> <span id="s293">And I think bef--one of, I think, was it Himmler, who refused to carry out the order because the Germans had just been, I believe, pushed back at the Battle of the Bulge and they were afraid...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">AM: I was a P.O.W. at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s296">Now, you were then, we go back to Sunday where you were all assembled and the British officer...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">AM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">PS: Oh, first Al, was this a headquarters of Luftwaffe or German Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">AM: Well, apparently it was of the Luftwaffe, because we were all airmen.</span> <span id="s300">As I say, the town was Oberursel.</span> <span id="s301">And it was just outside of Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s302">And it was from that point on that we were sent up to the final Stalag up in the Pomeranian, or near the Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">PS: You were sent as a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">AM: Well, they sent groups at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">AM: It was by railroad.</span> <span id="s307">And we were placed into these railroad cars and, of course, they had a load of men.</span> <span id="s308">There was not enough room for them to sit or lay or stand comfortably, so we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s309">And we laid down on the floor and they had little shelves up.</span> <span id="s310">Some of us laid up there.</span> <span id="s311">And one on top of the other until we got to the town of Wetzlar, which was a processing center, at which point they took us out and they gave us food and they gave us clean clothing and permitted us to take a shower and clean up.</span> <span id="s312">And from there we went to our final...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">PS: How many days, how long was it, the, were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">AM: That was at least a four day trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">PS: Four days on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">AM: At least for four days, on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">PS: On the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">AM: And that was going to the Stalag.</span> <span id="s319">The trip out of there was a lot worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">PS: During that period, they were not, they were like boxcars and...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">AM: Well, they just--the train that took us up there were regular passenger trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">AM: It had the compartments that you, you know, you probably are acquainted with from the European style of compartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">AM: And the aisleway and the compartments.</span> <span id="s326">And we, as I said, piled in four or five, six in the compartments and on the shelves and on the floors and the walkway outside, and did the best we could to make ourselves comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">PS: Were they officers and enlisted men together?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">AM: Our men, yeah.</span> <span id="s329">Our men were all officers and enlisted men.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">AM: Then when we got to Wetzlar we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">PS: Were there any other Jewish prisoners to your, were you aware of any others who were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">AM: I didn’t have a chance to.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">AM: To really, to go into, no, I never did.</span> <span id="s336">I knew, of course, in the prison camps where we were, interesting stories.</span> <span id="s337">And it is, a coincidence is that I’m gonna meet one of them tomorrow down at Baltimore where he’s staying in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s338">I’m going down and meet with him and his family, which we have done.</span> <span id="s339">We’ve been seeing each other for forty years or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">PS: He was with you in the prison camp or...</span></p> <p><span id="s341">AM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">PS: Part of your crew...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">AM: He was there in the Stalag.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">PS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">AM: I met him there in the, a very interesting story there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">PS: Also Air Force?</span> <span id="s347">He was Air Force?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">AM: Yeah, he flew three missions.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">AM: He got caught.</span> <span id="s351">His parachute landed in the tree!</span> <span id="s352">And he rolled over, a big tank with 155 mm gun pointed right at him!</span> <span id="s353">And they got out and they said, “Hey, for you the Krieg [war] is over!”</span></p> <p><span id="s354">PS: They wish they had been in the same position, I bet.</span> <span id="s355">[tape off then on] So Al, you’re now in the Stalag.</span> <span id="s356">Was this strictly for Air Force prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">AM: Air Force prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s359">Officers and enlisted men who...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">AM: It was Stalag Number Four, if I re--yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">PS: And the area was in Poland, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">AM: Grossye-Tychów if you know the area.</span> <span id="s363">It’s in the Pomeranian section of Germany, north of Stettin, up near the Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">PS: Could you possibly spell the...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">AM: The, Grossye-Tychów?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">AM: G-R-O-S-S-Y-E, hyphen, T-Y-C-H-O-W, Grossye-Tychów [phonetic].</span> <span id="s368">And then they had another name they referred to on occasion.</span> <span id="s369">It’s Kiefehyde [phonetic], K-I-E-F-E-H-Y-D-E, Kiefehyde.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">PS: Now that was still November of 1944, right?</span> <span id="s371">No that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s372">AM: Yeah, well, it was 11 days after the...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PS: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">AM: 21st.</span> <span id="s375">It was approaching December 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">PS: And the war ended May the 8th, 1945.</span> <span id="s377">So you then were held captive through November, December, January, February, March, April and May.</span> <span id="s378">Now, during that period, were you in the one prison camp the entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">AM: No.</span> <span id="s380">We were taken up there, and we were there through the early part of January.</span> <span id="s381">At that time the Russians were moving in into the area and the threat of them overrunning our camp was very great so that they, the German hierarchy, informed us that we would have to leave the camp and be taken to another camp.</span> <span id="s382">So it was one very bitter cold day, I think around January the 10th, the 12th, somewhere around there.</span> <span id="s383">And the snow was up to here.</span> <span id="s384">And they marched us out and lined us up, and then they marched us--with dogs as our accompanying us to the railroad station which was, give or take, about a mile away where we were, at which point we were assigned a car a little group in front of each car.</span> <span id="s385">These were the freight cars, what they referred to as the forty-and-eights.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">PS: Oh, forty-and-eights, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">AM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">PS: Forty men...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">AM: Forty men or eight horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">PS: Yeah, eight horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">AM: And we were lined up in front of them.</span> <span id="s392">And then each of us--and then they were--they gave us a Red Cross parcel, one for every eight guys.</span> <span id="s393">One, it was a ten pound parcel, which normally we were getting one full parcel when we were in the camp.</span> <span id="s394">One for every eight guys.</span> <span id="s395">So this had to be distri--whacked up in [unclear].</span> <span id="s396">[tape off then on] When we were given them, we were told to get into the car.</span> <span id="s397">So they had a little step up into the car, and we got into the car, and they kept coming into the car.</span> <span id="s398">Now these cars, forty men?</span> <span id="s399">There was about 55, 58 men piled into it.</span> <span id="s400">You couldn’t sit down.</span> <span id="s401">We were standing up.</span> <span id="s402">So one of the guys says, “Why don’t we sit down?”</span> <span id="s403">So where you gonna sit?</span> <span id="s404">We were in those cars for four days and five nights.</span> <span id="s405">One bucket among fifty-some men, one bucket.</span> <span id="s406">You want to take a leak, they have a little whatchyamacallems, wired windows in the corners of the car.</span> <span id="s407">You take a leak into a, one of the cans from the Red Cross [unclear] they had the powdered milk, which, Klim we used to call it, reverse of milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">AM: And we emptied it into a little container, some sort, and then we’d take a leak into the can and throw it out the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">PS: Out the...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">AM: But the guys were sitting, we were standing.</span> <span id="s412">You couldn’t move away.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">PS: And this was four days of...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s415">PS: This is Phil Solomon interviewing Mr. Albert Miller for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s416">This is tape one, side two.</span> <span id="s417">Mr. Miller, we were discussing your trip in the forty-and-eight cars, forty-and-eight, the expression used, I think, well, during World War I when most of the troop transport was by railroad.</span> <span id="s418">Now this was what time of the year?</span> <span id="s419">You say you were in...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">AM: Just around January the 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">PS: So it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">AM: Cold, very cold.</span> <span id="s423">And the snow was piled up.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">PS: And naturally in these cars there was no heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">AM: No heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">PS: So you suffered...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">AM: Sure, we had our coats on and we huddled against each other.</span> <span id="s428">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s429">Now referring to our tags or to our references regards Jewish, in Yiddishkeit and all that, I have the tendency to sing.</span> <span id="s430">And some of my buddies loved to sing.</span> <span id="s431">So we sang a few songs on the way, “Show Me The Way To Go Home” and things like that.</span> <span id="s432">We were about two days out.</span> <span id="s433">We were running out of material more or less.</span> <span id="s434">So I said, “I’m gonna sing, Yiddische Mama.”</span> <span id="s435">The guy said to me, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s436">Yiddische Mama among all these?</span> <span id="s437">They’ll break open the doors and take you out and shoot you.”</span> <span id="s438">I says, “Let them shoot.”</span> <span id="s439">Then all the gentile guys around said, “You want to sing Yiddische Mama, you sing it!</span> <span id="s440">And don’t give a shit for any of them!”</span> <span id="s441">Those bastards.</span> <span id="s442">I did.</span> <span id="s443">I sang it, and it was just great.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">PS: Right.</span> <span id="s445">Did anyone join in with you and...</span></p> <p><span id="s446">AM: Well my friend Moe Friedman with me to visit and then there was Marty Silverstein from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s447">He was the one guy that said, “Sh-,” he said, “should shoot these guys,” I mean, “Sing for these bastards.</span> <span id="s448">Let them know that we can laugh right in their faces!</span> <span id="s449">Come on baby!</span> <span id="s450">Sing it for me!”</span></p> <p><span id="s451">PS: There were no guards within the car itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">AM: No, there were not.</span> <span id="s453">It was horrible conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">PS: Were you fed?</span> <span id="s455">Did they stop...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">AM: Only the Red Cross parcel that we had because it was those four days.</span> <span id="s457">We got to a marshaling yards [phonetic] on the way.</span> <span id="s458">We were going, heading for a place called Barth.</span> <span id="s459">It’s out on the Baltic, on a peninsula jutting out into the Baltic, just north of Berlin.</span> <span id="s460">And that’s where we were heading.</span> <span id="s461">So on the way about two days out we came into a marshaling yards [phonetic].</span> <span id="s462">And we begged, we hollered, we pleaded.</span> <span id="s463">“We got to take a crap!</span> <span id="s464">We want to get out of these cars for a few minutes!</span> <span id="s465">Leave us have a little breath of fresh air!”</span> <span id="s466">And finally they stopped the car, and they let us out--in full view of all the citizens of the village--and they said, “That’s your toilet.</span> <span id="s467">You wanna go?</span> <span id="s468">Right there.</span> <span id="s469">Whatever we had to do, we did it right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">PS: Al, going back to the few months you spent in the Stalag, your original point, during that period, you saw no Jewish prisoners who were treated other than, who were segregated or sent elsewhere?</span> <span id="s471">To your knowledge, there was no segregation?</span> <span id="s472">No Jewish prisoners who were removed and sent elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">AM: Not at this first Stalag.</span> <span id="s474">But when we got to the second one, and we were assigned our barracks, when we looked around we saw certain people that we can see, and we asked what was happening.</span> <span id="s475">We asked a few of the people that were close.</span> <span id="s476">The guards sometimes were a little friendly, just like you have a foreigner here.</span> <span id="s477">So he was a little friendly.</span> <span id="s478">[tape off then on] And he would tell us, “There is another camp which we are preparing for the time when we want to separate the Jewish prisoners of war from the others.</span> <span id="s479">It’s not occupied as yet, but we are preparing for it.”</span> <span id="s480">And that’s as far as I knew about segregation or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">PS: That was told to you by a..</span> <span id="s482">.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">AM: A Jerry guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">PS: A Jerry guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">AM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">PS: But as far as you know, it was never carried out?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">AM: It never materialized.</span> <span id="s488">It never came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">PS: And you did know of the presence of two, three or four other Jewish prisoners besides yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">AM: Oh yeah, Moe Friedman, as I said.</span> <span id="s491">Well Marty Silverstein went someplace else.</span> <span id="s492">But Moe was with me all the way through.</span> <span id="s493">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s494">PS: [tape off then on] Al, going back to your period in the first Stalag, which was November, December, through January, your own personal experience and your observation, do you think that the Germans adhered reasonably well to the terms of the Geneva Convention?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">AM: Concerning me, I..</span> <span id="s496">.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">AM: Have no fault with that at all, because we were handled accordingly.</span> <span id="s499">According to how the transportation was bringing in the Red Cross parcels, which, as I said, one time was one package per man, which was about ten pounds of food and assorted items.</span> <span id="s500">But as the transportation was being shot up, and an example is when we were on the train being transported from one place to another, they would pull the trains in under a tunnel while an air raid was in progress.</span> <span id="s501">So, while that was all taking place, the food parcels were dwindling down to a point where we were very bad off.</span> <span id="s502">We just had a small share of a package among ten, fifteen men.</span> <span id="s503">And we used to raid the officers’, the German officers’ commissary.</span> <span id="s504">Outside of the commissary were potato peelings that they had put out of there from their kitchen.</span> <span id="s505">We used to raid them and bring buckets of it back to our barrack, wash them up, clean them up, and salvage the peelings as best we could for food.</span> <span id="s506">Other than that, we got one bowl of what they call Ersatz [substitute] soup through the day, and maybe two pieces of black bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">PS: So you really depended on the Red Cross packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">AM: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s509">Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">PS: How often, you say a ten-pound package, per...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">AM: Ten-pound package of assorted foods...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">AM: Like, well let me try to think, I have a..</span> <span id="s514">.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">PS: Were the foods mainly for the purpose of subsistence?</span> <span id="s516">They, I mean it wasn’t like pleasure food, like candies or fruits or...</span></p> <p><span id="s517">AM: Well, there were some little delicacies in there, and smoke supplies.</span> <span id="s518">In one package you’d find a pipe maybe, a package of tobacco, when we were getting individual packages.</span> <span id="s519">This is a log.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">PS: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">AM: Do you want to hear more about this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">PS: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">AM: This is a log.</span> <span id="s524">I was, at the first Stalag I became acquainted with some British prisoners of war who were taken at Dunkirk...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">PS: Wow, back...</span></p> <p><span id="s526">AM: Back in 1940.</span> <span id="s527">And they were there for about four years or more, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s528">And they had been given these prisoner of war logs to sort of keep a record for themselves.</span> <span id="s529">At that time they were getting mail from home, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">PS: They were supplied by the Red Cross or...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">AM: Red Cross.</span> <span id="s532">They were getting mail from home, too, which included photographs and snapshots, which they pasted into their log, like this.</span> <span id="s533">Now, when we got there, as I said, things were very bad.</span> <span id="s534">The food was limited to just a little bit a day, and the packages would dwindle down to one-tenth per man.</span> <span id="s535">So that I, who always like to write, had nothing, didn’t even have a piece of paper to write on or a pencil.</span> <span id="s536">I spoke with one of the British boys, and he had this log.</span> <span id="s537">And he was so tired of keeping it that [chuckles] he says, “Al,” he said, “if you want this log, I’ll take a half of your D-bar,” which was a ration of chocolate that we had gotten in the package.</span> <span id="s538">“I’ll take a half of your D-bar, and you can pay me out over a period of time.”</span> <span id="s539">Because we were in sections, in six cubicles like.</span> <span id="s540">So I said, “Look, I’ll give you my whole portion.</span> <span id="s541">You take it, and I’ll do without it,” because I wanted this more than I wanted the food.</span> <span id="s542">Because I kept as much of a log as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s543">I’m not a great artist.</span> <span id="s544">I’m not a great writer, but I do write poetry.</span> <span id="s545">I write songs and things like that.</span> <span id="s546">So this was the war time log that was given to the British prisoners of war, and which I got from this fellow Herbie Robison, and then which I started to keep.</span> <span id="s547">And little things like this, but, of course, it would take you a lot more time.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">AM: What I actually got it out for was to show you the Red Cross parcel and what all...</span></p> <p><span id="s550">PS: Were these, dr--did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s551">AM: They were tracings that were made by the POWs...</span></p> <p><span id="s552">PS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">AM: For me.</span> <span id="s554">They put them in these prisoner of war logs.</span> <span id="s555">All this stuff, and then it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">PS: These tracings are of war planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">AM: War planes, the British war planes.</span> <span id="s558">And this was a tribute to my crew, and these other little things.</span> <span id="s559">But I don’t want to, we did not have paper.</span> <span id="s560">I used to use, from the cigarette packages they got, they u--this is toilet paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">AM: But, this was me walking along the corridor at night going to the outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">PS: Night mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">AM: And, but I wanted to get this one of the Red Cross parcel.</span> <span id="s565">They wrote poems and they did, that was a drawing by one of the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">PS: Yeah, a British war plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">AM: This, I think, is a B-17.</span> <span id="s568">Queen of the Sky, that’s a B-17.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">PS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">AM: And these little poems that I made up.</span> <span id="s571">This is a gunner’s day, and I’ll get to it in a second here.</span> <span id="s572">This--well, Harry made that little bit of artistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">PS: The...</span></p> <p><span id="s574">AM: One of the guys did it for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">PS: Would you describe, Al, what we’re looking at here?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">AM: This is a prisoner of war log, which I managed to purchase from one of the POWs for a bar of chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">PS: Yeah, but I meant the pictures right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">AM: And I have it, and it, within these pages are memories that are priceless...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">PS: Oh they sure are!</span></p> <p><span id="s580">AM: Showing the barrack Stube which is a barrack room where we stayed.</span> <span id="s581">This is my poor attempt at artistry.</span> <span id="s582">But you can see that this is all we had.</span> <span id="s583">Our little, what they call a paillasse which was a bag of straw, was used for a bed--we rolled up at night, during the day and put it on the side.</span> <span id="s584">These...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">PS: Now this barrack room is identified as Room 12, Barrack 13, West Compound.</span> <span id="s586">Is that Barth?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">AM: Yeah, Barth.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">PS: B-A-R-T-H, Germany, Stalag Luft One.</span> <span id="s589">Now Luft One would refer to Air Force...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">AM: Yeah, Stalag Luft.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">PS: A Stalag for the Air Force prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">AM: This was a poem that I wrote.</span> <span id="s593">But I wanted to get to this oh, here.</span> <span id="s594">This are some of the contents of the Red Cross parcels.</span> <span id="s595">You can just go right on down every little thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">We’re looking at a page on which there are drawings of plum pudding, deviled ham, Wrigley’s Spearmint, Doublemint, pipe tobacco, fruit bar, mixed candies.</span> <span id="s598">And this was a typical package, Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">AM: Red Cross food parcel, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">PS: Al, during this period, were you or, during the first month or two months in your initial Stalag, were--did the Red Cross come in at all to interview for the purpose of identifying the prisoners?</span> <span id="s601">To notify, what I’m getting at, during this period, had your family been notified that you were a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">AM: Well, my family eventually got, was notified.</span> <span id="s603">As I say, my daughter was born in September of 1944 while I was on Operations.</span> <span id="s604">And my wife got the notice, the first notice came, it was a, sort of a, just a regular card, which indicated I am safe, I am uninjured, I’m being taken care of, and I’m in good hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">PS: This was after you were shot down in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">AM: When I was shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">AM: We were allowed to write, send that card away.</span> <span id="s609">Now as I say, we were captured November 21st.</span> <span id="s610">I had a, managed to get that card out a few days later.</span> <span id="s611">And Molly, my wife, didn’t get that till sometime in January.</span> <span id="s612">So, that’s the only correspondence we had between us.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">PS: Now that came through the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">AM: Through the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">PS: And, until then, when you were initially, when you were shot down, did she then, did your family then receive word that you were missing, that you were shot down?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">AM: From the War Department, Missing in Action.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s618">So that was in November.</span> <span id="s619">And it was January until...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">AM: It was in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">PS: They knew that you were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">AM: Alive, yeah.</span> <span id="s623">Missing in Action [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s624">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s625">Until then there was no communication at all of any kind between you and your family, and they had really no reason to believe that you were other than killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">AM: Well, except the word of the War Department that I was just missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">PS: Yeah, missing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">AM: But there was no official death notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">AM: You just asked something about the Red Cross visiting.</span> <span id="s631">I think that was one of the questions.</span> <span id="s632">At any rate, we did have representatives of the Swedish Red Cross come in at one time to--I guess this was Barth, Number One, Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s633">And among the group that was with them was Max Schmeling, the old fighter.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">PS: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s635">AM: He came with them, he was with that group.</span> <span id="s636">I don’t know, I guess he had some sort of a job.</span> <span id="s637">At any rate, they walked around, they spoke to some of the POWs, and everybody hollered, “When are we goin’ home?</span> <span id="s638">When are we gettin’ the hell out of here?”</span> <span id="s639">But for the most part they did their business, whatever it was, and they gave us some encouragement that things were progressing to a point that, “You’ll be getting more food.”</span> <span id="s640">And that we possibly might be getting out of here into a processing center preparatory to going home.</span> <span id="s641">It was words of encouragement, but it didn’t happen until the May we were liberated by the Russians on May the 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s643">And at that time you were north of, the Luft Stalag was north of Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">AM: Barth was on the Baltic Sea, on the peninsula jutting out, it was south of our original Stalag.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">PS: During that period, you had reached the point where you had no fear of your eventual release at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s646">Were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s647">AM: Well, I’ll tell you, things changed for us during the--by Stalin when they made that turnaround.</span> <span id="s648">They were bringing in hundreds of POWs, Allied POWs, from that battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">PS: Yeah, the German...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">AM: And the Jerry guards were walking around in, they were in their seventh heaven!</span></p> <p><span id="s651">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">AM: “Oh, we’re gonna kick the hell out of you Yankees!</span> <span id="s653">We’re gonna knock you all the way back to the Atlantic Ocean!”</span></p> <p><span id="s654">PS: What Mr. Miller is speaking of, right now, the Battle of the Bulge, Bastogne, Belgium.</span> <span id="s655">Can you just give, this tape could be made many, many years from now, be studied and listened to, by people who would have no knowledge of the term Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s656">Can you give us, for the benefit of those who listen to this in the future...</span></p> <p><span id="s657">AM: Well, apparently it was a geographic area that bulged out into the, actually into Europe, at a point near Belgium, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s658">My geography [is] not too good.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">PS: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">AM: And the German forces, the Wehrmacht, came in there in strength, and surrounded some of our forces up in that area, to a point where they probably would have annihilated them if they didn’t get, if we hadn’t sent every possible reserve.</span> <span id="s661">I heard later they were taking clerks out of offices in London, and in any area where they could reach out and get people of physical capability to get in there and fight, and do whatever they can to stave off the Germans till our reserves, till our forces got together and then drove them back.</span> <span id="s662">But that was a very serious setback in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">PS: Yeah, during that period as Germans suddenly were told that, “This is it, we have turned the whole thing around.</span> <span id="s664">And from here on in we will be on the offensive.”</span> <span id="s665">And, but it proved to be, I guess it was about two weeks that the Germans continued their advance under General von Runstedt, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">AM: Well he was the commander of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s667">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">AM: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s669">PS: Now during that, were you pretty much aware of what was going on while a prisoner?</span> <span id="s670">During that period of a few weeks, suddenly it took a turn in reverse.</span> <span id="s671">Were you aware?</span> <span id="s672">Of course, you had these many, many prisoners coming in...</span></p> <p><span id="s673">AM: With stories now.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">PS: With stories, and you heard.</span> <span id="s675">Were you getting any information at all through clandestine radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">AM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s677">We had hidden radios and they would get messages from the BBC and they would jot it down, and somehow or other, our men were absolutely marvelous with what they could get together.</span> <span id="s678">They had typewriters.</span> <span id="s679">They had the ability to convey information from one barrack to the other.</span> <span id="s680">And they would send messages around during the time we were free to walk around from barrack to barrack with information as to what was actually happening.</span> <span id="s681">Of course, they couldn’t give us the truest picture as to how badly we were being beaten in the Bulge, but it was enough to keep us informed, and, well, we got our hopes together.</span> <span id="s682">When some of the guys came in and said, “We’re gonna turn it around yet.</span> <span id="s683">We haven’t got our forces together, but we will do it.”</span> <span id="s684">And it turned to be the case that they reversed the whole thing and pushed them back, and then they knocked them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">PS: Now after you were privileged to send the card home, your family was then notified that you were alive, a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s686">Was there any mail, any exchange at all of any communications?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">AM: No communication at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">PS: You were not, your family, you could write no letters to your family and...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">AM: No, no written communication whatsoever.</span> <span id="s690">I was, we could write, but they wouldn’t mail it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">AM: The only thing that, a little information leaked to my wife was when one of the crews with whom we were roomed in England flight, there were two crews.</span> <span id="s693">We were one crew, another crew was beside us.</span> <span id="s694">And we shared that one barrack.</span> <span id="s695">When we went up on our last flight, these fellows from the other crew were being shipped home.</span> <span id="s696">They had completed their tour of missions and they were being shipped home.</span> <span id="s697">The information came back that our crew got shot down in this last Merseburg mission.</span> <span id="s698">And one of the fellows, a fellow named Millick [phonetic] from around Limerick where they had that tornado just recently...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">AM: He managed to get back over to the States O.K. And he got into the Philadelphia area, and he called my wife by phone.</span> <span id="s701">And he said that, “As far as people know, the men that were not in the formation saw the plane go down, and saw a lot of chutes in the air.</span> <span id="s702">As far as we know it could have been that he came through O.K. That’s all I can tell you.”</span> <span id="s703">And then when she finally got the card she knew that I was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">PS: Then, we’re approaching the surrender of Germany.</span> <span id="s705">After, you were getting information during the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s706">Then, when things turned, you were then aware of the fact that the Allies were definitely on the march through Germany into Poland on one side, into Austria on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">AM: And the Russians from the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s709">And you were aware then, now, that the day was coming in the very shortly of the surrender.</span> <span id="s710">Did you notice at that point any sharp change in the attitude and treatment from the German guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">AM: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s712">We were, I would say the latter part of April, we had information that things were being turned around.</span> <span id="s713">We couldn’t pinpoint exactly what, where and what the troops were involved, but the German leaders came to our leaders and told them that things were not looking too good for them and they were going to evacuate that camp.</span> <span id="s714">They wanted us to march out with them towards the west, where the Allies were.</span> <span id="s715">They didn’t want any parts of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">AM: And our leader says, “Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s718">We will not let these men go out on the road to be targets for our own planes.</span> <span id="s719">They’ll be completely unidentified.</span> <span id="s720">We have no identification whatsoever.</span> <span id="s721">We don’t even have a flag.</span> <span id="s722">And, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s723">These men are gonna stay here.</span> <span id="s724">You can evacuate.</span> <span id="s725">You can leave, and, “bye-bye Charlie.”</span> <span id="s726">But as far as we’re concerned, we’re staying here.”</span> <span id="s727">Now that was Colonel Zenkie [phonetic].</span> <span id="s728">You might have seen him on television just recently, in that, they had a, PBS had a whole big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s730">He was like the commanding officer...</span></p> <p><span id="s731">AM: He was our commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">PS: Of the prisoners...</span></p> <p><span id="s733">AM: Right, of the POWs.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">PS: Of the American...</span></p> <p><span id="s735">AM: At this Barth Number One.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">AM: And, Dobreski [phonetic] was there for a while too.</span> <span id="s738">He was a, 28 fighters he knocked down.</span> <span id="s739">At any rate, we stayed put.</span> <span id="s740">They, one night they disappeared.</span> <span id="s741">There was nobody...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">PS: And this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s743">AM: At Barth.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">PS: At approximately what...</span></p> <p><span id="s745">AM: The latter part of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">PS: Latter...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">AM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s748">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s749">The camp was unguarded.</span> <span id="s750">Then the Russians came up.</span> <span id="s751">And we were warned to stay away from them Russians, they’re crazy people, they drink like mad and they’ll kill, shoot anything in front of them that they don’t like.</span> <span id="s752">So we minded our own business, stayed together, and kept our heads about us as much as we could.</span> <span id="s753">But the vanguard of the Russians came up, met our leaders, and told them the camp was liberated.</span> <span id="s754">“You can do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s755">You can march out.</span> <span id="s756">You can walk around.</span> <span id="s757">But don’t interfere with our troops.”</span> <span id="s758">At any rate, we were warned not to do anything for several days, until that group went out, and the administrative, the more of the occupation forces came up to take care of the camp and administer whatever had to be done.</span> <span id="s759">So that we were there until we had the word that May the 8th the war was over, that the Germans had surrendered.</span> <span id="s760">And we were promised there would be planes coming in that would take us back to Allied territory.</span> <span id="s761">Well, we sat there from May the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.</span> <span id="s762">On the 13th of the month they flew in a bunch of B-17’s, and they took us lock, stock, and barrel back to Reims, France.</span> <span id="s763">From then on we advanced to Lucky Strike on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s764">PS: Yeah, I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s765">AM: That was.</span> <span id="s766">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">PS: Oh, I was there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">AM: Old Gold and all those...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">AM: Some very interesting experiences there too.</span> <span id="s771">But that was about the sequence of the events.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">PS: During the period that, between the time that the German guards left, until you were evacuated, was there any Soviet government, military government, looking after the welfare of the prisoners?</span> <span id="s773">Feeding?</span> <span id="s774">Who was...</span></p> <p><span id="s775">AM: This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s776">They were concerned that we were not fed too well.</span> <span id="s777">And as a result the leaders, the Russian leaders, advised their men to round up a bunch of oxen that were in the area, cattle, whatever they could, and drive them right into the camp, which they did.</span> <span id="s778">There must have been about forty or fifty oxen that were driven into the camp, and brought down to the lower end down there.</span> <span id="s779">And we were informed, “They’re yours.</span> <span id="s780">Do whatever you want with them.</span> <span id="s781">Eat ‘em, skin ‘em, do whatever you want.”</span> <span id="s782">So we happened to have a couple--so resourceful--a few guys that knew how to butcher animals.</span> <span id="s783">And they went down there and they went to town.</span> <span id="s784">They took about fifteen, twenty of these oxen and butchered them, cut them up, and they portioned out the meat.</span> <span id="s785">Raw meat, it was as tough as could be.</span> <span id="s786">And they saw that everybody in the camp had a ration of this ox meat.</span> <span id="s787">When we finally got it, it was so goddamned tough that you couldn’t even tear it.</span> <span id="s788">So we used to beat it.</span> <span id="s789">We had stones and whatever, hammers.</span> <span id="s790">We’d beat it until we made it as tender as we possibly could.</span> <span id="s791">Then we’d put it on a little bucket a day fire that we had and cook ‘em up to some extent and make of this a meal.</span> <span id="s792">We had other access.</span> <span id="s793">When we were free like that, had access to the entire area.</span> <span id="s794">So we left the camp, and we marched down to the roadways, to the little farmhouses.</span> <span id="s795">And I remember a big Jewish guy from Florida, Ralph Gross.</span> <span id="s796">He was the, who more or less lead because he was the biggest.</span> <span id="s797">He says, “Come on, follow me.”</span> <span id="s798">We went right into a farm house there and rounded up a bunch of chickens.</span> <span id="s799">Got ‘em into a corner and grabbed them.</span> <span id="s800">And he took them by the heads, like this, tore the head right off, and ran the blood out and jammed it into a bag, a sack.</span> <span id="s801">He said, “We’re gonna take them back and we’re gonna flick ‘em, and we’re gonna eat ‘em!</span> <span id="s802">[laughing] These Germans will learn a lesson from us!”</span></p> <p><span id="s803">PS: So you were finally evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">AM: By B-17’s, some British planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">PS: What is the--can you recall Al, then, when you first were in contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">AM: First?</span> <span id="s807">My first contact with my family?</span> <span id="s808">Well, I wrote a long, a lonnnng letter when I got to the [unclear] when I was sitting quietly.</span> <span id="s809">And the mail that, which she eventually got, only a short time before I got home, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">PS: There was no such thing, though, as telephoning?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">AM: Not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">PS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">AM: No, the first telephone communication was at Camp, Fort Patrick down in Virginia when I got into, we came into Hampton Roads by ship.</span> <span id="s814">And we were brought in in the camp there, and we were permitted a phone call.</span> <span id="s815">So I made my call from that point.</span> <span id="s816">But the interesting thing was, when the train came up from Fort Patrick, Virginia, it went right up past where we lived in West Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s817">Woodland Avenue has a railroad train going there...</span></p> <p><span id="s818">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">AM: Right on after Fort Mead, not Mead...</span></p> <p><span id="s820">PS: Dix?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">AM: Dix.</span> <span id="s822">Right after Fort Dix.</span> <span id="s823">That was two or three blocks from my house!</span> <span id="s824">[unclear] [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s825">PS: So you, then, the next question, we’re at the end, Al, but there’s something, it might be a little out of concept, there’s just something I’ve been curious about all through these years.</span> <span id="s826">After the years following World War II, there were many television programs that ridiculed, oh, like Hogan’s Heroes, which, I don’t know if you recall, it was a television series that made...</span></p> <p><span id="s827">AM: Oh yeah, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">PS: Remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">AM: Richard Dawson, and the guy that was killed...</span></p> <p><span id="s830">PS: Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">AM: I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s832">PS: It portrayed the German guards as blubbering idiots, and the American prisoners of war as being almost like in control of their own fate.</span> <span id="s833">I often wondered--now, you know, I was in combat in World War II; I was not a prisoner, but I often sat there watching, everything was, of course, in humor--and I often sat there watching and feeling very sensitive as to what former prisoners of war felt on looking at this, which certainly portrayed a completely different picture of the lives of our boys who were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">AM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s835">Our writers, of course, reporting for comedy.</span> <span id="s836">They wanted to...</span></p> <p><span id="s837">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">AM: Write a series that would attract the people to it, and give a laugh out.</span> <span id="s839">But frankly we kept looking at each other and saying, “It never happened.</span> <span id="s840">It never happened.</span> <span id="s841">It never happened.”</span> <span id="s842">Why, half of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s843">PS: Did you resent the fact that they made a big joke out of the whole, the, what were for some just horrible, horrible incidents, as prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">AM: Well, we had different elements of people.</span> <span id="s845">Some were cranks, some were jolly people.</span> <span id="s846">Even a Jerry guard, when you meet a foreigner today, or at any time, there, the personality that you run up against is sometimes different than what you see on a screen or read in books.</span> <span id="s847">At any rate, as I was describing one of our railroad trips, the Jerry guards were jolly fellows.</span> <span id="s848">They laughed and they joked with us.</span> <span id="s849">And they said, “I used to live in Camden!</span> <span id="s850">I remember Cane [phonetic] Avenue in Camden.</span> <span id="s851">I used to--my father had a..</span> <span id="s852">.”</span> <span id="s853">and we laughed, we had a little joke, and they would dance a little bit.</span> <span id="s854">So you had the jolly ones...</span></p> <p><span id="s855">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">AM: And on the other hand you had the mean, vicious guys that didn’t know anything but hate, and when we were going to that first camp… Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s857">PS: This is Philip Solomon interviewing Mr. Albert Miller for the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive.</span> <span id="s858">This is tape two, side one.</span> <span id="s859">Al, to continue, we’re reaching the end of the questions I had planned on asking you.</span> <span id="s860">To continue, we had reached the point where you were describing your trip home from Hampton Roads was it--your--the point of that train...</span></p> <p><span id="s861">AM: The Naval Base at Virginia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s863">You returned home on a naval...</span></p> <p><span id="s864">AM: Yeah, it was the General Butler, S.S. General Butler.</span> <span id="s865">It was a cruiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">PS: Oh, a cruiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">AM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">PS: Then, we were dis--you were describing the fact that you passed your former, within a few blocks of the former home in West Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s869">You then came into Fort Dix.</span> <span id="s870">Your family there was living in West Philadelphia?</span> <span id="s871">And you immediately were privileged to speak to them and...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">AM: Which I did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">PS: This was probably June?</span> <span id="s874">The German surrender was May the 8th, and I guess with all the processing and all we’re getting into mid-June of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">AM: Well, an interesting story regarding that was, as I said before, we were flown into Reims, France, where for the first time in months we were permitted showers and a thorough cleaning up and given rations of clothing, that is to say, clean underwear, socks, shirts, pants, slacks and so forth.</span> <span id="s876">And we relaxed there for a couple of days before we were flown up to Fort Lucky, or Camp Lucky Strike, which was the point of debarkation, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s877">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">AM: Where, for people going home.</span> <span id="s879">And then if you recall, there were points issued to...</span></p> <p><span id="s880">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">AM: Members of the military as to how quickly you can go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">AM: And P.O.W.’s were number one on the hit parade, so to speak, because they were given priority.</span> <span id="s884">However, when we got to Fort, to Lucky Strike, there was no shipping available, and we were there from, I would say, the beginning of June, for four weeks we were at Lucky Strike.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">PS: I was there at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">AM: Is that a fact?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">AM: Why didn’t you call me?</span> <span id="s889">[both laugh] An interesting thing about that was that this Moe Priven [phonetic] who, my buddy, his brother Bernie Priven played in the Glenn Miller orchestra.</span> <span id="s890">He’s a trumpet.</span> <span id="s891">And he was down in Paris, France, at the Olympia Theater there.</span> <span id="s892">Now we were at Lucky Strike for two weeks waiting for shipping and nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s893">So Moe got up off his fanny and he says, “The hell with this sitting around.</span> <span id="s894">I’m gonna go down and see my brother in Paris.”</span> <span id="s895">Well, he was a single man.</span> <span id="s896">He didn’t have to run home.</span> <span id="s897">But, he says, “I’m goin’ down there.”</span> <span id="s898">So he sort of left and we were casuals.</span> <span id="s899">We were not assigned to anything.</span> <span id="s900">So he wasn’t AWOL.</span> <span id="s901">But he went down to Paris.</span> <span id="s902">He was gone for about six or seven days, then he came back, and he sees we’re still sitting there waiting for ships.</span> <span id="s903">He said, “You dopes!”</span> <span id="s904">He says, “The biggest cit--the best city in the world...”</span></p> <p><span id="s905">PS: And you’re within...</span></p> <p><span id="s906">AM: “Is down there and you’re sitting up here?</span> <span id="s907">Get down there as fast as you can!”</span> <span id="s908">Well something was arranged and I managed to get there.</span> <span id="s909">And we went in, we saw Bernie Priven play, and we spent a little time there and we got back.</span> <span id="s910">But that was toward the latter part of June.</span> <span id="s911">I think we must have left Le Havre, we were, we came back to the camp and we were told shipping was available.</span> <span id="s912">“You better get down to Le Havre, and you’ll be able to get back home,” which we did.</span> <span id="s913">And we must have left there around the 19th or 20th of June.</span> <span id="s914">At any rate we got home, at Hampton Roads, about seven days later.</span> <span id="s915">And that’s when...</span></p> <p><span id="s916">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">AM: The trip back to Camp Dix.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">PS: To review just a few points, Al, how old were you when you were shot down, during this period of incarceration?</span> <span id="s919">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">AM: That was November, I was about 31.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">PS: And can you, if you care to review, your physical--oh, during the period of your incarceration, were you forced to work?</span> <span id="s922">Did you work on any assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">AM: No.</span> <span id="s924">We were non-commissioned officers and we did not have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">PS: Oh.</span> <span id="s926">What grade of Sergeant?</span> <span id="s927">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s928">AM: Tech Sergeant.</span> <span id="s929">I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s930">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s931">So, Privates and Corporals were forced to...</span></p> <p><span id="s932">AM: To work.</span> <span id="s933">None of our crew and none of the fellows in our area were forced to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">AM: We just...</span></p> <p><span id="s936">PS: None of them were below...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">AM: Played ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">PS: None of them were below the rank of Sergeant?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">AM: Not in our camp.</span> <span id="s940">PFC and Corporal.</span> <span id="s941">They were work groups, were detailed into the factories and the farmyards around.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">PS: But they were volunteers?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">AM: No, they were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">PS: Oh, they were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">AM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s946">Some of them wanted to do something, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s947">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">AM: They were detailed.</span> <span id="s949">We of the non-commissioned boys were in the barracks and then in our camp area.</span> <span id="s950">And what we did was play ball.</span> <span id="s951">A lot of them were talented in artistry and a lot of them formed classes.</span> <span id="s952">We had different classes in English and Math and foreign languages, classes, and then they formed a theater group.</span> <span id="s953">And they put on Petrified Forest among other things.</span> <span id="s954">It was just a very talented bunch of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">PS: In thinking back, Al, would you care to say anything at all, your physical and mental attitude and physical and mental condition during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">AM: I was as well as a man of my age could be at 31, and I was in good physical condition.</span> <span id="s957">I didn’t want to, I couldn’t compete with some of the 21-year-olders in the obstacle races and other things, but it was, I was in very good shape.</span> <span id="s958">And thank the good Lord for that.</span> <span id="s959">And mentally I was right on the ball.</span> <span id="s960">I wrote a few songs for some of the shows.</span> <span id="s961">And I did a lot of poetry, which is evident here in the log that I have.</span> <span id="s962">And I just kept myself busy as the other boys did, and thank.</span> <span id="s963">There was always talk about repatriation through the entire period of our incarceration, which only materialized for some of the very badly wounded.</span> <span id="s964">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s965">PS: They were repatriated before the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">AM: Before the war ended, yeah.</span> <span id="s967">Well, as a matter of fact, they called us all down, “Anybody who wants repatriation and feels that they’re capable of getting through, come down to our, to the meeting area,” which they did.</span> <span id="s968">Now some of the guys went to some extremes.</span> <span id="s969">They wanted to get back, and in order to, some of them punctured their eardrums.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">PS: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s971">AM: They did things; they chopped a piece of their finger off.</span> <span id="s972">They did whatever they could that they thought would get the attention of the repatriating officers and get them onto that list.</span> <span id="s973">But our group, we just stuck together.</span> <span id="s974">I got descriptive poetry that describes everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">PS: Al, it’s been I think a very informative interview.</span> <span id="s976">Is there anything at all that we didn’t cover that you would care, any personal comments, any...</span></p> <p><span id="s977">AM: Well, of course, did that piece get on the tape about the concentration camp that I saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">PS: No, no, it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">AM: Would you want that on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">PS: Oh yeah, surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">AM: I think that, relative to our Jewish subject, it might have been interesting, although I should have maybe explored it a little further.</span> <span id="s982">When we were liberated and given permission to walk around the area without Jerry guards on our back, I came across what appeared to be a concentration camp that was in the process of being liberated.</span> <span id="s983">Because these people were coming out of what appeared to be underground areas where they might have lived, and coming up into the air where they saw the sunshine they were, the sun absolutely blinded them as they looked up into it.</span> <span id="s984">And they were disheveled and broken down and limping and crippled.</span> <span id="s985">And I, we were not permitted to get close to them because of the prospect of disease being transferred.</span> <span id="s986">So I didn’t get that close that I could interrogate anybody or even get a better look.</span> <span id="s987">And I’m quite sure that it must have been a political concentration camp that was being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">PS: Were they wearing uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">AM: No uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">PS: No uniforms, just...</span></p> <p><span id="s991">AM: They were in rags.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">AM: Rags.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">PS: And their appearance, physical appearance was...</span></p> <p><span id="s995">AM: It was sickening.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">PS: Bad, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">AM: They were limping, and they were helping, one was helping another.</span> <span id="s998">It was really not a pleasant sight.</span> <span id="s999">But I couldn’t identify it as...</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">PS: You...</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">AM: Being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1003">You don’t know the name of the, the location or the camp or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">AM: Well, the location was in Barth.2</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">AM: It was just right outside of our camp only maybe a couple miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">PS: O.K., Al.</span> <span id="s1008">This has been certainly an interview that we appreciate very, very much.</span> <span id="s1009">And on behalf of myself and the Holocaust Oral History Archive at Gratz College we want to thank you very, very much and thank you.</span></p></body></html>
