Would you start with the first place that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A.</span> <span id="s28">We crossed the [ ??? ]</span> <span id="s29">in March of 1945 just after the crossing had been developed by the U.S. army.</span> <span id="s30">We went to a town that was a POW camp.</span> <span id="s31">Most of the POW's were Hindus from India.</span> <span id="s32">It was a jail which also had prisoners from France and Belgium.</span> <span id="s33">I also went to an institution that had been an insane asylum.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q.</span> <span id="s35">What was the composition of your unit and what was its task?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A.</span> <span id="s37">The unit was commanded by a major who was an attorney.</span> <span id="s38">There was a photographer, a forensics expert, interpreters, and regular service personnel.</span> <span id="s39">The purpose of the unit was to investigate and show evidence of war crimes.</span> <span id="s40">We investigated crimes and captured criminals and participated in the interrogation of people who had committed crimes.</span> <span id="s41">Hadamar was an insane asylum.</span> <span id="s42">It was converted into a place where they first exterminated Germans who were either insane or incapable of being productive.</span> <span id="s43">Later it became a place where people who had been forced from Eastern Europe could be killed when they could no longer work.</span> <span id="s44">We found shoes and clothes for some twenty thousand people.</span> <span id="s45">We had the Germans dig up bones and we did autopsies on them.</span> <span id="s46">The cause of death in almost all the cases was an injection of [??????]</span> <span id="s47">.</span> <span id="s48">We also managed to capture the people responsible.</span> <span id="s49">There was a Dr. Klein, a Dr. Waldeman, and a nurse Willy.</span> <span id="s50">They thought they were not going to be charged with anything because they were at an asylum.</span> <span id="s51">We established facts in a case and turned it over to the U.N. war crimes.</span> <span id="s52">The doctors and the nurse were tried in the first war crimes trials and hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q.</span> <span id="s54">What kind of people did you find in that institution?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. Mostly Polish and Russians from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s56">Mostly peasants who had been brought to work in the factory or the field.</span> <span id="s57">I have some pictures from Hadamar.</span> <span id="s58">The first is of the institution itself.</span> <span id="s59">The next is of the graveyard which held 20,000 bodies.</span> <span id="s60">Here is one of him[??]</span> <span id="s61">doing an autopsy.</span> <span id="s62">I have a picture of the courtroom.</span> <span id="s63">The German defense attorney was questioning a witness at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q.</span> <span id="s65">You then went on the Nordhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s67">It was located in central Germany.</span> <span id="s68">It was one camp in a series of fifty camps that were scattered throughout the mountains.</span> <span id="s69">The Germans had dug tunnels into the mountains.</span> <span id="s70">Each was about a mile and a half long and filled with American machine tools.</span> <span id="s71">They were being used to produce V-bombs.</span> <span id="s72">The camp was at the mouth of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s73">They had a practice at the camp to hang someone from a crane over the people that were working in order to spur them on to work a little harder.</span> <span id="s74">And they had a crematorium.</span> <span id="s75">They had a prison inside the prison for those who broke the rules.</span> <span id="s76">They destroyed many thousands of people at Nordhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q. Was this a secret installation at which advanced research took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s79">Workers came in from all over.</span> <span id="s80">Nordhausen was the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q.</span> <span id="s82">At what time did you come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A. Just as it was captured.</span> <span id="s84">It was a secret camp.</span> <span id="s85">The American army didn't know about the camp or the tunnels.</span> <span id="s86">There were about three thousand dead concentration camp victims when we came in.</span> <span id="s87">We captured the camp with the 69th division.</span> <span id="s88">The general put the three thousand bodies in a field and made his soldiers march through them.</span> <span id="s89">That unit was the one that finally met up with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q.</span> <span id="s91">How would you characterize the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A.</span> <span id="s93">It was a concentration camp in which the people that were there were in charge of making V-bombs.</span> <span id="s94">What made it a concentration camp was that those who could not work fully were killed right there.</span> <span id="s95">The volume of people they destroyed can be judged by the fact that they had crematoriums which were constantly working.</span> <span id="s96">They could cremate fifteen people at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q.</span> <span id="s98">What inmates did you find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A. Mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s100">But there were political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q.</span> <span id="s102">How many did you find when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A. 25-30,000.</span> <span id="s104">Mostly middle age and younger people, some teenagers and a few children.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q.</span> <span id="s106">What did the prisoners do when they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A. Just before we overran the town, it was bombed.</span> <span id="s108">The German soldiers ran away.</span> <span id="s109">The prisoners ran away after that.</span> <span id="s110">And they ran all over the place.</span> <span id="s111">The town , the hills, the woods.</span> <span id="s112">Those that couldn't run were the only ones who remained.</span> <span id="s113">When they saw us they were overjoyed but they were incapable of movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q. Was care and food provided?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A. Yes, obviously.</span> <span id="s116">We immediately provided care.</span> <span id="s117">We captured a number of doctors and made them care for the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q.</span> <span id="s119">Did you speak with prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A. Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q.</span> <span id="s122">What language?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A.

Testimony from inmates.</span> <span id="s129">We collected tooth charts from the guards.</span> <span id="s130">We picked up administration records.</span> <span id="s131">Photos of those in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q.</span> <span id="s133">Did you speak with German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s135">they were from very small towns.</span> <span id="s136">In all cases they said they didn't know what went on in the camps.</span> <span id="s137">What was the reaction of the soldiers?</span> <span id="s138">There were bodies in the crematorium at the time we got there.</span> <span id="s139">They did not have time to burn them.</span> <span id="s140">The reaction was a strong one.</span> <span id="s141">Some got angry.</span> <span id="s142">Some got sick.</span> <span id="s143">They wanted to defeat the people who had done this.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q. Would you show this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A. Yes............</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q.</span> <span id="s147">How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A.</span> <span id="s149">About a month.</span> <span id="s150">We were not far from Leipzig.</span> <span id="s151">We were told of an atrocity in Leipzig so we went to investigate it.</span> <span id="s152">There were three hundred and fifty French prisoners there and when the Germans realized we were coming they poured gas on the barracks and burned it.</span> <span id="s153">Then they set up machine guns and shot anyone who tried to escape.</span> <span id="s154">[Shows pictures…] This guy [in picture] was trying to crawl under the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s155">He was a professor.</span> <span id="s156">They recognized him from his glasses and his crutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q.</span> <span id="s158">Why did the Nazis want to destroy French civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A. Well, one of the things that was typical was the people in the camps feeling guilty.</span> <span id="s160">They were concerned that somebody would testify against them.</span> <span id="s161">The only way to avoid that is to get rid of evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q.</span> <span id="s163">Did you find a crematorium there?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A. No.</span> <span id="s165">No SS.</span> <span id="s166">It was strictly a camp for political prisoners to work in an aircraft factory.</span> <span id="s167">There was barbed wire all over the place.</span> <span id="s168">In this case it was not electrified.</span> <span id="s169">Nordhausen had been electrified.</span> <span id="s170">It was taken out by American bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q. Your investigation took you to other area?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s173">One of the places we went to was [Zeitz].</span> <span id="s174">At Zeitz there was a transport from Buchenwald that was taking people to the east.</span> <span id="s175">It got caught up in the advance of the American troops.</span> <span id="s176">The SS realized that the Americans were coming.</span> <span id="s177">So, they poured gasoline over the railroad cars and buried them, Germans civilians saw what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q.</span> <span id="s179">When you came upon the burnt cars was there any evidence you could collect?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s181">The Germans had put lime on them to get rid of the odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q. Could you tell it was headed for Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A.</span> <span id="s184">It was signed Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q.</span> <span id="s186">Did you get to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s188">A couple of times.</span> <span id="s189">[Shows pictures] Most of the people killed at Buchenwald were Jewish.</span> <span id="s190">[Picture] The people there put up crosses over the ovens as a memorial.</span> <span id="s191">Some of the crosses were made of bones.</span> <span id="s192">[Picture] Here you can see the remains still in the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q. And you found inmates there?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s195">They were still there.</span> <span id="s196">This was on about the 16th or the 17th.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q.</span> <span id="s198">Did you speak with inmates there?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A. No.</span> <span id="s200">We just went there to follow up on some specific things, then we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q.</span> <span id="s202">Did you notice any particular odor?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q.</span> <span id="s205">What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A. Around the crematorium.</span> <span id="s207">There was a terrible odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q. Human beings being burnt?</span> <span id="s209">Was it only perceptible near the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A.</span> <span id="s211">It wasn't working when we were there, so it was only near the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q. So, you made some other discoveries?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A.</span> <span id="s214">Once we had overrun the camps we concentrated on POW's mostly.</span> <span id="s215">We went to ....., south of Leipzig.</span> <span id="s216">It was similar to Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s217">They were digging tunnels into mountains in order to have a place to build munitions.</span> <span id="s218">Mostly, they were using American prisoners for that.</span> <span id="s219">These were people who were captured early in the war.</span> <span id="s220">The POW's had been mistreated.</span> <span id="s221">We found Red Cross packages that had been unopened.</span> <span id="s222">We found a number of graves where they were shot trying to escape.</span> <span id="s223">It said this on the graves and we knew that it was not necessarily true that they were trying to escape.</span> <span id="s224">They could have been shot because they were recalcitrant as a lesson to other prisoners.</span> <span id="s225">Also, we found that they mixed American dead with those from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s226">There were many thousands in mass graves.</span> <span id="s227">In most cases the cause of death was starvation.</span> <span id="s228">We collected what testimony we could.</span> <span id="s229">When the Americans got close, they got all of the prisoners into trucks and started to move them south.</span> <span id="s230">The fellow who was in charge was a sergeant by the name of Schmidt, and he had a theory that due to dysentery they should not drink water.</span> <span id="s231">We followed the route and we would go into cemeteries along the way and perform autopsies.</span> <span id="s232">We did catch Mr. Schmidt and he was tried by the American authorities.</span> <span id="s233">He was responsible for many American deaths.</span> <span id="s234">The Jews and the Poles were just killed and buried right there.</span> <span id="s235">It was only the American POW's that they felt a little bit concerned about.</span> <span id="s236">We followed Mr. Schmidt and we found his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s237">We put surveillance on her, and he showed up one night, so we picked him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q.</span> <span id="s239">Did you mention that you ran into Mr. Von Braun at Nordhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A.</span> <span id="s241">Mr. Von Braun turned himself in to us at Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s242">He didn't want to be captured by the Russians, so he turned himself in to our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q.</span> <span id="s244">What did you do after you collected evidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A. Several times we went back the SHAEF.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q. Would you tell us what the acronym stands for?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force.</span> <span id="s248">We went back and spent time there.</span> <span id="s249">[3 Or 4 days].</span> <span id="s250">In one instance we did that in June.</span> <span id="s251">The whole province of [Hollay?]</span> <span id="s252">was turned over to the Russians and we still had evidence to gather.</span> <span id="s253">So we went in there on July 4 of 1945.</span> <span id="s254">The Russian moved in on the 5th.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q. Were you still trying to apprehend anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A. No.</span> <span id="s257">That would have been difficult because we don't know what that reaction of the Russians would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q. Was you evidence turned over for use at the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A.</span> <span id="s260">It was turned over for specific use at specific places.</span> <span id="s261">The Nuremberg trials really tried the top people.</span> <span id="s262">One of the people we got was Walter [?????]</span> <span id="s263">, who was the finance minister.</span> <span id="s264">The evidence relevant to him we didn't do because it was of a higher level.</span> <span id="s265">One thing we did was to have a memorial service so the people would at least remember.</span> <span id="s266">[Pictures] The mayor himself was talking and he delivered a Eulogy.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q.</span> <span id="s268">Did the townspeople say they knew what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A.</span> <span id="s270">They knew in terms of the fact that there was a camp.</span> <span id="s271">In this particular case I don't think they knew the details.</span> <span id="s272">You didn't have tens of thousands going in, what you had was a POW camp.</span> <span id="s273">[Picture] -- Here you have ten Americans who had been on this so-called escape.</span> <span id="s274">We had them exhumed and reported to the grave registration service.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q.</span> <span id="s276">How did the unit deal with feelings, etc.</span> <span id="s277">?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A. Well, it depends on who and what.</span> <span id="s279">First of all when you see a great deal of death you are shocked.</span> <span id="s280">Then you get accustomed to it.</span> <span id="s281">You can't be in a perpetual state of shock.</span> <span id="s282">Secondly, when it was people who were not Americans, it didn't mean that much.</span> <span id="s283">The initial reaction was strong but you get used to it.</span> <span id="s284">I'm not talking about myself but the unit.</span> <span id="s285">Being Jewish, my reaction was completely different.</span> <span id="s286">American personnel who had been mistreated were reacted to with anger.</span> <span id="s287">We wanted to destroy the people responsible.</span> <span id="s288">One fellow was a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s289">When he saw Frenchmen he got very emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q.</span> <span id="s291">Why is it important to give testimony now?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A. Because these things that happened were not committed just by those who did it.</span> <span id="s293">But by the people who didn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s294">The only people who weren't guilty were those who in one manner or another did something about.</span> <span id="s295">When we questioned SS guards they thought there was nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s296">It wasn't there own people.</span> <span id="s297">Just like their actions of our war crimes team.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q. Do you feel a need to do something to make sure it doesn't happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s300">But what does one do?</span> <span id="s301">There is not one type of person or one kind of person that can do this.</span> <span id="s302">The French did it.</span> <span id="s303">The Austrians did it.</span> <span id="s304">The Rumanians did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0002 PAGE 6</span></p></body></html>
