Bluma.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer under Nazi control?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, actually, when I was in Theresienstadt, we were in a room, about 38 people, when they took us on the death march from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s33">This was the second death march, the first one was from Kittlitztreben to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s34">We were there for about a week and then I – I went out with the last transport from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s35">I was hiding in the wall and sudden I heard shooting into the wall cause some other people came.</span> <span id="s36">I went out through a window, cut myself, and ran in – outside I shouldn’t get shot and they were already a line – lined up, only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s37">They only asked for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s38">And we walked to Weimar by foot, which it was full glass, probably a half a foot glass from bombing and everything.</span> <span id="s39">And then on cattle train, put us about hundred or 110, I don’t know exactly, on the train.</span> <span id="s40">And people were dying every day, no food, no water, anything.</span> <span id="s41">And we threw out bodies.</span> <span id="s42">But we didn’t have place where to sit or anything.</span> <span id="s43">When it got more roomy and more place, actually took some bodies to make ourselves pillows, and we sat on them.</span> <span id="s44">And on the fourth day they stopped at the station, which they gave us a soup.</span> <span id="s45">And it was pure salt, this probably meant to kill us off, which I threw away right away [indecipherable] the other people don’t eat it.</span> <span id="s46">And on the fifth day they gave us some potatoes, they stopped at the station.</span> <span id="s47">And then came two Russian airplanes, and they started strafing the locomotive.</span> <span id="s48">Every five minutes the two came back.</span> <span id="s49">They were there for about a minute, strafing them.</span> <span id="s50">And on each side of the track were German soldiers also, and the aircraft, and other transports from the other camp.</span> <span id="s51">At that time when I ran down the train, from the train everybody ran, because we were afraid of the bullets from strafing.</span> <span id="s52">From another train came a boy from my city.</span> <span id="s53">He was a young – a young kid about 15 years old, and he was a Pole in the camp, not as a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s54">Says, come on, we’ll be with the Polish people, not as Jews, and you will survive better and we go there, and we have more food there than you do.</span> <span id="s55">And I says no, I will [indecipherable] with the Jewish people, I am going to stay, you can join me.</span> <span id="s56">And we were there a whole night long in the field laying around and the bombs were falling we saw from [indecipherable] everything red, on fire, with heavy bombing from the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s57">And this is the last time I saw that boy, he went back.</span> <span id="s58">In fact, I think they killed the whole transport there, and he got killed too, he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s59">They – several of us got away, but they killed them, because even soldiers, not only the SS, they were looking for us, and we walked all the way til we came to Terezin.</span> <span id="s60">In Terezin we were very hungry, dirty, and I don’t have to tell you the lice and everything, they ate us up alive.</span> <span id="s61">And we waited at Terezin all night long, they didn’t have a place for us.</span> <span id="s62">We slept on the stones there, I remember.</span> <span id="s63">Then we came the morning, they gave us hot coffee, bread, and some cheese.</span> <span id="s64">And right away they – we had to give away our clothing.</span> <span id="s65">We were washed and everything.</span> <span id="s66">They gave me two new shirts, clean white shirts.</span> <span id="s67">This is the first time I put on a shirt in four years.</span> <span id="s68">And nice clothing, and even a pajama, I was shocked.</span> <span id="s69">And we were in the Hamburg caserna(ph).</span> <span id="s70">We were there for a couple days, and people were just dying in the room, sick from typhus.</span> <span id="s71">And I was very scared to be with them.</span> <span id="s72">I knew – I saw what’s happening.</span> <span id="s73">And I jumped down a window, I don’t know if I was sick at that time or something, but something, I jumped out the window and I don’t know how long I was on the feet.</span> <span id="s74">But in the morning I – I have, in sleep like singing Czech songs, partisan songs, and when I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke me up.</span> <span id="s75">He stood with me.</span> <span id="s76">And they gave me some food.</span> <span id="s77">I went back to the – went back to the room there with some other people, we only left 16 people from over 30.</span> <span id="s78">And then I went out, I couldn’t walk because I was only about around 80 pounds, not any more.</span> <span id="s79">And after a day, the entire long day, a guy from our barrack, he was very hefty, he must be the kapo or something, but a healthy guy, he smuggled himself out from Terezin, because it was quarantine, they didn’t let anybody out, there were Czech soldiers staying outside the [indecipherable] because a lot of sickness was going, typhus.</span> <span id="s80">Th-Thousands of people died at that time.</span> <span id="s81">And he came with the wagon, horse and wagon and on the wagon he had wine, cases and cases of wine.</span> <span id="s82">And the Portuguese sardines in golden labels, I remember like now.</span> <span id="s83">And he brought in there thousands and thousands of hundred mark bills, which we didn’t have toilet tissue, was diarrhea a lot, and we put them on a hook, on nails, and we put them in – we didn’t know that the money will ever be good for something, how would we know?</span> <span id="s84">We didn’t have any other paper.</span> <span id="s85">And all I ate is the sardines and the – and the wine drank.</span> <span id="s86">And we didn’t have bread or anything.</span> <span id="s87">And then they told me to go to the doctor.</span> <span id="s88">When I went to the doctor and he says, what have you been eating, that you not even hungry?</span> <span id="s89">First of all, my stomach shrank, we couldn’t eat much.</span> <span id="s90">And he says, you’re pretty lucky, because you could have died from the sardines.</span> <span id="s91">You are lucky that you drank a lot of wine.</span> <span id="s92">The wine, that saved your life.</span> <span id="s93">And they gave us food, right away they brought in food, the same food what the army, the Soviet army took.</span> <span id="s94">And this was the biggest, biggest mistake, because th-they came in with the field kitchen, and they have kraut with bacon in it, meat, and potatoes and everything so fat, and people were dying like flies from the food.</span> <span id="s95">Then I heard when you were liberated by the Americans, they didn’t give you no food, very little, because the stomach shrank, you couldn’t eat anything.</span> <span id="s96">And that’s the reason a lot of people they could survive, died from the food.</span> <span id="s97">And I was very careful.</span> <span id="s98">When he told me you lucky that the wine – and when they gave such a food, all I ate was a little piece meat, not much, and the potatoes.</span> <span id="s99">And a liquid.</span> <span id="s100">They gave milk, this I drank, and – for about a week.</span> <span id="s101">And then th – th-they burned [indecipherable] there because they were full with, you know, vermin and everything.</span> <span id="s102">And dead people were all around.</span> <span id="s103">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did the doctor explain to you why sardines were dangerous and would have been harmful to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, he didn’t explain, he just said that you were lucky, but they tasted so good.</span> <span id="s106">Yeah, and everybody ate them, and we drank a lot of wine.</span> <span id="s107">We didn’t have anything to do, cause we were afraid to go to other barracks there.</span> <span id="s108">They weren’t barracks, but the other buildings, cause this was actually the ghetto, it wasn’t barracks.</span> <span id="s109">And we afraid a lot – I met there some friends, they were sick, from my hometown also.</span> <span id="s110">And a lot of my friends passed away.</span> <span id="s111">And we saw there – there I met a girl from Yugoslavia, she was on a bench sitting, I warmed myself in the sun, and then I met the girl Truwik(ph) from our city, from Dabrowa, they have a store with leather goods, the ver – very fine family and we talked about it.</span> <span id="s112">And then came the – they came for her that she went to Sweden.</span> <span id="s113">She begged me to go with her to Sweden.</span> <span id="s114">And – cause they took young kids there.</span> <span id="s115">And I says no, I’m gonna wait, maybe I find somebody or something.</span> <span id="s116">And I saw there guards, huge guards, they took Germans, the SS and other people, cleaning away the dirts and everything, and we screamed at them, we [indecipherable] but we couldn’t do any other thing, and I was sorry I didn’t kill a couple of them.</span> <span id="s117">But there’s nothing you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: When were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, let me tell you the story what was.</span> <span id="s120">From the Red Cross they came, ask my name, from which city I am, and the information that they took from me, went the same, I think, on the radio in New York.</span> <span id="s121">All over Europe, every night between 10 and one in the morning, they – they called out names who survive, which camp were they at, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s122">So my sister’s husband, Klugman, the one that was the secretary from [indecipherable] he heard on the radio I am alive.</span> <span id="s123">He was in Budapest at that time.</span> <span id="s124">He was with his son, he was in the underground, and – so when they heard me, he went alone, his son, they made up that they’re gonna meet in Prague, and he came to Terezin.</span> <span id="s125">Of course, they wouldn’t let nobody out at that time, but he had his son’s pass, and with this pass they let me out, and he was as a correspondent, because he had papers as a correspondent there.</span> <span id="s126">And he took me out from there, I had only one pair of pants, I took along another shirt what they gave me, and we walked a couple miles to Buchewice(ph) because there was no train at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: When were you liberated?</span> <span id="s128">You know the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I was – I was liberated, was around the sixth or seventh of – of May, or maybe earlier, I will never know the date exact, but appro – approximately this is the time.</span> <span id="s130">Cause don’t forget, I was out, I don’t know how long I was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: You said that they announced on the radio your name –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: – in the camps.</span> <span id="s134">What camps were you in during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Well, I was – first of all, of course in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s136">Then I was in one camp right after they took my parents away, the Jewish community send me to Szczakowa.</span> <span id="s137">This was a leather factory, which we work, we were about 30 men there.</span> <span id="s138">And after it was Judenrein in all Upper Silesia and we got food from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s139">The Juden [indecipherable] send us food.</span> <span id="s140">And when was no more food, about two weeks after Judenrein, the SS came.</span> <span id="s141">Now, the SS came, they took us away from Szczakowa and we were the ones cleaning out the [indecipherable] in Sosnowiec, Chancer(ph) was still there, he was the Juden-Elster(ph) from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s142">And we went there, I remember all the sto – all with people were sleeping and everything.</span> <span id="s143">And one morning before [indecipherable] we came – we went to work, came the SS man Ludwig.</span> <span id="s144">He was the head that they sent all the people to the camps from Silesia and everybody was petrified scared of him because we knew who he was.</span> <span id="s145">He sent my sister to the camp also, and everybody from our city.</span> <span id="s146">And he ask if there is a painter.</span> <span id="s147">And I was doing painting in the ghetto during the war for the Bauleitung.</span> <span id="s148">This is the building company that they send us to work.</span> <span id="s149">I was doing bricklaying and painting a lot and I learned the trade very good in the war, I was very good, young, and I kept my mouth shut, because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s150">I was a young boy, short, and I’m not going to tell him I’m a mechanic, I’m a painter, I was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s151">So one from my city that was with me [indecipherable] his name, said that the Rosen is a painter.</span> <span id="s152">So he came – he came over to me, bist du ein Maler?</span> <span id="s153">Jawohl Oberscharfuehrer, he gave me right away in the face [indecipherable] he knocks me out, all the teeth.</span> <span id="s154">[speaks German here].</span> <span id="s155">Why do you keep your mouth shut?</span> <span id="s156">I am a painter, I said, I am a very good painter, very good.</span> <span id="s157">He puts me on the side.</span> <span id="s158">I didn’t know what he was going to do with me.</span> <span id="s159">Everybody went to work and I stood there for about a half hour.</span> <span id="s160">Then came two SS men with him.</span> <span id="s161">He said, I got three rooms to paint and I give you three days.</span> <span id="s162">And he took out his pistol, tapped me in my head.</span> <span id="s163">He said, if you are not finished in three days, you lived enough.</span> <span id="s164">So I told him, I don’t have no tools, I don’t have no material.</span> <span id="s165">If you allow me to go to Dabrowa where we live, I got some tools that I work in the ghetto and I can [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s166">He says, you don’t need anything, you get everything.</span> <span id="s167">So the – the two SS men took me, I walk with them through Sosnowiec, this was in Sosnowiec and while you walking on the street, I noticed a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s168">Blonde hair, beautiful girl, I knew her.</span> <span id="s169">And she passed by so fast, and – and I looked away that I didn’t want to pay attention where that she should get caught or something.</span> <span id="s170">But she walked by.</span> <span id="s171">Then we went into a hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I have to just check the equipment for one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Okay, we’re back, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Okay, after –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You were telling me about the –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: – after I worked by –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: – I asked you about the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah, after I worked by him, and I was working there for about four weeks, so he said, well, Maler, you are not going to Auschwitz, which I didn’t know what Auschwitz meant at all.</span> <span id="s181">At that time we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s182">And he said, but I send you to a camp.</span> <span id="s183">And he brought me food every day.</span> <span id="s184">So I ask him, is it possible you send me to a camp where my sister is, I don’t have nobody from my family, just a sister.</span> <span id="s185">He says, where is she?</span> <span id="s186">I said, she is in Gruenberg, Lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s187">He says well, this is a women’s camp.</span> <span id="s188">And then he stood for a second [indecipherable] that you will go there.</span> <span id="s189">But meanwhile you go to another camp, a transition, which I went to Annaburg, and this was around October we went to Annaburg.</span> <span id="s190">There was no work there, but the transition beating every day.</span> <span id="s191">And from there I was sent – only three people went, Chancer(ph), which was the Juden-Elster from – from Dulac(ph) and Sosnowiec, and Herta(ph) Goldfinger, which it was his sweetheart.</span> <span id="s192">She was – she went over to Christianity, but still she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s193">They send her and she became Juden-Eltesten(ph) for the women in the camp, and by myself.</span> <span id="s194">I came there, it was about October in ’43, and there were already some people there, men there, and I walked there in the [indecipherable] where they make [indecipherable] and the first [indecipherable] arrived, he let me in to see my sister, the Juden-Elster, because you got to go through the women’s barrack, the women’s hall and the men went with the [indecipherable] every day, and I went to see her every day and I saw my sister every day in camp.</span> <span id="s195">And there we were til about March 1944.</span> <span id="s196">The SS came for us because there was – the men couldn’t be any more with the women, it became not a labor camp, forced labor camp, but a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s197">And we were sent to Kittlitztreben.</span> <span id="s198">Was a subcamp from Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s199">It was hell there because the – the barracks were still not heated, no water, anything.</span> <span id="s200">And from there we were til February fifth.</span> <span id="s201">When the Russians came near, we marched out on foot and this was the first death march, of which in previous tape I told my story.</span> <span id="s202">And we arrived sometimes in April to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s203">And Buchenwald was hell too, with all the dead people around everywhere and mountains of people, which I saw cannibalism for the first time.</span> <span id="s204">And on the heap of the dead bodies were still some live people half dead, one of them was Meyer Hysharik(ph).</span> <span id="s205">He was a German Jew, but they chased him out.</span> <span id="s206">He was in our city and I used to play [indecipherable] ping-pong with him in the Maccabee quarters.</span> <span id="s207">And he asked me, don’t you recognize me?</span> <span id="s208">I am Meyer.</span> <span id="s209">He says I knew – but at that time when I saw the other people cutting thing, and I start screaming at them.</span> <span id="s210">So they ran to me and I ran away.</span> <span id="s211">And then we heard that the American army came close by and they start to taking out only Jewish people, they called for Jewish people first, which was, I was hiding in the wall, I told the story.</span> <span id="s212">And then we went to Weimar by trains and this was the second death march to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s213">Theresienstadt I arrived toward the end of April, must be the 25th or 26th.</span> <span id="s214">This is the date.</span> <span id="s215">And I was liberated in May, either the sixth or the seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: When you were liberated, tell me, what did you look like, and what was the state of your health?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, the state of my health wasn’t bad, because all during – all during my being in camp, I kept myself clean as can be.</span> <span id="s218">This was the most important thing, not the food as much, but not to run after food to get beaten over a – a pea, on the death march, on a stomped cigarette like people got out and got beaten bloody, that’s how they died.</span> <span id="s219">I kept away from this.</span> <span id="s220">I was with a couple people, friends from camp, from Gruenberg.</span> <span id="s221">We kept ourselves clean, neat, we shaved, everything.</span> <span id="s222">And I would say I wasn’t very hungry, but I wasn’t sick, I didn’t have no diarrhea like all the other people.</span> <span id="s223">I was watching myself, I was sometimes with – two weeks without food.</span> <span id="s224">But the will to live and the will to live is on the death march because I have the pictures from my home.</span> <span id="s225">That’s what kept me alive.</span> <span id="s226">Of tor – course I lost them the last day in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s227">And what I wanted to live is, I wanted to see, particularly some of my friends, and especially when I met a young girl in Sosnowiec, and I was hoping I can meet her.</span> <span id="s228">That’s was the will to live, to see my family and this, and that’s what kept me alive.</span> <span id="s229">And I wasn't thinking about food never, but just to take [indecipherable] I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s230">And that’s, I think, that I lived through the war.</span> <span id="s231">And then, as I told you, my sister’s husband came and took me out, and this was sometimes in May around, I would say around the 14 or the 15th of May.</span> <span id="s232">And we walked through [indecipherable] there was a train didn’t go this way, so we went the first time – day in hotel.</span> <span id="s233">And we had there a dinner.</span> <span id="s234">Of course, they didn’t have meat, but nice potatoes with the soup, and this is the first time that I ate like a person, with a tablecloth and with a real fork and s – and spoon.</span> <span id="s235">The first time that I cried, and I says it couldn't happen.</span> <span id="s236">And when I came to the room, the bed was all white linens, I couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s237">And I took a shower there, went to bed.</span> <span id="s238">And the next morning we got up early, and we waited for the train.</span> <span id="s239">On the train was no place, so we walked up on the roof from the train, my brother-in-law, myself.</span> <span id="s240">We held onto each other, a lot of people were there.</span> <span id="s241">We came to Prague.</span> <span id="s242">We came to Prague, the first thing when we got off the train, we saw on the street in every corner was the kiosk with food, because a lot of people, a lot of people came out from the camps hungry.</span> <span id="s243">So every corner was a heart, a red heart and the ches – [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s244">And you have sandwiches, donuts, milk, coffee, tea.</span> <span id="s245">And then they told us noontime we should go there and there, we get food.</span> <span id="s246">So we had soups, and they gave us meat.</span> <span id="s247">They were so nice, that’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s248">I – I just couldn’t – couldn’t think that anybody would be so nice, especially to Jewish people, they know we Jewish.</span> <span id="s249">Then after – after being there about two days in the hotel, was about two – about two or three in the morning, suddenly I wake up it was such a thing, about a hundred Polish women came in to the hotel to sleep.</span> <span id="s250">And they were offniks(ph), and [indecipherable] they were good – they were workers from the fields and everything.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t think so they were from camps.</span> <span id="s252">And they jumped out of my bunk of my bed.</span> <span id="s253">My [indecipherable] I jump down, they grab me by the thing, and in Polish, rough language, where do you think you go?</span> <span id="s254">You stay right here.</span> <span id="s255">But I – they threw my shirt, I jumped down, my brother-in-law jumped down, right?</span> <span id="s256">Cause they were awful.</span> <span id="s257">They – they didn’t have men for a long time, this was their desire.</span> <span id="s258">And at that time I didn’t think of women.</span> <span id="s259">So I jumped down and went to the bathroom to wash up, and in the bathroom comes a young – a young gentleman, was about 18 years and I think – he ask me if I can loan the cup he wants to wash his teeth.</span> <span id="s260">And I look at him a red hair – a redhead and the way how he spoke Polish, so I -- [indecipherable] do I ask, are you Monek(ph)?</span> <span id="s261">He jumped to me and kissed me.</span> <span id="s262">This was my brother-in-law’s son from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s263">And I knew he’s coming and when – when I saw a redhead.</span> <span id="s264">And so we [indecipherable] went back, and then I said okay, I want to go back to Poland and see if anybody’s alive.</span> <span id="s265">My brother-in-law said, okay, I’m here, we are going to meet up.</span> <span id="s266">What happened, they gave me money, they gave me ticket from the Czech people.</span> <span id="s267">I come to the train, the train arrive from Katowice.</span> <span id="s268">Train arrive, a lot of Jews came out, guys.</span> <span id="s269">I ask them where you going?</span> <span id="s270">He says, we just came from there.</span> <span id="s271">I told him I want to go to Poland, he says, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s272">He says, we just had to give a couple bottles vodka to the Russian guards that they should let us out from there.</span> <span id="s273">You are not safe there.</span> <span id="s274">They kill people [indecipherable] people, nobody’s safe.</span> <span id="s275">So I turn back and went to saw my brother.</span> <span id="s276">He says, I had enough, he says, I don’t like the Russians.</span> <span id="s277">They are not any better than – I says, but they liberated us.</span> <span id="s278">He says, I don’t like the communists.</span> <span id="s279">We are going to go over to the American side, because the Americans were occupying part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s280">And from there we have a chance to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s281">That’s was te – okay, we packed his son and myself and we went on the train and he told me, by the way, when the guards will come, the American guards or something, don’t tell them you from Poland because they take you off and they go and ship you to Poland.</span> <span id="s282">Tell them you a German Jew, and you going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s283">We wanted to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s284">Okay, when came to the border, the Russian guards went off, the American [indecipherable] came in for passes.</span> <span id="s285">You know, passport because we crossed the border.</span> <span id="s286">Didn’t have anything and he ask.</span> <span id="s287">As he ask where I’m going I tell them I’m from Germany, I’m going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s288">So my nephew started talking to him English, in a perfect English and the same thing my brother.</span> <span id="s289">So they ask how do you know such a good English?</span> <span id="s290">In fact, they used to have a French maid at home that she spoke to them only French and English instead of Polish, and he knew very well.</span> <span id="s291">So they took them off from the train, who they are, and he says you go, I find you.</span> <span id="s292">So I went by myself and arrived about 12 o’clock at night in Pilsner.</span> <span id="s293">When I got out from the station there were American soldiers sleeping on the ground with their sleeping bags and blankets.</span> <span id="s294">It was cold.</span> <span id="s295">A May day at night is very cold in Europe.</span> <span id="s296">And I was only dressed in a shirt and a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s297">So I lay down between them, kept pulling the blanket.</span> <span id="s298">They kept pulling back and I kept telling th – pull them to me.</span> <span id="s299">Finally I fell asleep, I don’t know, when I woke up it was about 11 in the morning.</span> <span id="s300">Nobody was there ex-except me on the cement.</span> <span id="s301">I got up hungry and cold.</span> <span id="s302">Where do I go?</span> <span id="s303">I go first to the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: We have to pause so I can change the tape.</span> <span id="s305">Just one – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: – camp and survive it, and I am from Poland, Polish.</span> <span id="s307">The first thing they told me, don’t ever say you’re Polish, because they hated the Poles, because in ’38 when the German army entered Sudetenland, [indecipherable] the Poles went to [indecipherable], they occupied part of Czech Republic.</span> <span id="s308">And they hated the Poles.</span> <span id="s309">Just tell them you were Jewish from Poland, otherwise you won’t get anything and they are very angry, you might even get beaten up.</span> <span id="s310">They were angry at the Poles.</span> <span id="s311">And then he tole – he gave me five kroner, food, cigarettes.</span> <span id="s312">And he told me, if you join the communist party, you get double money and everything double.</span> <span id="s313">So I thought, for being in the party, what can it hurt?</span> <span id="s314">I get double money, better treatment – they would treat me better.</span> <span id="s315">He gave me right away to put on a thing that I belong to the communist party and he gave me right away 10 kroner, they put me up where to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s316">But the boy scouts – the boy scouts had a nice quarters, they gave me food, I showered, cigarettes.</span> <span id="s317">And I ask, is there Jewish people, cause I want to be with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s318">No, there were no Jewish people they thought.</span> <span id="s319">So I said, I’m going to go further.</span> <span id="s320">I go further, another place, I went to the police – all I went to the police there, I showed up, I told them I’m from the communist party, also a member, and they gave me food.</span> <span id="s321">Again, I ask them for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s322">I came to a third town, I think it was Fawlen(ph) and so I ask them, they said yeah, there’s Jewish people, girls, in Starachowice in the hospital.</span> <span id="s323">And I couldn’t wait til – to meet them.</span> <span id="s324">The first thing to meet Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s325">I came to Starachowice, and this was mostly by foot going, all the bo – the scouts, they took me by Jeep.</span> <span id="s326">They all time were nice, they took me from one city to other with their Jeeps.</span> <span id="s327">I came into the hospital, they told me yeah, there’s four Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s328">They wouldn’t give me the name.</span> <span id="s329">They’re all sick on typhus, you can’t go in to see them.</span> <span id="s330">It’s quarantine, they wouldn’t give me no information.</span> <span id="s331">I was so angry, here are all the four girls, tell me who they are, where they are.</span> <span id="s332">Can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s333">Walking out from the hospital, and looking around the buildings, somebody screamed in Polish, Moniek, Moniek, it was [indecipherable] don’t you recognize me?</span> <span id="s334">I am Bella(ph) Sigilla(ph).</span> <span id="s335">And she is from my city.</span> <span id="s336">And she was in Gruenberg, which I was with her in Gruenberg.</span> <span id="s337">So I – we cried both, and I asked her, can you tell me about my sister Bluma?</span> <span id="s338">She was with you in the camp, everything.</span> <span id="s339">So she said she was on the death march and she escaped.</span> <span id="s340">She saw when she escaped, they were shooting at the head, but I don’t know if she fell dead or not, I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s341">But if you want to know more about it, th-the transport in Volvalla(ph), which it’s in Volary, in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s342">There you will find, because the rest of the transport are there, we are here, four girls sick from typhus.</span> <span id="s343">So, I picked some field flowers, you know, in the field, they were coming out spring, I put a bouquet and I send it in to her, the flowers.</span> <span id="s344">And I walked away, I stopped there by people, they gave me food and I couldn’t wait.</span> <span id="s345">I walked 12 hours without interruption, just to see – to come with – with the ha – where the Jewish girls are.</span> <span id="s346">It took me two days to go there by foot mostly.</span> <span id="s347">I came to Vallin(ph), I came to the police, can you tell me – I heard there are Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s348">They took a policeman, he took me over [indecipherable] and he showed me this is the hospital, go in.</span> <span id="s349">Okay.</span> <span id="s350">As I came into the hospital I opened the door.</span> <span id="s351">On the top on the steps – were about 14 or 15 steps, girls t – a historical scream, Moniek, so hysterical.</span> <span id="s352">And happened to be the sister of my best friend Sheps(ph) Sheva(ph) Sheps(ph).</span> <span id="s353">She jumped down all the steps and we both fell to the wall, she would have killed me, both fell on the ground, and start screaming, right, that all the girls, that they were able to walk, because don’t forget, they were very sick, came down running and most of them I knew from camp, and most of them from my city also, because they took to Gruenberg, 450 Jewish girls sent to this camp, my sister included.</span> <span id="s354">And that Sheva(ph) told me right away that her sister died, we talked there and I met all the other girls, she took me to the cemetery, showed me where her sister is buried, that she died two days after the liberation here, and some other girls that I knew that they’re buried there, with a little note there written about her sister.</span> <span id="s355">And there were 45 graves there.</span> <span id="s356">They were buried in the field next to the Gentile cemetery, Catholic cemetery.</span> <span id="s357">They couldn’t bury them because Jewish people, so they were in the field buried, and with little sticks, you know, who they are, that’s all.</span> <span id="s358">And I came there, was there a chaplain, a Jewish chaplain from the army.</span> <span id="s359">His name was Jakov(ph) Katzman(ph), yes, and he gave me right away a job, you are going to work.</span> <span id="s360">So, he says, since you don’t know English, he spoke to me Yiddish, I have there in the hospital there – it wasn’t a hospital, just sol – you know, with a couple doctors for the army, army doctors.</span> <span id="s361">And to clean off there and help along, give him this and that.</span> <span id="s362">And he gave somebody a needle, and I fainted, because I saw blood.</span> <span id="s363">Here I was sleep on dead bodies, here I saw a little blood and I fainted.</span> <span id="s364">And then I stood there [indecipherable] he gave another one a needle, cause they gave inoculation, I faint again, so I went out.</span> <span id="s365">I told the chaplain I can’t work there, fainting all the time I see blood.</span> <span id="s366">So he gave me a job to the officers’ kitchen, which I help clean pots and pans, help in baking pies.</span> <span id="s367">And when I saw the meats, what they cut away the fat, meat and everything, I says why, this the best, they throw this away?</span> <span id="s368">The big cans that we filled them, filling from the pies they threw away.</span> <span id="s369">I says, what are you doing, my God [indecipherable] food.</span> <span id="s370">And on the next day I started stealing oranges.</span> <span id="s371">I saw, and I saw food, I put in my pants, I bind around for the girls – to bring to that hospital for the girls [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s372">So as I walked around [indecipherable] there, one of the officers come over, what do you have there?</span> <span id="s373">So I was really, you know, scared and this, and don’t be scared, what do you have there?</span> <span id="s374">I said, it’s not for me, you know I’m not hungry, I eat here all the food.</span> <span id="s375">It’s for the sick girls in the hospital.</span> <span id="s376">Take this – everything out here.</span> <span id="s377">Come with me.</span> <span id="s378">He took me on a Jeep, he took me to the American PX.</span> <span id="s379">He took a big sack, he put in – what you like from here?</span> <span id="s380">He put in chocolate, he put in soap, he put in toothpicks.</span> <span id="s381">He took a – he says, don’t you steal, you come to me every time.</span> <span id="s382">We know girls, we know about them, we help them.</span> <span id="s383">Anytime come to me and I give you plenty.</span> <span id="s384">And he gave me chocolates.</span> <span id="s385">And I have the nice experience, because on the third floor in the hospital was a very sick girl.</span> <span id="s386">And there were four sisters.</span> <span id="s387">They were the best friends of my sister in camp in Gruenberg.</span> <span id="s388">They were German girls.</span> <span id="s389">And they were with her, and I brought them chocolates and oranges every day and more.</span> <span id="s390">But what’s coincident – I want to interrupt, which it’s going to come later, that this is the Ebi(ph) sisters.</span> <span id="s391">She died late, late in September.</span> <span id="s392">When no more girls were there they took us out from there, they couldn’t – so they remained there, and she died there, she is buried in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s393">And I gave a talk before going for the 50th anniversary to Volary, with survivors from the hospital we came for a gathering there.</span> <span id="s394">I gave a talk on the synagogue, and I gave a talk a – by the end of [indecipherable] I told them I’m going to Volary for the 50th anniversary, I’m invited by the mayor of the city since I was there in the hospital with those girls, I was the only boy between 120 girls, and I am going back there.</span> <span id="s395">Suddenly I hear bursting out to cry, a young lady start to cry.</span> <span id="s396">So I walked over to her and I says, why are you crying?</span> <span id="s397">She says, my mother’s sister died there.</span> <span id="s398">So – and she told me the story, and she told me who were they and this and this and this, how old.</span> <span id="s399">So when I came home, was 10:30 at night, I called up Suzanna Budzelis(ph), she worked with me in the archives in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s400">I said, Suzanna, can you tell me the names of the girls, if you have anything?</span> <span id="s401">Oh yeah, they were three sisters, everything, they – th-th – this and this – they – they [indecipherable] on this, and I called up 12 o’clock this woman, she is the wife of a rabbi.</span> <span id="s402">I don’t know, they were younger.</span> <span id="s403">I says, look, they registered older to be safe, not to send them to the crematorium but to a war.</span> <span id="s404">And we became good friends.</span> <span id="s405">But when I came back from Volary, I brought the pictures of the grave and I gave her the pictures.</span> <span id="s406">And then she told me her aunt lives in New York, another aunt.</span> <span id="s407">So I took the number, I called her up.</span> <span id="s408">I says – I called up, she didn’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s409">I says, so you don’t remember I came there?</span> <span id="s410">You were there?</span> <span id="s411">I was the only boy.</span> <span id="s412">I says, the only boy what was there, his name was Moniek.</span> <span id="s413">I told her Morris, that’s why she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s414">And he brought me chocolate for – for us every day with oranges, yes, that’s me.</span> <span id="s415">And she burst out crying.</span> <span id="s416">And we became the best friends that all the time she calls me, every holiday.</span> <span id="s417">Well, I’m going to continue.</span> <span id="s418">We were there for not too long, about eight weeks.</span> <span id="s419">A lot of the girls went back home, one of the girls [indecipherable] we go back to Poland [indecipherable] which I liked it, I didn – no, I’m going to stay.</span> <span id="s420">So one of the girls, Regina Chepelska(ph), she is from Sosnowiec, says Moniek, let’s go somewhere, we all the time here, let’s go visit other cities.</span> <span id="s421">Okay.</span> <span id="s422">We went on the train and we came to Zvolin(ph), a city.</span> <span id="s423">The train wouldn’t go no further because it was demolish, you know, the railroad tracks have a thing, stopped here and we had to walk.</span> <span id="s424">And this was about one o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s425">And we didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s426">We asked somebody where can we go to sleep over, an hotel or something, and it was the motorman from the train.</span> <span id="s427">He had the bike, he ro – he took her – since she was a young girl we told them we were brother and sister, cause we were afraid, we are from camp.</span> <span id="s428">He took her on the bike, he walked with them, we walked for about five kilometers.</span> <span id="s429">We arrived about – after two in the morning.</span> <span id="s430">He woke up a 80 year old mother, he woke up, make some fire and some food, they are from camp, they are hungry, you got to give them food.</span> <span id="s431">We were shocked.</span> <span id="s432">So first of all she got up, made fire and put up for a soup.</span> <span id="s433">And she made the heavy – where you wash clothing, you know, you laundry.</span> <span id="s434">You put hot water in the laundry, wash yourself, yeah.</span> <span id="s435">We washed ourselves, gave clean towels, everything.</span> <span id="s436">We sat down at the table with a tablecloth, gave us soup, and then she gave us a room with beds, we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s437">In the morning he said he wanted to adopt.</span> <span id="s438">He was a bachelor and no kids, no nothing, he wanted to adopt her.</span> <span id="s439">And to – with me, he says, you are going to be here and he took me right away, what do you know, what kind pro-professionally.</span> <span id="s440">I said, well, I was painting at camp, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s441">Good.</span> <span id="s442">He took me to a factory where they make toys and I painted toys, designs and everything what was outlined, painted in different colors.</span> <span id="s443">I was there for three days and she – and he gave me a room in a hotel which – enough money to pay, I made enough money to pay, it wasn’t too expensive.</span> <span id="s444">And she was behind there, he wanted to adopt her.</span> <span id="s445">I says, Regina, I’m going back somewhere, because I met someone, another Jewish guy there, we are going to go.</span> <span id="s446">Okay, we will meet up.</span> <span id="s447">So I said goodbye to her and I went back to Volary.</span> <span id="s448">She came back two days later.</span> <span id="s449">I asked the Rabbi Katzner(ph) to check, I says, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s450">Can you find out about the Jewish girls, Bella(ph) Sigler(ph) and the others?</span> <span id="s451">I told [indecipherable] they are from this transport, they [indecipherable] in the hospital.</span> <span id="s452">He says, I go today.</span> <span id="s453">He came back a couple hours later, all four died.</span> <span id="s454">All four girls died from typhus.</span> <span id="s455">And I was very sad about it.</span> <span id="s456">And then my brother-in-law came, he found me.</span> <span id="s457">He says, I told you I’m going to find you.</span> <span id="s458">We were there for days, he went [indecipherable] you stay with them, I’m going to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s459">Couple days later came a order that they have to leave the – that the Russian army is going to take over Volary, and the Germa – and the American army had to evacuate.</span> <span id="s460">So the army, the American army came with three trucks, they took us by trucks to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s461">We arrived there because there was already men, the women separate to the Riedenburg caserna(ph), and the girls didn’t want to even know, Moniek is going to stay with us.</span> <span id="s462">He is to with us in the same – in the same room, slept there and everything.</span> <span id="s463">They made a curtain just for me to sleep.</span> <span id="s464">We won’t go in without Moniek.</span> <span id="s465">So I was there for two days with them and I says no, it’s no use, I have to go where the men sleep, I can’t be with you.</span> <span id="s466">But we became very close.</span> <span id="s467">We – particularly we – about eight girls and me, which consider like brother, sister.</span> <span id="s468">That’s how we loved each other, not as boy - girl.</span> <span id="s469">You know, two of them were from my city, one was an – one of the youngest girls, I won’t mention the name, you know, in case they don’t like it, I don’t know if I should or not.</span> <span id="s470">I can tell the names, one was Rozia(ph) Szalinga(ph) from Tarnów, Lidi(ph) Zilbigger(ph) from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s471">Was Halinka(ph) Goldberg, she was from Czestochowa, [indecipherable] from Benzburg(ph), Halla(ph) Malnavitsa from Dabrowa.</span> <span id="s472">Cheva(ph) Chet(ph) from Dabrowa [indecipherable] what the sister died there, and my best – my best friend’s sister, to our – we held ourself very close.</span> <span id="s473">And we were – then they transported over to New Palestine.</span> <span id="s474">We had the [indecipherable] we were in the DP camp New Palestine, Salzburg.</span> <span id="s475">And sudden they ask me can they go, we are going for dances, they all time ask me can we go, come along.</span> <span id="s476">So I went with them and we went to Ebensee and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s477">There were some survivors from other camps, from Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s478">So we went there because they have dances, I went there with them.</span> <span id="s479">We had a good time, we came back.</span> <span id="s480">As I came back, somebody told me, your brother’s here.</span> <span id="s481">That I found my younger brother, Josef.</span> <span id="s482">He came from hunger – from Budapest.</span> <span id="s483">He was with another guy from my city and woke him up during the night, I couldn’t recognize him, cause he was all kinds of skinny.</span> <span id="s484">He was blown up.</span> <span id="s485">[indecipherable] can be very blown up from all the soups they ate [indecipherable] everything, you know, from camp.</span> <span id="s486">He was in Auschwitz and then Gintagruber(ph) and the death march.</span> <span id="s487">He was liberated in fact, the 11th of May, two days after the war.</span> <span id="s488">They found him there with the SS wandering.</span> <span id="s489">And for over a thousand people there were only 14 that remained alive.</span> <span id="s490">My older brother, Srulek(ph) and him.</span> <span id="s491">And you can imagine how happy and everything.</span> <span id="s492">Then about a week later came my best friend what I told you the [indecipherable] he was in Bergen-Belsen, he came pi – to pick up his sister [indecipherable] he is alive.</span> <span id="s493">And I was there til ’46.</span> <span id="s494">In ’46 I had the – the – my sister, my older sister Ruchcia, which she escape to the Soviet Union from the ghetto out.</span> <span id="s495">She’s in Regensburg, so I went there to Regensburg, I saw her and I said, let’s go move to Vidin(ph), I should go over there and come.</span> <span id="s496">So we [indecipherable] Salzburg, we smuggled ourselves to the border.</span> <span id="s497">And I forgot to tell you that in my room in Salzburg, I have three rooms, and I was with my brother and another guy that worked in the kitchen, from the UNRRA kitchen that we had the food in the camp.</span> <span id="s498">And every night I have guests in my room, which they probably half [indecipherable] from Germany to smuggle them over to Italy and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s499">And in fact I went with them twice to the border, to Ironing(ph), Frylass(ph) and [indecipherable], also over some of the people, so it was a transition camp, because I went to sleep by my friends and I gave them the three rooms, food I had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: When were you in the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Was in ’45 and ’46.</span> <span id="s502">And came to Salzburg a young girl with a friend of hers from my city and she told me my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s503">That she know.</span> <span id="s504">Karla Lunda(ph), yeah.</span> <span id="s505">Well, you can imagine, I was there and she went away, she said she is going illegal, she is going with the bubbichar(ph) and we said goodbye, she left me a picture.</span> <span id="s506">About a week later I get a telegram from Poland, from a friend from my sister that they both escape together from the death march.</span> <span id="s507">Back to Gruenberg they went, to German people they went.</span> <span id="s508">And their life, well, that’s all I knew.</span> <span id="s509">This was the telegram which I still have it, and I’m going to give this to the museum.</span> <span id="s510">And when I heard my other sister is alive, so we packed ourself, went to – with a transport to Ulin, to camp also a DP camp in Ulin(ph).</span> <span id="s511">And then we smuggled ourself out from Ulin(ph) because we couldn’t go anything without – from the UNRRA you know what they tell you where to go, this – and we came to [indecipherable] house where my sister was.</span> <span id="s512">And I met my sister, so we got a private room, we lived with my sister together.</span> <span id="s513">Her husband was the president from the Jewish community in Vidin(ph) and we have some volunteers in this museum, they were also invited there.</span> <span id="s514">My friend from my city William Luxembourg, or Helen Luxembourg if you know.</span> <span id="s515">I know them, they were married there and we were good friends there.</span> <span id="s516">And I was there for awhile, then my other sister that escaped what I knew she’s alive.</span> <span id="s517">And what happened why we didn’t see her before, when she ran away, she went with the Russian army to Russia to look for my older sister, she knew she escaped to Russia, looking for her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s518">And then she went back to Danzig with her friend, and then she came – she came to Vidin(ph) which I met her too.</span> <span id="s519">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: How did she know where to find you?</span> <span id="s521">How did you all know how to find each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: How – what happened – don’t forget at that time, wherever you were in a camp, a DP camp, or you met a friend, leave a note that I am alive.</span> <span id="s523">And people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s524">For instance, the girl, Karla Lunda(ph) [indecipherable] Salzburg, she got somebody in Poland let them know that I am in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s525">That’s how I got the telegram.</span> <span id="s526">And my older brother, he was in Prague, he went in fact to pick up my youngest sister, Bluma from Poland, how, he didn’t have anything, you know how it was.</span> <span id="s527">And what I forgot to tell you, a very interesting story in Volary, which I go back.</span> <span id="s528">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s529">I didn’t have no shoes, I still walk around in my wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s530">[indecipherable] So one of the officers, while I walk in the officers’ kitchen, he looked at me, he says, hop into the Jeep, come with me Moniek.</span> <span id="s531">And – where we going?</span> <span id="s532">You will see.</span> <span id="s533">We arrived in [indecipherable], he took me to the station.</span> <span id="s534">He knew that the Czech people threw out all the Germans, the same thing like they did to the Czechs, the Germans from the Sudetenland threw out the Czechs, now they threw out the Germans, and they let them have 10 kilo in their bags, that’s all they were allowed to take.</span> <span id="s535">So we saw there a lot of people with boots and everything.</span> <span id="s536">He goes over to one, a ex-German officer, maybe it was an SS man, take off your boots.</span> <span id="s537">Put them on Moniek.</span> <span id="s538">About on the fifth person, they fit good.</span> <span id="s539">He took my wooden shoes, gave them.</span> <span id="s540">You took away more from him.</span> <span id="s541">He wore this for many years, now you can wear them.</span> <span id="s542">Then he took away the camera from him, with film.</span> <span id="s543">He says, you took away more from him than a camera.</span> <span id="s544">And with this camera I took pictures in the hospital with the girls there.</span> <span id="s545">I took about 80 pictures, I have so much film.</span> <span id="s546">And the historical pictures from the girls laying in the hospital, the girls [indecipherable] which they – now you can see them in the museum, which I gave a whole book fr – just from Volary with my friends being in bed sick, they are now there, these historical pictures.</span> <span id="s547">That’s what I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s548">When we were in Salzburg, I forgot to tell you, I went to see the girls when they went dancing there with their friend.</span> <span id="s549">And going to Barbishel(ph), we stopped in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s550">And another triangle, which the trains divided, one train went to Linz, one the directions that I have to go, and one to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s551">And when I stood there, we went in there to the men’s room, it was outside, they didn’t have no, you know, in the stations.</span> <span id="s552">As I walk out from there, in come there, stood at the train comes a German policeman with me – with a invalid – a POW, a German POW on one foot.</span> <span id="s553">And he said, you took this man’s vallit(ph), which is release papers, a POW, money, everything.</span> <span id="s554">I says, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s555">Well, you just came out there from the toilet, and he was there.</span> <span id="s556">And he wanted to take out everything from pocket and my – my other friend were a big guy.</span> <span id="s557">He says, you are going to tell me what to do?</span> <span id="s558">Damn Nazi, he called him, and he wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s559">So he called the MP.</span> <span id="s560">The MP, come with us.</span> <span id="s561">He took us in a Jeep to the constable, you know.</span> <span id="s562">I come in there, was a officer and a officer at the desk.</span> <span id="s563">Beautiful, tall guy, handsome as can be.</span> <span id="s564">Take out everything from the pockets.</span> <span id="s565">I took out from the pockets.</span> <span id="s566">Why do you have American scrip?</span> <span id="s567">Are you on black market?</span> <span id="s568">I says, I work for the American army and they pay me with scrip and that’s what I have.</span> <span id="s569">He took it away on the side.</span> <span id="s570">Then I have what an American soldier gave me, a Jewish soldier in Volary.</span> <span id="s571">This Yankee division, the Y.</span> <span id="s572">He took this away.</span> <span id="s573">And he saw pictures that I’m with the soldiers, with the girls, the American soldiers, this he left me.</span> <span id="s574">I says, how come you have so many coupons, for bread and this, you know, for ya – I says, it happened to be that I am with eight girls and I do the buying and I do everything for them, and that’s why I have so many coupons here.</span> <span id="s575">Didn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s576">They took us away to a prison.</span> <span id="s577">We come into the prison on third floor, there are Nazis there.</span> <span id="s578">Locked up.</span> <span id="s579">We started banging at the door, what it is.</span> <span id="s580">I says, we just came out from the Nazis and they put us like that.</span> <span id="s581">There were German guards there, by the way [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s582">So they took us on the second floor, who was there?</span> <span id="s583">Prostitutes.</span> <span id="s584">Still better.</span> <span id="s585">Yeah, locked up.</span> <span id="s586">So, we had to sleep in the hall, they don’t have no other place, and we were there three days.</span> <span id="s587">They – I gave them the information that I am in Salzburg, in New Palestine, gave them there everything information.</span> <span id="s588">They took three days to find out who we are and if we are live there, if we tell the truth.</span> <span id="s589">Three days.</span> <span id="s590">After three days with the Jeep they come and they took us back to the – to the station.</span> <span id="s591">There was my stuff he gives me back, but the scrip and the Yankee division [indecipherable] and he give us for the trouble two carton cigarettes.</span> <span id="s592">I took the cigarettes, stepped them down and I spit in his face.</span> <span id="s593">I says, you damn Nazi, you put me with the doxies in camp.</span> <span id="s594">Well, what he’s going to do to me?</span> <span id="s595">And I spit in his face.</span> <span id="s596">And – but this was far to go to the station, wait, if somebody go.</span> <span id="s597">We don’t need your help, you worse than the Nazis – because it’s after the war – and we walked out.</span> <span id="s598">What that incident happen, that coming back from Barbishel(ph), I walked into the same toilet.</span> <span id="s599">I said, let me look.</span> <span id="s600">Maybe he lost that son-of-a-gun there.</span> <span id="s601">And there was a big stall where you stepped on it – you sit on it – to – you know – and I see something sticking out, and it was his portfolio under the stall, he lost it.</span> <span id="s602">I threw it and I didn’t even look anything, I threw it into the toilet right away.</span> <span id="s603">But what’s interesting, that was the first high holidays, Rosh Hashonah in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s604">And they – they took in the [indecipherable] where they have the [indecipherable] there for the American soldiers, the Rainbow division what they called it.</span> <span id="s605">They had services for the high holidays.</span> <span id="s606">So displaced persons came for the high holidays for the first time.</span> <span id="s607">I sit down there – I came with one of the girls, and sit down and I look at that beautiful dressed – that son-of-a-gun that send me to the prison, to the Nazis, that was behind the desk.</span> <span id="s608">And I looked up at him, you Nazi, you in the synagogue?</span> <span id="s609">And I looked at him, and I walked away and went all the way to the back.</span> <span id="s610">He look at me, and I walked over again.</span> <span id="s611">You get out from the synagogue, you Nazi.</span> <span id="s612">He – he didn't answer anything.</span> <span id="s613">They weren’t nice.</span> <span id="s614">That’s that – that’s what hurts still today, that it hurts.</span> <span id="s615">And he didn’t know what to answer.</span> <span id="s616">He probably did his duties, but he should at – understand better, with Jewish prisoners where he sent, and took three days to found.</span> <span id="s617">Well, anyway, I was in Vidin(ph).</span> <span id="s618">Then – then was transports there and there came a gentleman by the name of Haskell(ph) Gansfy(ph), and he came from camp to camp, DP cam-camp, to take people [indecipherable] to go to Palestine, to fight for Israel, to go to Palestine with, you know, wi-with the underground and you’re going to be in Palestine.</span> <span id="s619">So my youngest sister went.</span> <span id="s620">And it happened that she went on the Exodus.</span> <span id="s621">She went with friends and friend she met – the same person Yehaskel(ph) Benzef(ph), wi – they got on board and they were on the Exodus, when – she told me stories, they came to Palestine, they had to go back.</span> <span id="s622">When she came back she was first in Aachen, and from Aachen she came back to Vidin(ph), naked [indecipherable] because when he left we bought her clothing, everything, she only had one dress, that’s all.</span> <span id="s623">We had to buy her everything new again, and she was there – End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: – uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Morris Rosen.</span> <span id="s625">This is tape two, side A, and you were telling me about your sister who had been on the Exodus –</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: – and who’d been returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Please continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: And then she had to go back because they – she got a note that she got to come back because there was hope that they’re gonna go to Palestine, evident, so we bought her new clothing, everything and she went back and in fact they went – they were the first ones, because from the Exodus people had priority even from Cyprus, that they went first.</span> <span id="s631">And she met her husband there on the ship, which they got married, they went to Palestine, and of course he went right away to war there when he arrived, cause he was a officer in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s632">And then my o – when Israel became a state, my other sister, Mrs. Beilauer(ph) which [indecipherable] name was, and he left Vidin(ph), he was the president from the Jewish community, he left Vidin(ph) and I have pictures of course, how with flowers the whole community there send her off, and they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s633">And then I heard news that a good friend of mine lived with me in Vidin(ph), he was Shlamik(ph) Merin(ph) from Benzburg(ph) [indecipherable] that when he went illegal to Palestine through Marseilles, and he – he got off the ship, in the first [indecipherable] he didn’t even see anything of Israel that he got killed.</span> <span id="s634">They send him toward Jerusalem, he didn’t even see his – anything.</span> <span id="s635">And I still have the death announcement from the paper, from the Jewish paper, I still have it at home.</span> <span id="s636">And so we supposed to go also to Israel, Palestine.</span> <span id="s637">So my brother said, look here, we lived through a war.</span> <span id="s638">We lost so much from our family.</span> <span id="s639">We have two aunts in New York, my father’s sisters.</span> <span id="s640">If we go to Palestine, we can’t go to America later.</span> <span id="s641">If we in America we can all time go – time go to Israel.</span> <span id="s642">So we decided we are going to go wait out, and we got affidavits from my aunts, and with the help from the HIAS, we came to Bremen, it was October, this was two days before Rosh Hashonah.</span> <span id="s643">We came to New York, and what happened, we have to get inoculation against all kind diseases, everything.</span> <span id="s644">And since I was all the time fainting from the needle and everything, all in my possession I have this 50 dollar, that’s all what I have.</span> <span id="s645">I gave the nurse in Bremen the 50 dollar, please mark that everything is there, I was petrified for the needle.</span> <span id="s646">She took it, wrote everything down, I took all the needles, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Before I have you leaving Europe –</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: – can you tell me for a few moments –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: – what were the conditions like in the DP camp?</span> <span id="s652">Tell me about life in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Life in the DP camps, it wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s654">It depends where you were.</span> <span id="s655">For instance, New Palestine.</span> <span id="s656">We were very close-knit from the camp.</span> <span id="s657">We – we knew each other, we went out dan – that we had dances there, and pa – especially I went to – in Salzburg, I went to every new show, any new operetta.</span> <span id="s658">What happened, you couldn’t get tickets there, they were very hard.</span> <span id="s659">But, if you bribe the cashier, you have it.</span> <span id="s660">I bought her soap, I bought a stocking, which I got from the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s661">Soap, I gave her.</span> <span id="s662">So from the soap, other things, I got tickets.</span> <span id="s663">Every time when a new show came, I had several tickets, as many as I want.</span> <span id="s664">And at the – almost every day I went out somewhere, cause in camp, there was a lot to do [indecipherable] but I had to go out, I liked to go out and what I missed out right during the war as a youngster, I want to catch up.</span> <span id="s665">And I met several girls there, which of course one wanted to get married, but I said not in the DP.</span> <span id="s666">And I wouldn’t do it, I – I not going to have a handout from the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s667">This was a Hungarian girl from Budapest.</span> <span id="s668">Very beautiful, intelligent girl.</span> <span id="s669">Anyway, she went to Palestine, she oh – from the ship she send me [indecipherable] even a letter, which I still have it, with the other things.</span> <span id="s670">But she went to Palestine, I came to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: What kinds of things did the survivors talk about in the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Well, most of them about parents, about what they went through, everybody [indecipherable] through.</span> <span id="s673">And we had the paper there that we gave out a lot, and a lot of people wrote articles also.</span> <span id="s674">And th – we liked to make out for the lost time.</span> <span id="s675">That’s what’s about it.</span> <span id="s676">What I tried – what I forgot to mention, right after the liberation, this was the worst time in my life, right after the liberation, cause during being in the camps, all what I thought is how to survive.</span> <span id="s677">Always I was thinking is only to survive, and we didn’t think anything about back home or anything.</span> <span id="s678">You didn’t have time to think.</span> <span id="s679">But after the liberation, then came back, where do I go?</span> <span id="s680">I don’t see my parents.</span> <span id="s681">This one’s missing, that one’s missing.</span> <span id="s682">Then I realize, I became again a person, with my mind and this was the worst time, and I was very, very nervous.</span> <span id="s683">And even when I came to the United States, for the first three years, all I did is taking pills and pills and pills til one doctor told me, you want to live?</span> <span id="s684">Put away the pills.</span> <span id="s685">You can do without them.</span> <span id="s686">Then I made up my mind and I stopped taking the pills, and I – and I start living a normal life.</span> <span id="s687">But this was in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: I’m curious as to what kinds of pills.</span> <span id="s689">What kinds of pills?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I forgot.</span> <span id="s691">This was in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s692">What was it for nerves, the pills that they gave?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Some kind of sedative?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Sedative.</span> <span id="s695">But what got me that the doctor even charged me for every pill.</span> <span id="s696">He had it as samples and he charged me 10 cents for each pill.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: When did you first come to realize the full extent of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Well, I knew in camp already what happened to my parents.</span> <span id="s699">In camp, because a transport in ’44 came from Auschwitz to our camp, and it was a – and it was one from our city [indecipherable] Levenstein(ph).</span> <span id="s700">And he says, oh your father’s alive because they have it good in Auschwitz, because they were in [indecipherable] and because they had a little bit more food, yeah.</span> <span id="s701">And for him it was good, but the parents, they’re not alive, and he told me about the burning and everything and the extermination.</span> <span id="s702">So I knew already this, I knew everything.</span> <span id="s703">But we didn't know to what extent.</span> <span id="s704">I couldn’t believe at that time to what extent, because here, okay, there were killings in the camp and everything, but we didn't see, in our camp was no burn or extermination, anything, it just that people died from hunger and from beating.</span> <span id="s705">And I was very good at that.</span> <span id="s706">I never got the beating, only once, because I was short and I never stood in front in the lines, all the time the middle, and all ki – picked tall guys that they should be in front of me.</span> <span id="s707">When they hit I was all time bend down and I n – I never got hit.</span> <span id="s708">I was selfish.</span> <span id="s709">But everybody looked to survive, that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Before you leave Europe, is there anything else about the years after the war, while you were still in Europe that you would like to – to cover, to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Well, about being in Europe, I just hated Europe, I wanted to get out from the bloody soil, especially from Germany.</span> <span id="s712">I wanted to get out, but we had to wait, we didn’t have where to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s713">We couldn’t go back because a lot of killing was going Poland.</span> <span id="s714">And then it wa – I was too much hurting, going back to the city there, which I never wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s715">And then finally my time came, yes, what I wanted to know, right after the liberation, when my friend Moniek Sheps(ph) came to pick up his sister, Sheva(ph), which was in Varamoltso(ph), he told me that a good friend of ours, Moniek Nifel(ph), that he is in Bergen-Belsen very, very sick.</span> <span id="s716">So I left everything there and went by train, went to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s717">I found him still alive.</span> <span id="s718">We talked, he cried, I am very sick.</span> <span id="s719">And of course this was under British occupation.</span> <span id="s720">Would he be under United States occupation, hundred percent he would be alive.</span> <span id="s721">Under the British, didn’t get medication, not the proper care, anything.</span> <span id="s722">And he expired there, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s723">And a lot of people there, if they would be under the American occupation, they would do more.</span> <span id="s724">The British weren't interested in anything to help out.</span> <span id="s725">That’s what I wanted to mention about it.</span> <span id="s726">And they’re known for it.</span> <span id="s727">And then what was going on, we marched there, we protested a lot.</span> <span id="s728">I don’t know if you remember with Belvin(ph), they didn’t let the Jewish people to Palestine, we protested, and we wrote in.</span> <span id="s729">I wrote a letter also to the United Nations, which I still have copies of it.</span> <span id="s730">Not [indecipherable] but then the Exodus ship and everything, I think that’s what helped Israel to become a nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials while you were in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, my sister’s husband, he was a Jewish, the only Jewish correspondent from the DP camps, in fact, and he covered all the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s733">I was there six times because he took – he was able to take along as guests two people.</span> <span id="s734">And I gave one to the museum and I still have one of the entry cards.</span> <span id="s735">And I saw everybody there.</span> <span id="s736">The sessions, I even have the numbers of the sessions there.</span> <span id="s737">Nuremberg was everything demolish except the building where the tr – the international tribunal was there, was standing.</span> <span id="s738">And in fact, I was – this year also there, I went back to the [indecipherable] cause I exhibited Nuremberg my exhibit this year, and I went to the courthouse there.</span> <span id="s739">I took even pictures how it looks now, I recognized the buildings right away when I came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: You said you saw everybody there.</span> <span id="s741">What do you mean you saw everybody there?</span> <span id="s742">Were you there for the main trial, or for the subsequent proceedings?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I went for the main trial.</span> <span id="s744">I saw Goering, Keitel, everybody and when I saw on television the things I was looking if I can see my brother-in-law there, because he had good connections with Redenko, which it was the Russian prosecutor.</span> <span id="s745">And he tried to listen to the American prosecutor there, in fact, we had breakfast with Redenko, which I am sorry I never took a picture, he was very good friend with him, yes.</span> <span id="s746">And in fact, my brother-in-law was one of the first ones that wrote a book about [indecipherable] like sheep to the slaughter, in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s747">And he wrote a lot of articles in the Jewish papers and a lot of articles to the [indecipherable] that he covered the – the trials.</span> <span id="s748">But he never got any money or anything, he never ask for money or anything.</span> <span id="s749">Yes, and – and now we want to know about me coming to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Yeah, one more question still in – in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: You said that you protested when you were in Europe.</span> <span id="s753">Can you tell me about the movement in the DP camps for the partition of Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: What was going on, what was the politics of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Well, the politics of that, that in every DP camps we screamed and we wrote articles, we send away to United Nations that we lost everybody, we live still on the bloody soil, that we can’t walk on it to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s757">We can’t, they killing Jews again.</span> <span id="s758">And we don’t have no place to go.</span> <span id="s759">The only place we want is to have our own Jewish homeland, and that was that.</span> <span id="s760">I remember one act in Salzburg which I can never forget.</span> <span id="s761">There was two cousins, they survived the war, and one of them had a carton of cigarettes with him.</span> <span id="s762">And the [indecipherable] policeman ask him what he have here.</span> <span id="s763">He didn’t want to show him and he es – he ran away.</span> <span id="s764">As he ran away, he shot him dead.</span> <span id="s765">And at that time, all the DP camps, Linz, Ebensee, all around Austria, from Polking(ph), they wanted to come here and do something, damage to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s766">And the [indecipherable] police, because it was a policeman that shot him, and the MP, hide away.</span> <span id="s767">They covered every road leading to Salzburg, trucks or cars, because a lot of trucks came with DPs from Linz.</span> <span id="s768">There were partisans a lot, that they used to be partisans.</span> <span id="s769">They came with hammers, they came even with weapons, what everything, and we wanted to do something to demolish Salzburg.</span> <span id="s770">And they knew about it.</span> <span id="s771">So when the funeral came, they shipped back the people, they didn’t let him in [indecipherable] they didn’t let them, they stood at the train stations.</span> <span id="s772">They didn’t let no – no DP person, no Jewish person into Salzburg.</span> <span id="s773">And they covered the whole funeral march, we were cordoned off by the military police.</span> <span id="s774">We had to go in the middle of the road, they didn’t let nobody out.</span> <span id="s775">And we couldn’t – we couldn’t let out our anger to anything.</span> <span id="s776">But we came to the cemetery, there was one house, which it was the caretaker’s, I think, and we put the house to fire.</span> <span id="s777">Which, I have pictures from the funeral, they’re here in the museum, which I gave them.</span> <span id="s778">We attended the funeral, I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s779">And that policeman, he ran away from Salzburg, cause we said we are going to kill all the police there.</span> <span id="s780">But, we couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s781">There were the happenings, what was.</span> <span id="s782">I remember coming to Munich.</span> <span id="s783">In the Munich was a march, which I still have the papers, which the Germans show what the Jews did there.</span> <span id="s784">They also starting demonstrating and – and beating up some Germans and things.</span> <span id="s785">And – because it was near Dachau, they wanted to march to Dachau, they didn’t allow.</span> <span id="s786">But I heard demonstrations in Munich from displaced person people, they came from all over.</span> <span id="s787">And I used to go from camp to camp if I can meet anything.</span> <span id="s788">That’s was the main thing.</span> <span id="s789">I went to Feldafing, I went to Landsberg, I went to Erfort(ph), which I found in each camp some old friends, people from our city.</span> <span id="s790">I met at this station in Frankfurt, a young girl, used to be friends with my sister, and she gave me a picture, in fact, from her sister on it, and another one a neighbor and my niece.</span> <span id="s791">And this picture was in the Red Cross, on the pamphlets advertising the Red Cross, the Holocaust [indecipherable] and I gave it also here to the museum.</span> <span id="s792">And that’s the stories.</span> <span id="s793">Wherever I came, I met some people.</span> <span id="s794">And finally, when we had the chance to go to the United States, I said I had enough.</span> <span id="s795">I don’t want to see any more Germany or anything and I would never go back.</span> <span id="s796">And came to the United States.</span> <span id="s797">When I came to the United States, the first thing is I went to my aunts.</span> <span id="s798">They waited for me, we came with the [indecipherable] ship.</span> <span id="s799">And everybody got sick, seasick, throw up.</span> <span id="s800">I think I was the only one walking around laughing, and I was the only one eating.</span> <span id="s801">When nobody could eat food, I was the only one.</span> <span id="s802">I had with me two watches that I took along to have some.</span> <span id="s803">So one of the crew people says, they going to arrest you, you can’t have two watches.</span> <span id="s804">He just wanted one watch.</span> <span id="s805">He gave me 20 dollar, which the watch cost me over a hundred, and I had to give it up.</span> <span id="s806">But then I talk, I was foolish, I was just taken, it was too late.</span> <span id="s807">Two days before we arrive to United States, what everybody got already well, when you should have see the screams in the morning on the ship.</span> <span id="s808">Everybody was laying on the decks, on the floor, why did I come to die on the sea?</span> <span id="s809">Why couldn’t we die there in Europe?</span> <span id="s810">That’s was the feeling of everybody.</span> <span id="s811">When everybody got well, even my brother got well, I came with my brother together, I got start on getting sick.</span> <span id="s812">So I didn’t have a good arrival in New York.</span> <span id="s813">When came to New York, my two aunts waited for me already with my brother.</span> <span id="s814">And I can never forgive them, they were so nice, too nice, they want to do something for us.</span> <span id="s815">We didn’t even go home, straight from the ship she went Fifth Avenue, bought for my brother, myself, hats with silk shawls, with shirts.</span> <span id="s816">Wanted me to try on a suit, I was sick like dog still.</span> <span id="s817">And I couldn’t tell them anything, they wanted to be nice and we came to the house, it was on the – prepared a big dinner.</span> <span id="s818">And right away, you are gonna be my children, you are not going to work any more in your life no more.</span> <span id="s819">You are going to live with us, you don’t have to put a finger in cold water, which I didn’t like it, I like to be independent.</span> <span id="s820">I stood there with my brother for two weeks.</span> <span id="s821">Then I went for one week to my nephew.</span> <span id="s822">What I forgot to tell you, my nephew, it’s my older sister’s son, he was in Vienna, translator to General Clark, and then he was translator for the American army in Vienna.</span> <span id="s823">In Vienna as you know, there were all four, the Russians, the French, the English and the Americans.</span> <span id="s824">So every morning they have all four on one she – if you saw on the newsreel something.</span> <span id="s825">And he was the one, whenever they gave him orders what to do, where to go, he translated him in French, into English, into German.</span> <span id="s826">And I have a lot of pictures him translating everything when they have the meetings, and he was the translator there as a young boy.</span> <span id="s827">I mean, I was very proud of him.</span> <span id="s828">Once he came to Salzburg with a young girl, she was only 14 years or 15 years old, Herta(ph) Weiss(ph).</span> <span id="s829">She was in Stutthof in camp, in Riga in camp, which was written a book and the picture her father, that her father got shot there.</span> <span id="s830">It’s a whole story, a separate story about her.</span> <span id="s831">And he came to me, introduced me that we are going to get married.</span> <span id="s832">I says, you’re crazy, he’s a kid.</span> <span id="s833">Fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s834">He traced her all the way from Budapest with her mother here.</span> <span id="s835">And he was – later on he found out through a friend, a Russian major, he says, Tom – his name is also Moniek, after my grandfather’s name, but he changed his name.</span> <span id="s836">Tom, now, he says, you got to escape, because the Russians wanted to take you over to the Soviets.</span> <span id="s837">At that time they caught, you know, a lot of people, special kind of people, and so right away he let know his superiors, was during the night, it didn’t take five minutes, they cordoned off the [indecipherable] where he lived, Jeeps with military and they brought him over to Munich.</span> <span id="s838">From Munich him and his wife right away to the United States.</span> <span id="s839">And, went to United States, first job was – his first job was going from the army camp to army camp in the States, he got 50 dollar for each talk, then he said, I got sick of these things and everything.</span> <span id="s840">He went to work for the HIAS, and then he wanted to go to the Columbia University.</span> <span id="s841">At that time, ’47, they didn’t take many Jews to Columbia, and of course as a refugee, so he wrote a article in the paper and the director from Columbia called him up.</span> <span id="s842">He – after talk with him, he was accepted.</span> <span id="s843">He was accepted and he was accepted and for international law, and then si – going seven years.</span> <span id="s844">He made it in three years with scholarships and when I came to the States I stood with him, also for a week, which they were so nice to me, everything.</span> <span id="s845">And then I said I got to get away from New York, cause my aunt said you are not going to work no more.</span> <span id="s846">Every day she tried to buy me thing and everything, I want to be independent.</span> <span id="s847">And I have the older brother, which lived in Palestine, and he married a girl from Baltimore, that they came back when the war broke out in ’48, they have two sons.</span> <span id="s848">Since she was a United States citizen she was scared.</span> <span id="s849">They burned – they burned their store in Jaffa, they were the only Jewish people in Jaffa, the Jewish store, in back, and so I came to Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: When did you come to New York, and when did you come to Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: I came to New York in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: And this was in ’49.</span> <span id="s854">September ’49, I came.</span> <span id="s855">And I remember I went – was Rosh Hashanah time that I went for the first time to the synagogue, which I couldn’t get a ticket and then this, you know, but who cared if we stood and prayed outside the synagogue?</span> <span id="s856">And then I came to Baltimore, was about six weeks later, I didn’t want to stay any more there, although I could have gotten a job in New York and I was introduced to someone in New York, I [indecipherable] about it.</span> <span id="s857">And I came, was – was around November 1949, I came to Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: When you came to this country, to New York and to Baltimore –</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: – I wanted to know what your first impressions of this country were, and I wanted to also know what impression you made on the Americans.</span> <span id="s861">So can you talk about the different impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s863">Well, first of all, my impression was tremendous.</span> <span id="s864">What I failed to tell you – I told you that my aunt took me right away out to Fifth Avenue, and after dinner I was so tired out I couldn’t sleep for a month.</span> <span id="s865">She took us to Radio City Music Hall the first evening.</span> <span id="s866">And I was so ashamed because I was afraid to fall asleep and every minute I fell asleep, even at this beautiful show that I never saw such a big theater, it made such impression on me, that’s the one in the world, the Radio City Music Hall.</span> <span id="s867">And here I had to sleep, and after that, after we walked out from there, half asleep so tired, she took us to Lindy’s.</span> <span id="s868">And I couldn’t eat because I felt more like giving everything out, I was still sick.</span> <span id="s869">And after Lindy’s, we finally came home.</span> <span id="s870">And I brought with me, that I bought a set of dishes from [indecipherable] German dishes.</span> <span id="s871">When I looked the things that she had in her home, I was ashamed.</span> <span id="s872">I was ashame I brought such a junk, I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s873">So during the night I went with my brother and took the whole cage with the dishes and dumped it in the outside, near the dumpster, and blankets and everything.</span> <span id="s874">She went out in the morning, says, did you dump anything there?</span> <span id="s875">She says, if you don’t want it, I take.</span> <span id="s876">Such a beautiful dishes and you dump?</span> <span id="s877">We was – we were ashamed that this is garbage, we didn’t want – yeah, but she’s – she had the [indecipherable] yes.</span> <span id="s878">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: What kinds of things did Americans ask you about your war experiences and what kinds of things did you choose to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Well, they ask me when I came over here, first of all I told them I’m a painter, because [indecipherable] some.</span> <span id="s881">My brother, he spent all the money what we had in Germany, and he learn typewriting machines to fix.</span> <span id="s882">And all the money what we had except the 50 dollar that I spent – I gave the nurse, I spent on the newest, most modern equipment to make parts for machines – for typewriting machines.</span> <span id="s883">Well, we came here, so I got right away a job, I took a job in painting, because I knew painting, which I got, by the way, 18 dollar a week.</span> <span id="s884">My brother couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s885">He called up Remington, says oh yeah, we need mechanics.</span> <span id="s886">When he came there, they found out he is Jewish, oh no, we don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s887">So they wouldn’t take Jewish people there, Remington.</span> <span id="s888">So he went to the HIAS, they got him a job through Ebertz(ph) machine on balt – on Baltimore Street – on Fayette Street in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s889">When he came down there he came with his tools and everything, he said he’s – he got his license, that he’s one of the best mechanics, worked several years in Germany, paid money, went – so he said, well, we don’t need such a mechanics.</span> <span id="s890">You see the shelves here?</span> <span id="s891">If something is missing, you see the numbers?</span> <span id="s892">We have parts, everything.</span> <span id="s893">We don’t need [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s894">It made him feel like two cents.</span> <span id="s895">So he got 12 dollar a week for his work.</span> <span id="s896">He [indecipherable] up.</span> <span id="s897">And it was very often [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s898">I cried every day, I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s899">First of all, I didn’t know nobody.</span> <span id="s900">Then when I had an apartment to get in, so s – there I work – I didn’t want to stay by my brother, because the sister-in-law wasn’t so well, she was an American, she had a different view and everything, and – and I saw that I am not welcome, so I said, I want right away an apartment.</span> <span id="s901">So the first apartment wen – my brother said, okay here, it’s – we looked in the paper.</span> <span id="s902">It was a shoemaker’s store, on the back of the store there was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s903">So I says, I didn’t come to the United States and live like this, worse than even a camp, near a shoemaker with the smell and everything.</span> <span id="s904">I went on my own and I found a room.</span> <span id="s905">I found a nice room there and we moved in right away.</span> <span id="s906">This was Sunday morning, we went right away to Reed’s(ph) drugstore, we bought pots and pans.</span> <span id="s907">We went right away there to the grocery store, this was our cook meal the first day, on our own.</span> <span id="s908">The landlady was very nice, and Friday evening when she baked the cakes and everything, right away she brought in [indecipherable] which in the next morning it went to the garbage can.</span> <span id="s909">We were – I don’t know, we were so that from somebody’s hands we didn't want to touch.</span> <span id="s910">It was foolish, but that’s how we were, very particular, that only on our own.</span> <span id="s911">And it was very, very tough on me.</span> <span id="s912">First of all I had to go, I didn't know not a word of English.</span> <span id="s913">So I had to go to school, so I went to night school.</span> <span id="s914">After work nine, 10 hours a day, cause I wanted to get more hours [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s915">Then my brother worked there, he only made 12 hours – 12, I think.</span> <span id="s916">After working for somebody, what happened that the men what we worked couldn’t mix the color for a person for a [indecipherable] that she wants a particular color.</span> <span id="s917">And of course I knew colors very good and everything.</span> <span id="s918">So as he went – as he went to get material – as he went to get material, I mix for her the color.</span> <span id="s919">Oh, that’s exactly what I want.</span> <span id="s920">When he came back, she says, I want him to do mixing the colors, everything.</span> <span id="s921">And she told me, why don’t you go on your own?</span> <span id="s922">I says, I don’t know nobody, I don’t know the language or anything.</span> <span id="s923">She says, I give you a customer.</span> <span id="s924">So I quit them and I got the customer on my own.</span> <span id="s925">From 18 dollar, right away that she offered me 60.</span> <span id="s926">From 18 to 60 dollar, cause [indecipherable] a mechanic.</span> <span id="s927">So he says no.</span> <span id="s928">You didn’t pay me right away, I don’t do it.</span> <span id="s929">And I walk myself up.</span> <span id="s930">Then I –</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: I have to interrupt you, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: One moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: How many – End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: – United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Morris Rosen.</span> <span id="s936">This is tape two, side B and you were telling me about the – basically branching now out on your own, professionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s938">Then I went on my own to work, and I took my brother right away, we’re not going to work for 12 ah – 12 dollar a week, you are going with me.</span> <span id="s939">Whatever is going to happen, is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s940">And it was very tough in the beginning, with my English, although we went to school.</span> <span id="s941">And I decided I got to do something with me.</span> <span id="s942">First of all we wanted to get a grocery store.</span> <span id="s943">At that time almost every survivor went into groceries, because they didn’t have [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s944">So while I was working, one of the nicest people was that person who was in charge of the Exodus ship in Baltimore, Mr. Spierd(ph) which he’s known.</span> <span id="s945">He was the one that brought everything, and the ship was [indecipherable] right in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s946">And his wife, she says no, you’re too intelligent, you don’t want to be a slave in a grocery store.</span> <span id="s947">You’re not married yet, you won’t be able to find a girl.</span> <span id="s948">You don’t want to be shop.</span> <span id="s949">You go to school, continue and do what you’re doing, never go to a grocery.</span> <span id="s950">And I already had a lawyer and everything, we already got prepared to buy this for everything, and I listened to her.</span> <span id="s951">Instead, I enlisted, I went to the Maryland Institute of Art, to the art school.</span> <span id="s952">I went seven years to the art school for interior design.</span> <span id="s953">I first graduated – honest, I was the only one in the ever class ever to get the medal, usually they give the medals for day school.</span> <span id="s954">I couldn’t go day school, I had to make a living.</span> <span id="s955">Worked during the day.</span> <span id="s956">I went post-graduate at seven years.</span> <span id="s957">Then the teacher told me, you have talent, I send you – which might not cost you for scholarship, to New York.</span> <span id="s958">But what happened – and meanwhile I got married already –</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I met my wife at a blind date.</span> <span id="s961">And before I come to this, I want to tell you I was miserable for the first year in the United States.</span> <span id="s962">I didn’t know nobody.</span> <span id="s963">Baltimore was like a little town.</span> <span id="s964">Every weekday – every Friday evening when I got my pay, when I had money, I ran to the train right away, and New York because I have a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s965">Baltimore was a little town.</span> <span id="s966">If you want to go out with somebody, you have either to know them – you couldn’t go to a dance like New York on your own, you have to belong somewhere, wasn’t as – even school, I was all the time called here comes the greenhorn.</span> <span id="s967">I wasn’t received not at all good.</span> <span id="s968">I went to the synagogue on a Saturday, all the ti – oh, here’s the greenhorn.</span> <span id="s969">I came for a sundae to a drugstore [indecipherable] made fun because I didn’t know so good English.</span> <span id="s970">So I let them have it in German, and I said, it’s miserable.</span> <span id="s971">They didn’t treat the newcomers at all good at that time.</span> <span id="s972">The American people were not at all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s973">They – they treat us like third class, and I mean third class, that I wanted to go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s974">But, with the time I met my wife.</span> <span id="s975">I met her in ’53, we went for a year time.</span> <span id="s976">I met her already in ’52.</span> <span id="s977">We went over a year time, and then March 31st we got married, to a Baltimorean girl, so was a little different.</span> <span id="s978">And I work myself up, and I was looking for an apartment before, which it was very hard to get apartments because people thought we are going to have kids, they didn’t want [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s979">And I worked there by a builder, na – and at that time, and I finish a job early, so I went there to look for work for my own, to another builder.</span> <span id="s980">When I came in, he asked me what I am looking this house, [indecipherable] was there a painting contract?</span> <span id="s981">And I couldn’t say that I am looking for – for paint.</span> <span id="s982">So I says, I am interested in a home buying.</span> <span id="s983">Okay.</span> <span id="s984">I ask him how much.</span> <span id="s985">It was 18 and a half thousand dollar home.</span> <span id="s986">And at that time thousand dollar, who had that kind of money [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s987">Then I [indecipherable] suppose I don’t finish this, and this I will do on my own, not only my own painting, but finishing off a lot of the walls and the bathrooms, knocked off this and this.</span> <span id="s988">He came down to about 15 and a half thousand dollar.</span> <span id="s989">Then I worked for this builder at that time, I did – for his private home, and I told him, he says, oh, he’s a friend of mine, let me go.</span> <span id="s990">He came to him, he says, do something for him, and this and this.</span> <span id="s991">So he knocked it down another 1500 dollar.</span> <span id="s992">So I said, instead of paying rent somewhere, looking for a house, I gave a down payment.</span> <span id="s993">And I said, I am buying this home.</span> <span id="s994">On a Saturday I took a ride, I took my future wife, I wasn’t married then [indecipherable] who can dream [indecipherable] home.</span> <span id="s995">This was the first semi-detached homes in Baltimore, beautiful.</span> <span id="s996">I said, this is yours, this is a present, she couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s997">And I didn't have money for furniture, anything.</span> <span id="s998">And I had everything together with my brother.</span> <span id="s999">One bankbook.</span> <span id="s1000">It didn’t matter what he makes, what a – I mean, when we split up, when we went for our honeymoon to New York, when we came back, I only had money for a bed and this.</span> <span id="s1001">And of course she got some money from her parents, not much.</span> <span id="s1002">And my brother, whatever we had money in the bank left, he bought a kitchen set, and he set up a bedroom, and we didn’t – we didn’t have any other furniture, but this came piece by piece.</span> <span id="s1003">And unfortunately – or fortunately, I should say, I have very expensive taste, which I just wouldn’t buy anything, I would – where I work, this was, I mean there lived the most richest people in – in Maryland, that’s the customers I had.</span> <span id="s1004">I was never listed in the phone book, I – this was recommended [indecipherable] I was all the time three, four years lined up with work before, I – and I didn't go everywhere, I just had a selected clientele.</span> <span id="s1005">Then I wanted to go into interior design.</span> <span id="s1006">Then I found out – that’s what I graduated from – I didn’t go to New York because I have already a home here.</span> <span id="s1007">Got my wife here, I couldn't – not start all over again.</span> <span id="s1008">So, for interior design you got to have a lot of money, you got to open a business, you got to have your own material, you got to have a showcase, I just couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s1009">Then I was recommended to interior designer Chambis(ph), which she was the most known in Baltimore, she told me okay, you can.</span> <span id="s1010">And I said no, I-I am a boss on my own, I’m not going for somebody.</span> <span id="s1011">So I work myself up all alone, and you know, I hired a lot of men, and then I had my builder’s work and I helped out decorating, which I got money for this too, but I could never [indecipherable] for opening my own business for interior design.</span> <span id="s1012">And I was happier with what I was doing and I was interested in my old hobby, this is philately, stamps, which I started as a youngster six years old.</span> <span id="s1013">I continued in the United States, this was by coincident.</span> <span id="s1014">I went downtown Baltimore, I saw a stamp store, it was something familiar to me, and I started again.</span> <span id="s1015">And I came to join the club in Baltimore, the philatelic club, which I was one of the first Jewish people to join, because at that time there were only doctors and lawyers, only professionals, and I was actually the first one like to join with them.</span> <span id="s1016">They liked me and I became right a member of the – there – the an – government of the – of the society.</span> <span id="s1017">And I started also to put my collections together in topics to exhibit, and I was starting to get known internationally for my exhibit, my work.</span> <span id="s1018">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: What exhibit?</span> <span id="s1020">You need to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: This was philatelic exhibition, which I was specially interested in Olympics.</span> <span id="s1022">I was all the time following Olympic games in ’36.</span> <span id="s1023">This was the first Olympics that I followed.</span> <span id="s1024">So, and every morning I went through the paper right away, who won this.</span> <span id="s1025">I followed everything, and I started collecting Olympic stamps at that time, which I – every penny I made in Europe, things, I – I bought stamps, and I was very knowledgeable in it.</span> <span id="s1026">And I have a good eye on good material to buy, everything.</span> <span id="s1027">And I assembled one of the best collections, probably, on Olympic history.</span> <span id="s1028">And I was invited to Europe, I think the first exhibit was in ’74 in Israel – internationally the first, the other ones I exhibited mainly here, which I won a nice prize.</span> <span id="s1029">Then I was exhibiting other places, in the navy too, I had invitation from the Olympic committee from Italy, to exhibit as an American guest in Rome.</span> <span id="s1030">They had – they invited 16 people from around the world, the most known – most known philatelists and Olympic committee members.</span> <span id="s1031">First I declined, I don’t have time my business.</span> <span id="s1032">In the philatelic [indecipherable] they told me, this is the biggest honors you can have, and you are going to recline?</span> <span id="s1033">They send you ticket.</span> <span id="s1034">Then I – I send a telegram, so right away they send a telegram back to go Philadelphia and go to Washington.</span> <span id="s1035">I – from everywhere, tickets, special plane, and I had to take to the Italian embassy my collection, that goes by pouch, you know, which they took along from the embassy, they took my collection there, and I was treated royally there.</span> <span id="s1036">We were about 18 people there, every day special dinners, special things, go out.</span> <span id="s1037">If I went to the synagogue on a s – on Saturday, I have a bus for a hundred people going with me, with one person.</span> <span id="s1038">Of course I took along a Polish guy [indecipherable] and a German guy, which they went with me, they wanted to see the synagogue in Rome.</span> <span id="s1039">And I was invited for the 95th congress, which was the Olympic congress in – in Rome, and from then on I got very popular.</span> <span id="s1040">Then I was invited to most of the international shows, which I was judging also, I became an apprentice judge first, and international.</span> <span id="s1041">And I went to every Olympic, I was invited free.</span> <span id="s1042">They paid for my travel, they paid for my hotel, for the food.</span> <span id="s1043">They gave me pocket money.</span> <span id="s1044">And I built up my collection through my knowledge, which was one – one of the greatest Olympic collections in the world.</span> <span id="s1045">There were only a few – very few more in this [indecipherable] and I think I was the only in the United States this.</span> <span id="s1046">And then I was also interesting – in the 50’s I saw a advertising in the German paper, “The Aufbau,” about somebody has a [indecipherable] stamp from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1047">I was very interesting and I bought a [indecipherable] the first was the Bansburg(ph) ghetto.</span> <span id="s1048">And I didn't even know it exists, this kind of material in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s1049">And as I went from show to show, I ask [indecipherable] and this, and then I found out that I can buy some material.</span> <span id="s1050">And I started assembling a collection on ghettos and especially on Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1051">Which I assembled one of the largest private collection in the world, which I exhibited international, in [indecipherable] Bulgaria, in Spain, in England, in Israel, which I [indecipherable] in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s1052">Last year I exhibited and – this year [indecipherable] in Johannesburg and Israel and I just came from Nuremberg, I exhibited there, I gave several lectures on the Holocaust, and mine collection is very well known, and I write a lot of articles on Holocaust material, and I give a lot of lectures on it.</span> <span id="s1053">Now I have to put together a collection on concentration camps, and subcamps and forced labor camps, which I have about 8,000 pieces, but I don’t have the time to put down.</span> <span id="s1054">So far [indecipherable] on my ghetto collection, which I’m very happy, and I give a lot of lectures.</span> <span id="s1055">And in ’91 – in ’91, I had a phone call from the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s1056">They called me up that they starting to open up a Holocaust tracing center in Baltimore, which this is the first center in the United States all over, and Baltimore became the headquarters of it.</span> <span id="s1057">They called me up, I says, I know, because they know me from exhibits all the time, the JCC, I exhibited in Baltimore the city, whenever it’s Yom HaShoah.</span> <span id="s1058">Okay, I will go over there.</span> <span id="s1059">They interviewed me there, it was not open yet, but they interviewed me, they locked the door, we don’t let you out.</span> <span id="s1060">You know too much.</span> <span id="s1061">You be very good for us.</span> <span id="s1062">You know the languages and you translate [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1063">Okay, since I retired from work, I’m going to do something.</span> <span id="s1064">So I started and I start to come every day there, then four times a week.</span> <span id="s1065">And then, when Gorbachev came to power, you know, they started to open up, you know, on there in the archives from the Holocaust, from Auschwitz, death books and everything.</span> <span id="s1066">There was a young lady in Baltimore, came to an idea, why don’t we open up a center, we can find and something to do for survivors, so on.</span> <span id="s1067">And Washington [indecipherable] the main headquarter [indecipherable] was.</span> <span id="s1068">And that’s where I started out, I started out from the first day on.</span> <span id="s1069">Then, when they find anything, so one – one official that started working on the Holocaust before they opened up, he was – he let know that Red Cross that we have some important material in Suitland, in the National Archives, that can be used for names and so on for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1070">So we had out about 12 people, twice a week, before they wanted everything twice a week.</span> <span id="s1071">We had a driver from the Red Cross and took us to Suitland.</span> <span id="s1072">After just two weeks, Haverford(ph) quit.</span> <span id="s1073">He couldn’t take it, it was too much, you know, when they read the stories, and a lot of them couldn’t understand either, because you know, you have to know languages.</span> <span id="s1074">I decided – it was very tough on me because everything came back to me.</span> <span id="s1075">I never wanted to talk about the Holocaust at home, never did.</span> <span id="s1076">Never to nobody, I never mentioned, I never wanted to watch a picture of the Holocaust, anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s1077">But here, everything came back on me.</span> <span id="s1078">Horrible stories.</span> <span id="s1079">And when I read there some stories, what I thought I went through bad, then I said, I was in the luxurious hotel, not in the camp.</span> <span id="s1080">What people went through, especially – especially in hiding place.</span> <span id="s1081">And we remained only a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: I need to interrupt you for one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: You – you reference Suitland.</span> <span id="s1085">Can you please establish on tape what you are talking about?</span> <span id="s1086">What is Suitland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1090">Suitland is the National Archives that’s the fourth largest depository and archive from the war in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1091">They were – people come from all over the world to look for archives and everything is there.</span> <span id="s1092">If you want to see from the Civil War, if you want to see about anything with the Indians, parts of lands, how – everything’s there.</span> <span id="s1093">But particularly is what we were interested on war material, they have in Suitland 33 tons, and I’m talking tons of material on the second World War, what the American army confiscated from archives in Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, France and Austria and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1094">And we were working, we had there – the main one from the Red Cross was Suzanne Artivelis(ph), which she is now head from the Christian society in Africa she works.</span> <span id="s1095">And we – several people.</span> <span id="s1096">And we were interested in finding names.</span> <span id="s1097">What we found in names, the names what we recorded, we put down – in every section we put in, we put in pieces of paper and then once a month they came and they copied this microfilming, which they gave to the Red Cross and then which it was sent to Germany, to Arlsen(ph), to the archives for the tracing, Holocaust tracing.</span> <span id="s1098">If somebody traced, you know, all the time, they sh – we knew names where they, if they died there or not, but they had them, the names, they’re there.</span> <span id="s1099">And we found that books which we recorded, over 400,000 names, which we gave to president from the Red Cross, Mrs. Dore(ph), it was on television, I think, I discovered a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1100">But aside to looking for names on the – as a historian and from my personal things, anything that concerned Judaism, or Jewish thing, important things, because people couldn’t read, they just – th-the American people they didn’t know languages, just names and they knew the names and they put in where to copy this.</span> <span id="s1101">But I looked through documents, and I had the sharp eye, I just ful – I knew right away, when I start taking a batch with documents right away, I knew right away what’s there, what to look up.</span> <span id="s1102">Whenever has to something with Jewish history, I copied.</span> <span id="s1103">I did more spend money there in copying – copying documents, which thing – they all are, what are you doing, what are you doing, that I am all tying up the wi – don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1104">I have my names everything, but besides that, I have assembled over 10,000 Xerox copies from the museum, which a lot of it were not even declassified, I declassified thousands and thousands of pieces there.</span> <span id="s1105">And I came across material that’s not known to nowhere.</span> <span id="s1106">Of course, I’m go [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1107">I – I have at home that I recorded, over 500 pages of documents that came out from the American embassy in Ankara, Turkey, which has to do with a Jewish question, a request from [indecipherable] from Palestine, and also from the United States with a request to President Roosevelt to rescue 405 rabbis from Europe.</span> <span id="s1108">In the beginning, he said okay.</span> <span id="s1109">This was in ninet – beginning ’41, which was already known what’s happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s1110">Of course, he got in touch with Mr. Eden from England.</span> <span id="s1111">So Eden, right away [indecipherable] anything, you are going to try to rescue 405 Jews?</span> <span id="s1112">All European Jews are going to come to you.</span> <span id="s1113">We don’t have ships, we have a war going on.</span> <span id="s1114">What do you need them for?</span> <span id="s1115">Let’s forget it.</span> <span id="s1116">Well, anyway, it came – it came then, it came Karski also, it’s know what he did here, what’s happening, and the [indecipherable] day, I have names written down, who – who was the representative and everything.</span> <span id="s1117">Even Steven Weiss was also connected with it.</span> <span id="s1118">So, he promise – he promised then, he said, where would [indecipherable] means money.</span> <span id="s1119">Once they had to send 25,000 pounds, which they send it.</span> <span id="s1120">25 pow – thousand pounds was a lot of money, it was over five dollar a pound at that time.</span> <span id="s1121">Then another 15,000 pound.</span> <span id="s1122">Finally they came up that they have to buy a ship.</span> <span id="s1123">There was a ship on the Black Sea, and they had permission from the Turkish government, when they come to Turkey, to the Black Sea, through Bulgaria, they will let them in only for one night.</span> <span id="s1124">Then they will go – go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1125">Palestine, the British only allowed them one night to be in there to come to United States.</span> <span id="s1126">But of c-course, delaying, delaying, you wi – everything – you know what happened with the Holocaust, nobody’s alive.</span> <span id="s1127">What we have on record is about 35 rabbis that they came out alive, which they escaped to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1128">And late in ’44, when it was known there are no more Jews, finally Roosevelt gave in.</span> <span id="s1129">They sent in – they sent in to all the friendly embassies in Europe, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, if somebody would list the name of the rabbis and if somebody comes here, give him the visa.</span> <span id="s1130">So we have a undersecretary Long here, which he was a anti-Semite, and he send – write the letters, before anything, I want to know who they are and what to know.</span> <span id="s1131">I have all documents home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Now, I’m – I need you to clarify something that I’m not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: – quite sure I understand.</span> <span id="s1135">You said you made copies of these things from the archive –</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: – and you said two things that I – I need you to clarify.</span> <span id="s1138">One is that you declassified them, and I’d –</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: – like you to explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And also you s – you said that these are now in the museum.</span> <span id="s1143">What is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: [indecipherable] the museum.</span> <span id="s1145">[indecipherable] in the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Okay, please clarify those two points.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: I will clarify.</span> <span id="s1148">First of all, when we looked through, don’t forget 33,000 documents, a lot, 90 percent was not declassified yet because nobody came to those documents yet, which I discovered them for the first time.</span> <span id="s1149">And when I wanted to copy this, I can’t copy this til they’re now declassified.</span> <span id="s1150">So I have to go to the head of the archives, he put in a stamp with a little note declassified the date, the day with the year, everything, requested for declassification and then she put on a stamp declassified, and then I could Xerox that, yes.</span> <span id="s1151">And I have at home at least 5,000 documents which I declassified because nobody saw them before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: And what of your collection –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: – is now in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: I would say about 60 percent, I have a lot of them, they’re not.</span> <span id="s1156">For instance, the names of the rabbis.</span> <span id="s1157">I have every name.</span> <span id="s1158">I have from which synagogue they belong, from which county.</span> <span id="s1159">For instance, they have 105 rabbis from Lithuania, that’s about 198 rabbis exact from Poland.</span> <span id="s1160">They have one rabbi from Estonia, from Latvia, from France, from Germany, from [indecipherable] all Europe.</span> <span id="s1161">And this documents, I gave a talk on it which I’m go – I – in my book that I hope to write, these documents are going to be shown, because a lot of them – I want to say this [indecipherable] some tape, but a lot of them are not declassified yet, which I have.</span> <span id="s1162">So, I’m a little bit scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: I have seen a few of the things that you have in your possession –</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: – that are not Xerox copies of documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: And they’re not stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Te – I would like you to – before I go back and find more about your personal life, as long as we’re on this I’d like you tell me about your personal collection of historical artifacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yes, yeah, mine personal collection of historical artifacts, especially on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1171">I acquired this through auctions, through dealers.</span> <span id="s1172">Of course no – i-in here.</span> <span id="s1173">And a lot of material, which I realize now, which I got information, was stolen out from archives in Poland, especially from the Jewish – from the Jewish Historical Society on the Litzmannstadt ghetto, which I didn’t want to buy anything, but there I came to one particular item, which I said if I’m not going to buy, somebody is going to buy.</span> <span id="s1174">It’s – it’s never will go back to the museum anyway.</span> <span id="s1175">And I know it was stolen out from the museum, but at that time, everybody – every Pole we had a hand in the museum, what does he think about Jewish things?</span> <span id="s1176">There were mostly Gentile people, and they stole them out, but loads of them, suitcases, which they came to United States and they were auctioned off here, and I bought them and I have a lot of documents.</span> <span id="s1177">I have documents from Hitler also.</span> <span id="s1178">I have documents from Himmler, signed by Himmler, other things.</span> <span id="s1179">I bought this at the auctions.</span> <span id="s1180">I bought in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1181">In the 60 – I was pretty lucky, the original telegram from the Crystal Night, when Crystal Night broke out, when Herschel Grynszpan shot vom Rath in the embassy, it was the f – one of the first telegrams that came out from Paris, sent to Berlin, and it – it’s a backstamp a picture of Herschel Grynszpan that they sent by wire, backstamp Scheidel(ph).</span> <span id="s1182">Scheidel(ph) is like Reuter news, this is Scheidel(ph).</span> <span id="s1183">It’s the original telegram that [indecipherable] what they call him, you know, in German.</span> <span id="s1184">Herschel Seibel Grynszpan, I ever – never knew that he had a middle name, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1185">His name is Seibel(ph), like the original telegram, which they have now a copy in the museum.</span> <span id="s1186">O-Of course it’s gonna remain later on in the museum, but for time being I hold onto it, but I have copies in the museum.</span> <span id="s1187">I have other documents.</span> <span id="s1188">I have documents from SS even, things which were taken away by soldiers, which I got them.</span> <span id="s1189">Is one picture that I acquired even in Vidin(ph) from a friend of mine, which he personally took away from a German soldier, how they cut the curls, the sidecurls from Jews with the beards, that I have it, all the other documents.</span> <span id="s1190">And I worked for about seven years in Suitland in the archives, and then they went over to College Park and then I stopped, I didn’t have time and I had a drive a day from the Red Cross they supplied, and I did a lot of research there, plus my research that I know.</span> <span id="s1191">And while I was working there, Bob Casting(ph), he should rest in peace, one of the nicest, most knowledgeable guys probably that this institution ever had, he worked in Suitland in the archives and a lot of times whatever I found, I gave it to him, to Bob.</span> <span id="s1192">I was introduced, and – and then he asked me Morris, how about coming over the museum, work for some.</span> <span id="s1193">This was on a case that he had.</span> <span id="s1194">So I did, and since then I’m with the museum, working in the archives on a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1195">And I wouldn’t say that I enjoy these things, what I look, who I work on the microfilms, on – which came out from Poland now in ’55, the [indecipherable] they have, which I work already two years on it.</span> <span id="s1196">And it’s not pleasant you – when you read, but somebody got to do it, and the people that they can translate, that we can do the stories, if they’re not going to do, who is going to do this later?</span> <span id="s1197">There’s Yiddish especially.</span> <span id="s1198">It’s not a dying language, but yet very, very few people know.</span> <span id="s1199">If it’s printed they know, but handwriting, if it’s handwritten, which I took along a lot of them, Xerox copies, maybe somebody can help me out, I have so much work.</span> <span id="s1200">Even to the rabbinical college in – the college in Baltimore, the rabbi, no, they wouldn’t do it, it’s too hard because it’s fancy Yiddish and this, but I managed to do.</span> <span id="s1201">And somebody got to do, and I enjoy the people here to work with and I learn a lot through what I read, through – a person can never say he knows everything.</span> <span id="s1202">It’s – it’s – it’s – believe me, I have a lot – a lot to learn to – to know.</span> <span id="s1203">But, a lot of things that I learned here, and it’s good to know.</span> <span id="s1204">I wrote many, many articles of this subject, and – and I have a lot – in fact I have here an article that I just wrote about Stutthof, the camps in Stutthof, with all archival work documents from my collection, with letters from Stutthof and it’s all there for future generations, and I hope to write a book, so for future generations, they can learn a lot about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Le-Let’s pause and change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: – Holocaust artifacts, and I-I’m very curious to ask if you have any idea what the value of this collection is, historically and financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yeah, well, historical, it’s very va-valuable.</span> <span id="s1209">I have a lot of unique items in postal history.</span> <span id="s1210">For instance, I have letters.</span> <span id="s1211">A letter from Kaiser [indecipherable] which it’s the only one known.</span> <span id="s1212">From [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1213">I have from some ghettoes that the ghettoes were only a hundred Jews, not quite a hundred, I – from there.</span> <span id="s1214">I have historical letters, which letters could get out from the ghettoes, the people couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1215">And everything was censored there, censored by the Jewish – by the Jewish council has to be censored.</span> <span id="s1216">If anything was written there, they were – they could be punished and even shot.</span> <span id="s1217">But, you know, in the ghetto slang, which the Germans couldn’t understand right.</span> <span id="s1218">For instance, I have a postcard from mine city, written from an aunt to a niece.</span> <span id="s1219">And she writes, my liebers(ph) kin, this is mine last writing to you.</span> <span id="s1220">We expect an Uncle Malchamovis, and I will have to go with them.</span> <span id="s1221">The Germans thought Uncle Malchamovis is a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: But it’s not.</span> <span id="s1224">Then I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: No, no, please explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: What Malchamovis(ph) is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Uncle Malchamovis(ph) is a Hebrew name, the angel of death, so the Germans wouldn’t understand what it is.</span> <span id="s1229">But the person receiving this card knows Uncle Malchamovis what it is, and she knew where she is going.</span> <span id="s1230">Other letters that I have in ghetto slang, that reveals the panic there, which in fact I’m gonna write now a article about postal history from the g-ghetto during the war, it reveals the pain and the suffering of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1231">With everyone listed in ghetto slang, we have a lot of material on this, of the news how many people got killed there.</span> <span id="s1232">For instance, you have postcards with a request to a Jewish consul, to a – the le – th-the head of the Jewish ghetto, we don’t hear from this and this family, can you write?</span> <span id="s1233">And he says, well, they’re buried in this and this cemetery.</span> <span id="s1234">So how can it be that four people from one family is buried, died in the same day?</span> <span id="s1235">Must be something.</span> <span id="s1236">So, as a archivist I look documents, I look through things.</span> <span id="s1237">I found out on this and this day, they murdered 650 Jews.</span> <span id="s1238">They put them in the synagogue, and put the fire the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1239">And these are things you learn from it.</span> <span id="s1240">And this is this – you got to write about it, what happened.</span> <span id="s1241">And you have the documentation, it’s not just that something nice can come [indecipherable] happen, it’s everything written the postcard.</span> <span id="s1242">And they can’t deny because this was censored, by the Germans censor, everything.</span> <span id="s1243">I have from the camps, going from the ghetto into the camps, letters, postcards.</span> <span id="s1244">And this irreplaceable, you can’t put in a value on it.</span> <span id="s1245">On a history you can’t put the value.</span> <span id="s1246">And to sell, I don’t know what you – depends on the collector.</span> <span id="s1247">I thinks that I paid 5,000 dollars for an item, for one letter, which is extremely rare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: In your work in the Holocaust Museum –</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: – do you ever work with the public?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: With the public here, not, but I do a lot, I give talks to charities.</span> <span id="s1252">I gave talks to universities, and I do this about 10 to 15 times a year.</span> <span id="s1253">I gave a talk about two years ago in Fort Meade for the army people, which it happened it was the ninth of May, the anniversary of the end of the second World War.</span> <span id="s1254">Was about 300 officers there present, they wrote me up in the paper, in fact they wrote me up in two papers.</span> <span id="s1255">Well, I came there.</span> <span id="s1256">I didn’t talk much about the Jewish Holocaust, because I don’t know who the people are.</span> <span id="s1257">Gentile – it depends.</span> <span id="s1258">In schools, in schools or [indecipherable] I tell them the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1259">Army people is a different thing.</span> <span id="s1260">I wanted to disclose to them, which the army doesn’t know if – the United States population doesn’t know what happened to American POWs during the war.</span> <span id="s1261">Their holocaust, which people don’t understand, they don’t know, which I have documents from the second World War that I copied, and it’s everything in the archives.</span> <span id="s1262">In what manner they killed the POWs, also death marches, which it’s not known that they went through death marches.</span> <span id="s1263">There’s a death march with 8,000 British POWs from Poland [indecipherable], they took them through the snow and everything, that I found in the archives, a book from a major, from a British major with the names who got killed, shot on the road, they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1264">So many of them, thousands got killed from the 8,000.</span> <span id="s1265">This is not known, and the public don’t know.</span> <span id="s1266">And they opened their eyes when they heard what they did to the American soldiers, how they buried them with the heads up, which you can find pictures in si – and now it’s in – in college [indecipherable], with the heads up, buried.</span> <span id="s1267">I have a fact, a Jewish soldier, which I have a document with the picture, everything.</span> <span id="s1268">When they – when they captured him they found a prayer book, which they have the army prayer books, the Jewish people, they took away everything.</span> <span id="s1269">Then they wanted to take off his ring, and it wouldn’t come off from the ki – finger.</span> <span id="s1270">They took a shovel and cut off his finger to get the ring.</span> <span id="s1271">Then they buried them with the heads up, and when the American army came in and they saw them burying the head, they kept them – they kept them from the American army, we should bury them here.</span> <span id="s1272">He says, don’t take no prisoners from them, look what they did to them.</span> <span id="s1273">And this is the anger, but today the population don’t understand what the Germans did to them.</span> <span id="s1274">The – they don’t know that over two million Russian POWs were killed by the Nazis in Buchenwald also.</span> <span id="s1275">There were between three and 400 killings every day in Buchenwald, that they had the barrack there, it was called by telephone, 91.</span> <span id="s1276">When they called them up, they knew what it is, they were dressed as doctors.</span> <span id="s1277">They put them in – they put them into this barrack, and it was just – just like a doctor effice – office for examine your eyes, the height, and everything.</span> <span id="s1278">And they took prisoners, a lot of prisoners in one time, every night what was going on.</span> <span id="s1279">And they examined their teeth, they examined their eyes, everything.</span> <span id="s1280">Then they took one by one into a next room, which it was against the wall to measure the height.</span> <span id="s1281">But there was a slot there, and they put with the heads back and there he got right away a bullet in his back head and this was going all night long.</span> <span id="s1282">In the morning they cleaned everything off, they had to have a plumber to unplug from the blood and everything.</span> <span id="s1283">They captured those people, they captured the people after the war.</span> <span id="s1284">What did they do to them?</span> <span id="s1285">I found documents, it’s – it’s – it’s unbelievable that the American government could do this.</span> <span id="s1286">I have a document which a German officer, a doctor decapitated a g – a-an American officer.</span> <span id="s1287">He took his head, put them in a liquid, get off the flesh, everything.</span> <span id="s1288">He bleached his skull, and it – he sent his wife a souvenir for mantelpiece.</span> <span id="s1289">They caught this, and now the German told them, and he wanted to save his life.</span> <span id="s1290">And he was among 45 other German prisoners what they killed [indecipherable] other places.</span> <span id="s1291">And of course, he was sentenced to death by hanging.</span> <span id="s1292">So the Germans were very smart, and very smart lawyers, right away got – they got petitions from the people from that city which that doctor [indecipherable] decapitated the soldier.</span> <span id="s1293">They got over 5,000 names that he was a good citizen, he went to church every Sunday, that he has a old mother, how can she die knowing if he’s gonna be killed?</span> <span id="s1294">He has two small kids.</span> <span id="s1295">How will the kids live the rest of the life he’s going to get killed.</span> <span id="s1296">And a letter included that came from the Vatican, which I have a copy, a document, which it went to General Clay, which he was the governor of Europe from the American army, if you are going to kill those 45 people, you are not any better than the Nazis, because the war is over.</span> <span id="s1297">So they commuted them.</span> <span id="s1298">Of course they got commuted to life.</span> <span id="s1299">The lawyers were so smart, they send in the petition to Washington, not explaining that they were commuted from hanging to life, but they said they were sentenced to life.</span> <span id="s1300">And with the same thing with their signatures.</span> <span id="s1301">So that particular person was commuted to 25 years.</span> <span id="s1302">After sitting Landsberg for five years only, for good behavior they let him out free.</span> <span id="s1303">I have the documents to show.</span> <span id="s1304">What do we say to the parents from that poor soul that he got decapitated?</span> <span id="s1305">They walking around free.</span> <span id="s1306">And of course the Cold War there so they did away everything, it’s known for it.</span> <span id="s1307">And it hurts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: You mentioned you do a lot of public speaking –</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: – and you have quite an extensive collection</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: – now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: But you didn’t talk about it in the past.</span> <span id="s1315">Do you have children and if yes, what did you tell your children about your childhood and your experiences in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Well, I never wanted to talk from anything, but my son, when I was invited to talk to a church in Stevenson, there in Baltimore, so him with his wife came, and I think that’s the first time he ever heard this, because I never wanted to talk at home.</span> <span id="s1317">And he knows a lot of times when I watch a film that – that I cry a lot.</span> <span id="s1318">I don’t cry, I walk out, so he knows this.</span> <span id="s1319">And he – he knows more about things.</span> <span id="s1320">And I told him about my collection.</span> <span id="s1321">A lot of it I donated, a lot of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1322">Every time I come here I give some here to the museum.</span> <span id="s1323">Of course, I can’t give everything to the museum, cause I got kids to leave some money, cause all my money, I never did the bank, everything went to buy this stuff, because I figured, I went through so much, let me enjoy what I want with my collections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: How many children do you have and how old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Yeah, I have two boys.</span> <span id="s1326">One just got his birthday in July, his 40th birthday and one is 38.</span> <span id="s1327">He is married, and I have my first grandchild, which she is 18 months old, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1328">But the only thing that I complain, he is all the time traveling on planes for a – his job demands a lot, he gives lectures and this, he travels all over.</span> <span id="s1329">For instance, he was only six weeks ago, the first time they send him to Israel, he was only for a day and a half, he saw my sister only for 10 minutes, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1330">He is all the time on the travel, and with a young kid.</span> <span id="s1331">But he is very well loved.</span> <span id="s1332">My other boy is so-so here.</span> <span id="s1333">And then my wife, unfortunately not so well, when you get a little older, with different things, and so it’s not easy, but I manage to do everything.</span> <span id="s1334">And I’m going to talk a lot about my family, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: I – I do want you to go over and tell me what happened to the members of your family, but I would like to ask you for a few moments to reflect about some of the things that happened while you were in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: And the first thing that comes to my mind is the Eichmann trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1341">Well, the Eichmann trial I did follow, and my brother-in-law was there.</span> <span id="s1342">In fact, I have letters from – from the prosecutor, from the [indecipherable] trial, which they gave to my brother-in-law for writing all those articles.</span> <span id="s1343">He – he writes a lot for the army and everything.</span> <span id="s1344">And what bothered me from the Eichmann trials especially, when my brother-in-law wrote me a letter, he says he – I can’t understand.</span> <span id="s1345">There were Israelis at the trial, and he overheard young Israelis, what kind scared people are the Jews?</span> <span id="s1346">Couldn’t they fight back, that they were killed like nothing, and everything.</span> <span id="s1347">And I got very aggravated about it.</span> <span id="s1348">I saw – I was once on Yom HaShoah in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1349">It was couple days sitting past me, he says, Morrie, don’t you – couldn’t I fight back, they go to be killed?</span> <span id="s1350">Just – just – just whatever they tell them to do it?</span> <span id="s1351">And when I was – I was invited to go with a group of Polish officers for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino.</span> <span id="s1352">So I figured I’m gonna go, I was the only Jewish person who [indecipherable], which I went with them, we went to Ossiah(ph), we went to Vienna, we went to Budapest and then Italy, to all the cemeteries where were soldiers from the [indecipherable] army were killed in Italy and they are buried there.</span> <span id="s1353">And it’s a lot of Jewish soldiers are buried there.</span> <span id="s1354">People don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s1355">In Verona, other places.</span> <span id="s1356">In the Monte Cassino we have about between 36 to 40 Jewish soldiers buried there.</span> <span id="s1357">So one of the ladies here, a very intelligent woman from Chicago, she’s a teacher for music and a artist.</span> <span id="s1358">And we were very close because with her I talk intelligent manner.</span> <span id="s1359">And she told me, she says Morris, you tell me one thing.</span> <span id="s1360">Look at the Israelis how they fight and this.</span> <span id="s1361">How come the Jews never fought there in – in – in Poland.</span> <span id="s1362">So I ask her wha – and then it burned me up, so I ask a question.</span> <span id="s1363">I says, Stasia(ph) tell me, how come that 15,000 Polish officers, they were officers, not regular army people, were killed in [indecipherable] murdered in [indecipherable], they never fought back.</span> <span id="s1364">By the way, there were over 800 Jewish soldiers that got killed, officers got killed in [indecipherable] which I have – the names I have in the archives, I was working the archives in Warsaw, I found the names, everything.</span> <span id="s1365">Tell me that the same valiant soldiers from the Russian army, that they captured Berlin, everything, fought so gallantly against the Nazis, over two and a half million got killed, and they went like sheep to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s1366">They didn’t fight back.</span> <span id="s1367">I said, how come so many British POWs got killed, they never fought back?</span> <span id="s1368">In Poland they never fought back.</span> <span id="s1369">I said, who were the first ones to fight, with nothing?</span> <span id="s1370">It was the Jewish uprising in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1371">I said, you show me in all the mankind history, if a person – if a army [indecipherable] is in defense, there is no uprising, they don’t.</span> <span id="s1372">Only when [indecipherable] there’s uprisings.</span> <span id="s1373">I said, the Polish uprising in Warsaw, when did it come?</span> <span id="s1374">When the Russian army were near th – near the – over there.</span> <span id="s1375">And they were near Praga and they didn’t come in, they la-later on killed the Polish uprising.</span> <span id="s1376">That’s what they wanted.</span> <span id="s1377">So then when the – the Pole – I said, people fought back in Sobibor in the camp.</span> <span id="s1378">They fought back even Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1379">They fought back anywhere they can, even the ghettos, when they – when they saw uniforms for the army – for the army, I said.</span> <span id="s1380">I said, Jewish people fought.</span> <span id="s1381">I said, two – two and a quarter million – 250,000 Russian soldiers, Jewish soldiers got killed fighting the Nazis, it’s a fact.</span> <span id="s1382">How many Jews in the British army fell?</span> <span id="s1383">In the French army, in the Greek army, everywhere they fought.</span> <span id="s1384">How many Jewish soldiers fell and fought against the Nazis, American soldiers?</span> <span id="s1385">You go and tell me that they didn’t fight back.</span> <span id="s1386">Give them a chance with what to fight back, but they fought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: During your years in the United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: – did you become involved with any of the Holocaust organizations that were not related to the museum, the – the survivors’ groups, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Well, when we started out in Baltimore when we came, there was a survivors’ group, we had meetings, but only[indecipherable] for three years.</span> <span id="s1391">What happened, people didn’t have time, where they have the groceries, most of them went to grocery stores.</span> <span id="s1392">They were 12 hours a day, they slept there and everything.</span> <span id="s1393">They were dis-integrated.</span> <span id="s1394">I mean, not particularly – there was a – I tried to – I tried to form a group, without success.</span> <span id="s1395">I tried even to put out a Holocaust museum in Baltimore, which I went to the biggest people, which they give donations in the heavy thousands, hundreds of thousands, but to have their name on it.</span> <span id="s1396">But something like this, I went to them, they told me, wa – what do you need here?</span> <span id="s1397">It’s going to be a museum in Washington, it’s a museum Los Angeles, what do we need this here?</span> <span id="s1398">I told them, you don’t need much, just give me a room, like they have in Chicago, they have in Los Angeles, there’s a little museum.</span> <span id="s1399">I will give the material.</span> <span id="s1400">In fact, I was ashamed.</span> <span id="s1401">Three years ago they called me from the Jewish Council, they have the teachers, the Catholic teachers convention in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1402">So they wanted to put up a little exhibit, so there – at the table from the Jewish Council, which I exhibited there, and I was there.</span> <span id="s1403">And they found out that I wanted to put up a museum and to donate this material.</span> <span id="s1404">That priest from the church came to me, we will – you donate the material, we will have in the church a little museum.</span> <span id="s1405">So I says, I am very sorry.</span> <span id="s1406">I can loan you the material, but you asking a little too much.</span> <span id="s1407">What the Christians killed so the Jews, and – and – and the priests didn’t do anything, you ask me from the people, from the victims to donate this kind of material to a church?</span> <span id="s1408">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: This coming week –</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: – there is going to be a march in Washington –</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: – of the neo-Nazi groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: There have been several of these over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: How do you respond to the neo-Nazis and the skinheads in this country and do you think the American Jewish community should be concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: How can you respond?</span> <span id="s1419">When I remember when they opened – the opening of the Holocaust Museum, what is this, almost six years ago.</span> <span id="s1420">Right in front there, where survivors came in were Nazis there marching with placards and the police didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1421">What [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1422">It’s free of speech here, they say, you can do everything.</span> <span id="s1423">But they don’t know from these speeches, what they have now, especially on the Web and everything, it can be another Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1424">How can I react?</span> <span id="s1425">And the best thing, let them go, not to put even the papers this was a march.</span> <span id="s1426">I ca – I started, I never wanted to talk about the Holocaust at all, but when did I start?</span> <span id="s1427">When I heard in Skokie what was go on the marches.</span> <span id="s1428">Then I woke up and I says, now I got to do something, now it’s about time I opened my big mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: How do you think the Holocaust has ec – influenced some of the choices that you’re made in your life personally, professionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Well, with everything I am very bitter.</span> <span id="s1431">If you – you ask me about religion.</span> <span id="s1432">I was very bitter, because where was God, and every survivor will tell you.</span> <span id="s1433">And if people wouldn’t be that fanatic of religious, because a lot of people couldn’t before the war, go to Palestine at that time, but they said no, they have to wait til the Messiah.</span> <span id="s1434">It wouldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1435">A lot of people, if they would have cut their beards and this, they could have maybe survived.</span> <span id="s1436">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1437">And what I found out, a lot of people that they were so religious before the war, friends of mine, they became the biggest thing, they eat everything not kosher, they wouldn’t even go to a synagogue, not even on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1438">And a lot of people that they were not religious, became religious.</span> <span id="s1439">And I tell you, it – ma – I think my boys suffered a lot in the beginning of it, because they saw me and i-it – it does something to the kids.</span> <span id="s1440">It does something.</span> <span id="s1441">But, when you get older, and this – and myself, I thought well, it went through everything, let’s forget it.</span> <span id="s1442">You can’t forget.</span> <span id="s1443">The older you get, the more you remind yourself what happened, the more you wanted to cry what happened.</span> <span id="s1444">You have more time to think about it, before you were busy with your work, with business and this and this.</span> <span id="s1445">Now when it comes you go to bed, everything comes back to you, and especially with me when you work in the museum.</span> <span id="s1446">When you see all the stories and everything is your head – you register everything in you – in you mind, and it comes back to you, everything.</span> <span id="s1447">A lot of the times I came home from work, from here, my wife, uh-oh, uh-oh, you had a tough time.</span> <span id="s1448">She can notice, by the way, that I don’t talk of this and this and this and this.</span> <span id="s1449">But yet, whenever I come to company, I all the time with a smile, I all the time lighten up [indecipherable] and I try to do my best in life what I can.</span> <span id="s1450">When I am in Germany, and I have a lot of German friends, they ask me, and this and this and this and this.</span> <span id="s1451">I says look, the only thing you can do about it, what happened, so to see that it doesn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1452">If you see somewhere the Nazi party and everything, do something about it.</span> <span id="s1453">That’s what you can help, I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: You mentioned that you were thinking of wring a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Can you briefly tell me a little bit about your plan for this book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Well, first of all, I want to talk about my whole family, what everybody in the family went through, because it’s a book in itself from e – every person my family can write a book.</span> <span id="s1458">And my life at home, my life in school, which I remember from the first grade on, the teachers and students and everything.</span> <span id="s1459">And during the war what happened, from everybody from mine family what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s1460">And right after the war, how traumatic it was, everything.</span> <span id="s1461">And yet, you got to go on with your life, and you get situated the best you can, and you try to be happy, and try to raise a family, and to have a future, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1462">And that shouldn’t be forgotten, that’s the main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: You mentioned that you knew what happened to your parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: – during the war.</span> <span id="s1466">Can you go through your siblings one at a time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: – and tell me with each one, their fate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Well, for instance, my parents.</span> <span id="s1470">I – my parents, August 12th was the [indecipherable] in our city, that the th-they – they – the Jewish community, the council, put out notices everybody should come, in the best clothes to be represented nice, and they come there to a field which it’s near the Jewish community, and they’re going – they’re going to register everyone for work and this and this, to come, and we have to be on time.</span> <span id="s1471">That’s six o’clock in the morning we came.</span> <span id="s1472">We were there six in the morning, I won’t go to the – all the history, it’s known, but they took away mine parents at that time, and they marched them all the way to Benzburg(ph), where they were in an orphanage for almost three days.</span> <span id="s1473">I didn’t have the keys to the house to get in, so I ran to Benzburg(ph), which the police didn’t let me in, the Jewish militia.</span> <span id="s1474">One of them recognized me and I says, I got to get the key.</span> <span id="s1475">He says, you might be – not be able get out.</span> <span id="s1476">I said I’d take the chance.</span> <span id="s1477">And when I came in there, I can never forget the scene what I saw.</span> <span id="s1478">People, a lot of them had taleism, how they prayed, an-and they banged themself in the heart [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1479">And I will never forget the scene that it was, my father gave me a watch, he had the watch, and the keys to the house.</span> <span id="s1480">And what happened, I worked at that time by one of the biggest SS men, Dryer(ph), I did some painting for his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1481">And a – a day before I ask him what’s going to be with the parent.</span> <span id="s1482">Oh go, you go there [indecipherable] because I was scared.</span> <span id="s1483">And then I came on with my older bro – why didn’t – you promised me they would take my parents, where are they?</span> <span id="s1484">They took him away.</span> <span id="s1485">Well, I will see what I can do.</span> <span id="s1486">Then two days later is where it was too late, but he didn’t tell me where they went or anything.</span> <span id="s1487">And what happened when I came out from there, from work, and I went home, I went through the fields, never through the city.</span> <span id="s1488">I went through the fields, I notice a train.</span> <span id="s1489">And when I look at the train I saw German army people in the roofs, and this.</span> <span id="s1490">I see through the window Yurinis(ph) Snifell(ph), the father from mine good friend, the one that what I told you, he died in – in – in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1491">He waved to me, I waved back.</span> <span id="s1492">That’s how I knew this is the train that they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1493">And it’s recorded that they were killed in the 17th of August, they were killed.</span> <span id="s1494">And then the first victim was my sister, the one that went on the Exodus.</span> <span id="s1495">She was taken away in the beginning of ’42, May, where they told all young girls, women between 14 and 30 have to register, 14 or 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1496">And of course, my sister was the youngest at home, she was only 14 years old.</span> <span id="s1497">And what I forgot to tell you about my sister, some – which it’s interesting i-in the ghetto what happened.</span> <span id="s1498">I will come back to this wh – time will permit me.</span> <span id="s1499">My sister saw in the window – through the window, a girlfriend of her on the bike.</span> <span id="s1500">And this was about nine in the morning.</span> <span id="s1501">She ran out to greet her, this was Basha(ph) Frotesfike(ph), very fine, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1502">As she ran out, it went by a gendarme, a German gendarme went by and she didn’t have her armband on.</span> <span id="s1503">So she ran quick back to the house, he ran back.</span> <span id="s1504">[indecipherable] to the house, he came to the house.</span> <span id="s1505">He saw my stamp collection, I was doing stamps.</span> <span id="s1506">Right away he came, you can’t have this.</span> <span id="s1507">He took it away, he says, the German government will pay you, you can’t have this.</span> <span id="s1508">He probably was collecting, he took it away.</span> <span id="s1509">And they took to court my sister and she got for three weeks a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1510">Of course my mother was crying, how can she go, so my mother went to prison instead of her, because a young girl, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s1511">Three weeks.</span> <span id="s1512">I went almost every second day with food to the prison to give her kosher food.</span> <span id="s1513">And that’s what happened, it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1514">And then they took – what I said, they said to register the girls, they took into Sosnowiec to the dulac(ph), and they sent 450 girls away, all the cream from the youngsters from our city, and they send them to a camp, Gruenberg [indecipherable] that’s where I came.</span> <span id="s1515">This is one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: And you’ve mentioned some of your other siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Who in your family did not survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1520">Well, it was Leosia, the oldest.</span> <span id="s1521">She died on the death march from Stutthof, yeah.</span> <span id="s1522">Then was Yehiel.</span> <span id="s1523">He died, they took him to Auschwitz with the whole family, with – with four children, one which it’s listed on the picture, on the pamphlets from the Red Cross, I have the picture.</span> <span id="s1524">And with his wife the whole family got wiped out.</span> <span id="s1525">Then was Ruchcia and Tamara.</span> <span id="s1526">She escaped howe – to Russia, which as – a witness from my city, they saw them going to the Russian side, and he says, come on, let’s go in deep.</span> <span id="s1527">And she says no, I have to go back home, I want to see my father.</span> <span id="s1528">When they tried to go back home, and that’s where I know the last thing I heard of them.</span> <span id="s1529">One, Sala, she ran to the underground, her and her husband, they have a little boy.</span> <span id="s1530">And she went on the underground and they were near Kraków, and they send him – End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: – it’s a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Morris Rosen.</span> <span id="s1532">This is tape three, side B, and you were telling me about your sister –</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: – who went to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Yeah, she went to the underground, to her husband with a little kid, and they send them away to undermine some rails, you know, for train.</span> <span id="s1536">When he came back there were four girls, four Jewish girls, it was in the PPR, the pepperarr(ph), this was the worker’s underground.</span> <span id="s1537">They were more leftists.</span> <span id="s1538">And when came back all the four girls were cut the throats and the stomachs.</span> <span id="s1539">And she was dead and the kid was alive, all bloody from the blood.</span> <span id="s1540">They didn’t hurt him, but bloody.</span> <span id="s1541">He grabbed the kid, he washed it off, ran away, and in Kraków he went to a building – you know the buildings have there staircases where you can – windows look out?</span> <span id="s1542">And he put the kid near a monastery, on the steps from a monastery.</span> <span id="s1543">He was there for about an hour watching window, and he saw somebody came out, a nun, and they took the kid away.</span> <span id="s1544">And he ran away.</span> <span id="s1545">He ran away back to Lvov, to Lemberg, where he came from, he was in Lemberg.</span> <span id="s1546">And what I know about it, what we found out, and this is from her husband’s brother, what we found out.</span> <span id="s1547">Her husband’s brother was a officer in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1548">And when he came back to Lemberg, when they liberated Lvov, they came from there, he found his brother, mine sister’s husband and he told him the story what happened to her, and with the kid.</span> <span id="s1549">The same day they were sitting a restaurant, a drunken Russian soldier killed my sister’s husband.</span> <span id="s1550">The day from the liberation.</span> <span id="s1551">So anyway, he knew about the kid, so after the war they put in the paper they’re looking for this kid, and they offered a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1552">In fact, I think that the HIAS or some Jewish organization offered a lot of money, a reward for – for give information about that kid that was here – he had taken away.</span> <span id="s1553">It took about two months, came a telephone, and they let them know that they know about the kid [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1554">They went there, no, gave him away already.</span> <span id="s1555">He went to another place where we gave him – he’s on a farm.</span> <span id="s1556">When he came there toward the farm, he saw a little boy in the pasture, barefoot that the cows, and the little boy started to yell in Polish, help, help, that the Jews want to kill me.</span> <span id="s1557">[speaks Polish here] They probably trained that little kid against the Jews that they shouldn’t be – either suspect he’s Jewish or something, they never know.</span> <span id="s1558">But anyway he came in, he wanted the kid, they wouldn’t give him.</span> <span id="s1559">He says, I give you so much money.</span> <span id="s1560">No, they don’t have kids.</span> <span id="s1561">They held him all during the war and this, it’s his, that they’re not give away.</span> <span id="s1562">He says, but I want to pay for every – no, no money can do.</span> <span id="s1563">We – we love him and everything.</span> <span id="s1564">Well, he saw he didn’t have no – anything to do, he took a couple Jewish comrades from the army, he went back with the guns there, and he says, okay, either we take him, or you gonna get killed when we take him.</span> <span id="s1565">Anyway, they grabbed the kid – there were four soldiers, they grabbed the kid, they left money on the table and ran away.</span> <span id="s1566">When they ran away they threw away their uniforms, smuggled themselve over to Italy, and then from Italy illegal to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1567">And my oldest sister that came back from Russia when they came to Palestine, she found out about it, she wanted the kid because she’s a aunt.</span> <span id="s1568">But they went to court in Jerusalem and they gave the kid to the uncle because he risked his life, and – and so anyway, I met a nice – he looks like my brother exactly.</span> <span id="s1569">This was happened to the other sister.</span> <span id="s1570">And so I lost four sisters and a brother and the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: The brother-in-law that you mentioned, that worked in Nuremberg and worked in the Jerusalem trial –</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: – of Eichmann, the same brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: No.</span> <span id="s1575">This is the brother from my oldest sister Leosia, that he – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Well, explain who was who [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: In the – Leosia, yeah.</span> <span id="s1578">This is – his name was Shaptai(ph) Kloneman(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Klugman.</span> <span id="s1581">The one from Warsaw that – that my oldest sister died and – on the way, on the death march from Stutthof, and he’s the one, the correspondent that wrote many books, and that was at the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s1582">That’s him.</span> <span id="s1583">His name, if you w-want to see, is under Kah(ph) Shaptai.</span> <span id="s1584">Klugman Shaptai(ph) [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1585">But he was also known as Scheinfeld(ph).</span> <span id="s1586">He changed his name, he was afraid from the Polish from the underground things, so he changed his name after his mother’s parents, Scheinfeld [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1587">And his son, his son, when he came over here and changed his name also to Scheinfeld(ph).</span> <span id="s1588">He was afraid Klugman because he was at the international trial, they have something, he was – and somebody recognize him from Warsaw [indecipherable] he said that’s not him, so he shortened his name to Field so his name is now Field, it’s not Scheinfeld, just Field.</span> <span id="s1589">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: And which brother-in-law covered the – or worked at the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Well, this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: The same one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: The same one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: The same one.</span> <span id="s1596">Q: I have just another one or two questions for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1598">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Excuse me, we had to take a quick break.</span> <span id="s1600">We are back now.</span> <span id="s1601">I wanted to ask you if there is anything that you wanted to mention that I didn’t ask you, about your life in this country since the war, and/or about your work at the museum.</span> <span id="s1602">Anything that we didn’t cover that you would like to include before we end the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Well, I would say, I made myself a happy life, the best I can, and was very constructive.</span> <span id="s1604">I am very busy with the philatelic organizations, which I travel a awful lot, I go four or five times overseas a year, which I am invited.</span> <span id="s1605">And it’s fun being judging at the shows because you meet so many people around the world.</span> <span id="s1606">The only thing that it’s bad, that I have about 40 – 50 letters to write monthly.</span> <span id="s1607">But on the other hand, it’s nice to know people everywhere.</span> <span id="s1608">Wherever I travel, if I go I feel at home and – and very nice, and that’s mine payback.</span> <span id="s1609">And otherwise, I enjoy the museum, I enjoy the people here, nice to work with them, and I know that my work here will help for future generations, that I do something constructive for the museum.</span> <span id="s1610">And that’s all [indecipherable] that I can pay back something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: I want to thank you for speaking with me today
