Dayton.</span> <span id="s3">As part of the “Oral History Project” of the “Survivors of the Holocaust” who live in this area, I am interviewing Mrs. Lilly Levine 09 May 1981 at 02:00 p.m. in her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Let us start with date of your birth and place of your birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: I was born March 31, 1925.</span> <span id="s6">I am 56 years old.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in a small town of Kulsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Did you grow up in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: We lived there until I was approximately two and half years old.</span> <span id="s10">Then we moved into Frankfurt on Main, and that is where I lived until we left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Tell me a little about the first town that you lived in...where it is?</span> <span id="s12">...what kind of town it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: It is a small town in the area of Wurzburg, which is a university town.</span> <span id="s14">It is probably 100 miles or so from Frankfurt, maybe not that far.</span> <span id="s15">The town had, I understand, about 127 Jewish families in it from about a population of about 1000 approx.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: How did your family come to that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s18">They seemed to have lived there for at least 3 or 4 generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Did you own your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I had one brother who was 4 1/2 years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Did any other family members live with you in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My mother and father and brother, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father had a store-general type department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did he own it?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did your mother work there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes, she did at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Do you remember anything about your life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Quite a bit.</span> <span id="s33">It probably seems strange since I was that young when I left there but I do remember attending a nursery school which was run by Catholic nuns.</span> <span id="s34">I remember that at graduation they gave a play and my mother made my costume - I was an angel.</span> <span id="s35">I remember some of the people in the town.</span> <span id="s36">I was very fond of someone that lived catty-corner across the street.</span> <span id="s37">An elderly gentleman, by the name - I called him Feist (that means “stout”) and he used to take me in his buggy riding around the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: At the nursery school you went to was it for Jewish and Non-Jewish students?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, I think my father and mother had good relations with the rest of the community - and there was no problem as far as that went at the time, in the 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: When did you first become aware of any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I believe that it probably was after we moved to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When did you move to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I believe that it was in 1927 or early 28.</span> <span id="s44">I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Do you know why you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I think that my father wanted us to be in a school that would be Jewish and would be a little more sophisticated, than what would have been available in Kulsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What education did your parents have, that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I think the usual at that time which was 8th grade education.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Can you tell me anything about your religious life?</span> <span id="s50">When you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: That I don’t remember that much, but my parents were Orthodox Jews and they observed all the religious things.</span> <span id="s52">They kept kosher, observed the holidays and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you attend Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What was the principal language spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: German</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did your parents speak any other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, my father knew French, but they didn’t speak it with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did they do a lot of travelling?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: My father did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Was it for recreation or was it for his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Business.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Would you consider yourself to have been among the richer of the community?</span> <span id="s64">Maybe amongst the poorer?</span> <span id="s65">or in between?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I would say “in between.”</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did your parents relate socially with the other - non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Can you remember any?</span> <span id="s70">Specific?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, from Kulsheim, I know that my father belonged to clubs and, of course, I mentioned the nursery school.</span> <span id="s72">Naturally most of the customers in the store were from the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s73">As far as friendships go, I don’t recall that much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Was that also true in Frankfurt, that the clientele of the store was basically non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My father did not have a store in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s76">He was a salesman for a wholesale jewelry company.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: To what extent would you say that the Synagogue was or was not the center of the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s78">Maybe in Frankfurt you remember better.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: It very definitely was a center of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s80">I also went to a school that was a Jewish school and that, very much, was a center also of the activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Could you name some of these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: The religious observances, and holy days and so forth.</span> <span id="s83">Sometimes things like concerts and speeches and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: How about politics?</span> <span id="s85">Was your family involved in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Not involved, as such, in politics, but very interested.</span> <span id="s87">Very aware of it and I was made very aware of it even at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Through conversations at home</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Through conversations at home and because I think there was a lot of concern about what was happening in politics.</span> <span id="s90">Of course, at the time Hitler gained power in 1933, and just before that, there was a lot of parading and speeches and so forth.</span> <span id="s91">I remember the symbols of what I think were the 3 main groups that were vying for that election.</span> <span id="s92">Of course the Nazi’s had, what they called the Hagenkreutz - which is the swastika; the Communist’s party had the hammer and sickle; and there was another party, and I can’t remember what it was called, their symbol was 3 arrows side by side.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What year are you referring to here?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: This was right before Hitler was elected, I believe in January 1933, so the campaign must have been the 2 or 3 months before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How would you describe your childhood in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I think that up to a certain point, it was a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s97">I felt very loved and secure.</span> <span id="s98">When I was about 6 years old my mother became ill and eventually died in Jan. of 1933, when I was a little over 7.</span> <span id="s99">She died of cancer at that point so it was a family tragedy that we went through at that point and at the same time Hitler began at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How did your mother’s death affect your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: There were various ramifications of course.</span> <span id="s102">At first it restricted my father from traveling since my mother was in the hospital a lot of the time while she was ill.</span> <span id="s103">I grieved very much - I think that all of us did.</span> <span id="s104">It was a very insecure time, of course, otherwise also, economically and politically.</span> <span id="s105">All these things coming together made for a lot of insecurity and fear and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What do you remember about the economic problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Of course, in the 20’s Germany went through this terrible inflation period.</span> <span id="s108">It caused great havoc.</span> <span id="s109">Once Hitler came into power - and my mother was already dead it restricted my father very much from traveling or conducting his business.</span> <span id="s110">It was very difficult for him to earn a living after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What about your buying power?</span> <span id="s112">The things you needed for the home?</span> <span id="s113">Did you have problems buying what you needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: You mean food or clothing or things like that?</span> <span id="s115">Probably some - that doesn’t register with me (she was 7 years old).</span> <span id="s116">I think that there probably some problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you continue to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Now you said that this was a Jewish school?</span> <span id="s120">Can you tell me any more about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: The school was called “Philanthropin” (LL spelled).</span> <span id="s122">It was a school founded probably 125 years prior to that year.</span> <span id="s123">It was a school to teach both Hebrew and religion as well as the secular subjects.</span> <span id="s124">It was one of 2 or 3 other Jewish schools in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s125">When Hitler came to power, I believe it was probably around 1934, Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to public schools and those who had been going to public schools were kicked out and were taken in by schools like the Philanthropin.</span> <span id="s126">Also (Jewish) teachers in the public schools and the universities were no longer allowed to teach so some of them became teachers there.</span> <span id="s127">Probably, before Hitler, I would say, that student body may have been 400 students after Hitler, it became about 800.</span> <span id="s128">It was a school which went from 1st grade all the way through high school, the foreign languages were taught and my brother learned French and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: At the grade level I was, I learned Hebrew - learned to read Hebrew not really to speak it, also I could understand some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: The main language spoken in the school then was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What about your associations in school?</span> <span id="s134">Friends?</span> <span id="s135">Were they mostly Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: There were only Jews in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you have friends outside of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, at some point, we did but not after Hitler came into power because something seemed to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What would that happen to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: We had neighbors who lived in the same apartment building with us, who were very good friends at one point.</span> <span id="s141">When my mother first went into the hospital they insisted upon us having dinner at their house - they couldn’t do enough for us.</span> <span id="s142">There was a time, and I know Hitler wasn’t in (power) yet, we had all gone to a main street where there was a parade taking place.</span> <span id="s143">My father went back to the house to get a chair for my mother who was temporarily out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s144">On the way he was beaten up by these people.</span> <span id="s145">So something was already happening when people were (beaten up with impunity).</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: That was the something which (happened later)?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s148">The reason why I brought that up was that their children I had played with them, they had been my friends.</span> <span id="s149">But after that no more!</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Do you remember any other incidents that made you feel that a difference had occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Lots of them.</span> <span id="s152">One of them was: leaving school one day a bunch of hoodlums were outside and threw stones at us.</span> <span id="s153">I was actually hurt by it and scared by it; after that my father would drop everything and come pick me up after school, rather than letting me go by myself.</span> <span id="s154">But after the incident I mentioned, of my father being beaten up by this people he became - all of us became very suspicious of anybody we knew and we no longer continued relationships.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What did the general feeling seem to be among your friends and neighbors who were Jewish about what was going on?</span> <span id="s156">What was the reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Everyone was (naturally) very concerned.</span> <span id="s158">Some people were hopeful, I believe that it would blow over, that it wasn’t permanent thing which was going to go on.</span> <span id="s159">I think that you always hope for the best.</span> <span id="s160">I think that my father, probably more than most people, began very early to look for a way out of Germany, because he was very concerned about what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Why do you think he started so early?</span> <span id="s162">To think about a way to leave?</span> <span id="s163">Any specific incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s165">I think the beating he received and when he, at that time he went to the police to report the incident, and they told him to forget about it and that, if he came back to report anything else they would arrest him.</span> <span id="s166">So I think that he felt that there no longer was any law or anything you could go by that you know would be there tomorrow.</span> <span id="s167">Each week there was some new regulation - something else was happening - after Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: At that time did you consider yourself to be more German or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I don’t think that I distinguished between the two.</span> <span id="s170">I thought that I was German and I knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s171">There was no distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did the Jewish community become tighter and more closely associated?</span> <span id="s173">Did they try to help each other in anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh, they definitely tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s175">I think that there had been the care right along.</span> <span id="s176">There had been a closeness right along.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: In what ways were they able to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I am not sure (I can answer that).</span> <span id="s179">You know that they had always been a charitable group that helped each other.</span> <span id="s180">I know that people supported the schools and had to give extra support to the schools after additional students came there.</span> <span id="s181">I think that there were groups that tried to probably direct you how you could get out of the country, how you could get to another country.</span> <span id="s182">That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you or did your father partake in any of these organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I am sure that he did.</span> <span id="s185">I can’t say specifically what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: What about his job?</span> <span id="s187">Were there changes in his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes, definitely because at a certain point he could no longer travel and his job did require traveling.</span> <span id="s189">He couldn’t leave Germany that easily on business because passports were not that easily given by Hitler’s government.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Were there any changes in your religious life?</span> <span id="s191">For your family and in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did anything in particular happen to your own family, when Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s194">You mentioned that your father didn’t lose his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: We did move a number of times, each time to a cheaper place, because economics became quite a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Within Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you remember any of the reactions among the non-Jews in your community to the new policies?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: As far as I knew the people that we knew of they went along with whatever was done by Hitler.</span> <span id="s200">It seemed like mass hysteria, where everyone went along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What about the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I know that my father occasionally would get a copy of “Der Sturmer” (spelled) which was a rag written by one of Hitler’s propagandists.</span> <span id="s203">There would always be anti-Semitic diatribes and that sort of thing in there.</span> <span id="s204">I don’t remember if the regular paper in Frankfurt had this type of propaganda in it.</span> <span id="s205">It may have.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did your father share the news with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Oh yes, or I would read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: How did you feel as a 7 or 8 year old?</span> <span id="s209">How did you comprehend what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I believe that it added to the feeling of insecurity and (apprehension) of what might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did you fear that something would happen to you or your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s213">I knew that I used to wait in the evening for my father to come home.</span> <span id="s214">I used to watch out the window and look at people a block away.</span> <span id="s215">I could tell his walk before I could really distinguish his face, and I always wait there, waiting very fearfully that he might not (come).</span> <span id="s216">The German word for arrested was: “Verhaftet” which had a terrible meaning to me.</span> <span id="s217">And I was always fearful that my father, if he wasn’t home on time - if he was even 5 minutes late, that he was Verhaftet.</span> <span id="s218">It is something that did happen to friends around us and also to my uncle who lived in a small town.</span> <span id="s219">He was taken to a concentration camp and later released.</span> <span id="s220">But it was a terrible, terrible fear which I had.</span> <span id="s221">I remember one time when I was walking - I believed that it was a Saturday morning walk to the Synagogue - on the corner were a number of soldiers.</span> <span id="s222">I do believe that they were SA (Brown Shirted, uniformed members of the Hitlerite Sturm Abteilung), with machine guns.</span> <span id="s223">And as I got to the next corner there was some more there.</span> <span id="s224">I remember things like this.</span> <span id="s225">Yes, that produced a little fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Why would the people that you know be arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Because they were Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: They were using that as an excuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Goodness knows: they may have used excused, but it was because they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t think that they even bothered with excuses.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Your uncle who was arrested, did he come from your father’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, he was my mother’s sister’s husband, and he managed to get out later on one of the last flights out of Germany.</span> <span id="s233">He came to this country then.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did you hear about any violence against any of the Jewish business?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What do you remember</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Very often there would be either breaking a window, some businesses were even forcibly closed.</span> <span id="s238">They couldn’t operate or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: What were most of the people doing?</span> <span id="s240">As a result of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I think that those that were affected by this type of thing probably tried to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s242">We had many friends who went to Holland or to France.</span> <span id="s243">But some of these people were later on killed in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Were people frowned upon for leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s246">I think that those who were not leaving very often were envious of those who could and did.</span> <span id="s247">Many of them, at the early point that we left, were not as eager to leave yet and thought that this would blow over.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Do you remember anything about the Zionist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes, I know that there were people who were part of it.</span> <span id="s250">I know that we went to see someone at one point, when it looked as if we couldn’t come to the U.S., to see if we could immigrate to what was then Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Who did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Someone who apparently interviewed people about going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: A Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Do you remember any incidence where you were not allowed to go to a meeting or to a theatre?</span> <span id="s256">Were you kept out of certain institutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I don’t remember that and I am not sure if that was happening at the point when we were still there.</span> <span id="s258">It probably was happening or at least beginning to - but I don’t specifically remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What date in 1935 did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: February 12 is when we left Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Before the Nuremberg laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Can you tell me about any other incidents which happened in school or in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Maybe we can come back to that.</span> <span id="s265">Right now I can’t (think of any).</span> <span id="s266">There were probably many.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You said that your father had considered leaving once Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s269">I think that from that point on his aim was to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Do you know how he went about it?</span> <span id="s271">About being able to.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: My mother had cousins in Cincinnati who, through their efforts and good will, made it possible for us to get visas to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s273">We had gone to the American consulate in Stuttgart about one year before our final visit there.</span> <span id="s274">At that time, my father was very, very puzzled because we were turned down since they said that he had a dislocated shoulder or something like that, which wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s275">So he simply replied and came back and was finally given a visa for us to come over.</span> <span id="s276">I know that my mother’s cousins I think got the help of a Congressman, at that time and were able to get us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: How many members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: 3 of us.</span> <span id="s279">My father, brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: How did you feel about leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I think that I was delighted to leave.</span> <span id="s282">I was really ready.</span> <span id="s283">A number of things had happened and I was eager to leave.</span> <span id="s284">There was no fear of new places or anything.</span> <span id="s285">I was so eager to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you speak any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s288">My brother spoke a little and he taught me to say “I am afraid I don’t speak English.”</span> <span id="s289">And that was the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You said that a number of things had happened are you referring to additional incidents that haven’t talked about yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes, they were not major things, as far as I remember but a lot of things that added to my feeling of fear and insecurity.</span> <span id="s292">I was really very eager to leave.</span> <span id="s293">I know that my father was too.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Can you mention any of these incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: That is what I answered to before.</span> <span id="s296">I had been very independent, up to a certain point, and walked everywhere to school, to Synagogue, where I went to play with someone and it got to the point where my father wouldn’t consider even my walking anywhere anymore and felt that he had to accompany me.</span> <span id="s297">Various things of this sort.</span> <span id="s298">We were hearing reports of friends who were “Verhaftet,” arrested, and taken away with no explanation - and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: You said that the population of your school doubled.</span> <span id="s300">Do you know of any other changes which occurred as the result of that in your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Outside of the fact that our class was put in an annex because there was no more room in the school.</span> <span id="s302">The annex was a little way from the school.</span> <span id="s303">They had to find room in other places to hold classes and a number of new teachers came, of course.</span> <span id="s304">I think that outside of that we were well aware of what was going on, that there were other new children coming in from other schools which they could no longer attend and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What was the general feeling at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Of course no one was happy about it and the general feeling was that you did the best you could with it.</span> <span id="s307">We were still children and played and this sort of thing; but we were also aware of some of the things going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did most of the students and teachers feel that this was going to be a permanent change?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I am not sure that I can answer that.</span> <span id="s310">I think probably so.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What about the religious life of the average student there?</span> <span id="s312">Were most families orthodox in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: The students at the school, yes, because it was a traditional Jewish day school and religious school, where the teaching of religious subjects was combined with the secular subjects.</span> <span id="s314">Everyone was quite observant - very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Was this maintained in spite of the influx of new students?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s317">It continued!</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Did you have any friends in school who were leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s320">There were some who left before we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Were most of them coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No, I think that they were going to places like Holland or France; places like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What grade did you get up to in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Fourth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: How did you first find out that you were coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: As I said, my father had worked very hard to try to have us leave Germany and come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s327">We had to go to the American Consulate in Stuttgart and I knew of course at that point that we were trying to come and hoped very strongly that we would get to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did you bring anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yes, I think that at that time we were allowed to bring either 10 Marks or $10.00.</span> <span id="s330">I can’t remember which in money.</span> <span id="s331">So we just brought suitcases of things we wore.</span> <span id="s332">We brought very little, otherwise.</span> <span id="s333">We were actually afraid to bring anything of value in case that would cause friction where they wouldn’t let us come.</span> <span id="s334">We left anything which might have amounted to anything, was worth anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you have any trouble getting out?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No not really.</span> <span id="s337">I remember that when we were getting on the boat, some official took our passports and told us that he had to check them or something, and that brought fear to us.</span> <span id="s338">Maybe about one hour later he came back and we were able to get on the boat without any trouble.</span> <span id="s339">We were on a U.S. Line boat.</span> <span id="s340">So, once we left Hamburg we thought that we were already in the United States and away from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Did you have trouble getting from Frankfurt to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No.</span> <span id="s343">We took a train and that was that.</span> <span id="s344">There was no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did you know other people on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No.</span> <span id="s347">Not when we got on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did you receive any help while you were still in Germany from any Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: I am not sure about this.</span> <span id="s350">I do know that at times, after school, I would go to a Jewish Center, until my father could come and pick me up.</span> <span id="s351">I know that I went away on a trip to a family out in the country, that was sponsored by some Jewish organization, more or less, as a vacation type thing for one week in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Was it in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes, I believe that it was.</span> <span id="s354">I remember that I wrote a letter to the Jewish newspaper from there and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did the newspaper continue?</span> <span id="s356">Was it published?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">As long as we remained there.</span> <span id="s359">I don’t know about later.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And the school remained opened?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s362">The school remained open, according to the book which I received from the school until 1938 or 1939.</span> <span id="s363">Apparently after Kristalnacht the teachers and any students over 16 were taken to concentration camps and they closed the school for a period of time.</span> <span id="s364">Some of the people came back from the concentration camps and they were able to reopen it for a short time.</span> <span id="s365">There weren’t that many students left then.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: How did you receive that information?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I have a book that was written by various teachers, and the students in the school, and people who were there at the end.</span> <span id="s368">The book is printed by the city of Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When did they print it?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Probably in the early 50-’s, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did someone send it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: I don’t think that we mentioned your maiden name before.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It was Weissbacher (spelled by LL).</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: You mentioned that you had family in Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes, cousins of my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: How did they happen to be in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: This, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s381">I believe that their parents had emigrated to the U.S. and the cousins had been born in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did you directly come to this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes, to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s384">After a day in New York we came directly to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did anyone meet you in NYC?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, we were on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you have any problem getting from N.Y. to Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: NO, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did your father speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, he didn’t, not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: My brother was able to get a few words across.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Did you keep contact with home, in Germany after your arrival in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Could you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Do you mean friends or relatives?</span> <span id="s397">Yes , my father had a brother, his brother Arno (spelled) who lived in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s398">He had a wife and a son.</span> <span id="s399">We regularly corresponded with him, of course.</span> <span id="s400">My father had urged him to make arrangements to try to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s401">He did not seem to feel that it was necessary.</span> <span id="s402">He thought that things would get better.</span> <span id="s403">He had a chemical import business.</span> <span id="s404">He too, later on, couldn’t conduct his business any further and around 1938, I believe that it was maybe one month before the Kristalnacht - some incidents evidently had happened to him, which he really couldn’t write about because the letters were always opened and censored and what have you.</span> <span id="s405">He wrote that he now my father to try to get a visa for him (and his wife and son).</span> <span id="s406">My father, of course immediately went to work on it.</span> <span id="s407">Although at that point we had not become citizens.</span> <span id="s408">I believe that it took 5 years (to become a citizen).</span> <span id="s409">We had someone who countersigned for it and we tried to get the papers.</span> <span id="s410">My uncle wrote that he had applied for a number - the number was somewhere in the 21 thousands - and he said we have to wait until that number comes up - please don’t send the papers, until I tell you because they have to be within 3 months of our being seen there (at the consulate).</span> <span id="s411">Well, to make a long story short, this was in 1938 - inn 1941 he was still waiting for his number to come up.</span> <span id="s412">The last letter was sometime in 1941, it said that the consulate in Stuttgart is closed and only Berlin is open but that he didn’t know if he could get into that consulate.</span> <span id="s413">We never heard from him further.</span> <span id="s414">My brother did some checking right after the war because he was there with the U.S. army of occupation.</span> <span id="s415">Apparently, my uncle and his wife were taken to a city by the name of Riga, which used to be the capital of Latvia.</span> <span id="s416">It was one of these situations where they were lined up in front of a ditch and machine-gunned.</span> <span id="s417">And he (my brother) found out that my cousin was in one of the concentration camps - Buchenwald, I believe, and apparently lived until about 3 or 4 days before the Americans came.</span> <span id="s418">He died of starvation, my brother gathered.</span> <span id="s419">So that is as much as we found out about them.</span> <span id="s420">We kept in touch with friends, of course and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Did they tell you much about what their life was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: No.</span> <span id="s423">They didn’t dare write things.</span> <span id="s424">I know my uncle wrote in one of his letters: “So and so is no longer at home.”</span> <span id="s425">Otherwise said using an euphemism to say that someone was taken to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s426">However, he would not have dared say the actual thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Were they able to receive your letters intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Not all of them.</span> <span id="s429">I believe that we started numbering them and not all arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How about your life in the U.S.?</span> <span id="s431">Could you describe what it was like when you first got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: We lived for a short time with my mother’s cousins.</span> <span id="s433">I went to Avondale School in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s434">I was placed with a teacher who understands some German and could speak German but I believe that she only spoke English to me.</span> <span id="s435">It was a very short time.</span> <span id="s436">I think that within one month I felt comfortable speaking English.</span> <span id="s437">I remember that I woke one morning and I was thrilled to death about the fact that I had dreamed in English.</span> <span id="s438">That was the point where I felt that I was really going to learn English well.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Was this a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No.</span> <span id="s441">It was a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Did you have any problems with acceptance?</span> <span id="s443">The students accepting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I don’t think so, not really.</span> <span id="s445">Of course, there were students of various economic levels and I know that my father - this was still during the depression - he felt very fortunate to get a job in a meatpacking plant.</span> <span id="s446">The pay was very minimal - very low.</span> <span id="s447">He had never, earlier in his life, done hard physical labor.</span> <span id="s448">He was very proud of himself that he was able to do it.</span> <span id="s449">This was the only work which was open to him at that time, with the language and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I believe that he started in Junior H.S., probably.</span> <span id="s452">He learned English very quickly also.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And your father learned English?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: My father went to night school, as part of citizenship classes, and also to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: He decided immediately to become a U.S. citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: I asked you earlier if you considered yourself more German than Jewish.</span> <span id="s458">What about now, when you were in the U.S.?</span> <span id="s459">How did you feel about yourself in that respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Of course, the German part - you can’t help being whatever you were born into - I certainly didn’t have very good feelings about the Germans; but I guess that at the time I considered myself as a German who was coming here.</span> <span id="s461">Now I think of myself as an American - sometimes, I don’t even think of the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Why do you think that your father was anxious to be a U.S. citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I guess that he wanted to make his life here.</span> <span id="s464">This was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: How long did you live with your cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A; Probably a few months and then we got our own apartment and we lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did you continue to go to the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes, of yes.</span> <span id="s469">We lived in the same area.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did you receive any help from any organization in the U.S.?</span> <span id="s471">In the Cincinnati area?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A; No.</span> <span id="s473">We were strictly on our own.</span> <span id="s474">I know that my father’s income was very low but we, somehow or other, managed to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Do you remember much about your school life?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Some, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: How would it compare to your school life in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: First, it was a public school instead of the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s479">The religious training stopped at that point.</span> <span id="s480">I think that probably, in some areas, in my school in Germany, there were more advanced.</span> <span id="s481">I think that writing skill and mathematics and things like that probably were somewhat advanced over where they were here.</span> <span id="s482">Then, in Germany the girls were separated from the boys in the lower grades.</span> <span id="s483">They even had their own playgrounds.</span> <span id="s484">For some reason or other they didn’t intermingle; whereas here, of course, that is not done.</span> <span id="s485">Outside of that the experiences were probably similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How about with your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Of course I had friends which I had had over several years in Germany.</span> <span id="s488">But I made some very close friendships here.</span> <span id="s489">I would say (that aspect was) similar.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t think that I had any difficulties making friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Were they mostly Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: I think that my friends were mostly Jewish, although there were some non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Was the principal language spoken at home English or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: My brother and I spoke English and my father had to revert to German occasionally, but eventually we all spoke English.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did your father ever remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: How about your religious life, in what way did that change or remain the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I think that my father remained very orthodox and we kept kosher and probably our religious practices may have fallen off somewhat because I think, mainly the milieu that we found here wasn’t as jewishly concentrated as it had been in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q; Did your father remain with the same occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A; Not totally, but for a long time he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: What did he go into after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: He went into business with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you remember when the war broke out between the US and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: What thoughts did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I remember first of all in 1939 - I believe that it was Sept of 39 when the Nazis invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s507">I was very concerned at that time about what was happening with family and friends and so forth.</span> <span id="s508">I did follow that situation very closely.</span> <span id="s509">Of course, once the U.S. was at war with Germany any correspondence with our relatives stopped completely.</span> <span id="s510">Up to that point we had continued to hear from my uncle and so forth.</span> <span id="s511">We were even able to, through England or Denmark, to send kosher meat to my uncle.</span> <span id="s512">That was apparently sent in frozen.</span> <span id="s513">He had been able to get that.</span> <span id="s514">However, once the war began that was the end and that was also his end.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Did the war make any other changes in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: My brother was then around 20 years of age.</span> <span id="s517">In 1943 he did graduate from the University of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s518">As soon as he graduated he was drafted into the army.</span> <span id="s519">That made a big change.</span> <span id="s520">He was sent overseas and was in England and then later on went into Germany, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Were there any problems with that?</span> <span id="s522">How did you feel his being of German origin affected him?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: He went in with the army of occupation to Germany.</span> <span id="s524">Because he knew German, he was able to do some things.</span> <span id="s525">I guess that he got some special jobs in so far as what he did with the army of occupation, including interrogating and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: He had no internal problems with being drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s528">By internal problems do you mean fight against Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: How he felt about it personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, of course, he wanted to see Hitler defeated!</span> <span id="s531">It was more that he was going and fighting against the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What did you do during the wartime?</span> <span id="s533">Were you still in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I graduated from H.S. in 1943.</span> <span id="s535">And from that point on I wanted to do all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s536">I wanted to go over there.</span> <span id="s537">I even wrote a letter to President Roosevelt, saying “no one wants me because I am not 21 yet?”</span> <span id="s538">or something like that.</span> <span id="s539">I wanted desperately to do something to assist my country.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Militarily, you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I don’t know if militarily but to help somewhere with the war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: What would you have liked to be able to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I don’t know I had in mind.</span> <span id="s544">But eventually I went to work for a research project with Curtis-Wright on an airplane which really had nothing to do with Europe, but with the war against Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did you receive an answer to your letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I think that I did.</span> <span id="s547">It was written by one of his assistants.</span> <span id="s548">I don’t even remember what it said, only that it didn’t get me anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Did you attend college?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s551">I went to Ohio University and graduated from there.</span> <span id="s552">I attended graduate school at the University of Denver in social work.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What about your father, and during the war and such?</span> <span id="s554">Did his life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Not other than that he was a newshound and listened to every report and read the paper and otherwise kept up with things which were going on.</span> <span id="s556">He was very concerned about what was happening to his family and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Did he continue to work at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Do you attend the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes, we do.</span> <span id="s561">It is a reformed congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: To what extent do you feel that it is the center of Jewish Community life?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Let’s talk about when you were in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I think that it probably was the center at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And here?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I think that here also.</span> <span id="s568">There are now auxiliary things like the Jewish Center, but it (the Synagogue) is the center I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Would you say that it differs from what it was in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, very definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: I think that in Frankfurt - which is the place I remember - the Synagogue was mainly a place to worship.</span> <span id="s573">Here it assimilates more of the everyday life.</span> <span id="s574">It circumvents the practice of strict orthodoxy, except for the most diehard people.</span> <span id="s575">it is not conducive as much as it was in Europe.</span> <span id="s576">I think that our orientation is not as strict and as orthodox as it had been for my family in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Do you think that that is good or bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I don’t think you can put it into this framework.</span> <span id="s579">I think that it is a matter of changes: changes of times, changes of what people do.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: What about your outside associations?</span> <span id="s581">How would they differ from what they would have been in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: First of all, in Europe I am not sure that I am able to say what really went on because I was looking at it from a young child’s viewpoint and here we have made a different kind of life.</span> <span id="s583">We feel fully accepted by the entire community.</span> <span id="s584">I don’t feel that there is the overt anti-Semitism that we experienced in Europe.</span> <span id="s585">That was the 1930’s and this is the 1980’s.</span> <span id="s586">It is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Do you find any subtle cases of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Oh, I think that there always are some.</span> <span id="s589">I don’t even think that they necessarily come from someone who is trying to harm you.</span> <span id="s590">It is often what they know and what they understand - they (often) do it very unconsciously.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: When did you first come to the Dayton area?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: When we were married in 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Is your husband Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Did you meet through college?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No.</span> <span id="s597">We met through family in Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: What does your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: He is an engineer.</span> <span id="s600">He worked for m any years in the Avionics (Laboratory).</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Is he a native American?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: What other activities or associations do you engage in other than religious oriented ones?</span> <span id="s604">Such as organizations or clubs you belong to.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: We attend theaters, concerts, lectures, this type of thing.</span> <span id="s606">We like to hike.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: What about within the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s608">What do you participate in?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: The Sisterhood at Temple or we attend Sunday morning brunches at Temple and we do volunteer work and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: What kind of volunteer work do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Not necessarily Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s612">I work with the hospital - I am a member of “Reach to Recovery” where I visit people who had had mastectomy and talk with them about various things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Do you think much about your former life?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes, I think so occasionally, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: How do you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I am not certain that I have any strong feelings about it one way or another.</span> <span id="s617">That was my life!</span> <span id="s618">I think that I have reached the point where I am able to look at the situation a little more objectively and less emotionally.</span> <span id="s619">Many times I have wondered how, in a civilized world some of the atrocities that occurred million fold - how it could be.</span> <span id="s620">I think about it often and I feel that our young people - my own children - need to know about it, in order not to let the same thing happen again.</span> <span id="s621">They have to be aware that it can happen.</span> <span id="s622">I think that very often people don’t want to hear about it - or don’t want to think about it.</span> <span id="s623">That is one of the reasons why I feel that the “Project of Oral History” is so valuable.</span> <span id="s624">After a while it has no meaning, it is like somebody in China having some thing happen to them &amp; you are not being able to relate to it.</span> <span id="s625">Recording these “Oral Histories” can bring it to a more personal and human level.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Do you talk to your children about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I tried to.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: What do you mean by “try?”</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I am not certain that my own children really comprehended it, comprehended what went on.</span> <span id="s630">We had discussions about it at times.</span> <span id="s631">It is too hard to comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Do you usually bring it up to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No, not too often; but we have had discussions about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What do you tell them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I think that in our discussions we touched on some of the things which happened.</span> <span id="s636">They read books on it.</span> <span id="s637">But I don’t think that they believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: They don’t believe that it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I really really believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Do you mean that they can’t grasp the idea that it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Or do they actually believe that it has been exaggerated or that it didn’t happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I am not sure.</span> <span id="s644">They may have some of that, but they also can’t grasp that it ever happened.</span> <span id="s645">I think that it is too hard to comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: How do you view their lives as being different from yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I think that I grew up very fast and became very serious about life due to my experiences.</span> <span id="s650">Fortunately, they have not had these kinds of experiences and I hope that they never have.</span> <span id="s651">They probably look at life a little differently than I did.</span> <span id="s652">I don’t believe that I ever had the “teenages” that you see with most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: This is the 2nd interview with Mrs. Lilly Levine.</span> <span id="s654">It is 2 PM May 29, 1981 and we are at her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">The last time we met we talked about your children lives being different from your own.</span> <span id="s656">Would you like to pick up where we left off?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A; OK.</span> <span id="s658">I believe that we were talking about my own childhood and teenage years.</span> <span id="s659">They were different, of course, than is the case with our children.</span> <span id="s660">Our children grew up in a normal household where one is not concerned about economics or getting thrown upon new friends and new environment including country and languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Have you ever returned to your former home?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, last October.</span> <span id="s663">We saw a trip coming up through our alumni association and my husband talked me into going.</span> <span id="s664">I was a little hesitant but I am very glad that I went.</span> <span id="s665">I believe that I was able to solve a lot of feelings which I had.</span> <span id="s666">I think that it was worthwhile.</span> <span id="s667">I had not wanted to go back up to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: What kind of feelings did you have about going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I had, of course, rather strong feelings about people who allowed to happen what did happen (to me and) to my fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s670">I was not certain as to how I would feel after I got there.</span> <span id="s671">I knew that it would be quite an emotional thing.</span> <span id="s672">I know that when we left I had such a feeling of relief that ever going back seemed most unlikely.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Who was it you blamed for allowing what happened to you happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: It is not a mater of blame; however the fault lies with the people who either you remained silent or you actively participated.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Others also.</span> <span id="s677">Whether you actively participated or you stood silently by - there is not that much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: How were you able to resolve how you felt when you did go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: I am not sure that I can describe that.</span> <span id="s680">We had been in other parts of Europe and when we got to Frankfurt I simply decided that I would keep some of my feelings in the background.</span> <span id="s681">It was very interesting to see some of the places that I knew so well as a child.</span> <span id="s682">We started on the day after we got to Frankfurt by taking a streetcar to the spot where I had remembered that our Synagogue had stood.</span> <span id="s683">I knew that it no longer existed.</span> <span id="s684">They built a wall around the area on it is preserved.</span> <span id="s685">There are some very old graves preserved from the XVI or XVII century, which graves had been with the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s686">The Synagogue, of course, had been burned down during Kristalnacht (Nov. 10/11 1938) and my one cousin whom I still have; he lives in the NY area.</span> <span id="s687">He was about 16 at the time and was living by himself in the Frankfurt area and going to school.</span> <span id="s688">He witnessed it.</span> <span id="s689">He stood right across the street and saw the Synagogue burn.</span> <span id="s690">It was quite an emotional thing to see that area.</span> <span id="s691">From there we walked, as I had done many times as a child, to where my school had been.</span> <span id="s692">Part of the school is still standing part of this are offices of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s693">We went in there and talked to people a little.</span> <span id="s694">We got an idea what the situation was in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s695">They told us that very very few Jews of German descent - and even fewer Frankfurt Jews were still in Germany, that the Jews who live there were people and their own children who after the war came out of “displaced persons (D.P.) camps” and had chosen to settle there - they usually originated from Eastern European countries to which they could or would not return.</span> <span id="s696">Apparently there is still fear there.</span> <span id="s697">They don’t have a large number of children, especially young ones.</span> <span id="s698">They are particularly concerned about the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s699">They had recently hired extra guards since there had been kind of increase of Neo-Nazism in the area.</span> <span id="s700">We had quite a long talk with the Secretary and also with the Director of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s701">They were able to help me get in touch with the records for the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s702">We then went to visit my mother’s grave, which I always wanted to visit.</span> <span id="s703">We found the cemetery in very beautiful condition - it was well taken care of.</span> <span id="s704">None of the graves, including the headstones, appeared to have been disturbed or else they had been put back into condition.</span> <span id="s705">There were a number of monuments to those from Frankfurt who had been killed in the camps, such as Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s706">That was very touching.</span> <span id="s707">There were a lot of new graves of the present residents families.</span> <span id="s708">We had been on a tour group but we left them to do things on our own.</span> <span id="s709">We also visited a family we had met on a previous trip to Europe who lived in Frankfurt and who invited us to their home for dinner.</span> <span id="s710">I felt very comfortable with them since they were hospitable.</span> <span id="s711">As a matter of fact the wife came to the airport when we left and brought us a gift.</span> <span id="s712">We also took a trip to Kulsheim, the little town where I was born.</span> <span id="s713">This was to me, in a way, more thrilling than anything else on the trip.</span> <span id="s714">I thought that I had remembered the place - and I verified that, when I saw it.</span> <span id="s715">I could identify our house as well as other houses where friends had lived.</span> <span id="s716">It was quite exciting to go back there because my father’s family had lived there for many generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Was anyone left there whom you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: We didn’t make any attempt to contact anyone.</span> <span id="s719">I went to the “Rathouse.”</span> <span id="s720">That is the local courthouse and city hall.</span> <span id="s721">The town was totally deserted - you didn’t see any people.</span> <span id="s722">I went upstairs in the Rathouse, to attempt to get a copy of my birth certificate, which I don’t have.</span> <span id="s723">It said: “ring the bell” for the police and the other for the offices.</span> <span id="s724">I rang both bells and I got no answer.</span> <span id="s725">We went up some long steps, up to the local castle - the very old Scholss - on top of the hill.</span> <span id="s726">There a little boy greeted us with “Guten Tag.”</span> <span id="s727">That was the only human we saw in the whole town.</span> <span id="s728">It seemed as if everyone was elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: How is your German now?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, I haven’t used it in many many years, but you don’t forget that.</span> <span id="s731">I understand it - I am a little slow to speak it, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s732">Of course, I can still write.</span> <span id="s733">I do naturally speak German and understand it perfectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: How would you say that the entire situation affected your religious belief?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I don’t believe that it had any effect.</span> <span id="s736">I believe that the beliefs formed as I grew up and as I questioned and thought for myself and that I come to my own beliefs which may not follow exactly, Orthodox Judaism, especially since I don’t pretend to keep that any m ore.</span> <span id="s737">I have my own philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: You don’t think that it was shaped in any way by your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Possibly, although I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s740">I believe that it was formed more by my beliefs and the philosophy I developed about life in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Do you have any grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What experiences would you like to pass on to future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: On this subject, I would like to emphasize that my experiences were a lot less dramatic than that of many other people since we left Germany so early.</span> <span id="s745">In no way can I say that my experiences were typical.</span> <span id="s746">But I feel that it has taught me to try to be understanding of others; since people may be different and come from different cultures it is important that they try to understand others, and not to treat them in such a way as to promote hatred or even prejudice.</span> <span id="s747">I think that much of what happened is still a mystery to me.</span> <span id="s748">I would like future generations to deal with that in some way, so that humanity does not have to experience this again.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: What you found particularly hard to comprehend?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: That human beings who have human feelings for families and pets can treat other humans so inhumanely and become animalistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Do you think the world can learn a lesson from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: I hope that it will be kept before the world.</span> <span id="s753">I believe that we tend to forget.</span> <span id="s754">It is now in the distant past.</span> <span id="s755">People should study it and learn from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Do you remember anything else you wish to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No, nothing else which would be significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Do you have anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No, not really and I am very happy to contribute to the project.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: I want to thank you for contributing.</span> <span id="s761">We appreciate it!</span></p></body></html>
