I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.</span> <span id="s29">What kind of business you father was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A. My father was working.</span> <span id="s31">He was an insurance salesman.</span> <span id="s32">My grandfather had a factory which made bricks and my uncles were very involved in textiles.</span> <span id="s33">They were fairly comfortable off, not rich, rich like a lot of Jews in Lodz were, but they were comfortable.</span> <span id="s34">Politically, I was exposed to the discussions of my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s35">I had about four or five uncles and three aunts, and they all belonged to a different political group.</span> <span id="s36">They were zionists.</span> <span id="s37">My father was a ______________, so Israel was not something he would think about or Palestine, at that particular time.</span> <span id="s38">He felt we should be happy where we are and the whole __________ idea.</span> <span id="s39">He was the only one of the whole lot.</span> <span id="s40">I had one uncle who was very hasidic.</span> <span id="s41">You know, had the long _________ and the whole bit.</span> <span id="s42">So, I was always exposed to those discussions, even as a little girl.</span> <span id="s43">Not that I participated, I was not a joiner.</span> <span id="s44">I was not zionist, I was not a _____________.</span> <span id="s45">I was just a happy go lucky young girl with friends and school, and that's how I related to life in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q. Before 1939, were you aware of Hitler and Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A. I was aware of Hitler, oh, I would say '38 when the first surge of German Jews were just packed on the border of Poland.</span> <span id="s48">And the Jewish community Lodz, and I imagine some place else too, was very attuned to it, very charitable.</span> <span id="s49">So, they were trying to place those refugees from Germany, open kitchens, those people were dumped on the border without anything, just whatever they could carry.</span> <span id="s50">So, they tried to place them in homes and opened kitchens to feed them, and that's when I really became aware that that's what Hitler is doing.</span> <span id="s51">I heard about the crystal night, but I wasn't terribly into it.</span> <span id="s52">By end of '38, '39 I became petrified of Hitler because all of a sudden the anti-semitism in Poland, which was pretty dormant, flared up.</span> <span id="s53">So, we started to be called names and it became very uncomfortable and not reassuring to be a part of it.</span> <span id="s54">So, yes, that's when I really became aware of it, and before that I was really interested in Polish history.</span> <span id="s55">We were taught Polish history five times a week.</span> <span id="s56">Piercutsky (ph) was hey, God.</span> <span id="s57">When he died, I remember we had stay salute the portrait of him and tears were running down our eyes because oh, how her father almost died, which was an illusion, but I guess I was not that sophisticated at that time.</span> <span id="s58">So, I was aware, and the closer it came to '39 or the middle of '39 the more aware I was of it.</span> <span id="s59">Until the last week in August I was in the country with my little sister and mother and then we had to rush back to Lodz, disguised as non-Jews to our home because it became very dangerous.</span> <span id="s60">By September 1, when war broke out, Hitler immediately ordered his troops, immediately overrun Lodz.</span> <span id="s61">It took two days and here they were.</span> <span id="s62">The Army I was so proud of, you know, the calvary with their white gloves and the beautiful pasture with the horses was disengaged and here we were under Hitler.</span> <span id="s63">And one law after the other followed in immediate succession.</span> <span id="s64">Schools were closed.</span> <span id="s65">People were dismissed from their work.</span> <span id="s66">We could no longer walk on the streets.</span> <span id="s67">We had to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s68">We had to put yellow stars on both hands and then fires broke out everywhere.</span> <span id="s69">And I can still smell, almost smell the synagogue burning and the Germans rounding up the men on the street, especially the ones with the beards and paftins, we had a lot of them in Lodz.</span> <span id="s70">And they had to dance around and the Germans and the Poles were just looking at it with such joy and glee that it just shattered my mind and made me a very, very frightened person.</span> <span id="s71">All that was going on.</span> <span id="s72">I stayed under German Nazi rule in Poland until December of 1939, and at that time, the whole feeling was let's escape, let's go where he isn't.</span> <span id="s73">Poland was divided, at that time, in two parts.</span> <span id="s74">One part of Poland the Russians took over and one part the Germans took over, so the idea was to escape the part where the Germans are and go to the part where Russia is.</span> <span id="s75">So, one night we were sitting and people were just knock at the door, knock at the door, and men were taken out, women were taken out.</span> <span id="s76">It was just a fearful, fearful situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q.</span> <span id="s78">What was going on in the streets?</span> <span id="s79">I mean did you pretty much stay home and hide out?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A.</span> <span id="s81">They couldn't because they were rushed out of their homes by the Poles and Germans.</span> <span id="s82">They might come into a house and say all Jews out.</span> <span id="s83">Then they would surround the men and some of them were never heard of.</span> <span id="s84">There were men going to work, with pails of water cleaning the streets, and we were very easily recognizable because you had to wear a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s85">You could not go to a store and buy anything because it wasn't being sold to Jews, so there was a little bit of hunger already.</span> <span id="s86">The predominant fact was the fear.</span> <span id="s87">Is my father going to go outside and ever come back?</span> <span id="s88">Am I am going to go outside and ever come back?</span> <span id="s89">Are they going to surround our apartment.</span> <span id="s90">It was the unknown of what they're going to do, but it was known that they were gong to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q. Was there obvious brutality in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s93">The Hitler ___________.</span> <span id="s94">We had a lot of Germans in Lodz, and the youngsters.</span> <span id="s95">"You there, you there, you there," you know back and forth with clubs, especially for the man it was worse than for the women.</span> <span id="s96">They were just using sticks, throwing stones.</span> <span id="s97">It was a free for all.</span> <span id="s98">There was no one to protect the Jews.</span> <span id="s99">We kind of became immediately second class people, not even citizens or a part of the community.</span> <span id="s100">By December we had a kind of family meeting and I just felt that I could not stay there.</span> <span id="s101">On other hand, the feeling was well, that's your home.</span> <span id="s102">You have a roof over you.</span> <span id="s103">You just don't walk out of the house, not in '39.</span> <span id="s104">People did it later, but not in '39.</span> <span id="s105">So, we made a decision that father and I are going to go on the other side to the Russians.</span> <span id="s106">We're going to find quarters, send for my mother and my little sister, and we'll establish some kind of roots away from the Germans under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s107">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s108">That was middle of December '39.</span> <span id="s109">So, my father and I didn't look what they call the term, I didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s110">We took the stars off and we set out to go to the Russians.</span> <span id="s111">It wasn't a unique idea.</span> <span id="s112">Thousands of people had the same idea, and proceeded to go like that.</span> <span id="s113">Also, the Poles tried to go to the countryside rather than stay in the city, so you were facing moving sidewalks.</span> <span id="s114">People, people, people, moving with bags on their backs.</span> <span id="s115">Suitcases, horse and buggy, but it was just a moving stream of people, so we set out and our first direction was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s116">Now, I don't know if you're aware of how Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s117">But towards ______________ that was part of Russia.</span> <span id="s118">So, we went in that direction, so our first stop was Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s119">We did not have a Ghetto yet in Lodz so we were living in our own homes.</span> <span id="s120">When we got to Warsaw, found out that all Jews lived in a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s121">We sneaked into the Ghetto and it was a horror.</span> <span id="s122">Dirty, hunger, they were so much worse off than we were, and there was no place for us to stay or did we have a desire to stay.</span> <span id="s123">So, after being there two days, we sneaked out of the Ghetto and continued our trip to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s124">As we walked towards, not knowing exactly where we were going, but general directions, and since we were not unique, and there were hundreds and hundreds of people, you start talking to people.</span> <span id="s125">We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the Russian part too, and they have a maid who lives not far from the Russian border.</span> <span id="s126">They are going there and she is going to bring them over.</span> <span id="s127">We are free to join them.</span> <span id="s128">Well, that was a wonderful opportunity, since we didn't know where we were going, and so we joined the group of people.</span> <span id="s129">Sure enough, we got to the house of the maid which was not far from the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q.</span> <span id="s131">How long had you been walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A. Oh, maybe two weeks.</span> <span id="s133">Maybe a week, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q.</span> <span id="s135">In the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A. Yes, well it was December.</span> <span id="s137">We get to the farm house and the maid greets them and also us with warmth and they have it all ready.</span> <span id="s138">They had a room ready for all of us and they were going to sneak in because it was still German occupation.</span> <span id="s139">They were sneaking in food for us in the evening, and then the first opportunity they have that they feel the road is clear, they are going to bring us over.</span> <span id="s140">I was observing the whole situation and it became very uncomfortable for me.</span> <span id="s141">I say, why does it take them so long.</span> <span id="s142">Something isn't right.</span> <span id="s143">And I was not wrong.</span> <span id="s144">We were there about two days and then in the middle of the night there is a knock.</span> <span id="s145">The doors from the place where we stayed on that farm, rip open and here is a German patrol escorted by the maid and the rest of her family.</span> <span id="s146">We were in just one room, completely surrounded and the first thing was your money, your this, your that.</span> <span id="s147">So, father and I very quietly kind of went towards the door, and as they were so busy plundering the baggage, suitcases, we sneaked out, but I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing and so did father.</span> <span id="s148">We just blindly headed for the forest.</span> <span id="s149">It was dark, it was cold.</span> <span id="s150">We had no directions.</span> <span id="s151">I turned around, there is no father.</span> <span id="s152">So, I found myself in that forest not knowing quite where I am going but heading for the direction away from the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s153">I must have run all night.</span> <span id="s154">First I tried to find father, which was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s155">Well, I never did, and when daylight started I found myself on the outskirts of a little town.</span> <span id="s156">It was cold.</span> <span id="s157">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s158">I was upset.</span> <span id="s159">Putting it mildly, I was desperate, when a woman approaches me and she must have sensed that I was not from that part of town or country, whatever I was.</span> <span id="s160">She approaches me and says why are you on the street at that hour?</span> <span id="s161">That's not allowed.</span> <span id="s162">And I said, I was just attacked by the Poles and Germans and I was running.</span> <span id="s163">Where am I?</span> <span id="s164">She says, "Come with me."</span> <span id="s165">And she took me to her house.</span> <span id="s166">She was a Jewish woman who went to fetch some water and took a chance to get some water when the Germans and Poles aren't out, that's why she was on the street.</span> <span id="s167">She took me to her house, her home, if you can call it such.</span> <span id="s168">It was a one room house, one room living quarters, and she had three little boys and a very pious Jews, sitting there praying and she gave me a little bit of food.</span> <span id="s169">Put me right next to the stove and tried to find out from where I am, what am I doing and so on, and I told her that that's what happened to me.</span> <span id="s170">My intent is to go over to the Russian part of Poland.</span> <span id="s171">She says, well that's very hard, but I'll see what I can do for you.</span> <span id="s172">She evidently was -- I don't know what her position in that little town was, whether she was a rabbi's wife, but knew the community.</span> <span id="s173">She went at night, she went over and she came back and she says I'll give you a way to go over to the Russians because I know people who do it all the time.</span> <span id="s174">They are smugglers.</span> <span id="s175">That's the trade they have.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q. Were these Jewish smugglers?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s178">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s179">I had no papers, no money, nothing literally zilch.</span> <span id="s180">She brought me over to the smugglers.</span> <span id="s181">They looked me over for some reason they say okay, we'll take you with us.</span> <span id="s182">So, I was very fortunate without the help of those strangers who stretched out their hand because they felt sorry for me or I just looked different to whatever they were, I can't explain it.</span> <span id="s183">But they were so kind.</span> <span id="s184">The smugglers took me with them.</span> <span id="s185">What they did were they were smuggling shoes, but just to assure themselves that nobody is going to grab from them what they grabbed from someone else, they first carried all left shoes, and then made the next trip with bags of right shoes and then the two bags got together and they had hundreds of pairs of shoes.</span> <span id="s186">But they worked with the Poles and Germans, so when they came around, the smugglers and I and the shoes went to a little ____________ where German patrol was standing and under their direction we went over to the Russian part.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q. Do you remember the names of these towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A. I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s189">At one point I did remember and I wrote it down.</span> <span id="s190">It's ____________ or something like that.</span> <span id="s191">It's a very small kind of town, and that's how I find myself on the Russian front.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q. Now, being that there were all these smugglers and here you were an attractive 17, 18 year old girl, was that an advantage or did they try --?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A. No, I don't think they took any advantage of me being a pretty 17 girl at all.</span> <span id="s194">As a matter of fact, nobody did, in all of my encounters.</span> <span id="s195">I found kindness in a certain -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s196">They kind of spoke to me differently like feeling sorry for me and that's very unusual because you feel sorry for someone when there is one, two, three, but there were hundreds of people like me.</span> <span id="s197">Maybe not all alone, but so I only had kindness from them.</span> <span id="s198">Then they had a place on the other side of the river where Poles were waiting and they collected their shoes, and then we parted company.</span> <span id="s199">The Poles even offered me to stay with them, and you know, you don't have to go any further, stay here.</span> <span id="s200">But, I wasn't trusting anyone.</span> <span id="s201">I took advantage of their kindness but never trusted them.</span> <span id="s202">So, then they went about their way and I continued.</span> <span id="s203">Now, I was on the Russian site, but I still had no money.</span> <span id="s204">I still didn't know where to go, and my recollection was that as we were still at home, my uncles took the route before us, and they were mentioning the city of ___________.</span> <span id="s205">So, I said I have to get to _____________, and maybe some how, some way, I had no address or no names of people, I contact them, find them.</span> <span id="s206">It's not unusual to meet people on the street, because everybody was walking.</span> <span id="s207">It took me two weeks to get to _____________.</span> <span id="s208">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s209">I had no money for tickets so when a train was moving, I tried to jump on top of the roof and get a little ride and then people were always helping me.</span> <span id="s210">When I did get to ________________, it was a terrible disappointment which I could not understand it there, but I understood it a little later.</span> <span id="s211">Evidently, _______________ was a central city, where all the people from the German part of Poland used to congregate.</span> <span id="s212">So, the city was over run with ______________ so called.</span> <span id="s213">And they had no place for them.</span> <span id="s214">They had no heart for them.</span> <span id="s215">So, you couldn't get a glass of water if you did not pay for it.</span> <span id="s216">So, I spent a few nights on a bench.</span> <span id="s217">Finally, somebody said there is some people from Lodz congregating in that house and I run there and I couldn't stay there because again, for a little place on the floor you had to pay money, and I had none.</span> <span id="s218">So, there was a woman who said oh, I'll tell you, I just come here for business, but I live in a little town about 17 miles from ___________, and I am sure that you can go to school there because schools in Russia are free.</span> <span id="s219">That's what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s220">She said come with me, I'll take you there and you find out, maybe things will be easier for you.</span> <span id="s221">Since I had nothing to lose, I said okay.</span> <span id="s222">Not that I knew her before, and the transportation I remember clearly my journey from ___________ to _____________.</span> <span id="s223">It had to be done by sled.</span> <span id="s224">There was no other way of transportation.</span> <span id="s225">By then it was January, and it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s226">Sled rides, the people who were running the sleds, that's how they made their living, but they offered to take me without money.</span> <span id="s227">But, my legs were all frozen.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't have enough warm clothes and they were frozen for about seven, eight years until I got rid of it.</span> <span id="s229">Anyway, I get to that city of ____________.</span> <span id="s230">She took me her home, and she says I'll introduce you to people who might help you and at that time that was the Russian part now.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q. Is she a Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q. And at this point, you had lost all contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A. Well, I had no contact with my mother and sister who were in the German part.</span> <span id="s235">I had no contact with my father whom I lost in the woods so I was all alone.</span> <span id="s236">So, when I got to that little town of _______________, she right away, a small town, they say, oh there is a little girl who came from the German side.</span> <span id="s237">So, there was quite a congregation of people from that little town around and then there was one person who said I introduce you to the Russian commissar who is in charge of all the stores and his wife is taking care of children who have no homes and maybe somehow we can work something out that you can go to school, maybe find a job, and I had no place to go, I say okay I'll stay another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Then the next morning, they brought me into that Russian officer.</span> <span id="s239">She spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s240">I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s241">The people around me spoke Jewish.</span> <span id="s242">I did not speak Jewish, but I understood it.</span> <span id="s243">So, he had a lengthy conversation with me the interpreter and he says, you stay here don't you travel any further.</span> <span id="s244">I see what I can do for you.</span> <span id="s245">You come to my office tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s246">And I said, your office, I don't speak Russian.</span> <span id="s247">I don't know really nothing.</span> <span id="s248">He said don't worry.</span> <span id="s249">So, I stayed another night at the household of that woman, and the next morning I got into his office and he said, okay, put me at his desk, wrote the Russian alphabet out for me and says you learn Russian and in the meantime I'll give you a salary.</span> <span id="s250">So, it was just unbelievable luck.</span> <span id="s251">To make a long story short, I stayed in the city of _______________ until the German liquidated the Jews, but that's getting ahead of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q.</span> <span id="s253">Why was he so nice, and how did you know who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A. Well, I trusted them as far as when I had no other choices.</span> <span id="s255">When I had choices, I did not trust them.</span> <span id="s256">Why did I trust him?</span> <span id="s257">I had no place to go, so why shouldn't I.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q. And he was just a nice man?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A.</span> <span id="s260">He was just a nice man.</span> <span id="s261">He introduced me to his wife, to his children, and they were very helpful at their later day in that respect that the Russians were sending out all the people who got into the city of _______________ after a certain day to Siberia.</span> <span id="s262">She put me on her list of the children who had no parents and didn't belong any place and that's how I was saved from being taken to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q. So, what did you do in this small town for all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A.</span> <span id="s265">After a very short time, I learned the language and I worked for Mr. ______________.</span> <span id="s266">That was the name of the guy and became the cashier of all the retail stores.</span> <span id="s267">A very prominent job.</span> <span id="s268">I got paid.</span> <span id="s269">I could afford to rent a finished room.</span> <span id="s270">I could afford to buy my food, and I was quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s271">The only thing is the Germans closed the borders between the Russian occupation part, and so I had no contact with what happened with my mother.</span> <span id="s272">I had no contact with what happened in Lodz.</span> <span id="s273">I didn't know what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s274">Nothing.</span> <span id="s275">We were just completely shut off from any information.</span> <span id="s276">After all, the Germans and the Russians were buddy, buddy at that time.</span> <span id="s277">So, I was just all by myself, and I was working and except not knowing and not having a way to know life kind of stabilized for me.</span> <span id="s278">I couldn't go to school because that's true, school was free, but board and food and everything else was not.</span> <span id="s279">So, I stayed in that town until ______________ when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland after they had that pact.</span> <span id="s280">And again, the Germans marched into _____________ in a very short time it's true, Mr. ___________ said, "Bella, we are skipping town.</span> <span id="s281">We are going further to Russia.</span> <span id="s282">Please do come with me.</span> <span id="s283">Come with my family."</span> <span id="s284">And I said no.</span> <span id="s285">I had the memory, or so I thought, of what it meant to just travel from city to city and not having a place.</span> <span id="s286">I didn't think I could face it again.</span> <span id="s287">So, I was not willing to give up the room that I had.</span> <span id="s288">The Germans were not there yet.</span> <span id="s289">Memories are sometimes short.</span> <span id="s290">So, I opted not to go with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q.</span> <span id="s292">One question.</span> <span id="s293">When this are was under Russian control and you were living there, were Jews allowed to be Jews openly?</span> <span id="s294">Was there any problem with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q. And they knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s298">That was never questioned.</span> <span id="s299">The only thing, since it was so close to the actual Russian border, they did not want refugees there, that's why I was not sent out because ____________ took me under his wing, but a lot of people were sent out into deep Russia.</span> <span id="s300">Because that was not a very good element for them, and they wanted to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s301">So, I stayed.</span> <span id="s302">But then on June 21, when the Germans invaded the Russian part --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q. 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A. 1941.</span> <span id="s305">So, I would say I had a year of fairly comfortable living.</span> <span id="s306">I made friends.</span> <span id="s307">I met everybody.</span> <span id="s308">Everybody was nice to me.</span> <span id="s309">I had a salary.</span> <span id="s310">I had a job.</span> <span id="s311">It was lonely but I was free of the Germans.</span> <span id="s312">Until that June 21, the Germans came very fast, very swift.</span> <span id="s313">The second day they were there, they surrounded all man of the little city.</span> <span id="s314">It was a _____________ get a shovel, get some food for three days.</span> <span id="s315">We have to build roads.</span> <span id="s316">Almost everybody just signed up, so it became a city of women.</span> <span id="s317">All men left and were never heard of again.</span> <span id="s318">As I was sitting in my room, there was a very kind lady who said, "Look, the Germans are here.</span> <span id="s319">You cannot stay by yourself.</span> <span id="s320">You come and live with me."</span> <span id="s321">I knew her son.</span> <span id="s322">I never met her but I knew her son, and I knew her daughters and I said, "No,I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s323">You have --."</span> <span id="s324">She said, "I don't want to hear any different."</span> <span id="s325">She was a very energetic person.</span> <span id="s326">She says, "Come on.</span> <span id="s327">Get your possessions."</span> <span id="s328">I didn't have much, so it wasn't a problem of sorting what I take, what I leave.</span> <span id="s329">I had very little, and she took me to her household.</span> <span id="s330">Her name was Mrs. Pollock.</span> <span id="s331">She was just the most wonderful, wonderful person that I have ever met in my life, and I met lots of people, and lots of people who are helpful to me, but she was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s332">She had lots of contacts through the farmers.</span> <span id="s333">She used to put her babushka on and get into the farm and bring some bread and share it with me, like she shared it with her daughters.</span> <span id="s334">There was never a difference.</span> <span id="s335">She was just great.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q.</span> <span id="s337">These were Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s339">As I was working, I made contacts with non-Jewish people too, and they were very nice, very helpful, very friendly.</span> <span id="s340">Most of the people were always very friendly towards me.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q.</span> <span id="s342">When you refer to this as a city of women, you're talking about just the Jewish area?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A. Well, we weren't in the Ghetto yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q.</span> <span id="s345">But the men who were taken away were just Jewish men?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A. Just Jewish men.</span> <span id="s347">Well, I don't remember exactly the period of times we could stay in our homes, then it comes that all Jews go to a Ghetto in _______________.</span> <span id="s348">There was no question for her that I go wherever she goes.</span> <span id="s349">So, we had about a week's time I think to find quarters.</span> <span id="s350">They just gave us a few houses separated them and then all the Jews from spread out towns had to go to a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s351">That was my first experience and exposure to a Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q.</span> <span id="s353">About how many people were in this Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A. I would just have to take a rough -- maybe 8,000.</span> <span id="s355">I wouldn't want to be quoted on it because I don't know, but it was a small town to begin with, and the Jewish population wasn't that tremendous.</span> <span id="s356">There was not an outright anti-semitism felt because it was spread out.</span> <span id="s357">So, I really don't know, but I do know that she found quarters.</span> <span id="s358">Every family had to find where to live, so she found a house where there were two sisters living and they had two rooms and a kitchen and then she had a mother, Mrs. Pollock.</span> <span id="s359">So, it was her mother, myself, her two daughters, and she, we all moved into that two room apartment.</span> <span id="s360">Life in Ghetto wasn't terrible because the people who were in charge of the Ghetto had a certain kindness about them and a certain understanding.</span> <span id="s361">So, those are Jews in the Ghetto and then there are Germans outside.</span> <span id="s362">They have to abide orders in order for the Germans not to storm the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s363">But their idea was how to help the Jewish population who was there.</span> <span id="s364">So, yes, we did have police and we did have a Judenrot, but they were a part of the Jewish community of the Ghetto, which was not true in other Ghettos.</span> <span id="s365">We were supplied our food from Wilno, the Wilno Ghetto was our main headquarters, you could say.</span> <span id="s366">We stayed in the Ghetto and I found a job for a German commandant of ______________ as a cleaning woman or cleaning girl, but she did have a German who took care of his needs.</span> <span id="s367">I was just a helper of the German soldier, and he too was very kind.</span> <span id="s368">I never felt any abuse or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q.</span> <span id="s370">You went outside of the Ghetto every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A. Yes, I went outside of the Ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s372">Lots of people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q. Was this a sealed off Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A.</span> <span id="s375">It wasn't closed.</span> <span id="s376">It was sealed off but people were going to work and coming back from work so there was contact.</span> <span id="s377">Of course there was a lot of barter, and it wasn't a very strict kind of situation.</span> <span id="s378">There was also hunger already creeping in.</span> <span id="s379">We had to give all our possession, the gold, furs, whatever the Germans collected that.</span> <span id="s380">Somehow, I found amazing through my whole experience, they demanded that they give all your jewels away, and it was hard to part with it so you gave it away.</span> <span id="s381">You wouldn't think of flushing it down the toilet or anything like that, but it was yours and you couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s382">At that point, we knew that the Wilno Ghetto had a lot of actions, that a lot of people were being killed and taken away and the Judenrot had to submit the people.</span> <span id="s383">The Germans never entered the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s384">They just gave the Judenrot a list, today I need 100,000 people or 10,000 people, whatever the transfer was.</span> <span id="s385">And one day, I remember clearly, the Wilno Judenrot put a request towards ____________, that the Jews of _________________ have to supply 1,500 people, and the Judenrot of ___________ said no.</span> <span id="s386">We are not doing it.</span> <span id="s387">So, after two days, the contingency from Wilno Ghetto came to ____________ and said, look, we just struck a bargain with the Germans.</span> <span id="s388">Instead of 1,500 people you give us 400 people elderly people, whatever.</span> <span id="s389">You give us a list.</span> <span id="s390">We want to grab them an then we continue our life as it is.</span> <span id="s391">Well, they did get 400 older people under the pretext that they're going to be relocated and not far from ____________ they put them all in not a barrack, but a farm house -- a barn and just set fire to it, and all the 400 people were burned.</span> <span id="s392">Now, those were people that we all knew, but that was the only time that they got any people from ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q.</span> <span id="s394">How did you get information about what was going on in Wilno and _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A. Well, people were kind of sneaking out, coming back, going, and so it wasn't a very precise information, but things started to filter through.</span> <span id="s396">Most of the stories were not believed.</span> <span id="s397">So, we did get kind of a feeling what was going on in Wilno.</span> <span id="s398">Not precisely but one day we got a decree that _____________ Ghetto is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s399">It's time for ______________ to become _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q.</span> <span id="s401">About when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A. '42 probably because '43 I was in _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q. Was it liquidated in April '43, does that make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A.</span> <span id="s405">When I got to _______________, I thought maybe April '43 yes because I was in Wilno a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q.</span> <span id="s407">But you're saying in the ____________ Ghetto, you really didn't have actions and all sorts of reprisals against the people and roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A. No, because the Judenrot -- the only roundup was the 400 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q. So, you felt moderately safe there?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s411">Kind of life took it's own tone so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q. Were there any activities in the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s413">Were there schools for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A. No, it was a small community.</span> <span id="s415">If I said 8,000 maybe I exaggerated the amount because there was a lot of people coming in from the neighboring little farms.</span> <span id="s416">They were all put into _______________, but I made some friends.</span> <span id="s417">So, people were going out to work, coming.</span> <span id="s418">It was not-- you didn't feel the Germans' hand very strongly, and people were helping eachother alot.</span> <span id="s419">They were just such unusual kind of people that it's unbelievable to describe.</span> <span id="s420">But I have such warm feeling towards every one there.</span> <span id="s421">They all embraced me.</span> <span id="s422">I embraced them.</span> <span id="s423">We used to after work, get into somebody's room and talk and it wasn't any special activity.</span> <span id="s424">There were small grounds, but kind of life progressed day by day.</span> <span id="s425">Mrs. Pollock used to go out on the farm at night, come back bring some flour, get some bread.</span> <span id="s426">Never did she make me feel that I am taking food away from her children.</span> <span id="s427">Not for one second.</span> <span id="s428">There were times, before I got my job, that they were saying we need 100 girls to build roads, she would send her daughters instead of me.</span> <span id="s429">She felt I'm too delicate for it.</span> <span id="s430">I mean she was just so terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q. And the Jewish police who are guarding the Ghetto, would let people come and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A. Well you had to have permission.</span> <span id="s433">It wasn't just free-- because we were not allowed to walk the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q. Not even in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A.</span> <span id="s436">In the Ghetto, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q.</span> <span id="s438">But you said this woman would go out at night to the farms.</span> <span id="s439">Did she sneak out or the people just didn't look?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A.</span> <span id="s441">She sneaked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q. And if the policeman saw her, they turned the other way?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A.</span> <span id="s444">She made sure nobody sees her.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q.</span> <span id="s446">When you were working for this German in town, did you learn anything special that you might not have learned otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A. No, just the Jewish star.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q.</span> <span id="s449">You didn't hear them talking about anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A. No.</span> <span id="s451">I was treated decent, but I was not a part of -- I very rarely had any contact with the commandant I was working for.</span> <span id="s452">That was not my place.</span> <span id="s453">I wasn't a member of that family.</span> <span id="s454">I was just doing the work, and it did give me an opportunity if I was to go and bring water which was in the next house, we didn't have running water, and then they were friends of mine, the Poles, and I used to sneak into their house, and they used to give me a slice of bread which I could bring back to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s455">So, there was still some contact with the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q. Now, you said you were learning little by little what was happening in Wilno.</span> <span id="s457">Did you have any knowledge of what was happening in the camps in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A. No, not at that time.</span> <span id="s459">So, when they liquidated the ______________ Ghetto, what they did is they took the Jews from the _________________ Ghetto and send them to a different so called camp.</span> <span id="s460">I don't remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s461">It was not a barn, a big house.</span> <span id="s462">It was clean, clean barracks, but I found so confining, no freedom to move, no way to escape.</span> <span id="s463">Nothing, so I discussed it with Mrs. Pollock and said, "Look, I can't stay here.</span> <span id="s464">I feel choked.</span> <span id="s465">I am going to go to the Wilno Ghetto."</span> <span id="s466">And the people who were going to the Wilno Ghetto to bring products for that camp, __________ was the name of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q.</span> <span id="s468">This is before the Ghetto was liquidated or right after?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A. No, no.</span> <span id="s470">Right after the Ghetto was liquidated we were sent to ______________, and I stayed there about three days.</span> <span id="s471">There was no distribution of work or nothing, but it was like living in a big open place and no where to escape.</span> <span id="s472">I was always fearful of putting my whole life in one kind of place.</span> <span id="s473">Even before the Ghetto _______________was liquidated, I worked with a gentlemen during the Russians, a Pole, an elderly man.</span> <span id="s474">And when he heard that the Ghetto is going to be liquidated ________________ he came to the gates when I was going to work and he said, "Bella, please come with me.</span> <span id="s475">I settle you.</span> <span id="s476">My cousin's farm far away from here.</span> <span id="s477">Nobody would know.</span> <span id="s478">I'll just introduce you as my niece."</span> <span id="s479">You see, I spoke perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s480">It was very hard to detect that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s481">And I was thinking back and forth, and back and forth, and then in the last moment, before we were sent out, I said no.</span> <span id="s482">Again, I would not put myself fully under any family's control.</span> <span id="s483">So, I just went with Mrs. Pollock to ________________ and then I made contact with the guys who were going for provision to Wilno and I said, "Hey, buddy, would you take me to Wilno?"</span> <span id="s484">And they said okay, but you'll have to be very quiet.</span> <span id="s485">We'll put you on the bottom of the truck.</span> <span id="s486">We'll put straw over you and then we'll sneak you into Wilno.</span> <span id="s487">So, the next morning, early in the morning, I went on the truck, and I went to Wilno.</span> <span id="s488">As luck would have it, at that particular time, the German officers were at the gates of the Wilno Ghetto, and they poked the truck and here I come out.</span> <span id="s489">So, the Wilno police, who had no idea, kind of whisked me away from them and brought me into the Ghetto and put me into that jail.</span> <span id="s490">Somehow I got away from the Germans thanks to their alertness or whatever.</span> <span id="s491">So, I was in the jail for about a day and a half, and I was interrogated.</span> <span id="s492">Why am I coming here.</span> <span id="s493">What do I want here, and so on and on and what am I going to be, and what am I going to live on.</span> <span id="s494">There was Jewish police woman and she was from Kovno.</span> <span id="s495">She said, "Oh, let her go.</span> <span id="s496">I'll take her to my house."</span> <span id="s497">So, again, luck was just unbelievably with me.</span> <span id="s498">She did take me to her quarters and kind of took me under her wing.</span> <span id="s499">She was a sweet young lady.</span> <span id="s500">She had a mother and two sisters and a little brother and I certainly was not welcome in their house, because I took another little space away.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: I'm going to back track a little and ask if you had any knowledge of the ____________ group who were operating in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A. Yes, I do, I did.</span> <span id="s505">At that time, because history was repeating itself, the same kind of Germans I saw in Lodz.</span> <span id="s506">The same kind of groups were entering the city of _______________, surrounding houses.</span> <span id="s507">Everybody out, men out.</span> <span id="s508">They were wearing those black uniforms, and they were a petrifying force.</span> <span id="s509">You know that if they leave and you're still alive, just count your blessing.</span> <span id="s510">It's your happy hour.</span> <span id="s511">There was never any assuredness that once you are surrounded them that you will escape from their clutches.</span> <span id="s512">It was never your choice.</span> <span id="s513">They either had enough people, or got what they wanted and left, but you really had no control over it.</span> <span id="s514">If they were looking for men or they suspected somebody was hiding, they didn't hesitate to enter the homes and bang around and look around and you're just standing there like a little mouse, or a big mouse, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q. Were these organized groups or just bands of thugs.</span> <span id="s516">Were they all Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A. Well, no.</span> <span id="s518">They were pretty organized, very disciplined, very impressive and their posture and their self assurance.</span> <span id="s519">I mean they were the Lord and Masters.</span> <span id="s520">What they were before, we had no knowledge.</span> <span id="s521">We just found out what kind of people were there, but they were the heros of the world.</span> <span id="s522">They had the power over that bundle of nothing, because the Jews became nothing.</span> <span id="s523">See, we stopped being human beings.</span> <span id="s524">So, yes, we were aware of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q.</span> <span id="s526">How did you know these were the ______________group, and did they have local auxiliaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A. Well, the soldiers were not in the city.</span> <span id="s528">Soldiers were fighting the front.</span> <span id="s529">Those were special groups with one purpose, round up the Jews.</span> <span id="s530">They were wearing different kinds of uniforms.</span> <span id="s531">There was one group which was wearing the brown uniforms.</span> <span id="s532">That was a __________, they were working on construction of roads.</span> <span id="s533">When they used to come in, and ask for people, you were pretty much assured that you are just going to go for a day, work on the roads and come back.</span> <span id="s534">When the _________ group came, you didn't think you would ever come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q.</span> <span id="s536">Did they have local support?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A. Not in _______________.</span> <span id="s538">They had it everywhere else starting from Lodz to whatever, they had full local support.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q.</span> <span id="s540">How did you learn what happened to these people who were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A. Well, first of all, many a times they used to take another group of people from the Ghettos.</span> <span id="s542">That became more clear in Wilno than in any place else because that's where the mass destruction took place.</span> <span id="s543">In ____________ it was just a group of men, you know.</span> <span id="s544">But somebody had to dig the graves and somebody had to cover the graves, and the Germans weren't going to do it.</span> <span id="s545">So, people were called to go to work and sometimes sneaked back they were telling tales and to us they were just tales, because no that couldn't happen, wouldn't happen, didn't happen.</span> <span id="s546">It took quite a few years until the real idea penetrated to everybody that that's what the Germans do.</span> <span id="s547">That they were such masters in psychology because sometimes when they round up people for work, the people really went to work.</span> <span id="s548">Sometimes when they round up people for work, the people were going to killing grounds.</span> <span id="s549">You never knew what's what.</span> <span id="s550">So, they kind of dulled your senses and there was always the hope, so you'd just go like cattle to the grave.</span> <span id="s551">That was that massive in Wilno-- in _____________ that it became very pronounced in Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q.</span> <span id="s553">In _______________ were you aware of any efforts to the people to get away to form a resistance group, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A. No, not really in ____________.</span> <span id="s555">Resistance towards what?</span> <span id="s556">Get away where?</span> <span id="s557">It was not that time to escape so where do you go?</span> <span id="s558">Who is going to help you?</span> <span id="s559">There was no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q.</span> <span id="s561">In all the time that you were there, you've now been away from your family a few years, what went through your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A. Through my mind that my family is probably no longer is alive.</span> <span id="s563">That's the more I was exposed to the politics and the behavior of the Germans towards the Jews, the more I knew that the chances for any of us to survive are not tremendous.</span> <span id="s564">So, I really didn't think that my family is alive, and I really did not choose to have a picture of how they died because it wasn't very clear in my mind either, how.</span> <span id="s565">Did they come and round them up in Lodz like they did, the people when I witnessed it.</span> <span id="s566">Did they take another turn.</span> <span id="s567">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s568">I didn't know much about the Lodz Ghetto, either.</span> <span id="s569">I knew about the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s570">I was there, but not the Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s571">Interesting that after the war, and I'm ahead of my story, I found out that almost each Ghetto was operated on a different wave length.</span> <span id="s572">There were different methods with different people, different way of administration, it was just not known to me then.</span> <span id="s573">I knew how the Wilno Ghetto operated because I was there.</span> <span id="s574">I knew how the ___________ operated because I was there, but I didn't have a scale of comparison at that time.</span> <span id="s575">So, lots of the things especially of other Jewish communities and how they handled their killing grounds and their being alive, I found out later but not then.</span> <span id="s576">I still am talking about Ghettos, which is quite different than concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q.</span> <span id="s578">This is probably a strange question, but by thinking that your family was probably not alive any more, did that free you at all from having to worry about then and think about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A. No, it did not free me from thinking about them, but it freed me for independent action.</span> <span id="s580">I can move around.</span> <span id="s581">I can hide in the doorway or not hide int he doorway.</span> <span id="s582">I don't have to worry well if I hide and my little sister and mother are in the room upstairs, I have a certain responsibility, So, yes, I was free.</span> <span id="s583">There were a lot of people who had family.</span> <span id="s584">I was more lonely, I was more not belonging, but I was freer.</span> <span id="s585">And I used that freedom later on in many occasions.</span> <span id="s586">Yes, and I probably used it in ___________________ Ghetto.</span> <span id="s587">Would I be with my family, Mrs. Pollock wouldn't take care of me.</span> <span id="s588">She wouldn't find a place for me.</span> <span id="s589">Maybe my family would, but we were not natives of that particular place, so I can't weight it, but if you can put it in those terms, there were certain advantages of being alone if you found helping hands from other people.</span> <span id="s590">I was not just an island by myself.</span> <span id="s591">I could have never done it without their help of strangers, who really didn't want any reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q. So, you went into the Wilno Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A. I went into the Wilno Ghetto, and that young lady befriended me.</span> <span id="s594">What I didn't do in the Wilno Ghetto, which was required, I did not register.</span> <span id="s595">So, I wasn't on any lists, but by now some people who are _____________ before and they were living there so I was kind of a free agent, but I did not register.</span> <span id="s596">So, when the actions came, I was not on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q. And you knew this?</span> <span id="s598">This was intentional?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s600">And I knew at that point enough people who would say there's going to be an action.</span> <span id="s601">I knew a lot of policemen because young men or women were policemen and some of them were more devoted to the cause very important were their jobs, and other ones just let functionaries because it's necessary.</span> <span id="s602">So,I remember at least three or four actions where people were lined up and I was warned they're going to round them up.</span> <span id="s603">Twice I stayed in the city because I had a job outside the city.</span> <span id="s604">I stayed not on my job.</span> <span id="s605">I couldn't do that, but I knew there was an empty apartment in the building where I was working.</span> <span id="s606">So, instead of gig back to the Ghetto, I just crawled under a bed in that apartment.</span> <span id="s607">The next day I just crawled out and was back on the job.</span> <span id="s608">I couldn't do it if I would have obligations towards my family.</span> <span id="s609">Would I rather not have a family and have that freedom?</span> <span id="s610">No, but that wasn't my choice.</span> <span id="s611">At other times there was actions in the Wilno Ghetto, and they were very often.</span> <span id="s612">Anyway, it worked.</span> <span id="s613">The Germans gave the commandant, ___________ was the commandant of the Wilno Ghetto, gave him a list that many thousand people he needs today, next week, next month, whatever the case.</span> <span id="s614">I was hidden in a policemen's room when he was on duty, I wouldn't say room -- cubical, but I had to be a quiet as could be because that place, the other Jewish police would not come because it was the policemen quarter.</span> <span id="s615">So, I might lie under the bed for two days.</span> <span id="s616">Again, I was lucky, fortunate at one of the actions, especially the last liquidation when the police had no control I watched the Germans when they finished with one building, I kind of got into the building where they finished getting everybody out.</span> <span id="s617">So, no, it wasn't a calculated kind of action, it was spontaneous, whatever the situation was, and I was getting away with it.</span> <span id="s618">Lots of people did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q.</span> <span id="s620">You were doing this on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A. Well, I had nobody else.</span> <span id="s622">Well, when I say on my own, yes, but there was always someone helping a little bit.</span> <span id="s623">Like if I knew someone who knew there was going to be an action that particular day.</span> <span id="s624">I did what I did on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q.</span> <span id="s626">You didn't hide with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q. Were there actions all the time?</span> <span id="s629">I mean was it a pretty fearful place to live in Wilno?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A. Very.</span> <span id="s631">Very, very fearful, very insecure, and I really didn't belong any place so I didn't have a permanent place so to say.</span> <span id="s632">Yes, so it was very fearful and I had no money.</span> <span id="s633">I didn't know influential people, and that always helps.</span> <span id="s634">There was a lot of it going on.</span> <span id="s635">I imagine you could buy out your place on an action.</span> <span id="s636">I was a newcomer to Wilno and again, the same policy, let's get rid of the Jews who came later here, who came from the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s637">So, yes, it was a very fearful place to live.</span> <span id="s638">There was also a group of people from ______________ in Wilno who were very involved in the resistance of the Germans.</span> <span id="s639">And, I guess it was a fairly large group, but the majority of the inhabitants of the Ghetto did not want to rock the boat as long as somebody else goes out of the Ghetto, let's not get the Germans in because then we are all going to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s640">Well, they had different views of it, and it was even argued then.</span> <span id="s641">Is it right for ___________ to get his police to round up that many Jews because the Germans wanted and they assured you the choice of who was going to go will be yours and not the Germans at random, or should we just the hell with that, fight it out.</span> <span id="s642">The majority of the population of the Ghetto did not want an uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q.</span> <span id="s644">They supported __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s646">And they opposed the groups who wanted to arm themselves and they really opposed it because that was a fear.</span> <span id="s647">The Germans find out, they enter the Ghetto, and we'll all going to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s648">So, I am not passing judgment.</span> <span id="s649">I'm just telling you what the mood was.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q. Were you involved in any resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A. I personally was not involved in any resistance.</span> <span id="s652">I was involved in nothing.</span> <span id="s653">I was just trying to survive without harming anyone, but I knew a lot of people who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q.</span> <span id="s655">The people that you knew who were involved in resistance activities, what sorts of things were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A. First of all, they were trying to get out of the city and bring ammunition in to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s657">When the Ghetto was in the process -- very shortly before the whole Ghetto was liquidated, they -- I don't know if I'm going ahead or not-- but anyway, that group set against -- you compile your lists if you believe that that might save any Jews but don't touch us.</span> <span id="s658">And they all collected in one building with all their ammunition and it was a known secret to everyone that that place belongs to that so-called underground.</span> <span id="s659">It no longer was underground, but that's where they sat and they set the guns if the Germans ever come into that building and touch that house, we let loose.</span> <span id="s660">The Germans respected it.</span> <span id="s661">They didn't touch it.</span> <span id="s662">Well, eventually they did.</span> <span id="s663">They had all the time in the world, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q. Was this a fairly large group?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A. I wouldn't think so.</span> <span id="s666">Not enough to do more damage to the Germans.</span> <span id="s667">I have to die, if you Germans would die, but there was a much larger group that did not want to resist the Germans knowing how hopeless it would be.</span> <span id="s668">And I believe against this, and probably other commandants too, that as long as he can keep the Germans out of the Ghetto there is a chance of saving one, two, five, twenty Jews.</span> <span id="s669">But _____________ was married to a non-Jewish person, and really could have stayed there.</span> <span id="s670">He eventually was killed, but two or three or days before the Ghetto was liquidated they called him to headquarters and evidently said they're coming into the Ghetto if he doesn't supply whatever, and he said enough is enough, so they just got rid of him.</span> <span id="s671">Then they stormed the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q. Daily life in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A.</span> <span id="s674">That depends on the times.</span> <span id="s675">When the actions were going to take place or were taking place or shortly after they took place, there was a very depressing mood, very frightened, very scared.</span> <span id="s676">Then, as I say the Germans were wonderful in allowing your feelings.</span> <span id="s677">Life was kind of normal for a Ghetto life.</span> <span id="s678">You used to go to work.</span> <span id="s679">You used to come home.</span> <span id="s680">If you were a young group of people, there was a cafe on the corner and the young people used to gather together and sing some songs, until the next episode would take place.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q. Were there cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A. Not organized cultural activities, not that I was aware of, and I certainly have no claim of knowing everything that was going on in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s683">I was I imagine a pretty narrow minded person myself, but from what I knew it was rather spirit building.</span> <span id="s684">We're still alive, we cannot sit still and think, not the younger people.</span> <span id="s685">And if I remember correctly, there was in that little cafe was a I remember the number was 31, the name of the street probably will come back to me, and it kind of lifted your spirit up, because none of us really believed that we are going to survive it.</span> <span id="s686">So, there were love affairs going on.</span> <span id="s687">Whatever normal does in normal circumstances under abnormal circumstances.</span> <span id="s688">The ethical standards were not the same.</span> <span id="s689">There was no code of ethics.</span> <span id="s690">There was none of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q.</span> <span id="s692">Why do you say that?</span> <span id="s693">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A.</span> <span id="s695">It means that things you would do when you were brought up in nice homes before the war, there were things you wouldn't do.</span> <span id="s696">You wouldn't make love so easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q.</span> <span id="s698">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A. I don't know.</span> <span id="s700">Just the whole outlook of did you hear that was taken on an action, this one -- it wasn't as bad as it became later.</span> <span id="s701">So, there was still kind of a measure, can I help you, or this one instead of that one justifying witnessing certain actions.</span> <span id="s702">That was not normal behavior.</span> <span id="s703">So, you tried to keep some feel of sanity knowing that it's not the same as outside.</span> <span id="s704">I mean you don't buy your life for money.</span> <span id="s705">I mean you don't do that outside.</span> <span id="s706">You might very easily do that in Ghetto if you can help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q.</span> <span id="s708">Did you steal from other people, tell on your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A. Sometimes you would do that, yes.</span> <span id="s710">It became much more pronounced later on.</span> <span id="s711">Ghetto still had some semblance, and I use that word very cautiously, of family life.</span> <span id="s712">So, yes, there was a police over you.</span> <span id="s713">There were some zealous policemen if you were not supposed to have onions in your house and they found a piece of onion on the floor or a crumb, yes, you would be denounced.</span> <span id="s714">You would be punished.</span> <span id="s715">Is that normal behavior, you know?</span> <span id="s716">So, other ones tried to say-- but there was still some family life.</span> <span id="s717">I didn't have one.</span> <span id="s718">I belonged no place, but lots of people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q.</span> <span id="s720">You had a social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A.</span> <span id="s722">What social life.</span> <span id="s723">I was just floating around.</span> <span id="s724">I had no roots.</span> <span id="s725">I had no responsibilities, and I did not get involved in any underground, so I went to work and said well, what do I do tomorrow.</span> <span id="s726">How do I escape the next day or how do I survive the next day.</span> <span id="s727">So, it was a very selfish kind of existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q.</span> <span id="s729">What about institutions in the Ghetto, like hospitals or soup kitchens, did that kind of thing exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A. Not in the Wilno Ghetto.</span> <span id="s731">Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q.</span> <span id="s733">It didn't have the organization that some of these other Ghettos has?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A. I don't think.</span> <span id="s735">I am not aware of it, and I think I would have been aware of it.</span> <span id="s736">Who would support that soup kitchen?</span> <span id="s737">There were no supplies coming in.</span> <span id="s738">There was no funds.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q.</span> <span id="s740">What about hunger, disease, things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A. Yes, hunger was becoming more and more pronounced because as I said it was semi-normal.</span> <span id="s742">A lot of products were brought into the Ghetto by the people who did not live in the Ghetto before and there was a lot of bunkers and people were hiding things.</span> <span id="s743">But then there were people who just got the normal rations and they were not very big.</span> <span id="s744">So, yes, hunger was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q. Were people sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A. People were sick.</span> <span id="s747">People were hungry.</span> <span id="s748">People were unhappy, their heads were always down.</span> <span id="s749">It was just how do I survive.</span> <span id="s750">How do I survive every day living and how do I survive the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q. I'm trying to picture this.</span> <span id="s752">If I were looking at the streets of the Wilno Ghetto, not during an action, but just on a day, what would I see?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A.</span> <span id="s754">You would see people milling around and moving around.</span> <span id="s755">Just lots of people small quarters.</span> <span id="s756">Wilno Ghetto was not tremendous and not necessarily dressed up, and not necessarily friendly and not necessarily -- just different needs and when you would go on the Wilno streets outside the Ghetto, those were lovely streets, lovely people.</span> <span id="s757">And you occasionally might see Jews because when the Jews were going to work, they were going through the streets of Wilno, but not on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s758">They all wore stars.</span> <span id="s759">They all were being led by someone.</span> <span id="s760">So, you did see it, so whoever tells you we didn't know just is lying.</span> <span id="s761">You could not not know.</span> <span id="s762">So, that's just a cop out and the majority of the population believes this statement.</span> <span id="s763">I just read an interesting -- it's not my own quotation, but somebody wrote it in a book.</span> <span id="s764">That when you hear today or heard after the war how helpful the outside population was, how many thousand helpful people there were, it is very surprising that even one single Jew was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q. Was there much observation of religion in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A. Individually, yes.</span> <span id="s767">People became a little bit more religious looking for help.</span> <span id="s768">There was no help from the outside world, so they were looking for help from God.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q. Was this done in families or were there actually prayer houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A. No, families, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q.</span> <span id="s772">What kind of work did you do when you were living in the Wilno Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A.</span> <span id="s774">When I was in the Ghetto I was working in a household, cleaning.</span> <span id="s775">That was usually a very good job.</span> <span id="s776">It was not on the street, it wasn't in a factory, so those were plum jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q.</span> <span id="s778">How did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A. I knew someone who needed ten people because he was in command of and he said, "Hey Bella, I'll put you on that."</span> <span id="s780">I said great.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q.</span> <span id="s782">So you were working for a Lithuanian family, a German family?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A. I'm trying to remember because I didn't work very much because I had no connections so occasionally I used to get a job.</span> <span id="s784">It was a German family.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q.</span> <span id="s786">How long were you in the Wilno Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A.</span> <span id="s788">A few months.</span> <span id="s789">Not very long, but I was one of the last ones to leave the Wilno Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q.</span> <span id="s791">How did the end come about, can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A.</span> <span id="s793">The end came about when ______ refused the last remnants of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q.</span> <span id="s795">How many people are we talking about that were still in the Ghetto approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A. I would say approximately 2,000.</span> <span id="s797">Then the Germans came into the Ghetto and they started rounding up Jews at random.</span> <span id="s798">At that point, I tried to avoid them, found myself in some bunker.</span> <span id="s799">People were building precautionary places.</span> <span id="s800">I found myself in a bunker.</span> <span id="s801">I stayed there overnight until the next morning when the actions were going on upstairs, I was downstairs, and the next day everybody was chased out.</span> <span id="s802">We were brought to a big market, and we found there people who were chased out the day before right there assembled.</span> <span id="s803">So, we were the last remnants of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s804">I saw the trains ready marked for Auschwitz, cattle cars ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q.</span> <span id="s806">How did you know Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A. Well, at that point, we're talking about 1943.</span> <span id="s808">We knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s809">We knew about Pornaty.</span> <span id="s810">I don't know whether you know what Pornaty was.</span> <span id="s811">Before the ovens were working, and before it was beautiful organized mechanized, they used to get people from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s812">They had a transport bring them to the forest of Pornaty.</span> <span id="s813">Those dug their own graves and then they had to line up and were killed there.</span> <span id="s814">All of a sudden the Germans found an enemy.</span> <span id="s815">Not from the dead or the living, but the whole grounds lifted up.</span> <span id="s816">They could not absorb all that blood and whatever, so those thing had to be dug out.</span> <span id="s817">Those were the Jews from the Ghetto were brought in, dug out the graves and put some petroleum and burned it.</span> <span id="s818">We were fully aware of what Pornaty was.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q.</span> <span id="s820">As people came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A.</span> <span id="s822">Some of them snuck out.</span> <span id="s823">Some of them were killed, stayed there in the grave for two days until they dug themselves out until they got back home, the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s824">So, at that point we were fully aware that there is only one way for the Jews, that's gas chambers.</span> <span id="s825">And that was after the _________ conference, after the solution of how to take care of the Jews.</span> <span id="s826">So, there really is not much hope.</span> <span id="s827">There certainly wouldn't be much hope that anybody is going to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q.</span> <span id="s829">You got information about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A. Right.</span> <span id="s831">That was at that point and when the first people came from Pornaty and told us what happened, there was total disbelief.</span> <span id="s832">No human being can do that to another human being.</span> <span id="s833">No human being is going to allow them to do that.</span> <span id="s834">So, illusions.</span> <span id="s835">So when the Wilno Ghetto was liquidated, that must have been September '43 I think, those people were all -- it was warm, hungry, thirsty, frightened, Germans were all around with their dogs, and then they marched through the gates started.</span> <span id="s836">Came my turn, there were two SS men pointing left, right, which is standard procedure as we're going.</span> <span id="s837">I happened to be pointed to go right.</span> <span id="s838">Just the same, there was a small group of very young girls, the majority was going left and was put on the trains and off they went and new trains came and off they went, and we just stayed there.</span> <span id="s839">Then we were put on a truck and that was my last view of the population of Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q.</span> <span id="s841">How many people were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A. 200 out of 2,000, 4,000.</span> <span id="s843">Why me?</span> <span id="s844">I don't know.</span> <span id="s845">We didn't know where we were going, but you were just going.</span> <span id="s846">Whatever he said, left or right, that's where you went.</span> <span id="s847">You were brought in on that truck and then after a while we were loaded into a cattle car and the doors closed and we were just taking off.</span> <span id="s848">We had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s849">The doors never opened.</span> <span id="s850">We weren't fed.</span> <span id="s851">The situation in the cars was horrible.</span> <span id="s852">People became just wild.</span> <span id="s853">No air, no food, little human dignity left.</span> <span id="s854">You know, two or three days -- once they stopped the cars and brought some buckets of water in, and that probably was a bigger disaster than not having water.</span> <span id="s855">I don't know, because the worst element of your personality was coming throughout.</span> <span id="s856">After about three days, I would guess, of that voyage, the doors opened up and everybody _____,________,________, so you just jump out of the cars and I was faced, and the rest of the people with me was faced with a group of German soldiers with bayonets and some kind of a forest.</span> <span id="s857">Now, my thought was knowing what happened in Pornaty, that that's the end of it.</span> <span id="s858">Now, they're just going to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s859">They didn't.</span> <span id="s860">After everybody was out, we all of a sudden see some people in striped uniforms, and they speak Jewish and they say don't worry you're ____________.</span> <span id="s861">They brought us that group of people, which they brought on the train, the cattle car, they brought us to a barn with straw then all of a sudden this creature comes through the barn, starched white blouse, red kerchief, black pants with a whip in her hand and here we are a bundle of nothing.</span> <span id="s862">I mean, just unbelievable impression.</span> <span id="s863">Well, we did get to _________ to the concentration camp of Heidelberg, unknown to me at that time, but made known to me later that as we were on the Wilno grounds, the commandant of the _______ concentration camp called the commandant and said, "Hey, I killed all my women in ___________ and now I have 200 hands to work.</span> <span id="s864">Do you still have some available?"</span> <span id="s865">And he did, and I was one of them, so I got myself to ____________ instead of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q.</span> <span id="s867">So you arrived in _____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A. Right.</span> <span id="s869">And that whole group, they were only women, no men.</span> <span id="s870">The next day they wrote our numbers and that was the point where I stopped being a person and became a number.</span> <span id="s871">The whole set up life changed.</span> <span id="s872">There were no more family units.</span> <span id="s873">It was just a group of inhabitants, or a group of Jews, eventually for slaughter.</span> <span id="s874">We stayed in that barn for about two days, until we were named, and in the meantime a group of people were selected for work, and the type of work that all suitcases was closing had to be sorted and put away.</span> <span id="s875">I was chosen for that job too, so it was a group of I don't know, twenty girls, something.</span> <span id="s876">Then, the next morning, the ones who were there the day before were selected for the same job.</span> <span id="s877">And that eventually became my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q. Was there any particular way you got chosen for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A. I would say it would be random.</span> <span id="s880">In the meantime, once we all got numbers, and I remember mine like today, it was 5633.</span> <span id="s881">We were put into barracks.</span> <span id="s882">Everybody was assigned a place, and out clothes were taken away.</span> <span id="s883">We got striped clothes and we became full fledged inmates of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s884">There were other people in that camp, people that got there before us.</span> <span id="s885">They were not _________ women because they were killed off.</span> <span id="s886">There was some German women and there was some German men.</span> <span id="s887">Then the selection of work started.</span> <span id="s888">Again, you had an entirely different hierarchy.</span> <span id="s889">No longer did you have a Judenrot.</span> <span id="s890">The people in charge of us were Germans -- not Germans, soldiers, but prisoners of war, criminals, people who were sent to concentration camps for crimes committed, and all of a sudden they became the elite of the --snapping their fingers.</span> <span id="s891">They could do whatever they pleased.</span> <span id="s892">Power thirsty and just brutes, real honest to goodness brutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q.</span> <span id="s894">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A. Abusive, beating, snap command because they were dealing with vermin, not human beings anymore.</span> <span id="s896">They were just outright criminals.</span> <span id="s897">The guy that was in charge of the camp, Mr. Ickes, was there for killing his wife and her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s898">There were other ones.</span> <span id="s899">Some of them were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s900">They were nicer.</span> <span id="s901">The difference with them was they were all wearing little triangles, the black triangles designated one crime.</span> <span id="s902">Then we had the commandant who was a German SS.</span> <span id="s903">We had some German SS supervising some internal functions of _____________.</span> <span id="s904">And then we had some Jewish supervisors supervised by German guards who were working outside the camp.</span> <span id="s905">______________ really was not a camp, it was a collection camp.</span> <span id="s906">They used to bring Jews from Germany.</span> <span id="s907">It was an interesting place when you learned later about geography and happenings.</span> <span id="s908">______________ was a very important place.</span> <span id="s909">The Germans did not do their killing on German grounds.</span> <span id="s910">They exported the Jews and the minute they left the borders of Germany, they no longer were German citizens and they just joined the ______________ of the Jewish work.</span> <span id="s911">So, anyway, we had columns of people going out to work, different kind of work.</span> <span id="s912">There were factories in _________ who needed chap labor.</span> <span id="s913">There were all kind of things, and then there were places where the Jews who came into ____________ were selected and sent to other little concentration camps where they slept and ate and again were under other supervision, but they all belonged to that ____________ headquarters.</span> <span id="s914">I stayed in _____________ headquarters.</span> <span id="s915">That became my home.</span> <span id="s916">I was not sent out to work.</span> <span id="s917">I had a permanent job in the so called ______________.</span> <span id="s918">I used to take mostly care of the German uniforms, which were cleaned and darned and then they used to come and exchange their uniforms for uniforms.</span> <span id="s919">It was part of the big _____________ who used to get all the suitcases if you equivalent to the Auschwitz commando.</span> <span id="s920">It was equivalent in the way of work.</span> <span id="s921">All the Germans used to be brought in Czechs who came by car and suitcases and under pretense of paradise, all their baggage was taken away and was sent to ______________ and we used to sort the things.</span> <span id="s922">Put valuables separate, ladies clothes, furs, and you know when you go on a voyage and leave everything behind, you take the very best with you.</span> <span id="s923">So, the people in Germany had a hey day because all those things were taken by the Germans and sent to their wives, their lovers, their whatever.</span> <span id="s924">So, anyway, that was the assignment I had among other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q. So, in doing this, how did it feel.</span> <span id="s926">Sort of strange going through other people's lives in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A. Yes, very strange.</span> <span id="s928">Heartbreaking, if you had a heart left.</span> <span id="s929">When I say there were different standards of viewing life, that was one of them.</span> <span id="s930">What pride.</span> <span id="s931">There was only the strongest who tried to keep on resemblance of a human being because the Germans did everything possible to destroy it in you and then you are __________________ .</span> <span id="s932">So, and you did see it over and over among the surroundings of the Jews in camp in the barracks, how they behaved.</span> <span id="s933">How some tried to keep clean no matter what.</span> <span id="s934">Others did not.</span> <span id="s935">Some tried to walk with a high head, others would just --it's awful.</span> <span id="s936">And then there always were some people above you.</span> <span id="s937">There always was that fear, that anxiety.</span> <span id="s938">So, it was not easy to keep your dignity about it.</span> <span id="s939">There was nothing to feed it on.</span> <span id="s940">But still we managed.</span> <span id="s941">I think that was one of the biggest victories that the Jews showed, that they did remain with some dignity in spite of so many losing it.</span> <span id="s942">And to me, every survivor is a hero if they could withstand all that and then join the world and become useful citizens.</span> <span id="s943">So, heroism isn't necessarily groups of soldiers attacking and doing.</span> <span id="s944">That wasn't heroism because hunger was rampant.</span> <span id="s945">Actions were taking place.</span> <span id="s946">You had to separate from your loved ones.</span> <span id="s947">If you came together, men went one way, women went another way.</span> <span id="s948">Children went the third way.</span> <span id="s949">They still came with children from some places and then you being separated and so that's what concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s950">But, I think in that particular time you don't compare.</span> <span id="s951">I didn't know about other ones and I thought that was hell.</span> <span id="s952">I find out differently, but I had -- talking about my luck being at the right place at the right time is just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s953">I was working in the ______________ and just before Christmas '43, I would imagine, fire broke out in the _____________, and the _____________burned down.</span> <span id="s954">Now, I was working there, and I was one of the last ones to leave the place and the next day I was summoned to an interview with Doctor Longer, and if you're familiar with the literature of the Holocaust a bit, he was one of the biggest sadist in the establishment of the SS.</span> <span id="s955">And when my name was called to be interviewed by him, everybody who knew me was sure that was the last they'd see me.</span> <span id="s956">He interviewed me for two hours.</span> <span id="s957">I don't know if I was dumb, naive, stupid or something, I don't know what he was fishing for, but I didn't have to avoid what he was fishing for because I had no idea what he was fishing for, but he interviewed me in a very kind way for two hours.</span> <span id="s958">He dismissed me back to camp.</span> <span id="s959">But those were the ways of the Germans.</span> <span id="s960">Now, he's known to be the biggest brute.</span> <span id="s961">He was in charge of all the Jews in that part of Europe.</span> <span id="s962">All the camps, little camps, small camps and so on, the biggest sadist ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A. Well, I would say I was privileged.</span> <span id="s966">I didn't have to go outside the camp.</span> <span id="s967">I stayed in camp.</span> <span id="s968">My job was pretty protected.</span> <span id="s969">The weather did not affect me.</span> <span id="s970">I could be choosy in some articles of clothes, I had either access to it.</span> <span id="s971">Oh, yes, I think it was a privileged job.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q.</span> <span id="s973">When you say you had easy access to certain pieces of clothing, what did you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A.</span> <span id="s975">You steal them, and you use them or you sell them.</span> <span id="s976">I did not sell them.</span> <span id="s977">It wasn't something that I wanted or needed, but occasionally I would see a sweater that was pretty so I could put it on, and the people who didn't have access to it, could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q.</span> <span id="s979">But didn't you have to have this uniform?</span> <span id="s980">How could you have this sweater?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A.</span> <span id="s982">You wore it underneath or you know, and since I was working inside, that's part of the privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q.</span> <span id="s984">What about trading these clothes for extra food?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A. Lots of people did that.</span> <span id="s986">When they had access to it, lots of people did that.</span> <span id="s987">It was just an instinct in some people.</span> <span id="s988">I never needed very much, so I had no need to do it, or desire, or was too scared.</span> <span id="s989">I might have just been scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q. Now, in working in this ____________, you probably had a good idea of transports coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A. Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s992">And there were lots of transports coming in and some of them were sent out to work.</span> <span id="s993">We had no gas chambers around, so either the people were shot or they went to other places to work.</span> <span id="s994">So, that was a fairly mild concentration camp, I would say, on a scale of comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q. Where were these transports coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A. Mostly Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s997">As time progressed and more and more Jews were sent out from Europe, that's where they were coming from.</span> <span id="s998">And there was a little sleepy station, a ____________, and God is that clear in my mind, all those SS standing there when the doors opened and those hundreds of people giving out and I did visit that place after the war and it was just mind boggling.</span> <span id="s999">Peaceful, quiet, what Jews, what transports, what Hitler, what Germans, none of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q. Were there children at ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A.</span> <span id="s1002">There were transports coming in with children.</span> <span id="s1003">The children were not very long there.</span> <span id="s1004">They were sent out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q. Was there any resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A.</span> <span id="s1007">In ______________, no I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1008">Not in ______________.</span> <span id="s1009">What was happening to me personally let's say in _____________, I found since we no longer have any home life, any home things, that we were just individuals bonding and developing of new families was fabulous.</span> <span id="s1010">I still have now -- it's 55 years later -- I still have friends in ______________ who we see very often, meet very often.</span> <span id="s1011">It's like family.</span> <span id="s1012">And such friendship did develop I think much more in ____________ concentration camp than any place else.</span> <span id="s1013">I don't know about other concentration camps, but we had very strong ties to people whom we didn't know before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q.</span> <span id="s1015">You would help each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A. Oh, morally, it was just and I have about five, six, seven friends who are just wonderful.</span> <span id="s1017">I met some wonderful, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1018">I met my husband there, not this one.</span> <span id="s1019">I met him to, but another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q.</span> <span id="s1021">When you weren't working, how did you and your new friends spend your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A. Just sitting on the wooden planks talking.</span> <span id="s1023">There was no entertainment.</span> <span id="s1024">There was no stimulation of -- there was nothing to feed your mind or expand it or look what happens outside.</span> <span id="s1025">We were completely cut off from the outside.</span> <span id="s1026">There was no communication.</span> <span id="s1027">So, you just bonded with yourself, trying to remember, keep strong, that's not what you're going to become if you ever survive.</span> <span id="s1028">That was my thinking.</span> <span id="s1029">Now, that's not the way to behave.</span> <span id="s1030">All those little things.</span> <span id="s1031">There was nothing to feed our minds and develop us.</span> <span id="s1032">Some Ghettos had schools and what not.</span> <span id="s1033">Concentration camps did not.</span> <span id="s1034">My concentration camp did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q.</span> <span id="s1036">What did you dream about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A.</span> <span id="s1038">In camp, I imagine freedom.</span> <span id="s1039">That was a farfetched dream.</span> <span id="s1040">I know what I'm dreaming of now, it's concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q.</span> <span id="s1042">When you were in camps, did you think about what you would do if you got out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A.</span> <span id="s1044">As a profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q. Just your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A. I didn't know what I'd do with my life, but I knew I was not going to carry my education from concentration outside concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1047">I'm not going to slam my fist and say you owe me.</span> <span id="s1048">If I want to become a part of society and evidently if I want freedom, that's what I want, that I will have to adjust and nobody else is going to adjust to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q.</span> <span id="s1050">You thought this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1052">And that was my firm conviction.</span> <span id="s1053">Maybe that's what you are talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q. Anything more about just the physical conditions at ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A. _____________ physical conditions were not too bad.</span> <span id="s1056">There were three barracks.</span> <span id="s1057">Two for women, one for men and then there was an extra barrack for non-Jewish workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q.</span> <span id="s1059">How many in a barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A.</span> <span id="s1061">There wasn't so many in __________, so it couldn't be too tremendous.</span> <span id="s1062">But my husband built ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q. Your husband now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q. Your former husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1067">He built ________________, so he was an excellent architect, so he built it well.</span> <span id="s1068">There was a lot of stealing of material from the outside so we had washrooms, which is just not the usual feature of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1069">So, that's why I say ______________ was not the worst.</span> <span id="s1070">Once you survived, once you're there, once you worked, it was not worst.</span> <span id="s1071">We used to take walks.</span> <span id="s1072">I remember my girlfriend and I we were 17 or 18 and we walked for hours around, around, and around talking about our families.</span> <span id="s1073">I had a sister and I had mother and I had a this and how was it.</span> <span id="s1074">And that friend of mine, she's very interesting.</span> <span id="s1075">It was in ______________ that she was sent out on what we call ________________, different locations and she was brought to _________________ and the woman, the SS woman that I told you about, the young chick with the white blouse, she recognized my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1076">She was a shoes sales girl in my girlfriend's home town and was fitting shoes on Trudy.</span> <span id="s1077">So, she knew the family and she recognized her, and she was very kind to her, to Trudy, and I was Trudy's best girlfriend, so she was kind to me too.</span> <span id="s1078">So, that's like an extra bit of privilege you pick up here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q.</span> <span id="s1080">You said you met your husband in this camp?</span> <span id="s1081">You were allowed to socialize with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A. No.</span> <span id="s1083">But you never asked permission.</span> <span id="s1084">First of all my husband had more freedom of walking around since he was taking care of the barracks and the camp and the buildings and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1085">No, we were not allowed to socialize but that didn't stop us from socializing.</span> <span id="s1086">It was one of those unwritten laws.</span> <span id="s1087">You go to work, boy meets girls, you know you don't have much to live.</span> <span id="s1088">You get acquainted.</span> <span id="s1089">These kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1090">I think that's the hardest part for people who are not in camp to understand it, but it was a part of social life, if you wish.</span> <span id="s1091">The encounters were very brief.</span> <span id="s1092">You just looked through the barbed wire and waved, you know, that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q. Were people able to have sexual relationships in camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A. I don't think so, but I'm sure too that was done.</span> <span id="s1095">I would not like to put it that kind of thing, life wasn't so bad, no it wasn't that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q.</span> <span id="s1097">How long were you in ________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A.

Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1171">You could see it.</span> <span id="s1172">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1173">You were just standing outside.</span> <span id="s1174">Food was despicable.</span> <span id="s1175">There was no food.</span> <span id="s1176">Starvation, lice, going to the bathroom, bang, bang, 2 o'clock at night everybody out.</span> <span id="s1177">2:05, everybody back.</span> <span id="s1178">Sickness, dysentery, lice, just awful.</span> <span id="s1179">That's an indescribable place.</span> <span id="s1180">The selections and what not the ingenuity of the Jews is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1181">Couldn't break our spirit.</span> <span id="s1182">We all of a sudden I get the message.</span> <span id="s1183">It's funny to get a message in those circumstances.</span> <span id="s1184">There were ways of communication.</span> <span id="s1185">There were always gutsy people who used to write a note.</span> <span id="s1186">I get a note from my husband telling me register on the ___________ transport.</span> <span id="s1187">I said to myself, okay there is one person who lost his mind.</span> <span id="s1188">How can I register on what.</span> <span id="s1189">There was a note back, sorry I am not on that transport.</span> <span id="s1190">So, the people who are going on the transport to ______________ were selected from different barracks.</span> <span id="s1191">There was about 200 women.</span> <span id="s1192">Well, I wasn't one of them.</span> <span id="s1193">My girlfriend was.</span> <span id="s1194">In the meantime, just as a side story, one night I get a message it said Mrs. Pollock is in Studthoff and would I need her help.</span> <span id="s1195">Those were the wire fences and that was all electrically fed and so on.</span> <span id="s1196">I sneaked out at night to that fence and on the other side is that woman, and then she says to me, "Bella, catch."</span> <span id="s1197">And she throws me her ration of bread.</span> <span id="s1198">She says I am going to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1199">You still have a chance.</span> <span id="s1200">And just disappeared in the night.</span> <span id="s1201">That was the last time I ever saw her.</span> <span id="s1202">That's the kind of a person she was.</span> <span id="s1203">Going back to _______________.</span> <span id="s1204">Somehow my husband managed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q. Your future husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A. No, my first husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q.</span> <span id="s1208">But you weren't married yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A.

Yes.</span> <span id="s1213">You know marriage doesn't necessarily have to have a canopy with candles and fancy dresses and feasts and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1214">It was I'll call it an official ceremony, whatever was official at that time.</span> <span id="s1215">There were witnesses and so on.</span> <span id="s1216">Not very many people were privileged to go through that kind.</span> <span id="s1217">Anyway, my husband sends me a note, you're going to go on the ____________ transport and I had no idea how or what that ____________ transport was in the process of leaving Studthoff.</span> <span id="s1218">About ten days back and forth different reasons either they had no trucks or they had no cars.</span> <span id="s1219">There was a war going on.</span> <span id="s1220">Germany was fighting the war.</span> <span id="s1221">There preference number one was destruction of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1222">There was a transport of people leaving for _____________ and as they got them transport out of the gate, I was added to the transport.</span> <span id="s1223">So were ten other girls, my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1224">Unfortunately unknown to them they were German born and in the last second, they decided not to send the German born people back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1225">I was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s1226">And they documents, they had papers, they had registrations, kept precise records.</span> <span id="s1227">My close friend _________ stayed behind.</span> <span id="s1228">Well, I did not stay with her, I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q.</span> <span id="s1230">How long had you been in Studthoff just so I get a sense of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A. Probably not longer than six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q.</span> <span id="s1233">You didn't work there or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A.</span> <span id="s1235">There was no work.</span> <span id="s1236">Probably couldn't survive more than another week or so.</span> <span id="s1237">That's how terrible conditions were.</span> <span id="s1238">As a matter of fact I know now people who survived Studthoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q. Was it a big camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1241">It was a destruction camp.</span> <span id="s1242">It was not a work camp like Auschwitz was some times.</span> <span id="s1243">Studthoff was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q.</span> <span id="s1245">So most people that went to Studthoff --</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A.</span> <span id="s1247">Did not survive, except at the earlier stage when they needed working hands for the farm, and those younger people who got out on the farm, some of them survived because they were not in Studthoff.</span> <span id="s1248">But at that time when I got there there was no need for workers any more.</span> <span id="s1249">It was just a matter of how fast can you get rid of what you have.</span> <span id="s1250">How fast can you get rid of the Jews you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q. Most of the people who were there were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A. All of them were Jews were we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q.</span> <span id="s1254">There were women and men, mostly women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A.</span> <span id="s1256">There were mostly women.</span> <span id="s1257">Men were on the other part of camp, but mostly women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q.</span> <span id="s1259">What did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A. Probably stood outside on an appeal plots, supervised stay, jump.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q. That's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A.</span> <span id="s1263">There was illness, the sickness, diarrhea, dysentery.</span> <span id="s1264">As a matter of fact, we were the last transport to leave Studthoff, because once we left ___________.</span> <span id="s1265">So when we did get finally to ___________, we were ___________ for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1266">But I could not have survived Studthoff and I don't know anyone who did who was not sent out by some sheer luck before.</span> <span id="s1267">So, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1268">I'm not aware that there were people liberated in Studthoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q.</span> <span id="s1270">Did they give you food in Studthoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A. Very, very little.</span> <span id="s1272">A thin slice if you weren't killed before, dirty water, so that to me it was probably the worst concentration camp ever.</span> <span id="s1273">Something puzzles you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q.</span> <span id="s1275">What was the effect of these conditions on the people who lived there?</span> <span id="s1276">The inmates, did it bring out the worst in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A.</span> <span id="s1278">The very worst, except if you had some very dear close friends like I had my friend but usually they were all strangers.</span> <span id="s1279">I mean if you lie on those pieces of benches and you want to move, four other people have to move.</span> <span id="s1280">You don't even know them, and they stink, and they're full of lice and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q.</span> <span id="s1282">Did you have lice on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q.</span> <span id="s1285">When you say it brings out the worst, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A.</span> <span id="s1287">It means I don't care about you.</span> <span id="s1288">If I want to go to that bathroom and you're in front of me, I don't care.</span> <span id="s1289">That kind of just to make it descriptive to you since you weren't there so other things would have a hard time visually it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q. Stealing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A. Sure.</span> <span id="s1292">Whatever you had, and you didn't have much and you could hear screams in the night.</span> <span id="s1293">Somebody attacks you.</span> <span id="s1294">Hunger is a terrible, terrible thing and can do to you no matter what your principles and morality is.</span> <span id="s1295">I mean hunger, I don't mean just being hungry, but hunger.</span> <span id="s1296">So, yes, again, I was fortunate to get out of _____________ and get to ____________, which really was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1297">It was a part of the concentration camp just like ______________ had different places where they send the Jews.</span> <span id="s1298">We were a part of Buchenwald and there was an ammunition factory, and that's where they needed some labor.</span> <span id="s1299">They sent them the front, they needed people to produce work, so they just took some from Studthoff and that's where we got to _______________ and worked in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s1300">It was not the normal set up of a lot of SS, there were no gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1301">There were places they could send us but that was not the set up.</span> <span id="s1302">So, we worked.</span> <span id="s1303">It was fairly clean and again you formed groups with most of the people you came from Studthoff so you were already had a family.</span> <span id="s1304">We already belonged together.</span> <span id="s1305">Same upbringing so to say.</span> <span id="s1306">Until the Americans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q. Wait, before we get to that, I want to hear a little bit more about _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q.</span> <span id="s1310">You were able to see your husband there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A. Yes, he did not work in the factory.</span> <span id="s1312">He was an inside worker.</span> <span id="s1313">He was a civil engineer by profession and he was older.</span> <span id="s1314">He was more experienced and kind of out of respect, so he never worked in the factory, but he was freely communicating between the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q.</span> <span id="s1316">What were the general conditions?</span> <span id="s1317">Were you in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1318">Did you live in a barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A. Well, we were living in the barracks, had the same wooden kind of pieces.</span> <span id="s1320">Food was given out by the you know they had a set many rations of bread and soup.</span> <span id="s1321">We kept it fairly clean.</span> <span id="s1322">There was not that constant fear of SS storming in, so it was a much more relaxed atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1323">And then we used to go work in the factory, you did mingle with the Germans because you all were involved in producing ammunition.</span> <span id="s1324">We were just additional help.</span> <span id="s1325">So, you could move around.</span> <span id="s1326">It wasn't that tight supervision by SS.</span> <span id="s1327">That lasted until January '45 when the first wave of American bombers attacked _____________ and three quarters of the city was bombed and fire and there was no work because the factory was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s1328">It was very careful bombing.</span> <span id="s1329">The camp was not attacked.</span> <span id="s1330">The factory was not attacked.</span> <span id="s1331">Three quarters of the city was in rubble.</span> <span id="s1332">We were used to go out and help clean the city.</span> <span id="s1333">That was the assignment.</span> <span id="s1334">As a matter of fact, we never worked again in that factory because if the factory was almost ready to be workable, one plane came and dropped one bomb on the water supply and just got the factory out of circulation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q.</span> <span id="s1336">So you were out on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A. Well, there's more going out on the streets, cleaning the rubble and cleaning up the street and waiting until we can go back to work and continue.</span> <span id="s1338">So far they did not send us back to Buchenwald because they did expect to have the factory working again.</span> <span id="s1339">They never did.</span> <span id="s1340">And what would you like to know next?</span> <span id="s1341">How did we get rid of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q. Well, a question about this ____________ it seemed like it was a little bit easier than _________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A. Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q. Was there any sense of normalcy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A.</span> <span id="s1346">When you mean normalcy --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q.</span> <span id="s1348">Did people have a social life, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A. No.</span> <span id="s1350">It was still just a barrack and when night comes and you come back from the night shift then close the door and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q.</span> <span id="s1352">The guards weren't as horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A. No, there wasn't that many guards so it like on a scale of comparison, that was paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q. Now, when you were out cleaning up the rubble and cleaning up the streets, did you come in contact with the local people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A. I didn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q. Oh, you didn't do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A. I personally did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q. So, what were you doing at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A. Mostly we were sometimes sitting in the barracks and waiting.</span> <span id="s1360">Sometimes we would go to the factory and clean up the factory.</span> <span id="s1361">Mostly men did the cleaning up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q.</span> <span id="s1363">In the factory you were working with German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q.</span> <span id="s1366">Did you ever have any conversation about what was going on in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A. Politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q.</span> <span id="s1369">The war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q.</span> <span id="s1372">The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q.</span> <span id="s1375">You just worked side by side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A. Yes, and one of the co-workers of mine, denounced me when I was just that short of being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q.</span> <span id="s1378">You want to tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A. Sure.</span> <span id="s1380">Well, as the war was getting closer and closer and closer, and that must have been April, now I'm back to April.</span> <span id="s1381">From January to April it was off work, on work, and so on.</span> <span id="s1382">Americans were getting closer and if you want to know about ______________, it was located on the ____________ and it had a historical meaning because that's what our friends were supposed to get together and throw arms around each other and declare peace for ever after.</span> <span id="s1383">That was supposed to take place on the _________, and we were right there.</span> <span id="s1384">On April 14, 16th something like that, the order came to get the Jews out of _____________.</span> <span id="s1385">Bring them towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s1386">We cannot leave them for the Yankees.</span> <span id="s1387">So, that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1388">they lined us all up and we were ready for our march towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s1389">An SS woman comes into camp and announces that the Americans are in town.</span> <span id="s1390">So whoever guarded us and wanted to go with us to Berlin, just took off, and here we were in front of the gates without any SS the Americans are here, which really does mean you're free, and all we could do is stare at each other in complete disbelief.</span> <span id="s1391">What the hell's going on.</span> <span id="s1392">What do you mean we're free.</span> <span id="s1393">What's free?</span> <span id="s1394">Until we realized that we really have no Germans watching over us.</span> <span id="s1395">No SS, and what do you do with freedom?</span> <span id="s1396">You turn right back and go into camp.</span> <span id="s1397">We didn't know the city.</span> <span id="s1398">We didn't know who was going to do what.</span> <span id="s1399">That was home so everybody went -- almost everybody went back to camp and plundered the supplies and had a party and celebrated freedom.</span> <span id="s1400">Except my husband, myself, my girlfriend and her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1401">My husband said, "Hey, I did not see an American.</span> <span id="s1402">I am not going back to camp."</span> <span id="s1403">So, we left camp.</span> <span id="s1404">We marched outside, didn't know the location.</span> <span id="s1405">The Germans had little houses where they took care of their gardens.</span> <span id="s1406">We went there and found a house.</span> <span id="s1407">Went into the basement and sure enough Americans did not enter __________ yet.</span> <span id="s1408">Later on we find out Eisenhower said "No, No, wait for the Russians.</span> <span id="s1409">That's our agreement."</span> <span id="s1410">So, the troops were there and they did not enter the city.</span> <span id="s1411">The Germans pulled together and surrounded the camp.</span> <span id="s1412">Everyone out, told them to march to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1413">So we were some place in the fields in _______________.</span> <span id="s1414">We were there for about four or five days.</span> <span id="s1415">The Germans were looking for the Jews because they knew that some Jews just escaped some place and they fished us out and we had some people who were not Jewish who worked for ___________, the so called _________________.</span> <span id="s1416">They had different rules and regulations than we did.</span> <span id="s1417">My husband was in very good standing with the Russian generals.</span> <span id="s1418">So, when they fished us out and the girl said he's not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1419">So he didn't have to go with the Germans, and he dragged me and that was fine except that German meister I was working for said "She is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1420">She worked for me."</span> <span id="s1421">So, that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s1422">My husband went with me.</span> <span id="s1423">We were going towards Berlin and the night was terrible.</span> <span id="s1424">It was shooting, storming.</span> <span id="s1425">You could feel the woods just going through you so the next time we got into a ditch, including the Germans because they were petrified.</span> <span id="s1426">When the shooting stopped, everybody got up.</span> <span id="s1427">We stayed in the ditch and went in a different direction.</span> <span id="s1428">We didn't know where we were, but went in a different direction, but it was such a bad night -- and if we saw a patrol they spoke to us German.</span> <span id="s1429">We spoke to them German and we just continued and find a place again in one of those huts that the Germans had.</span> <span id="s1430">We stayed there for a while until the German population of that place came over.</span> <span id="s1431">We could hear them coming, looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s1432">We decided it's time to leave that place and find another one.</span> <span id="s1433">We didn't where to go.</span> <span id="s1434">Looked at the name of the street--and again people were walking because some were caught in one part of the town, other ones were caught in a different part of town so we were just walking.</span> <span id="s1435">We saw a name of a street and a direction and we decided that's where we're going to go.</span> <span id="s1436">I was shaking like that.</span> <span id="s1437">I really couldn't put a straight step, I was so petrified.</span> <span id="s1438">This is what we did.</span> <span id="s1439">We just walked and walked and walked, and all of a sudden we see something which looks like a ____________ off a German patrol, but it was too late to turn back.</span> <span id="s1440">So, we just boldly continued.</span> <span id="s1441">The guy stopped us, leather jacket, not uniform, but leather jacket and he says where are you folks going, and we told him that we were going home to _____________.</span> <span id="s1442">He said well the Germans left that establishment last night and I found a wonderful desk which I'd like to take home, but my wagon broke, so if you're not in a terrible hurry could you help me carry that.</span> <span id="s1443">I will give you something.</span> <span id="s1444">I don't have much, but a little sugar if you help me carry that desk.</span> <span id="s1445">Hey, sure.</span> <span id="s1446">We didn't tell him who we are, and he did not suspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q.</span> <span id="s1448">You weren't wearing your camp uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A.</span> <span id="s1450">We no longer had --what we had striped clothes like that and I had a kerchief.</span> <span id="s1451">My husband had a regular suit which he prepared, and my girlfriend had a kerchief.</span> <span id="s1452">We spoke fluent German.</span> <span id="s1453">When he took us to his bombed out house, we helped him carry the desk he wanted, and we started talking a while and my husband and my friend said to him, hey there are so many other good things there.</span> <span id="s1454">He said yes but how am I going to carry them.</span> <span id="s1455">He said, okay we don't care.</span> <span id="s1456">We'll stay here a night and help you tomorrow and it developed into a two week stay at his house.</span> <span id="s1457">Things were a little touchy because he had a girlfriend who had a niece and she socialized with the German soldiers, and they came at night to visit, so we had conversations and they told me why don't I come to their barracks, they had food left over.</span> <span id="s1458">It became a little sticky.</span> <span id="s1459">And we hear the Americans entered the other side of ______________,and now we are divided by the _____________ river.</span> <span id="s1460">So, we decided to go over to the Americans, we found some German uniforms.</span> <span id="s1461">I became -- my husband became a lieutenant I don't know, and my girlfriend some kind of ranking German official, and we decided to go as prisoners of war to the American Army.</span> <span id="s1462">So, we found a boat, made some oars, and hooked up with seven other German soldiers who are sick and tired of being treated like second hand citizens as they had no intentions of going to the front.</span> <span id="s1463">When they found out that we are going over to the ___________ they were too happy to join us.</span> <span id="s1464">So, we had seven German soldiers, two Jewish men and two Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1465">We took a trip around 6:00 at night and they had their revolvers all ready.</span> <span id="s1466">If there is a Hitler they are going to shoot at them and they are going to shoot back and we had a white flag ready.</span> <span id="s1467">We got over to the other side of the ______________-- the first thing we did was push the boat back into the _________ if the Americans get any brilliant ideas to send us back, we have no transportation.</span> <span id="s1468">We walked for a while with our white flag and there was no American in sight, but neither was anybody else.</span> <span id="s1469">So, we just walked and walked and walked and finally come across two Americans who said hi and I said to my girlfriend how are we going to tell him that we are not German.</span> <span id="s1470">They're Americans.</span> <span id="s1471">They speak English.</span> <span id="s1472">My girlfriend said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1473">I took four years of English in high school, no problem."</span> <span id="s1474">So anyway they are bringing us as prisoners of war and I said, "Bessi tell him, tell him."</span> <span id="s1475">And she said nothing.</span> <span id="s1476">So, we were taken as prisoners of war to the headquarters of the Americans.</span> <span id="s1477">It was May 1.</span> <span id="s1478">Getting upstairs the two girls separate and the nine men downstairs.</span> <span id="s1479">I said wait a minute, American headquarters.</span> <span id="s1480">I am used to the Polish discipline, the German discipline, and here are the headquarters.</span> <span id="s1481">Here are the guys sitting in a room with their collars open, feet on the desk and American headquarters.</span> <span id="s1482">Now, we go through the process of telling them we're not Germans.</span> <span id="s1483">We sit down, show them, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s1484">They never saw a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1485">They never saw a concentration camp inmate.</span> <span id="s1486">It's a fighting line.</span> <span id="s1487">It's a fighting soldiers.</span> <span id="s1488">It took I'd say about an hour because they brought every soldier speaking every language to try to communicate because we sounded so urgently trying to tell them something to finally someone who speaks Polish in that room.</span> <span id="s1489">I said well, they just went wild, literally wild.</span> <span id="s1490">They didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1491">I said the first thing you do is get those two guys out of the basement there because they are the real Germans, which they did.</span> <span id="s1492">They all came upstairs and those soldiers really did not know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1493">They had a concentration camp, but they were the fighting troops.</span> <span id="s1494">They were still fighting the war.</span> <span id="s1495">The war was not over.</span> <span id="s1496">They put us on a jeep.</span> <span id="s1497">Found us a place, you know lots of Nazis left town, established, brought us a house and then were bringing us everything which there kitchen had.</span> <span id="s1498">Every two minutes a truck load of food came on the table.</span> <span id="s1499">I mean just talk about unbelievable happiness, and that's just a side story because when we were brought into that house with all that food, I remember what I said to myself.</span> <span id="s1500">If you're ever liberated, you're going to be a human being right from minute one.</span> <span id="s1501">So, I asked the American soldiers to give me a white table cloth and some dishes.</span> <span id="s1502">The three of them were ready to kill me.</span> <span id="s1503">They were starved and I said, no.</span> <span id="s1504">And then we set the table and had some candles and had our first meal as liberated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q. With your dignity in tact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A. Right.</span> <span id="s1507">And that's how we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q.</span> <span id="s1509">How long were you at this place before you felt free -- were you free at this point to just move around and do what you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A.</span> <span id="s1511">We could, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s1512">It was very shaky, very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1513">But then we got used to it.</span> <span id="s1514">We got a nicer house and we contacted lots of people who were liberated different ways and we had party.</span> <span id="s1515">So, we were free.</span> <span id="s1516">We really were free.</span> <span id="s1517">There were no Germans and we were under the American occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A.</span> <span id="s1521">We were liberated May 1 in ____________,and it was the outskirts of _____________ and eventually the Americans were so wonderful and found us a home, a house, when my girlfriend and I and my husband and her boyfriend lived.</span> <span id="s1522">Then we went to town to ________ and found out other people who survived different ways, they kind of congregated more in two or three houses in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s1523">So, we didn't see too much of them, but we knew of them and stayed there until the rumors headed that the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1524">I think that was the sequence of the events.</span> <span id="s1525">And no way would we stay under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s1526">So, we just stepped left of ______________ and again towards the American zone, Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1527">At that time, we had a car because this on the lighter side.</span> <span id="s1528">As the Jews were cleaning up the city of ____________ from the bombing, a friend of ours discovered a car in the garage.</span> <span id="s1529">The house was burned, the garage was not.</span> <span id="s1530">The car was standing there so after the war and we needed some transportation he said to my husband hey I'm going to sell you that car.</span> <span id="s1531">So, they went to the American authorities got a permit to dig out the car.</span> <span id="s1532">He posed as a German some executive.</span> <span id="s1533">They dug the car out and then my friend sold the car to my husband.</span> <span id="s1534">They went to the American authorities, got it all stamped and now we owned the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q. Was there gasoline?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A. No, but we got rations.</span> <span id="s1537">Then we left ____________ and went towards Frankfurt, I think.</span> <span id="s1538">Anyway, so it was some sets of different friends.</span> <span id="s1539">I think Hank was with us on that journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q. Hank your present husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A. Yes, but he was a very good friend of the family all those years.</span> <span id="s1542">He was really a good friend of my husband.</span> <span id="s1543">I'm not clear.</span> <span id="s1544">First we went -- as we were leaving ____________ we were driving along and we came across a beautiful location and I read in German that that was a French zone.</span> <span id="s1545">So, we stopped on a Saturday afternoon and we said we are refugees from camp and we need some quarters and soon we got a house designated for us.</span> <span id="s1546">WE took our car and took possession of the house and in that beautiful town of _____________, and we stayed in that house in _____________ for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s1547">At the time, Hank registered himself as a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s1548">So, here we lived very happily in _____________ doing nothing, acting like imbeciles.</span> <span id="s1549">Laughing, having fun playing games, complete now all of a sudden a notice comes there is a Frenchman who doesn't want to go home.</span> <span id="s1550">Well, that Frenchman did not want to go home, so we had to pack up and leave ____________ and go someplace else when they don't want Frenchmen to go home.</span> <span id="s1551">So we just left _________ and went to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1552">Frankfurt there is a funny story about the car but it's really of no importance, so anyway, we got to Frankfurt and we went to ___________.</span> <span id="s1553">That's where Jews congregate.</span> <span id="s1554">Salsheim was a place where D.P.s were coming from all around so when we got to Frankfurt we too went to Salsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q. Wasn't there some sort of informal network so you knew about Salsheim and you knew about certain places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A. Well, not officially.</span> <span id="s1557">There was no network.</span> <span id="s1558">You just used your common sense, well where it would it be.</span> <span id="s1559">Headquarters of the Americans would be Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1560">Salsheim is where the D.P.s are, so that's how I got to Salsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q. Now, it's been I guess a couple months, two or three months since you've been liberated, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q. Was there any effort to figure out whether you had family still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A. Well, that's where Hank comes in.</span> <span id="s1565">There was a tracing bureau opened where you asked about your families.</span> <span id="s1566">D.P. camps, where you registered and so on, so there was an effort to find out.</span> <span id="s1567">And that's what Hank did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q.</span> <span id="s1569">But up to this point you weren't able?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A. No, there was no mail.</span> <span id="s1571">There was no rails.</span> <span id="s1572">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s1573">There was no telephone.</span> <span id="s1574">There was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q. And you hadn't thought about going back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A. Not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q.</span> <span id="s1578">So you went to Salsheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A. I went to Salsheim.</span> <span id="s1580">I got a job in the office and we did register people who were looking for relatives and now the next thought is what are you going to do with the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s1581">You don't want to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s1582">We knew that we wanted to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1583">There was a very strong push of having displaced persons go to Palestine and there were a lot of single displaced persons and a lot of them did go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1584">So, I had a house in Salsheim and we lived there.</span> <span id="s1585">I worked in an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q.</span> <span id="s1587">What were the conditions like in the camp, in Salsheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A.

Yes.</span> <span id="s1692">My husband had a cousin here whom he didn't know who met him at the boat and took us to their house.</span> <span id="s1693">They were lovely people and kind and good, and we stayed there for a little while.</span> <span id="s1694">My husband had a sister in Peoria so naturally that is where we were going, my husband and my sister and I.</span> <span id="s1695">We got to Peoria.</span> <span id="s1696">She had just lost her husband and there really wasn't very much for us to do unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1697">We didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s1698">Their community was very willing.</span> <span id="s1699">They were so happy to finally have refugees and do something for them, they were willing to give us money.</span> <span id="s1700">Well, money we did not want.</span> <span id="s1701">We wanted to learn English, get a job and so on.</span> <span id="s1702">That was very tough because let's face it, I had no qualifications.</span> <span id="s1703">They finally got me a job in a sewing factory.</span> <span id="s1704">Princess Peggy's they used to make frocks or something like that.</span> <span id="s1705">I worked there for a whole two weeks, but at the end of day every day, the girl who supervised the work, came over ripped out what I did, because I didn't know how to use a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1706">So, if you have to put fancy things on it, you know, the material went and the other part went.</span> <span id="s1707">I really could never master that art.</span> <span id="s1708">I didn't know how to speak English, and I was very unhappy there.</span> <span id="s1709">Then my mother was coming to the States, so my husband says okay, I go to New York and pick up your mother and you stay here.</span> <span id="s1710">That's what he did.</span> <span id="s1711">Then he told me he's not going back to Peoria.</span> <span id="s1712">I said fine, I am coming to New York.</span> <span id="s1713">So, we left Peoria behind and got back to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q.</span> <span id="s1715">What were your first impressions when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A.</span> <span id="s1717">As far as people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q. Was it some sort of a culture shock at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A. No.</span> <span id="s1720">I remember my first ride in Central Park, and when I looked at the tall buildings and each building had a light in the window and I said to myself, there is a family living every place behind that light.</span> <span id="s1721">That was very impressive.</span> <span id="s1722">Life was not very easy to get adjusted and make a living here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q.</span> <span id="s1724">What do you think gave you the strength and the courage to get through all of this the way you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A. I really could not answer that question, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1726">I just thought that's the way I should behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q.</span> <span id="s1728">Did you think you would get through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A. No, but did I really give up hope completely?</span> <span id="s1730">Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q. Is there anything that you can think of that kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A. No, honestly I don't think it's a desire I have to survive to let the world know, I didn't think so.</span> <span id="s1733">I don't think that's what kept me going.</span> <span id="s1734">I think it was selfish reason to survive and to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q. It's interesting when you told me you got married at _______________, it strikes me that here you were in a concentration camp, without much hope, some man you've just basically met --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A. Oh, but he was so terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q. Okay, maybe you answered the question.</span> <span id="s1738">Why in these conditions did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A.</span> <span id="s1740">Why not?</span> <span id="s1741">I mean, it's answering a question with a question, why not?</span> <span id="s1742">Well, I'll tell you, if I wouldn't have gotten married to him, and that wasn't a pre thought idea, I would have never gotten out of Studthoff.</span> <span id="s1743">I only got out of Studthoff because I was his wife, and me made a deal with a guy who was in charge of work division.</span> <span id="s1744">He gave him his raincoat and my husband felt I have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1745">He can take it any time he wants to but he didn't.</span> <span id="s1746">He said you have my raincoat and you put my wife on that ____________ transport.</span> <span id="s1747">That was not the reason I married him.</span> <span id="s1748">But somehow that seemed that would be the better way to do it if we ever wanted to stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q.</span> <span id="s1750">So there was a thought that maybe there's a future there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A. I said there always was otherwise you wouldn't just do what you did.</span> <span id="s1752">You just didn't know how you were going to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q.</span> <span id="s1754">How important, if at all, was religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A None to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q. Were you resentful of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q. Sorry you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A. No, no problem.</span> <span id="s1760">I was amazed and probably happy for some people who had that belief and were going to the gas chambers with their hand and eyes to God, it's his will.</span> <span id="s1761">No, religion was of no importance to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q. And after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A. Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q.</span> <span id="s1765">The other thing that we had talked about a little, do you think that the experiences were different as a woman or as a girl than they were for boys and men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A.</span> <span id="s1767">The experience maybe were not but how it affected the experiences of men or boys but for women there was a difference.</span> <span id="s1768">I think some of it is probably their upbringing of women always take care of someone, of something.</span> <span id="s1769">And even it the someone or something is just themselves, but it's just taking care of.</span> <span id="s1770">Men, the majority was brought up that someone takes care of them because there was nobody to take care of them, they let themselves go much faster.</span> <span id="s1771">Women bonding with other women because they need that camaraderie probably more than men did.</span> <span id="s1772">That's my observation, my explanation of it.</span> <span id="s1773">So men when they lost their pride, they became nothing.</span> <span id="s1774">There was no support group, whereas lots of women did find support groups somehow.</span> <span id="s1775">Even the term was different, but just that whole idea of you have to be clean, you have to fight a little, you have to you know, and here is a little girl who needs help and so yes it depends on the woman.</span> <span id="s1776">It just isn't a flat rule going for all womanhood, but it was a certain trend of doing that.</span> <span id="s1777">On the other hand, I saw women who went very willingly on the bus train, whatever, car load, if their child was taken away from them.</span> <span id="s1778">They didn't have to.</span> <span id="s1779">I didn't see men doing it.</span> <span id="s1780">That doesn't mean they didn't, but I didn't see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q.</span> <span id="s1782">What about the way you were treated?</span> <span id="s1783">Were you treated differently by the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A.</span> <span id="s1785">In certain respect for women?</span> <span id="s1786">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q. Or disrespect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q. Was there an opportunity to women to use their sex to get favors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A. Sometimes.</span> <span id="s1791">I don't think there was the same opportunity for men because whatever they presented would not be very attractive to the SS women that have everything.</span> <span id="s1792">There were opportunities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q. And that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A. I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q.</span> <span id="s1796">This wasn't a first hand experience of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A. My first experience, no, but I know that it happened.</span> <span id="s1798">I don't like to prove my point by names and what not and having opinions about it or judgment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q. I'm just curious as to whether it went on and whether people were able to use that to their advantage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A. Sometimes they did and sometimes people did and could not.</span> <span id="s1801">And it wasn't always possible.</span> <span id="s1802">There were times that it was possible.</span> <span id="s1803">The will to life was very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q.</span> <span id="s1805">When you talk about the bonding between women, the relationships that were formed that really helped sustain you, were some of those relationship sexual as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A. No, not that I know.</span> <span id="s1807">It's not fair for me to say.</span> <span id="s1808">Not that I know.</span> <span id="s1809">Just loving someone and everytime I think of my girlfriend who stayed behind in Studthoff and lost her life --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q.</span> <span id="s1811">When you think back, and I'm sure you think back often, what images stick with you the most?</span> <span id="s1812">What haunts you the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A.</span> <span id="s1814">What hurts me the most I imagine the images of seeing people loaded on trains to destination destruction and murder.</span> <span id="s1815">I think that's probably -- the rest kind of disappears.</span> <span id="s1816">So there was hunger so people were dead.</span> <span id="s1817">That hurts the most.</span> <span id="s1818">There was just no way out of it except luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q.</span> <span id="s1820">What sort of long term impact do you think this has had on you and on your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A. Long term impact?</span> <span id="s1822">Nightmares, waking up in sweat and fear until you realize there is nothing to fear.</span> <span id="s1823">There are no trucks and SS and barracks and chambers and what not.</span> <span id="s1824">I think nightmares and thinking of all the ones who are no longer here.</span> <span id="s1825">It's not guilt.</span> <span id="s1826">I did not trade their places and vice versus.</span> <span id="s1827">It's just they were not as lucky as I was.</span> <span id="s1828">Most of it is luck.</span> <span id="s1829">It wasn't the armies helping to liberate the inmates of concentration camps and all of that.</span> <span id="s1830">There was no country who really reached out to help us.</span> <span id="s1831">So, it was luck, mostly, and if you call being at the right place at the right time, that's a part of luck, so I don't know really why I am alive and somebody isn't, but that is what the greatest impact is.</span> <span id="s1832">There was a very sad and those terms are all from this world, and I am referring to the other world, after the war long after the war, the past four years, my husband Hank and I traveled to the eastern European countries and I did go to Wilno and I did go to Pornaty and I did go to _____________ and I did go to ______________ and all those famous places, and what I saw was a quiet peaceful world with all those lives disappearing to the ground and burned and out of memory and nothing, just nothing.</span> <span id="s1833">That was painful.</span> <span id="s1834">When I went to _____________ and I visited a very famous monument built by the ____________ of _________________ , a beautiful monument to the hundreds of people who were destroyed by the Germans, non-Jews, every half of minute the bells are ringing to remind people.</span> <span id="s1835">Well, that kind of hurt.</span> <span id="s1836">What happened to the six million Jews.</span> <span id="s1837">The same way the Russians were probably helping to destroy.</span> <span id="s1838">One crime doesn't justify another.</span> <span id="s1839">It's just the memory.</span> <span id="s1840">Those were the bells every half a minute chimed and what happened to the six million Jews.</span> <span id="s1841">I can speak for them, that's all what's left for the world not to forget them.</span> <span id="s1842">That's sad.</span> <span id="s1843">I can do the best I know how.</span> <span id="s1844">I think not of six million, but the very dear ones I came across through my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q. Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A. I hope the world will not forget those people who died and don't consider every holocaust the same kind of holocaust.</span> <span id="s1847">Death is the same, murder is the same, but the motives and the way it was done, the way it was done by civilized people, it's not the same as every holocaust.</span> <span id="s1848">It was a group of people who's crime was to be Jews to burn and to disappear with a nod of the whole civilized world.</span> <span id="s1849">It's not the same holocaust and killing.</span> <span id="s1850">Any war is horrible, but it was done by an intelligent, educated, bright people, to take a whole nation and say vermin we are going to make the earth clear of you and have everyone participate.</span> <span id="s1851">So, it's a different holocaust.</span> <span id="s1852">Holocaust doesn't only mean kill or murder, and I think that's why the Jewish Holocaust is different.</span> <span id="s1853">And it should just make people aware that that can happen to any group of people by other people.</span> <span id="s1854">Then the Jewish holocaust wouldn't be unique, theirs would be unique.</span> <span id="s1855">It still would be unique, but what I'm saying is remember hatred does not justify that kind of human attitude.</span> <span id="s1856">And how do we teach people not to hate?</span> <span id="s1857">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0340 PAGE 37</span></p></body></html>
