Auxiliary of the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago</span></p> <p><span id="s9">NAME: IGOR FERTELMEYSTER Interviewers: Ruth Goodman and Gail Neiman I was born in Moscow in 1956.</span> <span id="s10">It was a famous day in Russia, it was the beginning of the war, June 22nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">It is very tricky to explain what my parents did for a living.</span> <span id="s12">My mother was an engineer, with software engineering and my father worked as a buyer for companies.</span> <span id="s13">I think that is close to what you would call it in America.</span> <span id="s14">They would buy components in big quantities and then sell them in smaller quantities to different plants.</span> <span id="s15">He dealt with radio components.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">When I was a child we lived in an apartment building.</span> <span id="s17">When I was born there were five of us who lived in a room, twelve square meters in size, and I don't even remember how many families were in the same apartment as we were, but we changed our apartment when I was two years old and we had a room, twenty square meters, and when my brother was born there were six of us in this room and also two other families in this apartment and there was one bathroom for all of us and one kitchen.</span> <span id="s18">It was very complicated!</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Then we got a two room apartment when I was eight years old and then we changed and when we left Russia, with my new family, not with my parents, we had a three room apartment.</span> <span id="s20">It was even larger than this apartment.</span> <span id="s21">But it was pretty unusual.</span> <span id="s22">Usually people lived in worse conditions than we did.</span> <span id="s23">We were lucky in this, because we had this big apartment and my mother and father also had a two room apartment.</span> <span id="s24">This is very good for the way people live in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">My parents met when my mother was on her vacation in Odessa and my father lived downstairs from the apartment of her relatives.</span> <span id="s26">They met at that time.</span> <span id="s27">My father was a sailor then and he lived in Odessa.</span> <span id="s28">They were married about a year later.</span> <span id="s29">They didn't tell me anything else about how I was born!</span></p> <p><span id="s30">When they were first married they lived in Krasnodar where my mother went after graduation from the Institute.</span> <span id="s31">Because it is the law in Russia that after graduation you must go to some place which is chosen for you to work.</span> <span id="s32">When I graduated, practically all people who lived in Moscow, they stayed in Moscow.</span> <span id="s33">But when my mother graduated, no one from her group stayed in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">When I was born, they returned to Moscow and lived with my mother's parents, in this 12 square meter room.</span> <span id="s35">The other people in the apartment were not relatives, the relatives just lived in the one room.</span> <span id="s36">In our room were my parents, my grandparents and myself.</span> <span id="s37">How they found the time to have my brother in this situation, I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">I used to go to day care when I was four years old and then I went to school and I changed schools almost every year, because I went to one school and then we changed our apartment and I was in a new development; then they build another school which was closer to our building and then I went to another school and then another school.</span> <span id="s39">Then I stayed in one school from fourth grade to eighth grade and then I changed school and went to a specialized school in math and physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">When I was very young I don't know who took care of me but when we moved to Moscow I had a baby sitter.</span> <span id="s41">It wasn't the truth when I told you that there were five of us in that room, because the baby sitter lived with us so there were six of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">There were probably some Jewish children in my first schools but I don't remember this for sure.</span> <span id="s43">I don't remember when I found out I was Jewish but probably not from my parents but from someone else.</span> <span id="s44">There is another meaning to being Jewish in Russia, in America it is probably people who belong to the Jewish religion because there are a lot of Jews who assimilated, and do not think they are still Jews.</span> <span id="s45">In Russia, we have a special mark on our documents with this as our nationality.</span> <span id="s46">Even in first grade this was marked on all our documents.</span> <span id="s47">So, probably somebody told me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">My parents were probably different from other families in Russia but I wasn't too much aware of this as a child.</span> <span id="s49">But my parents did not know anything about Judaica or Jewish History.</span> <span id="s50">My grandparents knew because both of the parents of my mother spoke Yiddish and my grandmother on my father's side also spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s51">For my father's mother it was easier because they lived in Odessa and it was a more Jewish city than Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">I remember that when I was very young, probably about four, everyone in Odessa seemed to be speaking Yiddish, and when I grew up about half of the people in Odessa were speaking Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s53">I didn't know my grandfather from my father's side because he was shot in 1937, during Stalin's terror.</span> <span id="s54">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I went to school, as a youngster, the school began about 8:30 AM., I don't remember.</span> <span id="s56">Then I came back and was alone at home until about six o'clock when my parents came back from work and for most of this time I read.</span> <span id="s57">I began to read not so early, at eight years but from that time on it was my love.</span> <span id="s58">I read now, also, maybe too much!</span></p> <p><span id="s59">I don't remember having chores or jobs to do at home as a youngster.</span> <span id="s60">I think the adults took care of everything by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Our family celebrated some things but they weren't Jewish holidays, just the usual governmental and family holidays.</span> <span id="s62">We celebrated anniversaries, weddings, things like that.</span> <span id="s63">For a birthday, it was typical to eat, eat, eat and it was maybe more fun than here because you could eat anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s64">But in Russia there is a special preparation for this day and people tried to get something unusual.</span> <span id="s65">I don't remember what these things were, I have never been a great eater.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Our family had practically no friends because of the character of my father, he didn't like people, so on these holidays it was mainly our family.</span> <span id="s67">Mainly they were from my mother's side of the family because they all lived in Moscow.</span> <span id="s68">Actually my parents had only one family as friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">When I was young and at school, we spent each Summer in Odessa because it is near the sea and it is a kind of resort.</span> <span id="s70">We lived their with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s71">It was fun to go there because there was no sea in Moscow and there is sea in Odessa!</span> <span id="s72">Not a bad place to spend a summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">As for as finding out that I was Jewish, it was probably in a negative way.</span> <span id="s74">I don't remembers anything specific but usually if somebody would remind you that you are a Jew it is usually in a negative way.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">My father's father, I only know that he was arrested in 1937 and then my grandmother got a paper that he had died in 1943, but he probably died earlier.</span> <span id="s76">When he was arrested my father was seven years old and his sister was three or four years old.</span> <span id="s77">So my grandmother did not get married again, so all her life was in raising her children in Odessa.</span> <span id="s78">She is still alive in Odessa.</span> <span id="s79">She is eighty-three years old and she lives with my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">I think my grandfather was probably arrested because he was a Jew and he was something like an accounting clerk and my grandmother was told that he had belonged to some organizations and that was why he was arrested.</span> <span id="s81">It was a crazy idea of Stalin's.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">My grandfather on my mother's side was born in Minsk and when he was twenty years old he went with his older brother to Palestine and his brother stayed in Palestine and my grandfather came back to Russia because he was a communist and he believed in their ideals.</span> <span id="s83">Maybe if he had changed his ideas at the right time I would have been born in the right place!</span></p> <p><span id="s84">I don't know how he met my grandmother because she lived in Moscow and she lived in, as far as I remember, in a Jewish neighborhood of Moscow.</span> <span id="s85">It wasn't actually in Moscow at that time, it was a village near Moscow, but now it is part of Moscow.</span> <span id="s86">And I remember my great-grandparents from both sides.</span> <span id="s87">I don't know a lot about them, all of them passed away when I was pretty young.</span> <span id="s88">I remember only that my father's grandfather had some private place where they made cooking oil.</span> <span id="s89">After the Revolution he lost everything and when I saw him he was very, very old.</span> <span id="s90">I really didn't remember that we spoke of anything serious.</span> <span id="s91">He was very kind to me but I don't remember more about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">My grandfather believed in all the things and my parents weren't members of the communist party and I really don't remember what they thought about the party when I was young but when I grew up they understood everything about the situation of the country but my grandfather, he believed until his death and he argued with me when I said something against the rules of the country.</span> <span id="s93">It was difficult to change his mind because he was used to living this kind of life and when someone tells you that everything is wrong it would mean that all his life was wrong, and it was not easy to change your attitudes about these things.</span> <span id="s94">At least I never heard from him about any change in his thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">I had found at an early age that I like mostly math and physics and this branch of science.</span> <span id="s96">I told you that I changed in high school (there is not such a term as high school in Russia) and I spent these years in a Special School for Math.</span> <span id="s97">There are special language schools.</span> <span id="s98">Okay, my wife will tell about her school herself, but she went to a Special English School but it didn't help her to know English.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">After that, I went to a Machine Building Institute.</span> <span id="s100">I tried to go to a University but I failed.</span> <span id="s101">I went and applied and had exams but I didn't pass that exam and probably because I was Jewish because after my special school it is impossible to get a "D" in a math exam.</span> <span id="s102">So, one task was so difficult that I didn't know anyone who could solve it.</span> <span id="s103">It seemed impossible.</span> <span id="s104">So then I went to this Institute and passed all exams very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">There is no problem for Jews to go to Technical Institutes because there is no real demand for places at these Institutes.</span> <span id="s106">I have to explain the situation, because it may be difficult for you to understand.</span> <span id="s107">In America, you pay money and you go to university, - you pay?</span> <span id="s108">you stay.</span> <span id="s109">And in Russia, everything is free, so they choose people who would study at this Institute and because it is free it is their choice, not ours.</span> <span id="s110">There are more places in Technical Institutes than there are people who want to study there.</span> <span id="s111">So most of the Jews study in technical areas, machine building, civil engineering, and you must really be something special to go to Moscow University.</span> <span id="s112">Not many Jews get to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">I am not sure but I suppose there is a special percentage of Jews who are allowed to study there and this percentage is probably less than it was during the Czar.</span> <span id="s114">Because during the Czar's time it was 5% and in Soviet time it is less.</span> <span id="s115">But this situation is not only for Jews.</span> <span id="s116">It is also difficult for people from the Caucasus: Georgia, Armenia - to pass these exams to the medical institute in Moscow.</span> <span id="s117">Some rules are hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">The children of lawyers weren't allowed to study in law schools.</span> <span id="s119">They just weren't allowed.</span> <span id="s120">Because if you are a lawyer and the professor is also a lawyer, and this might give you connections that would help your children at the school.</span> <span id="s121">So it is really crazy.</span> <span id="s122">You are used to living in a normal world and this kind of crazy world is hard for you to understand!</span></p> <p><span id="s123">So after you graduate a day institute, a full-time institute, because there is an evening institute or a part-time institute that people attend while they are also working.</span> <span id="s124">When you graduate a full-time institute you cannot choose between positions that are available, they put you in a job.</span> <span id="s125">I was first in my group so I could choose from among many positions, but I was advised to go to one place, a machine building plant, and I really loved this place, because of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Russian education is very different from an American one because Americans get a very narrow but very deep education, and we got a not so deep but wider education and it is very important when you went to work to go to the right place with people who could help you to learn deeper.</span> <span id="s127">So I was in a good place with good people.</span> <span id="s128">I was twenty-two years old when I took this first job.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">I also met Tatyana, my wife, while I was working here.</span> <span id="s130">It was very funny.</span> <span id="s131">At that time I understood why I paid my money as a member to Komsomol, the Communist Youth Organization.</span> <span id="s132">Because I met Tatyana in the quarters of the Komsomol Organization in our plant.</span> <span id="s133">She was a journalist and she came to our plant to make interviews with some young people who worked at our plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">So I met her and we got married in two months.</span> <span id="s135">When I met her I did not know that she was Jewish, my mother asked me about that but I couldn't answer her on that.</span> <span id="s136">Fortunately, she was.</span> <span id="s137">I think it was important to my family that she was Jewish because in Russia, especially, there is a lot of problems with intermarriage.</span> <span id="s138">I understand that there are a lot of problems in America with this kind of family situation but there are probably differences.</span> <span id="s139">With some spouses, whether they are Jewish, or of another nation, which are living under more difficult situations than if you are Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">For example, if your husband wasn't promoted and you understand that he wasn't promoted because he is a Jew, you might begin to complain, "Why did I marry you, when I could have chosen another guy and not have these problems?"</span> <span id="s141">There are some Jewish/non-Jewish marriages, but probably not as many as between different nationalities within the Soviet.</span> <span id="s142">Even before marriage Jews understand that they might have trouble, not necessarily with their spouses but with the parents-in-law, and because of this closeness with one's parents in Russia, it is closer than here because everyone lives together in one apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Divorce is as common in Russia as here but maybe the reasons for divorce are different.</span> <span id="s144">I think the main reason for divorce there is that everyone has to live with their parents.</span> <span id="s145">The second main reason for divorce there is drunkenness.</span> <span id="s146">You cannot imagine how much a Russian can drink.</span> <span id="s147">I could drink a pint of Vodka and I saw one guy who drank a liter of Vodka and he worked after that!</span></p> <p><span id="s148">After I met Tatyana, we began to live together after two weeks.</span> <span id="s149">This is not common in Russia.</span> <span id="s150">She had a room in an apartment and so we began to live together.</span> <span id="s151">This was after two weeks and I had spent one of the weeks on a business trip.</span> <span id="s152">So it was very quick.</span> <span id="s153">I think that is the only way to get married when you are twenty-six years old because otherwise you see that this woman has these bad sides and another woman has these bad sides, and you know one will never find someone completely perfect.</span> <span id="s154">And I know I am not either.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">We spent our honeymoon before the wedding because I decided to change my job and got a vacation from my job and Tatyana was at university and she had exams at that time and she had vacation from her work for exams and so we spent that time as our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s156">I read this joke that I liked, "We liked our honeymoon so much, we decided to get married."</span> <span id="s157">The wedding ceremony was very official.</span> <span id="s158">In one year I participated in our wedding, the wedding of Tatyana's witnesses at our wedding and then the wedding of my brother.</span> <span id="s159">All the ceremonies were just the same and I was laughing under the surface.</span> <span id="s160">There is a special text that this representative of the Soviet government pronounces for the bride and groom and she pronounces it without any emotion.</span> <span id="s161">We had two parties because we didn't have enough room to invite all the friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s162">So we had one party for relatives and then, in a week, we had another party for friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">At the parties, we drink vodka, maybe a little dancing, but there is not much room.</span> <span id="s164">Sometimes people have the parties at restaurants.</span> <span id="s165">But we did not, for us it was too expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">We lived very well for Russia when we got married.</span> <span id="s167">Now I tell you what my salary was.</span> <span id="s168">It was like $158 for each month.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">It was really strange because when my cousin started to leave Russia I didn't think he was doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s170">Not that he was crazy or anything, but just that he wasn't right.</span> <span id="s171">And I changed my mind eventually when my daughter was born, because I began to see nightmares about pogroms and I understand that it is really possible in Russia and I did not want to be in Russia if it happened again.</span> <span id="s172">But I spent five years arguing with Tatyana about this.</span> <span id="s173">She wanted to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Anyway, it was impossible to leave Russia at that time so then Tatyana picked the right time to leave.</span> <span id="s175">It was at the easiest time to leave Russia and come to America because before that it was very difficult to leave Russia and now it is very difficult to get into America, so we did choose the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">It is possible to read about pogroms, but it was as if it was something that was only possible before the Revolution and that they were impossible afterward.</span> <span id="s177">But, I knew that this was possible.</span> <span id="s178">Only because I had a child, because I don't think that when people decided to leave in our time (not now, completely different now), they didn't think only about themselves, only about their children.</span> <span id="s179">Even now, I can't say that it is better for me in America than in Russia because I really had a good job, not a bad apartment, and - the most important thing - I lost my friends and my circle of living.</span> <span id="s180">How to say it?</span> <span id="s181">When you live in America, you begin to forget about all the difficulties you met in Russia and remember fondly all the things you left there.</span> <span id="s182">But I don't feel bad that I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">We decided to leave in 1987.</span> <span id="s184">It was a one time decision because we went to visit my friends who got permission to leave and there was another couple there and they asked my friends to make them an invitation to Israel and I asked that they would also make this invitation to us.</span> <span id="s185">We waited three months to get this invitation and then waited five months to get permission, but it was very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">I don't think that we considered going to Israel when we were in Russia but when we were in Italy this situation with permission to come to America changed and then we considered going to Israel.</span> <span id="s187">But, the main thing was leaving Russia.</span> <span id="s188">There is no big deal in the difference between countries outside of Russia, there is a big difference between Russia and other countries in the whole world.</span> <span id="s189">But we didn't have anybody in Israel, some friends of our relatives but they were not close to us.</span> <span id="s190">Here I had a cousin and he was pretty close to me when he lived in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">It is hard to say what the difficulties are in Russia.</span> <span id="s192">Everything that is easy in America is difficult in Russia.</span> <span id="s193">Shortages of food, of clothing, of apartments, of anything there.</span> <span id="s194">Now it is worse than when we left.</span> <span id="s195">I read in one letter that there is nothing on the shelves there and this nothing becomes less and less.</span> <span id="s196">The most difficult thing is the insecurity.</span> <span id="s197">You don't know what will happen in the next day and it is possible that everything you can imagine, or can't imagine, may happen.</span> <span id="s198">This applies to all Russians, not just Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">When we prepared for our interview with the American Embassy in Italy and it was important to prove that we were leaving because we had difficulties because we were Jews, we began to remember some cases when something wasn't allowed us because we were a Jew and we did remember.</span> <span id="s200">But it wasn't the only reason for our leaving.</span> <span id="s201">The main reason is that it is practically impossible to live in Russia.</span> <span id="s202">For anybody!</span></p> <p><span id="s203">6/26/90 INTERVIEW WITH IGOR FERTELMEISTER.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">(What did it mean to be a Jew in Russia?)</span> <span id="s205">Mostly it means that you feel different, no - not that you feel different, but that other people push you to feel different.</span> <span id="s206">Because a lot of Jews find they are Jewish at seven years old when they go to school.</span> <span id="s207">When other people, teachers, tell them something that is not polite.</span> <span id="s208">It really depends on the teachers.</span> <span id="s209">Russian teachers have a different level of intelligence and education so some of them can tell Jewish kids that --, especially now, now there are a lot of cases, where teachers belong to this Russian Nationalistic organization, Pamjat'.</span> <span id="s210">And I read an article about one school in Leningrad where they really pushed all Jewish kids from this school.</span> <span id="s211">All teachers, with the principal of the school, and there were about 300 Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s212">And this was a special school, I don't remember what was special about this school, but it is very common with special schools that there are more Jewish kids than in common ones.</span> <span id="s213">Because Jewish parents want their children to get more knowledge in different fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">And when I grew up all companies were formed mostly along nationalistic principles.</span> <span id="s215">Because a lot of my friends were Jewish and not because they were the best people for me but because if I knew somebody was a Jew even that made me feel a different way toward him and to closer to him.</span> <span id="s216">But, I also had Russian friends and at some point we couldn't understand each other.</span> <span id="s217">With Jews, there were fewer points of non-understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Maybe for people who tried to hide their Jewishness, it was more difficult to live because they had to think every time that they didn't, they couldn't show they were a Jew.</span> <span id="s219">For example, not to mention the maiden name of your mother, because then they would show that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s220">For me it was simpler because I never tried to hide that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s221">I didn't really have a lot of difficulties connected with my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s222">I told you that it was difficult for me to get to the university but,--- When we had to prepare ourselves for the interview at the American Embassy in Italy we began to remember all cases where it was bad for us and we remembered seven cases.</span> <span id="s223">But it wasn't really the reason for our leaving.</span> <span id="s224">And we had to try real hard to remember these.</span> <span id="s225">Before we came to Italy it was very easy to get into the United States.</span> <span id="s226">This interview at the American Embassy with the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) was pretty informal and just when we came, America changed rules and people began to get a refusal to come to America.</span> <span id="s227">So this interview wasn't so informal.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">When we lived in the townhouse in Italy with another two family and two families got permission to go to United States and we left Italy day after day.</span> <span id="s229">But the third family got refused, so, they spent four months in Italy.</span> <span id="s230">I thought at the time, and I think it now, that America could not refuse anybody for reason, because it would be impossible to blame America for discrimination in this case.</span> <span id="s231">And it was lenient toward Russian immigrants.</span> <span id="s232">And they refused without any visible reason.</span> <span id="s233">There was some refusal with reason but only a few.</span> <span id="s234">Only now, all people who were in Italy have come here.</span> <span id="s235">About two weeks ago the last family from Italy came.</span> <span id="s236">They spent more than a year in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">(When you decided to leave, what was the process?)</span> <span id="s238">Everybody who is going to leave knows exactly what he is going to do.</span> <span id="s239">Because, even before he made such a decision he knew a lot of other people who were going to leave and others who had already left.</span> <span id="s240">So everyone has some instruction on how to prepare yourself for leaving.</span> <span id="s241">It is about ten pages with the names and addresses of all organizations you need to deal with.</span> <span id="s242">With a list of all the papers you need to fill out, with different advice on how to make the process easier.</span> <span id="s243">So it was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Most people went from Moscow to Vienna, then Italy, and then to the United States.</span> <span id="s245">So we spent twenty days in Austria -it was very beautiful, and then we came to Italy and found out about these refusals.</span> <span id="s246">Then it wasn't so beautiful!</span> <span id="s247">In the beginning I didn't believe in this.</span> <span id="s248">Because it was only eight cases and I could see some reason for these refusals.</span> <span id="s249">But when it became thirty percent - - - Before we left Russia we considered only about going to the United States.</span> <span id="s250">When we were in Europe, we understood that the main point is to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s251">Where we ended up was important but not as important as being out of Russia.</span> <span id="s252">So, in Italy we had to consider that maybe if we are refused by America, maybe we will go to Israel.</span> <span id="s253">But, mainly the reason we wanted to come here was because we had only one relative outside of Russia and he was living here.</span> <span id="s254">We thought it would be easier for us to accommodate in a country where we knew someone.</span> <span id="s255">And this is true.</span> <span id="s256">Because there are all the different rules, even little ones, and people behave differently from what we were used to.</span> <span id="s257">And we needed someone to give us advice and we were really good pupils.</span> <span id="s258">I followed all my cousin's advice!</span> <span id="s259">Now, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">(What did he tell you?)</span> <span id="s261">Where I needed to apply to Social Security; how to write my resume; how to open a checking account in a bank.</span> <span id="s262">A lot of things we would have never thought about.</span> <span id="s263">The language also.</span> <span id="s264">I remember how scary it was when I went to apply for Social Security.</span> <span id="s265">Everything was so strange for me, I went along the street and it was really scary.</span> <span id="s266">Now I am at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Nothing frightened me in Italy and Vienna.</span> <span id="s268">We were just very excited.</span> <span id="s269">Especially because it was the first Western country we saw.</span> <span id="s270">I was in East Germany and Bulgaria but it is not the same.</span> <span id="s271">Germany is not so bad in comparison with Austria but Austria is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">I didn't connect these reactions with freedom but more with the different stores, the things, and mostly the food available.</span> <span id="s273">We were in Austria - we left Russia on the twentieth of October, so there were a lot of fruits.</span> <span id="s274">There in the fruit stores, and very cheap.</span> <span id="s275">And you cannot buy even apples, in Russia.</span> <span id="s276">And another thing we were surprised at the clean air.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Now it is really strange for me, the American government made a law about clean air and Chicago is one of the worst places in America.</span> <span id="s278">The air in Chicago, compared with Moscow, it is perfume.</span> <span id="s279">I think there are some places in Moscow where there is no oxygen at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">(We wanted to go back and talk about your grandfather and what happened to him, the one you said was probably arrested because he was an activist.)</span> <span id="s281">I knew only a few things about this because I think parents try to save their children from bad things.</span> <span id="s282">They do this not only for the children, but for their own security.</span> <span id="s283">Because, even after this Twentieth Congress of Communist Party when Khrushchev spoke about Stalin and what he had done, even after that it was marked on any application form was the question, they asked if somebody from your relatives was repressed or something like that.</span> <span id="s284">Also, if you or your relatives had spent any time in occupied territory.</span> <span id="s285">Because every person who was in occupied territory in World War II was not considered like a hero but a criminal.</span> <span id="s286">And a lot of such people when they were freed from the concentration camp in Germany, then they came to Russia and then were sent to a concentration camp in Russia because they were considered as traitors because they were caught.</span> <span id="s287">So parents did not tell a lot about somebody who had spent some time in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">My father was born in 1930 and his father died in 1937 so even he did not remember him well.</span> <span id="s289">I only know that my grandmother who lived longer that this was very difficult because when my grandfather was killed she had to raise two children, one seven years old; another four years old.</span> <span id="s290">And when she got old, then as an old woman she like to cry.</span> <span id="s291">So she mostly cried about her husband and they had only lived together maybe eight years in all.</span> <span id="s292">I never really discussed this with her.</span> <span id="s293">At first, I was too young to ask these kinds of questions.</span> <span id="s294">And then when I didn't go to Odessa where she lived, and then I became older and it was a good time to ask these questions, but then she was to old to be asked.</span> <span id="s295">She is still in Odessa.</span> <span id="s296">We wrote a lot of letters back and forth at first but now it is very, very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">My mother and brother are still in Russia.</span> <span id="s298">My brother is going to come out, but it is difficult.</span> <span id="s299">He got refugee status at the American Embassy in Moscow with his new wife, because he got a divorce and then married another girl.</span> <span id="s300">And now he is going to divorce her, and now I can't figure out how he will come here because she doesn't want to come here and she doesn't allow him to go alone.</span> <span id="s301">It is not simple.</span> <span id="s302">In Russia, even if you pay, you need to get the divorce paper that she has no financial dependence on you.</span> <span id="s303">And she does not care to sign it!</span> <span id="s304">Her father was Jewish but not her mother, but that doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s305">But he -- He has children by both his first wife and his second wife.</span> <span id="s306">Fortunately, his first wife is now married to my cousin and they are also going to come.</span> <span id="s307">It is so funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">My mother wants to come here, and was here to visit us.</span> <span id="s309">She didn't like America when she was here but now when she is back in Russia, now she likes America!</span></p> <p><span id="s310">But their coming mostly depends on my father.</span> <span id="s311">And when we were going to leave he wouldn't even speak with me.</span> <span id="s312">Now he completely changed his mind about immigration.</span> <span id="s313">But it is very difficult for him to lose his job.</span> <span id="s314">Because he is a manager, some kind of manager and he deals with a lot of people and people like him and he really lives on his job.</span> <span id="s315">So, to lose his job was practically to lose the most important part of his life.</span> <span id="s316">So, when he will be retired, it would not be a big difference for him to live in Russia or here.</span> <span id="s317">But even then it would be difficult for him.</span> <span id="s318">Because at his age it is very difficult to learn the new language and he has never learned any other language.</span> <span id="s319">My mother used to learn English and French.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">My father will be sixty this year, and my mother is fifty-eight.</span> <span id="s321">So when my brother, I hope, leaves Russia, and his first wife also leaves Russia.</span> <span id="s322">Because my mother is very strange.</span> <span id="s323">I think she likes her first daughter-in-law better than her son.</span> <span id="s324">Because when they were divorced my mother stayed with her ex-daughter-in-law, even though she (the daughter-in-law) had her own apartment.</span> <span id="s325">So, when all of them will leave Russia, I think that it will be easier for my parents to leave.</span> <span id="s326">They have already applied for permission to come to America but it will probably take them more than a year to get this through to American Embassy, maybe two years, because now it is something like a million who have applied.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">I am concerned about their still being in Russia.</span> <span id="s328">It is possible to be worried about everything one can imagine happening, and even things one cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s329">In one program, on Russian TV, was announced that this organization Pamjat' was going to make pogroms on the fifth of May.</span> <span id="s330">I could believe it.</span> <span id="s331">Just before we left, it was the same slogans out on the street that there would be Jewish Pogroms, I can't remember, it was the Fourth of June or the Sixth of June.</span> <span id="s332">It was the thousandth anniversary of Christianity in Russia and they were going to celebrate this way.</span> <span id="s333">There wasn't anything, but people were really scared and some of them didn't go anywhere - to the countryside where they have some country houses.</span> <span id="s334">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s335">There were slogans all over the countryside.</span> <span id="s336">There were articles in the newspapers that the KGB knew about this and didn't let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">This Anti-semitism in Russia became more open.</span> <span id="s338">I can't say it grew up but it became more open.</span> <span id="s339">I used to speak with the guys in Pamjat', but they were just stupid.</span> <span id="s340">But this group is really dangerous, Pamjat' - Memory.</span> <span id="s341">Most of their slogans are all right.</span> <span id="s342">They are saying that Russian nature is spoiled.</span> <span id="s343">That Russian culture has been destroyed.</span> <span id="s344">That it is necessary to save Russian culture and nature.</span> <span id="s345">That it is not right for the Russian government to sell all natural resources to the West.</span> <span id="s346">Everything is logical, only one point - they blame Jews for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">But these right words make a lot of people feel that these guys really want changes in the right direction.</span> <span id="s348">I saw people who came to Moscow from Kazan, from very far places, especially to speak with the guys from Pamjat'.</span> <span id="s349">Another thing, Russian people used to think that everybody who was blamed for anything in the newspaper were actually the good guys.</span> <span id="s350">Because Russian newspaper wrote that Solshenitzyn was bad, Sahkarov was bad.</span> <span id="s351">And now everybody knows that they were not bad.</span> <span id="s352">But, Pamjat' is still bad, so there are plenty who think they may really be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">So, I never met the leaders of this organization.</span> <span id="s354">I only read interviews in Russian-American newspapers but those members on lower level, they know a lot of slogans, and they are very pushy, they don't want to hear any arguments but it is not so simple.</span> <span id="s355">For example, I saw where when one guy called the man from Pamjat' an Anti-Semite, and he tried to grab him and bring him to the police because he used a bad word to him.</span> <span id="s356">They never told that they have something against Jews, only about Zionists, but all Zionists have already left.</span> <span id="s357">They speak against Zionists and Masons, and they also don't know who they are.</span> <span id="s358">They say the Masons are a conspiracy organization.</span> <span id="s359">There were Masons in Russia but I am sure there are only a very few now.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">(What are you disappointed in here?)</span> <span id="s361">I don't want to hurt your feelings.</span> <span id="s362">I thought that Americans were smarter and better.</span> <span id="s363">I am really disappointed in the level of the American engineers.</span> <span id="s364">There is really a different educational level.</span> <span id="s365">Most American engineers are Bachelors and most Russian engineers have their Masters degrees.</span> <span id="s366">First, I thought that our Masters Degree was closer to Bachelors but not now.</span> <span id="s367">It is another kind of education.</span> <span id="s368">We got a very wide education, maybe not so deep as American.</span> <span id="s369">And in modern industry and modern sciences it is good to know things in a wider area.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Another thing, I don't like the way I have to work.</span> <span id="s371">Because both companies I work for are small, and everything depends on the one man.</span> <span id="s372">I'm am used to making my own decisions and everything must be referred through him and it is uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s373">In Russia, I could argue with anybody, the production manager, my supervisor, - I was fully responsible for my work.</span> <span id="s374">And here -he signs checks, so I should keep my mouth closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">But, the main thing, the good thing that is different from Russia, but these things seem so natural to us now that sometimes we forget that we didn't have them in Russia.</span> <span id="s376">For example, nature.</span> <span id="s377">There are only rats and cats on the streets in Russia and here we see so much more.</span> <span id="s378">It was a one of our biggest surprises, when we had just come here and we saw squirrels.</span> <span id="s379">We have them in Russia but in special parks, not on the street.</span> <span id="s380">Basically, I see these animals on the road.</span> <span id="s381">I drive on Rand Road.</span> <span id="s382">The speed limit is 55 but everybody drives 65.</span> <span id="s383">I see animals by the side of the road.</span> <span id="s384">I saw two live deer, and others.</span> <span id="s385">One time we even had a raccoon by the house.</span> <span id="s386">They look very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Another big surprise for us was that Jews are Jews here and these Orthodox Jews surprised me.</span> <span id="s388">There are even the Jews here with the big black hats and very they walk proudly as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Basically we had not so good expectations and often told ourselves that our life would be very difficult especially the first couple of years.</span> <span id="s390">We were really looking ahead to our children's future.</span> <span id="s391">When we came, we found out that our life wasn't over yet, so we have a lot of years ahead.</span> <span id="s392">We can have our own fun in America.</span> <span id="s393">Now my wife will tell you she says, "Why did we come to America?</span> <span id="s394">to work or to have fun?"</span> <span id="s395">Basically I thought about the children and their future.</span> <span id="s396">They can choose their own way in America, there are a lot of good ways and a lot of bad ways.</span> <span id="s397">The good ways are much better than in Russia; but American bad ways are worse than Russia.</span> <span id="s398">So I want my children to choose the good ways.</span> <span id="s399">You know this better than me: drugs, crime.</span> <span id="s400">There are probably some drug problems in Russia but especially five years ago nobody knew about the problem.</span> <span id="s401">And it is much more difficult to get drugs there.</span> <span id="s402">From this point of view, children were safer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">There were other problems there.</span> <span id="s404">Alcohol.</span> <span id="s405">Acetone.</span> <span id="s406">As Russian engineers, we had to make something from nothing.</span> <span id="s407">In America you don't have to be so creative because everything is available.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">I don't know if I ever want a business of my own.</span> <span id="s409">I know what kind of a business I can manage.</span> <span id="s410">But, for this business first I need "cold metal" because I am an engineer in the area of control.</span> <span id="s411">And there are not a lot of companies which have such an engineer on their staff.</span> <span id="s412">I deal with anything which has automatic controls, any machine tools, in any industry.</span> <span id="s413">And there are a lot of smaller companies, ten to twenty or so people, who cannot afford to have such a specialist on their staff.</span> <span id="s414">So if I would know forty or fifty such companies and everyone would have a problem ten days out of a year, I could open my own business.</span> <span id="s415">It doesn't make any difference to me in which field I work, because from the point of view of the controls any machine is practically the same as any other.</span> <span id="s416">But it is not a goal, to have my own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">I could speak a very long time about many things we have not discussed.</span> <span id="s418">You can see, when you ask the questions I tell you more than you want.</span> <span id="s419">It is easy to remember things not connected with your questions at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">My son now answers the question, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s421">with "Chicago."</span> <span id="s422">This is not upsetting to me.</span> <span id="s423">Maybe it will be helpful to him to know about Russia and maybe he will have some interest in Russia when he is older.</span> <span id="s424">But now I do not feel it is important to talk about it much.</span> <span id="s425">I don't care what he remembers about Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">At home we speak only in Russian, and we do not allow our children to speak English at home.</span> <span id="s427">But it is very difficult to stop that.</span> <span id="s428">In a few years, it will be easier for them to speak English, even in a few months.</span> <span id="s429">My daughter began to translate phrases from English into Russian after a half a year in America.</span> <span id="s430">She deals with Russian phrases in an American manner.</span> <span id="s431">She is the only Russian kid in her class.</span> <span id="s432">She speaks English all day and she spends maybe two or three hours a day with us.</span> <span id="s433">And we cannot spend all these three hours talking with her.</span> <span id="s434">We are trying not to let her be too involved with TV either.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">We have explained to her many times why we left Russia.</span> <span id="s436">My cousin told me that they had a lot of problems with his daughter.</span> <span id="s437">They also left when their daughter was seven years old and in a year she was trying to hide that she was from Russia and she did not want to bring her friends home, embarrassed that her parents didn't speak English well.</span> <span id="s438">The only way they managed was by explaining what they did was for her and that it was very difficult for them.</span> <span id="s439">For us the leaving was much simpler than for them.</span> <span id="s440">They were some of the last immigrants on the first wave.</span> <span id="s441">For us it was simpler in the bureaucratic way but in a psychological way it was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">So it is the way that children can be made proud that they have another heritage than American and that they are not worse than American kids.</span> <span id="s443">They have something that is good.</span> <span id="s444">And when my daughter told me that she wants to change her name to Alice.</span> <span id="s445">I told her that it is very common among kids that they want to be the same as the others, but it is really important but more difficult to be different.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">I know my cousin has a lot of problems with his daughter now but it is different.</span> <span id="s447">She is sixteen now and they had terrible problems.</span> <span id="s448">His wife is a doctor so she, after they came here, she had been preparing for her exams for two years and then there was her residency.</span> <span id="s449">He worked to feed his family and neither of them could spend a lot of time with her.</span> <span id="s450">So they practically lost control of their daughter, now they have problems.</span> <span id="s451">Let us hope it works better for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">IGOR FERTELMEYSTER</span></p> <p><span id="s453">J.C.C./W.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">page \*
