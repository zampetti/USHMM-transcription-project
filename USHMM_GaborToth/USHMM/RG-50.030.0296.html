id="s10">05:00:26</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: I need you to start off please by telling me what your name was at the time of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Where you were born and on what date?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name was Gertrude Granirer and I was born in a small town in Romania.</span> <span id="s14">Some 10 miles away from Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s15">And I was born September 28, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: The name of the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: The name, Sadagura (ph).</span> <span id="s18">The meaning of that word, Sad means garden, and Gura means hill.</span> <span id="s19">A garden on the hill.</span> <span id="s20">And this is -- the word was, I believe, Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Was it a lovely town?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s23">For me it was a lovely town.</span> <span id="s24">Only three thousand people.</span> <span id="s25">Very small.</span> <span id="s26">And all my studying I did in the next town in Chernivtsi.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you have a comfortable childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Very comfortable.</span> <span id="s29">I was an only child and they discovered very early in my life that I had an inclination or a talent for music.</span> <span id="s30">I would go to the piano, which was almost in every house of a middle class family, and I would play whatever I heard people singing and so they started me very early -- I was four years old.</span> <span id="s31">And when I was six I already played little concerts.</span> <span id="s32">But my mother was not very keen for me to become a professional musician.</span> <span id="s33">It was only to round out my education.</span> <span id="s34">In fact, when she realized that I became very involved with music, she didn't like it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">05:03:01 But by that time it was too late.</span> <span id="s36">I was also, through my father, very interested in languages.</span> <span id="s37">My father had been turned from the first World War with a shrapnel (ph) in his hip which could never be removed.</span> <span id="s38">And so he was a -- what do you call it -- a disabled person.</span> <span id="s39">And he couldn't walk very much.</span> <span id="s40">He was a lawyer and he loved me very much and so I loved him too.</span> <span id="s41">I was constantly next to him and he was very proud of my achievement.</span> <span id="s42">Whatever he had taught me I knew.</span> <span id="s43">I would know all the capitols in the world of all the countries and I would know all the rivers and all the mountains even in America.</span> <span id="s44">And he never dreamed of going, leaving our home town.</span> <span id="s45">And so when I was about six years old I spoke five languages and had made up my mind that I would study languages.</span> <span id="s46">If possible, one new language each year.</span> <span id="s47">I came up to ten languages and then the world fell apart.</span> <span id="s48">And I realized that I could not afford that luxury any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: You said the world fell apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, 1938 and 39 we heard a lot of rumblings what went on in Germany.</span> <span id="s51">We saw many people running away from Poland.</span> <span id="s52">Some of them from Illwolf (ph) and coming into our town.</span> <span id="s53">And some of us opened our doors for them and they told us how horrible things were.</span> <span id="s54">And we heard a great deal about Hitler and on the radio when he was on, everybody listened.</span> <span id="s55">And everybody was afraid, but nobody believed that he would, in fact, come to our town.</span> <span id="s56">We just felt very sorry for the people in those other towns where Hitler was.</span> <span id="s57">And in 1940 Hitler and Stalin made this agreement.</span> <span id="s58">1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">05:06:05 Ah, and they were suddenly good friends.</span> <span id="s60">In this agreement Stalin got half of Poland, the Baltic States, Bessarabia, which was part of Romania, and for a good measure they also marched into the Bukovina which was never theirs before.</span> <span id="s61">Why they did it, we don't know.</span> <span id="s62">I don't know to this date.</span> <span id="s63">But suddenly one day there was an ultimatum on the radio and the next day the Soviets marched in.</span> <span id="s64">And before we knew it, we were Soviet citizens.</span> <span id="s65">We did not know what would happen to us.</span> <span id="s66">In fact, their propaganda was so good that we, in fact, thought it must be better than it was because before that the Rumanians were close friends with the Nazis and, in fact, they did the bidding of the Nazis and Atonescu was the head.</span> <span id="s67">Well, so we thought "this is an improvement".</span> <span id="s68">But somehow I have to get back for a moment.</span> <span id="s69">My mother has, had a brother in Columbia, South America.</span> <span id="s70">Very rich man.</span> <span id="s71">He saw it coming and he chartered a plane and came to Europe to pick all his relatives and none of them wanted to go, including my parents.</span> <span id="s72">In our case, my parents said -- my father, which was my stepfather -- my father died when I was nine.</span> <span id="s73">My stepfather said "ah I have no reason to go and live in Columbia, South America.</span> <span id="s74">I haven't done anything wrong.</span> <span id="s75">I haven't engaged in politics, nothing is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s76">I'm not going to throw away all the things that we have worked so hard for."</span> <span id="s77">And they stayed and they didn't ask me, so I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s78">So, in fact, my uncle who came by to pick us up, and we didn't go, said to us that in case we changed our mind he will had prepared four visas to come to Columbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">05:09:17 Two for my parents, one for me, and one, preferably if I had a boyfriend to bring him along.</span> <span id="s80">Because at that time I was sixteen, seventeen.</span> <span id="s81">Ah, it would be better he thought.</span> <span id="s82">Well we didn't go and so the Soviets marched in and the world fell apart for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Times were not tough under the Rumanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes, they were tough.</span> <span id="s85">They were very tough.</span> <span id="s86">And especially 1937, 1938, 1939, our town had a garrison (ph).</span> <span id="s87">Soldiers and particularly officers.</span> <span id="s88">And they got often drunk and they roamed the streets and cursed the Jews and shot, you know, they went around with guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">It was frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you feel particularly vulnerable as a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Some.</span> <span id="s92">I had times where I felt very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s93">And I have a hard time trying to bring back many memories which I probably have absolutely wanted to forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Were the girls abused?</span> <span id="s95">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s96">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So you said that the Soviets came in and the world fell apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s99">The strange thing at that time -- it was June 28, 1940.</span> <span id="s100">That is when the Soviets marched in.</span> <span id="s101">And, you know, during the day and in the early part of the evening, it was fantastic what kind of concerts they gave.</span> <span id="s102">What kind of excitement they managed to bring out in the people and nobody would have believed that a few days later, during the night, they came and people disappeared in the thousands.</span> <span id="s103">And at that time we didn't know where they were taken.</span> <span id="s104">And it so happened that in the town in which we lived we had a very beautiful house.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">05:12:02 Probably the best house in town and we were very wealthy and that was very much against us.</span> <span id="s106">I didn't even realize it at that time because I was friends with all kinds of children, never thinking about these things.</span> <span id="s107">But, immediately there were people who wanted this house and they moved in and then one night three uniformed men came in the Russian uniform of what was called NKVD, which is now called MVD or KGB.</span> <span id="s108">They rang the doorbell.</span> <span id="s109">They came in.</span> <span id="s110">They searched our house.</span> <span id="s111">We didn't know why.</span> <span id="s112">My stepfather, my mother, my grandmother and I were made to sit in the corner and I noticed how this one -- after they had turned the house upside down -- this one of them said "hey look there" while he was pulling out a handkerchief and blowing his nose and I saw how he dropped something, and at the same moment he said "look here what they have" and it was either a five or a ten dollar bill.</span> <span id="s113">It was the first time in my life that I saw a dollar bill.</span> <span id="s114">But I didn't know the implication of this.</span> <span id="s115">I was going to say "you dropped this from your pocket" but I couldn't because the next thing all three of them came up to my father and said "you just have to come with us.</span> <span id="s116">We found foreign currency in your house.</span> <span id="s117">You just have to sign a paper and you will come home."</span> <span id="s118">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s119">We don't know what they did to him.</span> <span id="s120">I know he was 48 years old at that time and my mother would go every day to some place where many other people stood in line with food to bring their husbands, to whom exactly the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s121">And after she went for -- I don't know, three weeks, one day another guard stood there and said "why are you coming here?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">05:15:07 Your husband isn't here".</span> <span id="s123">She said yes is here.</span> <span id="s124">I've been bringing this food for three weeks.</span> <span id="s125">If he is not here for a long time?</span> <span id="s126">And then one day the head guard called her in and said to her "don't come any more".</span> <span id="s127">She said my husband is here.</span> <span id="s128">He's not here any more and threw his shoe at her.</span> <span id="s129">And he said "here is your husband and don't ask any more questions or you will have the same ending".</span> <span id="s130">So we don't know, but I do suspect that they killed him and I don't know where he is buried and I wish I would.</span> <span id="s131">This was so traumatic for me.</span> <span id="s132">I think it was worse than anything that came afterwards, including the Nazis.</span> <span id="s133">By the time the Nazis took us into the concentration camp I was so numb inside, I was so dead, I was not able to feel anything.</span> <span id="s134">And so when Sam told you about how we met, for me the world had ended and here was this man who had jokingly said "we can get married".</span> <span id="s135">That was the farthest from my thoughts.</span> <span id="s136">My mother had said "run and go wherever you can and hide."</span> <span id="s137">And I was running from our town that evening for about ten hours until I came to this other town.</span> <span id="s138">It was very difficult because they had -- what do you call this, at night when you are not allowed to go -- curfew.</span> <span id="s139">Well I made it somehow, very tired, exhausted and very sad.</span> <span id="s140">And I thought of going to my parents' best friends at whose house I had stayed a whole year until the end of May of that year.</span> <span id="s141">I came to their apartment.</span> <span id="s142">They opened the door and they wouldn't let me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">05:18:01 And they told me forgive us.</span> <span id="s144">But last night, it was an apartment house, next door, there was a raid and they came into the apartment and they found one person in that family who did not have a permit with this particular address and because of that they took her and the entire family and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s145">And so these people would not let me in.</span> <span id="s146">At that moment I had no idea where to go.</span> <span id="s147">The only thing that remained was to remember the Philharmonia.</span> <span id="s148">That's a building where the conservatory was located where I had studied and where I had finished conservatory about also four weeks before the Russians came.</span> <span id="s149">And I went upstairs into a projection room where they also had a movie theater and I fell down on the floor and went to sleep.</span> <span id="s150">And when I woke up it was day and I thought if I could find somebody in this office and if they would give me a job as a pianist, as a accompanist, maybe I could simply hide.</span> <span id="s151">But I knew they were after me because they were after our family and so I went and I met the man who was in charge and he was just closing up the office.</span> <span id="s152">And I said I am looking for a job as an accompanist, as a pianist.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">He said to me "you look to me like you need a lunch, that's where I am going now".</span> <span id="s154">I said no, "please get me a job", but I didn't tell him what had happened.</span> <span id="s155">And he said how much money do you have and I said three rubles.</span> <span id="s156">That's 75 cents.</span> <span id="s157">And he said that's enough.</span> <span id="s158">I said enough for what.</span> <span id="s159">Enough to get married he said.</span> <span id="s160">He said I can see you don't know where you're going to sleep the next night, I can see it in your face.</span> <span id="s161">He didn't know my name, he didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s162">So he starts walking in the street and I walked after him and I said please get me that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">05:21:02 And suddenly he stops and he says "come up here with me".</span> <span id="s164">Two flights of steps, very dark, old, dilapidated building, and upstairs is a young girl, about seventeen, and this is supposed to be the Registrar's Office.</span> <span id="s165">And so she asks him if he came to get married and he said yes.</span> <span id="s166">This girl, asks "are you living with another woman?"</span> <span id="s167">"No".</span> <span id="s168">"Do you have children with another woman?"</span> <span id="s169">"No".</span> <span id="s170">And she asked me the same thing and every question is an insult in my book because I, I was so properly brought up I didn't even have a date.</span> <span id="s171">So when we were ready to sign this little paper she calls over the man who swept the floor in the corner.</span> <span id="s172">To this day I don't know his name.</span> <span id="s173">And he was the witness who signed and we went downstairs and Sam, my husband, said to me "by the way, what's your name?"</span> <span id="s174">And we went back to the Philharmonia and he enrolled me.</span> <span id="s175">Gave me a job as an accompanist, pianist, and he said "now no more running around.</span> <span id="s176">Five o'clock we meet in front of this building".</span> <span id="s177">I don't know what he thought.</span> <span id="s178">I didn't know where I would run but he had told me that he has a mother and a sister and an apartment.</span> <span id="s179">I didn't believe a word he said to me.</span> <span id="s180">I thought of one thing only.</span> <span id="s181">Where could I hide.</span> <span id="s182">And suddenly I realized that I had changed my name because I married.</span> <span id="s183">And my name is no longer the one that these authorities were looking for.</span> <span id="s184">So I went with him and when he came into the apartment, I had a big surprise.</span> <span id="s185">He did have a mother and he did have a sister and they were wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s186">And that was like a miracle somehow.</span> <span id="s187">That is the story.</span> <span id="s188">Yes.</span> <span id="s189">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you, what happened to your mother after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: A few weeks later - my mother had, in the meantime, also left the home because all these other people who wanted our home moved in and one person who probably had a little bit of heart said to my mother, "you better disappear from here or you will have a bad ending".</span></p> <p><span id="s192">05:24:15 So my mother came into this larger town with her mother-in-law, and they rented a small apartment and they both went to find some job to become a proletarian, and my mother found a job to become a cook in an orphanage and I saw her a few times.</span> <span id="s193">I went every morning to this apartment to see her.</span> <span id="s194">And one morning I went there and there was a big sign.</span> <span id="s195">"This apartment has been confiscated and the inhabitants have been enemies of the people" and so I know that at this moment, my mother and my grandmother had disappeared, but we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s196">Now a long time later we found out -- not even so long, because in three nights 35,000 people had the same fate, and they were brought to an end station outside of the town into cattle cars, and when they were filled they were, left the area and nobody where to.</span> <span id="s197">But many, many years later we found out that they were taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s198">And my mother was 17 years in Siberia.</span> <span id="s199">My grandmother died immediately, one or two days in the transport.</span> <span id="s200">And it's strange because my grandmother was only 73 and at that time my mother was 48.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did your mother come back from Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: We found her in the most difficult manner.</span> <span id="s203">We, after we went through hell and came to this country -- actually first to Columbia, South America where my mother had a brother -- then we came here and my uncle, my mother's brother, found -- one day he received a letter by a lady, Mrs. Weisselberger (ph), who was in Siberia and roomed together with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">05:27:22 And there was a moment in the Soviet's time under Khrushchev when he decided -- you know, you remember that he stood up and said how what a monster Stalin had been -- and Khrushchev had then permitted people over 65 if they had close relatives in Israel.</span> <span id="s205">And if these relatives sent an invitation to them, an obligated themselves to take care of them, he would permit them to come out.</span> <span id="s206">And this Mrs. Weisselberger who, by the way, was the widow of the, of the greatest Zionist in Czernowitz, and he was one of the first the Soviets did away with, and afterwards Mrs. Weissenberger was also taken to Siberia as the wife of the enemy of the people, and my mother had given Mrs. Weissenberger a photo that was taken in Siberia and on the back of it had written the address of her brother in South America because she didn't know what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s207">And so, when, when, he received this note he sent it to us.</span> <span id="s208">That's how we found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">05:29:07 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s211">06:00:37</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: You were telling us about finding your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: As soon as we got this letter, and we lived in Minnesota and were already very successful as musicians, and well known.</span> <span id="s214">We knew Senator Humphry who was at that time the senator of Minnesota, and we got in touch with him and he said he'd do whatever he could to see whether he could get her out.</span> <span id="s215">And after some time he said "sorry, the Soviets say they don't have such a person".</span> <span id="s216">Then some more time went by and we approached the other senator from Minnesota, Senator Phye.</span> <span id="s217">He said he would try.</span> <span id="s218">And this was maybe a year later and at that time the Soviets said "yes, there is such a person".</span> <span id="s219">They would, would, let her out if somebody, some relative in Israel, would ask for her.</span> <span id="s220">She didn't have any relatives in Israel but Sam had an uncle.</span> <span id="s221">He wrote to him and this uncle, who had never set eyes on my mother, had filled out some papers and she was finally permitted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s222">But I have to tell you that this, from the moment we had this first notification that she had survived and until she came to Israel, was eight years.</span> <span id="s223">So after she arrived in Israel we did whatever we could and we brought her to the United States and I saw her again and we were like two complete strangers.</span> <span id="s224">She was so different.</span> <span id="s225">She was so hard -- so, so aloof.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">06:03:02 I can't even describe it and there was nothing much I could do.</span> <span id="s227">I wanted very much to ask her to talk and she couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s228">Finally I got it out of her.</span> <span id="s229">One day I got very angry and I said "please, tell me what has happened; can't you tell me?"</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: She started talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">And she finally said to me that she had undergone some hypnosis and they had told her -- "you want to see your daughter again, you want to see your son-in-law again, you want to see your brother again, then you have to forget everything that happened to you".</span> <span id="s233">She didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s234">She promised she would forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: OK, so you said that living under the Soviets was really horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s237">And they said to me and to others, "you can never run away from us.</span> <span id="s238">We find you everywhere".</span> <span id="s239">You know, that sits so deep in me.</span> <span id="s240">I can't get over it.</span> <span id="s241">I simply can't get over it.</span> <span id="s242">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Do you remember the things you saw, under the Soviet occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: You never saw anything because they did everything very, very smoothly.</span> <span id="s245">Behind closed doors.</span> <span id="s246">You never saw anything.</span> <span id="s247">You only knew that people disappeared, and when, by chance, you found them like I found my mother, I couldn't get a word our of her to her dying day.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So what happened, the Germans marched in?</span> <span id="s249">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And things changed again?</span> <span id="s251">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Were you married then?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">At that time I was already married.</span> <span id="s255">And the first thing that I remember is that they came and took all the men.</span> <span id="s256">Not the women.</span> <span id="s257">All the men from our building and from the whole street and marched them, I think by foot, and we didn't know where they were taking them.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">06:06:14 Then we found out.</span> <span id="s259">There was a big building that they, the Russians had called Palace of Culture and that same building, under the Germans, was used for certain purposes.</span> <span id="s260">They took those men -- these were all Jewish people -- and the rumor went that they took them to shoot them.</span> <span id="s261">And I knew at the moment that I will never see Sam again.</span> <span id="s262">And somehow it was very, very difficult to accept.</span> <span id="s263">But all of a sudden, some hours later, I saw him running down the street and I thought that I was having a vision -- that I was imagining.</span> <span id="s264">But he did come and he said that they had put them up to count one-two-three, one-two- three.</span> <span id="s265">Every one was taken to be shot.</span> <span id="s266">And he was not one, but they took him and many others to bury them.</span> <span id="s267">So they marched them down to a place near the river and they forced those that they had not shot to bury them.</span> <span id="s268">And Sam managed, knowing the area very well, managed to somehow to jump out of the line and, through certain side streets, he was out of there and he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: This was a few days after the Germans occupied Czernowitz again.</span> <span id="s271">That is, 1941.</span> <span id="s272">When they began to, to, to, push east, and the Soviets ran like crazy.</span> <span id="s273">The Soviets had not believed that Hitler would do this to them.</span> <span id="s274">I mean the Soviets, Stalin.</span> <span id="s275">Stalin did not believe that Hitler was preparing to run into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">06:09:05 And you know, in fact, his generals who told him that -- warned him, some of them were executed because they said it.</span> <span id="s277">No, by the time this happened Stalin had executed so many of his best people.</span> <span id="s278">Generals.</span> <span id="s279">And, so when the Soviets ran away from Czernowitz, they couldn't run as fast as the Nazis followed them.</span> <span id="s280">And this happened a few days after the Nazis came into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: I understand that the Soviets in leaving were burning the towns?</span> <span id="s282">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Were you in the town at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">This is a big town and you did see lots of smoke, lots of buildings.</span> <span id="s286">But mostly you were hiding.</span> <span id="s287">You were trying not to see.</span> <span id="s288">You couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s289">You were just in your place hoping that they will not come for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Was there lot's of hysteria?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s292">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s293">I don't think there was much time for that.</span> <span id="s294">Q: So Sam made it through this first --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s296">And they didn't even notice that he had absconded from that line.</span> <span id="s297">Because otherwise they would have come for him.</span> <span id="s298">But it was all so haphazard, you know.</span> <span id="s299">It was not by name at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Now where were the Romanians who were officials.</span> <span id="s301">Didn't they eventually take over?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: They were part of what went on, but I didn't see too many of them.</span> <span id="s303">They were probably together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s304">And I understood that some people were explaining away this horror of the German's idea and the Romanians to kill at random.</span> <span id="s305">You know our town, this little Sadagura (ph), that was horrible.</span> <span id="s306">When, on the evening of the departure of the Soviets they ran so fast that the Germans were not even in there and there was a whole night where nobody was in there, in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">06:12:10 And the local population who were mostly Ukrainians, rounded up all the Jews that were there.</span> <span id="s308">They pushed them up onto a hill and killed them and raped the women and everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s309">This was a massacre.</span> <span id="s310">This was an awful massacre.</span> <span id="s311">I've heard this from a few people who know exactly how that happened.</span> <span id="s312">But this was neither the Soviets nor the Nazis.</span> <span id="s313">This was the local population.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Was that typical of the Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s316">I don't know.</span> <span id="s317">You know at that time I was so innocent.</span> <span id="s318">I could never believe that people could do things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So was it shortly after the Germans occupied the town that you were herded up and put in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Ah, not shortly.</span> <span id="s321">I think a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s322">If you could call it shortly.</span> <span id="s323">Q: What happened, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, they, I think that we saw posters which said that as of tomorrow morning, such and such hour, all the Jews have to leave the area of Czernowitz and are allowed to live only in such and such streets.</span> <span id="s325">And everybody went meekly.</span> <span id="s326">Nobody fought.</span> <span id="s327">There was no, no possibility to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: How long were you in this area?</span> <span id="s329">A: This I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Days, months?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s332">I heard some say a few days, but I'm not even sure that this is correct.</span> <span id="s333">It, it was really awful.</span> <span id="s334">And you know, the whole thing is actually fear.</span> <span id="s335">The horror of what happens to you and the even greater horror of what may happen tomorrow, because you see in which direction this is going, I don't know.</span> <span id="s336">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Other than the fear, were the conditions horrible, did you have food, could you come and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">06:15:03</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I would say that the conditions were not eh, extraordinary.</span> <span id="s340">On the stone quarry they were horror.</span> <span id="s341">Pure horror.</span> <span id="s342">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So you were in the ghetto for some time near Interance (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s345">By the way, we were in this house in this apartment of a friend of mine with whom I went to school and they happened to live there.</span> <span id="s346">They happened to have an apartment there and they took us in, so we shared their bedroom with them.</span> <span id="s347">And, we were not the only ones.</span> <span id="s348">There must have been 8 or 10 or 12 people in one room.</span> <span id="s349">But that was then --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Were the selections beginning?</span> <span id="s351">There was a big deportation early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s353">Yes.</span> <span id="s354">I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s355">I know very little about this.</span> <span id="s356">I don't know if I've forgotten or I don't know if I ever knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: So what was your next move after the ghetto, what happened?</span> <span id="s358">A: I suppose after the ghetto we were put into cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Were you pulled up, how did this come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s361">It's amazing.</span> <span id="s362">I do not know.</span> <span id="s363">Would you believe that a person could block out to such an extent?</span> <span id="s364">I do not know.</span> <span id="s365">Well anyway, we were in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s366">We didn't know where they were taking us and we finally arrived somewhere where the cattle cars stopped and we were told that this was near Mogilev.</span> <span id="s367">This was on the border of -- between Bessarabia and Ukraine -- and there came some -- by the way, we were told to take along only what we could carry.</span> <span id="s368">And, naturally most people could carry very little, but what they could carry was sometimes earrings, or a watch, or a necklace, or a bracelet.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Did Sam take his violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Did Sam take his violin?</span> <span id="s371">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s372">I think he took his violin and then somebody took it away from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">06:18:01</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Sam: I prepared my worst violin because I knew they would steal it and so they stole it.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Anyway, before we were embarking on what Sam called a ferry, which I don't recall at all; I think it was a little boat.</span> <span id="s377">I know we had to go through the river, so there is no doubt about that, but to me a ferry is something large you know.</span> <span id="s378">This was a little boat and his sister said "I'm not going in.</span> <span id="s379">I'm afraid this boat will collapse."</span> <span id="s380">She was absolutely not aware of where she was going you know, but she did go.</span> <span id="s381">So before going into this boats you saw a mass of people on the shore of that river waiting to be taken on this little boat.</span> <span id="s382">Eh, if there were 2,000 or 3,000 or more people, there were maybe 4 or 5 maybe who could into a boat and there was, I think, just this one boat.</span> <span id="s383">And suddenly there was an announcement to all the people who were there on this shore.</span> <span id="s384">"No gold or valuables permitted.</span> <span id="s385">If we find anything on you, you get shot."</span> <span id="s386">And in one split second everybody took off their rings and their watches and their necklaces and dropped it as if it didn't belong to them.</span> <span id="s387">And in one second you saw a whole area full of gold.</span> <span id="s388">In the next moment you saw the natives of that area, the Ukrainians and the soldiers, the Romainian soldiers, picking up these things.</span> <span id="s389">That's my recollection.</span> <span id="s390">Then when we were taken over on the other side -- we arrived in the carara de pietra (ph).</span> <span id="s391">The stone quarry.</span> <span id="s392">You know pietra is stone and carara (ph) is the same word like in Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">06:21:06 That stone quarry was an unbelievable experience.</span> <span id="s394">About a week before we came, they had taken the inmates of the insane asylum from Czernowitz, put them in cattle cars and brought them to the same carara de pietra (ph).</span> <span id="s395">Didn't give them any food and had them starving and a week later they took the intelligencia of Czernowitz, the, the people who were educated, and put them in cattle cars and we were among them.</span> <span id="s396">And they brought us to this place where insane people had been going for one week without food.</span> <span id="s397">And what we saw there was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s398">They were eating each other alive.</span> <span id="s399">This is absolutely unforgettable and incredible.</span> <span id="s400">And there we stayed, I cannot remember for how long.</span> <span id="s401">And Wassileskov (ph) was the Commandant.</span> <span id="s402">A fairly young man, I would say probably no more than 45, and he marched around with a whip and when he found a louse on a person, that person got 25 in front of everybody else, over their behind.</span> <span id="s403">Over their naked behind.</span> <span id="s404">So when I hear of Singapore I am no longer very impressed you know.</span> <span id="s405">So, what else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: What else was going on at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I don't know very much.</span> <span id="s408">I think once a day it was permitted for certain people only - not everybody - to go down to the river on the bottom of this carara (ph) was a little stream, very little stream.</span> <span id="s409">The natives who lived in the area came with whatever they had to, to offer, to sell, to barter, a piece of butter or a piece of bread, or a piece of cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">06:24:13 The women usually were hiding them in their bosom.</span> <span id="s411">And they stood on one side of that stream and the inmates of our group stood on the other side and were showing what they had to barter.</span> <span id="s412">One had a blouse or one was offering maybe a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s413">Anything for just a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s414">And then, if that person on the other side pointed at this blouse, yes, that's what I want and I have a piece of bread, then they come a step closer into the water and they exchange this.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did you exchange anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I don't recall.</span> <span id="s417">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s418">It's so unbelievable.</span> <span id="s419">Q: How did you sleep there?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: How did we sleep there?</span> <span id="s421">We slept, there was some housing which had all the windows broken because the war had gone by there and that housing was on top of that mountain - - there was a mountain, you know -- but without, without trees.</span> <span id="s422">Without anything.</span> <span id="s423">Just a, a few long stretched houses and small rooms.</span> <span id="s424">And, in a small room I would say the size of our kitchen, we would be about 20 or 30 people sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s425">If one person had to turn around, everybody had to turn around.</span> <span id="s426">It was like sardines.</span> <span id="s427">And it was often that we woke up in the night and we saw one of those crazy people looking in through the broken window and trying to steal something.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Were you working in the stone quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: In the stone quarry there was no working.</span> <span id="s430">The stone quarry was place, a holding place and from there, every time they needed 200 people to put over the Bug, that it was the closest one to the Bug, you know, that river.</span> <span id="s431">Once you were over the Bug you never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">06:27:02 That was, if they took you over the Bug, you did some work and when you were finished with work you were killed.</span> <span id="s433">And so, over the Bug these were called extermination camps, and other than that, one day they needed to have some people for a hospital and, as Sam told you, they had to have a roofer and a carpenter and a few doctors and a dentist, so you know that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">06:27:50 End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s436">07:00:35</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Just one question for clarification.</span> <span id="s438">When people from your community were to carara (ph), do you remember about how many people were in that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Maybe a 20, a thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I would say definitely not 20 and definitely not a thousand.</span> <span id="s442">Probably several hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">And, of course, I'm sure you have heard how horrendous things were when, eh, the people were hardly dead and their gold teeth were pulled out and things like that.</span> <span id="s444">These things happened on the carara.</span> <span id="s445">And later in Tolchin (ph) we had an experience.</span> <span id="s446">In Tolchin (ph), Sam and I had a little room by ourselves and, by the way, Sam called it a camp.</span> <span id="s447">I think I called it a ghetto in Tolchin (ph).</span> <span id="s448">It was one street that was just completely isolated from everything else and it was somehow a ghetto to me.</span> <span id="s449">Eh, one day a man was brought in and nobody wanted to let him sleep in because he had typhus and typhoid fever at the same time and eh, we decided somebody had to take him in.</span> <span id="s450">So we took him in and he shared the -- it wasn't a bed -- the cart with us.</span> <span id="s451">And we didn't know him at all.</span> <span id="s452">He died the same night and it was bitterly cold and there was lots of snow.</span> <span id="s453">He couldn't be buried.</span> <span id="s454">He was dead with us for two nights and two days on our cot until he was buried.</span> <span id="s455">And I don't know his name.</span> <span id="s456">Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">07:03:04</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: What more do you remember Tolchin?</span> <span id="s459">You were there for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s461">I was very much persecuted in Tolchin (ph) by this man Saporshnikov (ph) who was a sort of administrator in the hospital.</span> <span id="s462">And I cleaned the hospital floors and the toilets with petrol and, other than that, I helped them in dentistry and also, I continuously peeled potatoes.</span> <span id="s463">What else do I remember?</span> <span id="s464">This Saporshnikov (ph), by the way, I was told, when the war was over he became the mayor of Tolchin (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: What did he do that made him so hateful?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh, I could feel his hatred.</span> <span id="s467">And he always talked in such terms.</span> <span id="s468">Q: Did he make you do special things?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes, he gave me the hardest things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did he physically abuse you?</span> <span id="s471">A: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s472">Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Ya</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Now you and Sam had probably more mobility than some people there because of your dental careers --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s477">Yes.</span> <span id="s478">Yes.</span> <span id="s479">We could go in the morning to the hospital and we could return in the evening to the place where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did the people have enough food there?</span> <span id="s481">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: It's amazing.</span> <span id="s483">My impression is that you can get used to anything.</span> <span id="s484">And I had a feeling that, in spite of the fact that there was not awfully much food, when there was a little bit of food, people sort of continued living.</span> <span id="s485">I don't know.</span> <span id="s486">I do not recall one case of a suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">I'm not saying that there wasn't, but I do not recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Did the Romainians officials people, was there any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I hadn't seen any of that.</span> <span id="s490">I have also known that, in spite of the fact that they say a lot of bad things about the Romainians, I think that they can also be nice if they want to.</span> <span id="s491">We had a Romainian officer who came several times from Bucharest and brought us help from my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">07:06:01 Help in the sense -- one time they brought us a piece of cheese and another time he brought us some eh, eh, medicines which were of great help to us.</span> <span id="s493">And he was very decent.</span> <span id="s494">I have a very good memory of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">- - - - - - - - - - Indiscernible.</span> <span id="s496">Another person (Sam, I think) is speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">- - - - - - - - - -</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Why do you think that he was particularly nice to you, or do you just think that people were just inconsistent?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: I think he was a nice man.</span> <span id="s500">I think he was a good human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: My impression is that the Romanians were clearly not as systematic --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Because violence was more random or -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And at times they were even rather stubborn or prideful of their independence from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yes, you are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: So your impression is that they you experienced everything.</span> <span id="s507">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Is there anything else you can think, that should be remembered about Tolchin?</span> <span id="s509">You were there how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Anything else you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No, I can't think of anything else.</span> <span id="s513">It is only a miracle that we survived and that we are here to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: We were "liberated" in I'd say 1944.</span> <span id="s516">But very early in the year.</span> <span id="s517">I would say we began to hear noises like cannons -- I think it was January or February -- and I said to Sam "now the front is getting so close, now they will kill us all."</span></p> <p><span id="s518">07:09:05 Because it was well known that the Germans, when they retreated, they set a whole thing on fire and they killed everybody in the camps and in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s519">And I said "it's unbelievable that we have survived until now and now we're going to die", and you know, this was January, February, no tree to hide in.</span> <span id="s520">At least in the summer the trees have leaves, you know, no tree to hide in.</span> <span id="s521">None of the native Ukrainians wanted to hide us.</span> <span id="s522">They would not risk their life, you know.</span> <span id="s523">And I said, "Sam, what are we going to do?"</span> <span id="s524">and I got so vehement and so excited that I banged with my foot on the floor in that room in which we lived, and suddenly as I banged, I heard a hollow noise as though it was empty underneath and I said, "Sam, did you hear what I just heard?</span> <span id="s525">It seems to me that there is nothing underneath.</span> <span id="s526">Maybe we could hide there."</span> <span id="s527">And we had a neighbor who was an engineer, Rosenfeld, and he was the kind of man -- what his job was, he went also out of the ghetto in the morning, worked for, for the hospital, but he fixed radios.</span> <span id="s528">So he was the one who radios all day long and came home and told us all the news that went on in the outside world, which was amazing because we never had a paper or anything or a radio.</span> <span id="s529">So we told Rosenfeld -- I told him -- we are going to have to hide if we want to survive and nobody will take us in.</span> <span id="s530">Could we try and see if we could hide right in our room, I have heard a hollow sound.</span> <span id="s531">And he just had a smile but he humored me and he came into our room and he tried and he said "you are right".</span> <span id="s532">So he brought -- where he got this, I don't know -- a saw.</span> <span id="s533">Now these were, these were floors in the old fashioned kind, you know, long boards.</span> <span id="s534">And so he was sawing one board here and then two later, like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">07:12:00 Finally he made an opening and we did find an opening down there which was very raw and nothing in there, and everybody who was in our area knew about it and laughed about us.</span> <span id="s536">They thought that I was crazy, out of my mind.</span> <span id="s537">And when the day came and they, the shootings, came closer and closer, we had amassed a lot of straw which we had brought into our room and since about 18 people knew about this crazy idea, these 18 people came and went downstairs with us and we thought it would be an hour or two or three.</span> <span id="s538">Well, they kept coming and coming and before we knew it, we were standing one next to the other and how many were we -- 68 people down there.</span> <span id="s539">We closed this thing and had all this straw on top and all of a sudden -- now this was already night -- all of a sudden we heard footsteps on top of us.</span> <span id="s540">We knew that the Germans were running away but we heard footsteps directly above us and we recognized by their marching, by their walking, that these were Germans.</span> <span id="s541">What had happened -- they had chosen that room to stay over night because they didn't see anybody there and there was a lot of straw there, and we sat there underneath, 68 people not daring to breathe or cough or anything, and the next morning they left.</span> <span id="s542">And then we began to, to smell smoke.</span> <span id="s543">And we knew that they had put some buildings on fire and someone in our group of 68 people -- a woman started yelling, "I don't want to die, to suffocate here.</span> <span id="s544">I want out.</span> <span id="s545">I want out."</span> <span id="s546">So by that time we opened the thing and the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s547">We came out.</span> <span id="s548">We were green and white as a sheet and we saw in front of us three young Russian boys with very long coats and with rifles and we asked them "who are you" and they said "nastuyahschi (ph), Russki partisani (ph)."</span></p> <p><span id="s549">07:15:10 We are the real Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s550">And they said to us "and who are you" and we tried to explain to them.</span> <span id="s551">They didn't understand.</span> <span id="s552">That's how we were liberated.</span> <span id="s553">They we could dream only of going home.</span> <span id="s554">That's a very different story.</span> <span id="s555">We couldn't get home until a few days later because we found a truck driver who wanted vodka and then he gave him the vodka and he took us up to a forrest and dropped us down there and said "that's enough for you."</span> <span id="s556">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Where did you get the vodka?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Where did we get the vodka?</span> <span id="s559">We ran around among the natives and whatever we still had on us we shared.</span> <span id="s560">And the worst thing was when we finally came to Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s561">We were dreaming of returning to our home.</span> <span id="s562">We came to Czernowitz on a train.</span> <span id="s563">We waited for hours and hours and the train was an open lorry.</span> <span id="s564">And on this train, when we arrived in Czernowitz, a woman came close to Sam and said "don't go up the Banastrasse (ph)", the street from the railroad people because they are taking people to Siberia.</span> <span id="s565">She said it only in Yiddish, in a short word mancopt (ph).</span> <span id="s566">That means they are catching people.</span> <span id="s567">So we did not go there and so we were sort of trying to get to our apartment which we finally made and there were some people there and they, when we opened the door and said this is our apartment, they said "it's not going to be very long your apartment because you are not going to be here very long because this is our apartment."</span> <span id="s568">So we very quickly disappeared from there.</span> <span id="s569">And then we tried desperately to get into the Czech Army, which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: We had to go somewhere and we had to go as far west as we could.</span> <span id="s572">Q: Why the Czech Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Because they were there.</span> <span id="s574">We had no choices.</span> <span id="s575">The Czech army were wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s576">07:18:01 And we were good to them but they were wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s577">And we were constantly in the Czech Army between the devil and the deep blue sea.</span> <span id="s578">Because in front of us were the Nazis, never more than one or two miles, no more.</span> <span id="s579">And behind us were the Soviets.</span> <span id="s580">So, we were there from middle 1944 until 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Was it frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Frightening?</span> <span id="s583">Different.</span> <span id="s584">Very different because, first of all, we had one or two meals a day.</span> <span id="s585">It was beans, always beans, but it was something.</span> <span id="s586">Much more than we had before.</span> <span id="s587">And frightening yes because at every step you were stepping on a mine or one of your colleagues were killed, or somebody lost their eyes, or somebody lost their limbs.</span> <span id="s588">I did a lot of concertizing (ph) for the Czech Army soldiers before they were sent out into battle with an accordion and singing folk songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Did you play the accordion or the piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Both.</span> <span id="s591">And I knew that when I am sent out to sing for a thousand soldiers, I knew these were being sent out into a battle.</span> <span id="s592">The next day I was sent to a hospital and I found many of these people without arms, without legs, and this was a very small army, so we were very good friends all of us.</span> <span id="s593">And this was very tough, but it was the best part of our odyssey.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: I meant to ask you, in all of this time did your musical background play a part -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: In the Czech Army.</span> <span id="s596">I knew that this was lost for me forever.</span> <span id="s597">I could not believe that I would ever return to music.</span> <span id="s598">I thought music is much too, too unimportant.</span> <span id="s599">But I found out music is not unimportant.</span> <span id="s600">Music is very, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">07:21:04</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you were in the Czech Army until the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s604">We liberated a number of towns.</span> <span id="s605">Our, our unit.</span> <span id="s606">By the way, I was the only woman amongst 75 men because I wanted to remain with Sam.</span> <span id="s607">I made a special petition to the commanding general to permit me to stay with him.</span> <span id="s608">They didn't like it because they did have women, but in the rear.</span> <span id="s609">In the office, in hospitals and so forth.</span> <span id="s610">I wanted to be in the front line because that's where Sam was.</span> <span id="s611">And they permitted me.</span> <span id="s612">And we liberated L'vov.</span> <span id="s613">And in L'vov I had a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s614">Coming out -- I was in the front of that whole group, marching into L'vov and I had a small snare drum in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">- - QUESTION FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON - -</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s617">And then, of course, we also liberated Prague.</span> <span id="s618">Q: It must be very odd being the only woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I didn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s620">But I had 75 wonderful friends.</span> <span id="s621">They were the greatest.</span> <span id="s622">They were really the greatest.</span> <span id="s623">Wonderful people.</span> <span id="s624">You know who they were?</span> <span id="s625">They were people who had run away from Hitler when he marched into Czechoslovakia and they had run into Poland, but in Poland they thought they would be safe, but they encountered the Soviets.</span> <span id="s626">And the Soviets had a very, very interesting way of dealing with them.</span> <span id="s627">They would ask them, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s628">"Edward and Povachkowve (ph)" after your father.</span> <span id="s629">"Adolfovich" (ph).</span> <span id="s630">Ahh.</span> <span id="s631">Adolfovich, three years", because Hitler's name was Adolph.</span> <span id="s632">So they gave him three years.</span> <span id="s633">And these people were all in Siberia when they put together the Czech Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: They were independent of every one else?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: The Czech Army was fighting next to the Soviets, but independently.</span> <span id="s636">In fact, they got the uniforms and food from the Americans.</span> <span id="s637">We thought of ourselves as the allied army.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Where were you when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: In Prague.</span> <span id="s640">They wanted us to stay in Prague.</span> <span id="s641">They would have liked very much for us to stay, and I said, "Sam, no more Europe for me, I've had it."</span> <span id="s642">And the funniest part was before we entered Prague, the first town we entered in Czechoslovakia was -- well anyway, we got an order to arrest anybody who speaks German on the street.</span> <span id="s643">Koshetse (ph).</span> <span id="s644">So we got this order and I said "Sam, if I have to arrest a person because they speak a language --"</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: And they spoke it 500 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: "-- and they spoke it for the last 500 years, this is not the place for me to live."</span> <span id="s647">And this is why we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: I want to ask you a quick question because I know that you have to go.</span> <span id="s649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: It seems as though you were able to immigrate fairly soon after the war ended.</span> <span id="s651">I mean, a lot of the people had a long time before they got out of Europe.</span> <span id="s652">How were you able to get out so quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: When the war was finished it was May 8, 1945, we were in Prague.</span> <span id="s654">And we decided, particularly I -- out.</span> <span id="s655">I don't want to live in Europe anymore.</span> <span id="s656">Immediately, we decided to hitchhike to the West, preferably to Paris, where I thought I would make contact with my uncle -- my mother's brother.</span> <span id="s657">And so we went by way of Stuttgart, Nuremberg -- came to Paris and there we make contact with my uncle.</span> <span id="s658">But there we have to wait six months before we -- the first boat left Paris, I mean -- Le Havre.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Was he able to get you visas or money?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s661">He had -- my uncle was the Honorary Czech Consul in Berekeya (ph) -- But this was not the reason, even if he had not been, he was able to do that.</span> <span id="s662">And, and there was no connection with South America.</span> <span id="s663">We had to go by way of the United States, and that did it for me.</span> <span id="s664">I never dreamed that we would go to the United States.</span> <span id="s665">But we came by, we were here about two weeks.</span> <span id="s666">And we found the most wonderful people in Philadelphia, who turned out to be a cousin of my husband.</span> <span id="s667">And they were so human and so wonderful that after two weeks when I went to South America, I simply could not forget how human this life was in the United States.</span> <span id="s668">And six months later, we were here.</span> <span id="s669">And I also wanted our child to be born in the United States, I wanted that very much.</span> <span id="s670">When I found out I was pregnant and we were in South America, I didn't even want to go to see a doctor.</span> <span id="s671">And I needed to go because I didn't go to see a doctor for five years.</span> <span id="s672">So I said to myself, "If I go to a doctor in South America, I am going to be stuck there" -- and my child has to be born in the United States and that is how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NOTE: the text is missing from 07:28:38 to 07:30:12 End of Tape #3 Conclusion of
