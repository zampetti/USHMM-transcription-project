CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name?</span> <span id="s15">Cornelia Anna Schouten, is my name.</span> <span id="s16">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In Veenhuizen, I was born January 21,1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Would you tell me about about your family?</span> <span id="s19">About your parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My father was Theodorus Schouten.</span> <span id="s21">My father was Theodorus Schouten and my mother was Marta Stam.</span> <span id="s22">We first lived in the community of Veenhuizen where my father and mother lived when they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And then what...tell tell us about.....</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Later, later on we moved to Oosterblokken where my grandfather had a farm.</span> <span id="s25">Q: Tell us about the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s27">The other children already went to school.</span> <span id="s28">I went to school in Oosterblokken.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Wwhat what was the farm like?</span> <span id="s30">What was what was your daily life like on a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: We worked.</span> <span id="s32">We played.</span> <span id="s33">We helped my mother.</span> <span id="s34">We helped on the farm.</span> <span id="s35">We also helped to milk a few cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What happened when...how did your life change?</span> <span id="s37">when the Nazis invaded Europe (sic), what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:03:00</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My...there was a lot of change.</span> <span id="s40">My oldest brother was in the service, and he fought on the front, at the Grebbeberg.</span> <span id="s41">It was very difficult because when the Netherlands capitulated we didn't know if my brother was alive or dead.</span> <span id="s42">Every day in the village there was news of other soldiers who had fought at the front and who had survived.</span> <span id="s43">But we never received any news whether my brother was still alive, and everyone was very sad and worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">01:04:15 My father went every day to ask about his son, and every day there was news of this one who had returned, or that one who had returned but no news of the oldest son, and finally my father said I am going to go look for him.</span> <span id="s45">So then he spent three days searching in barracks and in schools and the war was already six weeks past, six weeks over.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">After......After three days my father found him.</span> <span id="s47">He was not wounded, he was alive, but he was very apathetic and didn't quite know where he was or who he was.</span> <span id="s48">He found him in a school.</span> <span id="s49">And brought him home.</span> <span id="s50">That's how the beginning of the misery.</span> <span id="s51">That's how the war started.</span> <span id="s52">In the beginning it was a little bit difficult but in a small village it was fairly peaceful still.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What was it like every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My brother worked everyday at the farm and slowly but surely he recovered.</span> <span id="s55">Daily life was fairly quiet and normal at first in a little village.</span> <span id="s56">You didn't notice so much.</span> <span id="s57">Then they started rounding up people.</span> <span id="s58">At first they took doctors and and people who had done something wrong in their eyes.</span> <span id="s59">My uncle was also a doctor and was picked up.</span> <span id="s60">At that point, people went on strike here and there.</span> <span id="s61">In 1942, in the beginning of 1942, they even picked up my father because he had not delivered milk as he was supposed to.</span> <span id="s62">That was his way of striking.</span> <span id="s63">At seven in the morning, the Germans came with a big truck [used for raids] and all around our place they they were were Germans.</span> <span id="s64">And took my father along.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">01:09:15 I helped my father get dressed.</span> <span id="s66">He was still in bed because he was a little sick and he didn't have (his) papers.</span> <span id="s67">My mother was walking in the hall with the mayor of our town, because the mayor had come along because he had to point out the people who were striking because the Germans didn't know where they were living.</span> <span id="s68">He was also restraining my brother who was very angry because after all he had been in the war and wanted to attack them.</span> <span id="s69">And I was in the bedroom helping my father get dressed and getting his things together.</span> <span id="s70">He didn't want to take his wallet and he didn't want to put his coat on but the Germans said he had to take his coat because it is cold on that open truck.</span> <span id="s71">So then there was a panic because he left without his ID papers.</span> <span id="s72">And we were afraid if he if he didn't have his ID papers he would never get back.</span> <span id="s73">Then I biked out.</span> <span id="s74">I got on my bike and rode out of the village where they were picking up other people, with his ID papers.</span> <span id="s75">I found my father at the German car and gave him his identification papers even though the Germans yelled at me that I was not to go near the car and I succeeded in giving it to him.</span> <span id="s76">Then I went home but first I stopped at the church and there I burst in to tears.</span> <span id="s77">I went home to my mother.</span> <span id="s78">And then this truck was standing at the neighbor's house.</span> <span id="s79">He also had a farm.</span> <span id="s80">I thought my goodness, now the neighbor will also be picked up but that wasn't true.</span> <span id="s81">They were simply asking the neighbors to keep an eye on us.</span> <span id="s82">To make sure that nothing would be taken away and that no livestock would be removed and it was the neighbor's responsibility to see to that.</span> <span id="s83">It was a terribly difficult day.</span> <span id="s84">Everyone thought my father would never come back.</span> <span id="s85">He was brought to Amsterdam, but I don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">01:14: There they took everything away from him.</span> <span id="s87">He didn't have very much with him but what he had they took away.</span> <span id="s88">But later that same evening we got news that he was on his way home.</span> <span id="s89">But we have no idea why they let him go like that.</span> <span id="s90">Sometimes we think the Dutch Nazi Party (NSB) put in a good word for him.</span> <span id="s91">Then he told us that in Amsterdam they made him read lists of people who had been shot.</span> <span id="s92">His predecessors...</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s94">Can I ask something?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: He had to read lists of names of people who had been shot as an example to him.</span> <span id="s96">But he refused.</span> <span id="s97">(Laughter) He was very stiff-necked and stubborn.</span> <span id="s98">He said I cannot read.</span> <span id="s99">So he didn't have to do it.</span> <span id="s100">So then he was allowed to go home but he had the audacity to say, well, I don't have any money to get home.</span> <span id="s101">He he thought maybe they should bring him home again but he somehow got money and was able to get home.</span> <span id="s102">We were over-joyed that he was home again.</span> <span id="s103">The whole village had thought he would never return.</span> <span id="s104">Later on, boys were picked up from the street, young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">01:17: They had to go to Germany to work for the Wehrmacht in some way and they went into hiding, underground.</span> <span id="s106">That started the period of putting people into hiding and we, from periodically, got one hiding person or another, one fugitive or another.</span> <span id="s107">One of them got sick and we brought him to the hospital and we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s108">Later on we had a young man from Enkhuizen, that's in our neighborhood, in our area.</span> <span id="s109">We also got a teacher from Hoorn who was working in the resistance and had to disappear from time to time.</span> <span id="s110">He would ask if he could stay with us.</span> <span id="s111">A few months later he asked if his son could stay with us who was at that time in hiding in Zaandijk.</span> <span id="s112">For three months he sat in a attic room which he never left.</span> <span id="s113">He went crazy.</span> <span id="s114">After that he came to stay with us.</span> <span id="s115">He was very difficult.</span> <span id="s116">Sometimes he spent whole days in bed.</span> <span id="s117">Eventually he recovered somewhat and we urged him to get out of bed and to walk outside where other fugitives, were able to walk freely in the country side.</span> <span id="s118">We put them to work.</span> <span id="s119">They started to help out a little bit, because doing nothing all day long is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">01:20:30 They also walked in the street, but they generally stayed close to the house and our farm.</span> <span id="s121">In the fall of '42, Laura came to us, or maybe it was '43.</span> <span id="s122">I don't remember the year exactly.</span> <span id="s123">After the war we didn't talk about it very much anymore.</span> <span id="s124">Laura was brought to us on a Sunday afternoon by two men on bicycles from Hoorn.</span> <span id="s125">The two men were from the underground and asked us if we could take a child.</span> <span id="s126">Well, we already had several people hiding in our house and I liked children very much, so we thought there was room for one more.</span> <span id="s127">And then that was Laura.</span> <span id="s128">That was Laura.</span> <span id="s129">She was very sad and cried quite a bit because she had already experienced quite a lot.</span> <span id="s130">Later on my sister came with her oldest daughter, her little daughter who was a little bit younger than Laura, but we didn't really know how old Laura was until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">01:23: She was a bit younger.</span> <span id="s132">Quickly they started to play and by evening they were having a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s133">My father said to my sister, why don't you leave Riet here for a while so that the little girl will get used to us and have some to play with......they can play together.</span> <span id="s134">It worked out very well and soon she began to feel at home.</span> <span id="s135">She had experienced so much she was still quite fearful and in the beginning especially at night she often woke up crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s136">She had it difficult.</span> <span id="s137">I slept in the same room with her.</span> <span id="s138">We always did it that way, and when she laid down, I always had to hold her hand.</span> <span id="s139">(Laughter) Well, my niece had to leave again because she was in school, and she played with children in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">01:25: Once in a while Riet and Dick were here with me.</span> <span id="s141">They would come and play.</span> <span id="s142">For the rest I, we all thought it went very well with Laura.</span> <span id="s143">She was very happy and cheerful afterwards.</span> <span id="s144">And we loved her very much.</span> <span id="s145">And Laura loved us.</span> <span id="s146">Every week I wrote a card to her parents, so-called, because we really didn't have any idea where her father and mother were.</span> <span id="s147">I had to write it and Laura would dictate.</span> <span id="s148">No card every came back.</span> <span id="s149">So it was kind of unnecessary and so the war went on.</span> <span id="s150">Laura went to school.</span> <span id="s151">The school was informed they knew it and took care of her.</span> <span id="s152">The school was fairly safe although there were searches at school, but they said it would be OK to send her.</span> <span id="s153">It was too difficult to keep a child hidden all day long, completely hidden.</span> <span id="s154">Even in our own family we had several nieces and nephews who who sort of looked like her and even had dark hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Everything ran very nicely and evenly.</span> <span id="s156">(laughter) She did well in school.</span> <span id="s157">There were not that many difficulties any more.</span> <span id="s158">Of course once in a while there were Germans in the village and we would get the news of that and then we would just go on out our bicycles.</span> <span id="s159">I would visit my......I would visit my sister or go somewhere else and would take Laura along.</span> <span id="s160">The underground took care of it and saw to it that we got food coupons for Laura and the other people we were hiding.</span> <span id="s161">She was of course afraid of Germans.</span> <span id="s162">When she saw a German she would say, he's not going to do anything to me is he?</span> <span id="s163">One night the Germans were in front of our door and that was very scary.</span> <span id="s164">All in their uniforms with their boots and then all the people who were hiding in our house had to lay low.</span> <span id="s165">I had......I had to crawl through the house on my knees to warn the adult young men who were hiding of the danger but Laura said, they're not going to do anything to me are they?</span> <span id="s166">And, but it was hard to hide her.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:30:40 I said just crawl under the blankets.</span> <span id="s168">They won't do anything to you and that's what she did.</span> <span id="s169">I think she was with us about two years.</span> <span id="s170">But we didn't know if her father and mother were still alive or where they were or if they still lived.</span> <span id="s171">When she came to us, she said her name was Laura Cruck (ph), but that was not her name and she didn't want that name.</span> <span id="s172">She wanted to be called Schouten.</span> <span id="s173">So she was Laura Schouten.</span> <span id="s174">We thought it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">The the war caused many difficulties.</span> <span id="s176">There were more strikes.</span> <span id="s177">Here and there people were picked up and deported.</span> <span id="s178">In that same way, in our village, a gentleman was taken and all the Jews he was hiding in his house and we never saw any of them again.</span> <span id="s179">In the villages here and there people would be shot and farms would be plundered or set on fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">01:33:00 It got very scary.</span> <span id="s181">But somehow our farm stayed safe and many people came from Amsterdam to ask for milk , food, potatoes and grain.</span> <span id="s182">At night there was alway after we had milked, there was always a long line of people asking for a liter or two of milk.</span> <span id="s183">We also had to set apart part of our land for the Germans and give food, part of our crop such as beans or grain, my father had to give to the Germans.</span> <span id="s184">We had to grow kidneybeans for the German army.</span> <span id="s185">My father sold all the beans himself to people who were happy to have them.</span> <span id="s186">For the same price that they would get from the German army or that they would have to pay in the store.</span> <span id="s187">In a few days everything was sold out and as far as the Wehrmacht was concerned the harvest had failed.</span> <span id="s188">This was our way of striking or resisting.</span> <span id="s189">One night a gentleman came to our house and asked if he could sleep over, that he wouldn't need any food.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">01:36: Most people who came to the house asked for food.</span> <span id="s191">Once he was inside he was quite a big man.</span> <span id="s192">Inside of his coat he had a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s193">He asked if he could sleep in the hayloft.</span> <span id="s194">He said, don't worry, I have my own food.</span> <span id="s195">When he took his food out of his pocket it was three large carrots and that was his food.</span> <span id="s196">So then we had to cook some food for him so he would have something to eat, but the next morning he took took off and we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s197">Every day more people would come from Amsterdam with carts and with bicycles asking if we had anything for them to eat or to get some stuff.</span> <span id="s198">It got more and more difficult, these people who came from Amsterdam with their hand carts on barefeet, very very thin and sick.</span> <span id="s199">They were, they were all...they would return with sick people in the carts.</span> <span id="s200">Sometimes they were dead.</span> <span id="s201">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody.</span> <span id="s202">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody, either a German or a Dutch person who had betrayed an other Dutch person, and then there would be terrible retaliation and several people in the village would be killed.</span> <span id="s203">They would grab a few people in the village as prisoners and they would be shot.</span> <span id="s204">Leaflets would be thrown from planes.</span> <span id="s205">One time a nephew was walking in the fields, in an other village and he was met by some Germans.</span> <span id="s206">He had some of these leaflets in his pockets and they took him and we never heard a word of from him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">01:14:15 My uncle who also had, was also hiding two young men had his house raided and he and the two young men were also taken along and taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s208">He he spent three months in prison in Amsterdam and later he was brought to Vught.</span> <span id="s209">Those two people who he was hiding did not survive.</span> <span id="s210">My uncle was supposed to be sent on transport to Germany but the railroads were on strike and so he didn't go.</span> <span id="s211">So in the end he survived.</span> <span id="s212">Well, then the war ended.</span> <span id="s213">The Germans capitulated.</span> <span id="s214">But even that same day two boys who were in the resistance in our village were still shot.</span> <span id="s215">The whole village was in an uproar that some, that just at the end two more were shot.</span> <span id="s216">We said to Laura, now your mommy and daddy will come soon, but of course we really didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">01:43:11 Actually they were only a few villages away from us in a little tiny house.</span> <span id="s218">I thought how can they hide people in that little tiny house.</span> <span id="s219">One week after the war, on a Saturday, they came to our house to see Laura.</span> <span id="s220">We told Laura here comes your mother and father, but Laura didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s221">She didn't know what she was seeing, that she was seeing her father and mother again.</span> <span id="s222">And she didn't want to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s223">Which was terribly sad for her father and mother.</span> <span id="s224">Of course we were happy because it showed that she had had a good life with us.</span> <span id="s225">They wanted to go back to Berkhout, where they had been hidden that same evening and take Laura with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Laura did not want to come along.</span> <span id="s227">So I took Laura on the back, on the back of my bicycle and I went along to Birkhout to that little house where they were hidden.</span> <span id="s228">But she stayed very close to me and the minute I took a step she would stay right with me.</span> <span id="s229">So then I suggested to the father and mother that they should come along with me until Laura had gotten use to them a little bit again.</span> <span id="s230">So that's what they did and we all bicycled back to my house and the father and mother stayed with us for a week.</span> <span id="s231">It was of course very difficult but it went a little better.</span> <span id="s232">The father wanted to go back to Amsterdam as quickly as possible to see what he could find.</span> <span id="s233">To look after his butcher shop and his house.</span> <span id="s234">He got a house there and so they left for Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s235">Laura was very homesick in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s236">She thought everything at our house was better and the food more delicious than it was in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s237">She had at...with us she had her friends and everyone knew her.</span> <span id="s238">So she went to Amsterdam but in the summer vacation she was allowed to come and stay with us again.</span> <span id="s239">Well, she agreed to that and she went along to Amsterdam and when the big vacation came, she came and stayed with us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">01:48:12 She thought everything at our house was better and on her birthday, the 26th of August, her parents came to get her to celebrate her birthday.</span> <span id="s241">But Laura said to her parents, but my my vacation isn't over yet.</span> <span id="s242">Why don't you just come later.</span> <span id="s243">But the mother said yes, but we'll come for your birthday and we'll celebrate your birthday and then we'll stay a few days and then we'll go back to Amsterdam and that's what they did.</span> <span id="s244">Off they went to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s245">After the war my two brothers were getting married.</span> <span id="s246">One of, one of my brothers was a priest.</span> <span id="s247">He was a divinity student in Nijmegen and he was home for a few days, but there was a railroad strike and he couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s248">This is during the war.</span> <span id="s249">Until the end of the war he was in ?</span> <span id="s250">and he worked there.</span> <span id="s251">At the end of the war, one of the people we were hiding took a tandem bike with him and took him back to Nijmegen.</span> <span id="s252">Because the trains were not running normally yet, and so he could finish his studies.</span> <span id="s253">I don't know what else I should tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Laura came back to visit you when she 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s256">She came to visit in Hoogkasperen, the house of my sister.</span> <span id="s257">It didn't work too well.</span> <span id="s258">She came with a friend, although we did have someone who could translate.</span> <span id="s259">She stayed a few hours but then in the evening she went back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s260">At first we had news and messages from America and they asked if I wouldn't like to come along to America but my mother was sickly.</span> <span id="s261">Later on after the war, my mother became very ill.</span> <span id="s262">She had a brain hemorrhage.</span> <span id="s263">And was half paralyzed.</span> <span id="s264">She was sick for five more years.</span> <span id="s265">In 1952 she died.</span> <span id="s266">My father, who was always very healthy, also became ill.</span> <span id="s267">Fourteen days later he died, after my mother.</span> <span id="s268">They were, both of them were 66 years of age.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Where do you live now?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I live with my sister in Hoogkasperen-Westwoud.</span> <span id="s271">The same year my parents died, Dick's father died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s272">He was only 39 years old.</span> <span id="s273">My sister was 38 years old.</span> <span id="s274">And she had five children.</span> <span id="s275">I worked for an aunt and uncle in Bergen and on the weekends I was with my sister.</span> <span id="s276">And so I always stayed......I always stayed with my sister.</span> <span id="s277">During the week I worked in Bergen and on the weekends I was with my sister.</span> <span id="s278">I'm still living with my sister who had, also had a brain hemorrhage and is half paralyzed.</span> <span id="s279">And I'm taking care of her for the last ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">01:55: My brother, the priest, died two years ago of a brain hemorrhage.</span> <span id="s281">My other two brothers have also suffered brain hemorrhages.</span>
