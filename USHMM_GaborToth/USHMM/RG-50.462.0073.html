side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s3">JF: Mr. Turzanski, can you tell us where and when you were born, and a little bit about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">MT: I was born in Poland, southeast part of Poland, now taken by Russia, on January 18, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">JF: What was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">MT: Zupanie, it was a village.</span> <span id="s7">Z-U-P-A-N-I-E.</span> <span id="s8">Zupanie.</span> <span id="s9">My parents were wealthy in Poland.</span> <span id="s10">They had quite a bit of land, forest, and the village consisted of about ten Polish families, I think they were all Catholic families, three Jewish families, and they were the business-oriented families in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">JF: The Jewish families were the business-oriented?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">MT: Business.</span> <span id="s13">They were the ones that were running the store and lumber yard, as far as I can remember, stories I heard about them.</span> <span id="s14">And the rest of the community was a Polish minority, which were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s15">They were individuals that fought for their rights for many years, for centuries.</span> <span id="s16">They settled in Poland and they worked for my parents.</span> <span id="s17">They were not slaves, but they were the servants.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">JF: Your family, then, was one of the ten Polish Catholic families that held the primary holdings in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">MT: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">JF: And was your father, then, the owner of this forest land that you are talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MT: That is correct.</span> <span id="s22">He had two mountains of forest ready to be cut down.</span> <span id="s23">One was a pine forest and another one was oak.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: Had his forebears also lived on this land?</span> <span id="s25">Had they also been from this section?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">MT: Yes, and his father, unfortunately, died in the First World War in the Leipzig Camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s27">I donít know whether they called them concentration camps.</span> <span id="s28">It was also a camp.</span> <span id="s29">My father survived, so he came back as a 12-year-old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">JF: He was in the camp also?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JF: Did he tell you of his experiences there?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">MT: Not too much, because each time I wanted to discuss it with him, it would choke him up.</span> <span id="s34">He felt very guilty about the whole thing that, as a l2-year-old boy, he should have done more than he did, because when they came back from the camp, back to Poland, whatever his father started, the neighbors took it from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">JF: The other large families in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">MT: The other, whoever were, whoever needed lumber, his father started to build a house or something, whatever building they started, he said that within a short time all of it was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">JF: Why, was the whole family in this camp in Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">JF: For what reason were they taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">MT: Well, because, again, they were the evils of the territory.</span> <span id="s41">They were Poles.</span> <span id="s42">Poland went through this each time there was a misunderstanding between Russia and Germany, or Eastern Germany needed to expand, or needed a corridor to move through.</span> <span id="s43">Poland was the corridor of Europe.</span> <span id="s44">They just walked back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JF: Were other families like your grandfatherís family also incarcerated, or were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">MT: Yes, because they were actually a minority in their location.</span> <span id="s47">Not far from that village was another well-established community, Felicenthal [phonetic].</span> <span id="s48">I think that they called it.</span> <span id="s49">It was a German colony.</span> <span id="s50">A lot of Germans had colonies in Poland in those days, and they were the-- not as much merchants as mechanics, etc.</span> <span id="s51">They were the people that would fix your equipment, farm equipment, and they would have the parts for it, and they would also supply the territory with certain shoes, and so forth.</span> <span id="s52">There were some wooden shoes used by some people, that the Germans were making and selling, so everybody was-- had a place, the way I see it, in that territory.</span> <span id="s53">They were well-organized; they had orchestras-- my father, when he got married, my parents, this was when they had the big blow-out, a German band and everything, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">JF: And the Jewish families that you were familiar with were primarily these merchant families?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JF: The business families?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">MT: Families that were as well off as my parents were, Goldreich [phonetic] I heard quite a bit of when I was growing up, were the-- they had a lumber yard.</span> <span id="s58">They were right across the little creek from us, within eyesight.</span> <span id="s59">I remember seeing the place, and they were right next to the border patrol barracks.</span> <span id="s60">As a matter of fact, I asked my parents, my father and my mother--they are still alive, my father was just 80, he just celebrated his 80th birthday-- the story about Goldreich [phonetic] being hidden in our house.</span> <span id="s61">It was not during the German occupation, because we were out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">JF: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">MT: It was when Poland was still free.</span> <span id="s64">He was involved in some kind of trade that was not quite legal and was not quite illegal, and my father, being a, not a mayor, only a recognized individual in the territory, he asked if he could stay there, and I think they gave him two weeks.</span> <span id="s65">For two weeks, if heís not caught or whatever, then he doesnít have to answer to the authorities for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: This was the Polish authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">MT: Yes, the border, something-- border.</span> <span id="s68">He did not have permission to trade across borders which he was doing, and was quite successful dealing with certain things: not selling arms or anything like that, it was some kind of a business deal-- sugar, horses, and things like that.</span> <span id="s69">Normal deals, but there was not a written contract, I think, for it, so the government could not get their tax.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">MT: He asked my father if he would do that, and he said, ìYou do realize that the border patrol is right across the street from us.î He said, ìYes, but they do look up to you.î He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">JF: So he and his family came.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">MT: No, just him, just him, and they asked him not to go back in those two weeks, because he can get caught going from my house by the border patrol that would look to your house at night.</span> <span id="s74">As a matter of fact, when he was staying at our house, the individuals were coming over for dinners and so forth, and the border patrols to our house also, so it was quite safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JF: This was the border to...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">MT: Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s77">We were within about three and one half kilometers to Hungarian border which is what, like one and one half mile, not too far from the Hungarian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">JF: What was the relationship like, generally, with the Jewish families?</span> <span id="s79">Youíre talking about 13 families, which were essentially the primary economic base for this village.</span> <span id="s80">What was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MT: I feel that they had very good organization and relationship, not co-existence, was actually more than that.</span> <span id="s82">They supplied the territory with necessary things, so they were recognized as such.</span> <span id="s83">Poles had land.</span> <span id="s84">They always treasure land, like my father, he had land because of his ancestors.</span> <span id="s85">Ukrainians were the forgotten people, I would call now.</span> <span id="s86">There was no welfare in those days.</span> <span id="s87">They were not starving, but they had to work for their food and, as a matter of fact, kids would be sent out early in their life, like the girl, the woman that was taking care of us, I think she came to my parents, given by her parents, at age of 14, if they would please give her a job, which is working for [unclear].</span> <span id="s88">I think she had it very enjoyable.</span> <span id="s89">I donít think we were that rotten.</span> <span id="s90">I had three brothers.</span> <span id="s91">She was taking care of us; she was our governess.</span> <span id="s92">She was taking care of us, correcting our language and manners and keeping eye on us.</span> <span id="s93">My mother was a very brave young lady.</span> <span id="s94">She liked horses and she liked to ride an awful lot.</span> <span id="s95">It was against territorial wisdom, and when my father married her, that caused a lot of talk in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JF: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">MT: Because he brought in a woman thatís modern.</span> <span id="s98">All she wants to do is just ride horses, and she was quite a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JF: She was from outside this territory?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">MT: Yes, yes, but later on she proved to be quite a brave woman during the war.</span> <span id="s101">So, then it came to September 20, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JF: You were born in 1934?</span> <span id="s103">Do you have much recollection of the pre-war period?</span> <span id="s104">Of the atmosphere in your home village?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MT: The only thing I remember there was no church.</span> <span id="s106">The Polish people did not have a church.</span> <span id="s107">The Ukrainians had a church, so I remember going to the Ukrainian church once, and I believe that either at that church or in a German church that we were baptized, but I think that it was in the Ukrainian church, because they made some kind of deal that, as long as you didnít have your own, itís the same deal if you go to theirs; itís a Russian Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s108">As far as with Jewish families, I remember around Christmastime they would come to our house.</span> <span id="s109">We had a post office--when I say a post office there was always only one post office in a territory, and, of course, they have the big landowners, which one, I donít know, I donít think it was the Goldreich from the lumber yard.</span> <span id="s110">I think there was three families.</span> <span id="s111">I think there was one like a rabbi--he was not a rabbi--but he had the right to give weddings to Jewish individuals, and he had all those other rights that they needed in that territory as a religious group.</span> <span id="s112">He would come to visit us, but I think it was only to show us his concern for our holiday, the way I see it now.</span> <span id="s113">Because why would he stop into our house when there was preparation going on?</span> <span id="s114">I remember that he was dressed in dark--dark hat.</span> <span id="s115">He was always very intelligent, very nicely spoken.</span> <span id="s116">I used to listen to people speak.</span> <span id="s117">For some reason it would give me a good feeling if somebody spoke a beautiful language.</span> <span id="s118">I remember that individual was very intelligent, he spoke a nice language, and, of course, I remember that parents did their utmost to accommodate that individual.</span> <span id="s119">What his purpose was, I donít know.</span> <span id="s120">I did not have a chance when I went up for my fatherís birthday that I could talk about it.</span> <span id="s121">It was such a short time, and we just talked about what we went through and then we cried a little bit.</span> <span id="s122">To start talking about a war is bad.</span> <span id="s123">Itís always bad, it just finishes everything.</span> <span id="s124">We never had a chance to touch base on that.</span> <span id="s125">But I remember they were saying that anytime a bishop or some individual would be coming to that territory, he would be representing a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s126">He would be there with the religious people way up front where the bishop is, not where the people are.</span> <span id="s127">He would be with them, so whatever they did, they did it, the way I see it, the way I would like to see it done; they did it right.</span> <span id="s128">They were co-operating with the territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">JF: The Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">MT: The Jewish families, because why would they have to send a--why would he go there and sit at the pulpit whatever, with the Catholic representative, when Poland was free?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: This was in a church that this meeting...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">MT: In a church.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">JF: And he would go alone, or he would have other Jewish people with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">MT: That I donít know, but I know that my parents said that he was the representative of the Jewish community, so he would also welcome the other head, of the religious head, into the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JF: What about the children?</span> <span id="s136">Was there contact between the Jewish and...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">MT: From Poland.</span> <span id="s138">I donít remember.</span> <span id="s139">Like I said...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">JF: You were quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">MT: Yes, I was in a kindergarten, but nobody ever said that somebody is Jewish, so I donít, actually from Poland I donít remember except that individual, that he spoke so well.</span> <span id="s142">He was something special.</span> <span id="s143">I only remember that he was something special.</span> <span id="s144">I thought he was a doctor, but then I was talking to a friend and they said he was like a rabbi, but not a rabbi.</span> <span id="s145">He was a special individual with a special philosophy of life, perhaps.</span> <span id="s146">But in Hungary, in Keszthely, Hungary--I was already eleven, I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">JF: Before we get to that, perhaps we can speak of what happened in 1939 with the invasion, as you recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">MT: Well, as I recall, it was one beautiful morning around 10 oíclock.</span> <span id="s149">My aunt was with this girl who was taking care of us.</span> <span id="s150">My aunt was crippled.</span> <span id="s151">She was my fatherís sister, I donít know whether it happened in a camp, but something happened to her, and she was crippled, and my fatherís mother in the First World War, Iím going back to that, lost her marbles.</span> <span id="s152">She got mentally ill, I guess because the death of her husband or something.</span> <span id="s153">Depression.</span> <span id="s154">Yes, she had depression.</span> <span id="s155">She was not mentally ill, but--she was not old, she was not feeble.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: You said she was depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MT: But she was depressed, and there could be some medical term for it.</span> <span id="s158">She did have some mental problem later on, so thatís what actually hurt my father more than anything else, I guess.</span> <span id="s159">He lost his father, and his mother and his sister was messed up.</span> <span id="s160">Well, going back to this, in--we were before the war or when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">JF: Just in ë39.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">MT: Just in ë39.</span> <span id="s163">When it started, we were in the garden playing around--I remember my father had bees there and bee hives and he told me to stay away from them, and it was so nice to sit there, observing them land on the flowers and then go back into beehive, and all of a sudden, something is flying over our heads, something I never heard before.</span> <span id="s164">This sound that I never heard before, big birds, airplanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JF: You had never seen them before?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MT: No.</span> <span id="s167">Airplanes flew over our heads.</span> <span id="s168">Since we had a post office, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s169">Somebody yelled out, ìHitler started a war.î Those were the German planes and then there was some explosions, or machine gun fires--I remember something.</span> <span id="s170">But there was nothing around us that happened, but I remember that my aunt was hiding us under trees.</span> <span id="s171">I think they were using machine guns, the fighter planes, probably, now I am thinking about how it is.</span> <span id="s172">This squadron is organized, bombers and fighter planes to make sure that nobody will start anything.</span> <span id="s173">Because later on I heard stories that they were machine gunning the cabbage patches because it looked like organized army or something.</span> <span id="s174">They were in rows, and could have looked like army men.</span> <span id="s175">Then, I donít remember too much.</span> <span id="s176">That happened like, I guess, for two weeks.</span> <span id="s177">It was a lot of commotion, and we were like being neglected.</span> <span id="s178">There was always something going on.</span> <span id="s179">Everybody was always meeting and lot of talking, an awful lot of talking and not too much time to spend with us.</span> <span id="s180">Everybody was always busy.</span> <span id="s181">Now, all of a sudden my father is leaving, and I couldnít tolerate it.</span> <span id="s182">I started banging my head, my mom tells me, I didnít even remember it, against the ground, crying, ìWhy do you have to leave us?î He was going to the war.</span> <span id="s183">He was going to jump on one of the tanks that were driving by us, by our territory, to go to the war to fight the Hitler.</span> <span id="s184">But one of his officers that knew him from the military service, said, ìMr.</span> <span id="s185">Turzanski, your place is at home with your children.</span> <span id="s186">This is going to be a terrible war.</span> <span id="s187">I am a professional and I am telling you that.î And, he, more or less, threw him off the tank, so my father came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JF: He had been in the army previously, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">MT: Everybody had to be in Europe.</span> <span id="s190">You had to serve, and, I think, itís longer than in the United States.</span> <span id="s191">I think you had to serve four years or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">JF: But, this is after the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">MT: After the First World War.</span> <span id="s194">Yes, and he had a rank of officer.</span> <span id="s195">He did his duty.</span> <span id="s196">Then one morning I remember, I heard a dog bark.</span> <span id="s197">Now, I learned it was September 20, 1939.</span> <span id="s198">Early in the morning, the dog started to bark something terrible outside.</span> <span id="s199">We didnít have dogs inside the house, only outside.</span> <span id="s200">It was to protect the house from the wolves and the strangers, I guess.</span> <span id="s201">He was on a chain, and then I heard some kind of yelling, screaming, and the dog did not bark anymore.</span> <span id="s202">Then my mother screamed.</span> <span id="s203">She ran out.</span> <span id="s204">So, we ran out.</span> <span id="s205">They were trying to kill my father.</span> <span id="s206">Now at that time I did not know who ìtheyî were, so-called ìtheyî.</span> <span id="s207">It was Ukrainians from different village that came to our village with the news that Poles are killing Ukrainians in their territory, so they came to revenge that act, and to stir up the rest of the Ukrainians to do the same.</span> <span id="s208">Well, they killed that dog and he wanted to--he lifted, one of the leaders lifted the cane to hit my father who was bald-headed--I donít know how it happened but they said it happened overnight.</span> <span id="s209">Something, maybe when the war started.</span> <span id="s210">He was going to smash him on the head with a cane.</span> <span id="s211">A cane was a weapon in those days.</span> <span id="s212">The cane had a sharp metal tip on the end, very sharp; this was to protect yourself from wolves, because you had to do an awful lot of walking through the woods, and, the wolves were the bad thing in those days.</span> <span id="s213">Dogs were no problem, but wolves were, and the people, in case you would have to protect yourself.</span> <span id="s214">It was just like in the old days, they had what?</span> <span id="s215">The sword.</span> <span id="s216">The cane was just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">JF: So this was cane that grew and was then supplemented by an iron or metal tip of some kind...</span></p> <p><span id="s218">MT: Yes it was a regular walking cane, a walking cane with a special tool.</span> <span id="s219">Some of them had even long knives inside.</span> <span id="s220">When you turned the handle, you could pull it out, there was a sharp knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">JF: Almost like a bayonet.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">MT: Yes, they had those things in those days, for some reason, thatís what they used to kill the dog with, that sharp point they pierced the dog with, and he went.</span> <span id="s223">He wanted to do that to my father.</span> <span id="s224">Thatís when my mother, I guess noticed, she screamed, she ran out, ìYou have to kill me first before you kill him.î Well, then, there was an awful lot of excitement.</span> <span id="s225">The guy in charge of our post office, he was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s226">They were all Ukrainians, people living in our facility, not the same house, the girl did with us, but the rest of them just had their facilities.</span> <span id="s227">He jumped in and he grabbed the cane and says, ìI am in charge here.î They wanted weapons; my father had a lot of weapons.</span> <span id="s228">ìI am in charge here.</span> <span id="s229">I have the keys.</span> <span id="s230">I have the weapons.</span> <span id="s231">You talk to me.î</span></p> <p><span id="s232">JF: So, your own Ukrainian friend saved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">MT: Yes, and then he whispered in my parentsí ear, ìRun, because all they are looking for is the taste of blood, and then nobody will be able to stop them.î That was six in the morning.</span> <span id="s234">My youngest brother was two weeks old, so my mother was just after delivery, and in those days you delivered at home if everything was normal.</span> <span id="s235">My younger brother--there was four of us--my younger brother didnít even have his shoes on his feet yet.</span> <span id="s236">Nobody had a chance to put on--there was so much commotion.</span> <span id="s237">We grabbed something.</span> <span id="s238">Somebody put shoes on us, I guess.</span> <span id="s239">We ran towards the Hungarian border to run away from this.</span> <span id="s240">It was in the fall, so that means after the wheat was cut down.</span> <span id="s241">There was no corn, but there was wheat, and those jaggedy things were sticking up.</span> <span id="s242">My younger brotherís feet started to bleed, so then I donít know who had to carry him.</span> <span id="s243">My mother was carrying the youngest.</span> <span id="s244">There was no shoes.</span> <span id="s245">But two Ukrainians ran after us, I remember they were shooting in the woods, but in the woods when you shoot, the bullets donít travel too far.</span> <span id="s246">They were after us to catch us, but finally they realized that we were running away, that we would get away, and I also remember when I looked back, the flag, the Polish flag on the barracks of the border patrol was being broken off.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">JF: By those Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">MT: They had horses.</span> <span id="s249">It was just like cowboys.</span> <span id="s250">They attached a rope to it, and they started pulling.</span> <span id="s251">They were beating the horse and they finally broke that.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">JF: So these two Ukrainians who were following you, were following you on foot with guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">We got to the border, running.</span> <span id="s255">Hungarians stopped us at the border.</span> <span id="s256">My father could speak Hungarian, some Hungarian.</span> <span id="s257">They said that they cannot let us, in because they have only one machine gun, three guys on the border, and they would not be able to stop the revolution.</span> <span id="s258">And if they would let us in, that would just start their problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">JF: They were afraid of the Ukrainians coming into Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">MT: Exactly.</span> <span id="s261">To get us and, actually, to get even with them why do they let us in.</span> <span id="s262">My father was very angry then.</span> <span id="s263">And he snapped at the border patrol and he said, ìI want to speak to an officer in charge of this,î and there was a guy, right behind us.</span> <span id="s264">The guy was very scared.</span> <span id="s265">He said, ìI am also an officer, I will give you everything I can; I will do everything I can for you as a military man, but you let my family in back of that into Hungary, and I will stay with you to protect you.î Well, that was the beginning of our running experience.</span> <span id="s266">We ran through quite a few camps in Hungary.</span> <span id="s267">Every camp we were foreigners, every place we went to, we were foreigners.</span> <span id="s268">We did not go to school for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">JF: When you say camps, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">MT: It means that the Polish Government-in-Exile was given some...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s272">JF: You were talking about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">MT: Camps in Hungary were actually prepared, or maybe not even prepared... individual homes that we went to, but they were in close vicinity... all the people, immigrants would live in certain quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">JF: These were provided by the Polish Government-in-Exile?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">MT: I think some of it was provided perhaps, but my parents had to work right away, so perhaps they had to work to pay for it.</span> <span id="s276">But there was some organization., maybe it was just churches, but we called them camps because we were all grouped in one territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">JF: Was it collective housing, or did you have separate dwellings?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">MT: There was no collective housing.</span> <span id="s279">I remember once we were in a military establishment.</span> <span id="s280">The first one we were in was a military establishment when we just crossed the border.</span> <span id="s281">The only thing that I remember from that was that there was an awful lot of uniforms, and then the latrine, I had never seen anything like it in my life.</span> <span id="s282">You had to go outside and there was a ditch, and there was like a board that you had to hang on to so you didnít fall into the ditch, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s283">There was a shower.</span> <span id="s284">You had to cover things up yourself after you were done.</span> <span id="s285">Then we went into some kind of--like a hotel, I remember, for another two or three days we were interrogated and separated.</span> <span id="s286">They were looking-- Hungarians were not too friendly to us because they wanted to stay neutral, I think.</span> <span id="s287">I am not sure about that, but they also wanted to make sure that there is no political individuals there so they donít have to answer for.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">JF: Did you ever find out whether or not the Ukrainians who were chasing you caused any trouble at the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">MT: At the border, no, but I have some stories to tell about what happened later on in the same territory with Jewish families and with Polish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">JF: These were stories that you heard afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">MT: I heard stories from the son of Goldberg, Goldreich.</span> <span id="s292">I donít even know the spelling, it would be like a Polish spelling, but itís a German word.</span> <span id="s293">It means ìGoldrich,î right?</span> <span id="s294">Goldreich.</span> <span id="s295">But it would be spelled somehow the way Poles would spell it, I think.</span> <span id="s296">Going back to the camps.</span> <span id="s297">So finally we end up in Keszthely, Hungary, where they organized a Polish school.</span> <span id="s298">It was the first time I had a chance to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">JF: The spelling of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">MT: K-E-S-Z-T-H-E-L-Y.</span> <span id="s301">Itís next to Balaton, which is their big lake, and they call it their sea, because they did not have access to the sea.</span> <span id="s302">Now, in Keszthely-- I am losing some of my thoughts-- if we could just stop this for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">JF: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">MT: I am ready to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">JF: When you got to this village or town...</span></p> <p><span id="s306">MT: Town.</span> <span id="s307">It was a very nice town in Hungary, very nice It was 1944 already, that means we traveled already that many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">JF: You were on the road then for 5 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">MT: Constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">JF: Constantly, stopping in these camps, as you described them?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">MT: Yes, and just running.</span> <span id="s312">Exactly why we were doing that, I think, that whatever was running out, either jobs or something, that we had to keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">JF: Did you attend school in any of these areas?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MT: No, we had private lessons through some educated individuals.</span> <span id="s315">Older people, they were giving us.</span> <span id="s316">No schooling.</span> <span id="s317">In Keszthely was the first time that I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">JF: Not until 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">MT: No, that was before we left in ë44.</span> <span id="s320">So I would say 1942.</span> <span id="s321">I think, in Keszthely.</span> <span id="s322">Thatís the place where we actually stayed until the end before the Germans took us.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s324">This was also a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">MT: It was a city, but we were always kept an eye on.</span> <span id="s326">We were the foreigners.</span> <span id="s327">We were the unwanted ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JF: You were always kept with other Poles who were running the same way that you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">MT: Thatís correct.</span> <span id="s330">We were just like those Cubans in Miami that came from Cuba by boat.</span> <span id="s331">Unwanted ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">JF: Were you under guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">MT: No, but we had to report.</span> <span id="s334">We had to report to police stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">JF: How often?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">MT: My parents had to report, but perhaps it was only my parents, because my father was organizing a underground movement in Hungary.</span> <span id="s337">Hungarians deadly were afraid of that, and he was traveling constantly to Budapest, which is the Hungarian capital, and wherever we were he was on the go, from beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">JF: He was organizing a Polish underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">JF: Was this linked up with the Polish underground in Poland itself, or was this another?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">MT: This was linked up, I believe, if I see it correctly now, with the military in Rumania and so forth we had.</span> <span id="s342">We had Polish Army outside Poland and it was linked up with them, so what we were doing was actually making artificial passports and smuggling young men through Hungary to Rumania and then they would go to wherever they had to go to fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">JF: Smuggling the young Polish men, who had escaped from Poland to the Polish armies in these other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">MT: There were young Polish men and there were also young Jews.</span> <span id="s345">They were all young, I mean they were all Polish, all Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s346">Smuggling Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s347">They were willing to fight Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">JF: So this group then included both Christians and Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">MT: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">JF: When your father and your family left Poland, initially it was to escape the Ukrainians who were after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">JF: Was he involved in any kind of movement at that time?</span> <span id="s353">Was he a political person then, or was it not until he got to Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">MT: No, he was not.</span> <span id="s355">That is the sad thing.</span> <span id="s356">He was not.</span> <span id="s357">They were, I think, double-crossed, by the government.</span> <span id="s358">They were not aware of whatís going to happen.</span> <span id="s359">They were constantly told by government that are ready and able to stop any aggression from Hitlerís side, ëcause Hitler was making a lot of noises, and the world knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">JF: But your father, then, felt deluded by the Polish government?</span> <span id="s361">And he was, therefore, not prepared for the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s363">Correct.</span> <span id="s364">As a matter of fact he often says that we should have had something.</span> <span id="s365">We were told we have it.</span> <span id="s366">They would take an airplane, they would take a new machine gun and drive it from place to place and show it to the people what we are doing, the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">JF: The government would do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">MT: And it would be the same airplane, new airplane and new weapon of some sort, that would travel from city to city, from village to village, just to keep the people confused that things are fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">JF: But people as educated and knowledgeable as your father trusted that this indeed was what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">JF: So that his feeling upon leaving must have been betrayal?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">MT: Betrayal.</span> <span id="s373">When somebody made something out of it.</span> <span id="s374">Itís a betrayal.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">JF: And yet he was willing to get involved in an underground to restore Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">MT: That is correct, because actually our duty was from then on to fight Hitler with everything you have.</span> <span id="s377">Now, he had family.</span> <span id="s378">I donít know whether I could do that, to give up my kids and my wife and go ahead and spend all the time on the road, knowing if I would be caught, their lives are in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">JF: He was supposed to be working, according to this plan, of being in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">MT: Yes, he had to report to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">JF: How did he finesse that?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">MT: So, my mother-- we also had other people there, and one of them was like a cousin to us.</span> <span id="s383">She grabbed him and she said, whatever his name was, Walter or something, ìYou are coming with me.</span> <span id="s384">You are Marian Turzanski.î I am junior; my father is also Marian.</span> <span id="s385">So they went to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">JF: Your mother took him?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s388">They went hand by hand and they signed that report.</span> <span id="s389">My mother is Ottelia and he was Marian.</span> <span id="s390">Later on my father came, and I think that is what actually made them move again.</span> <span id="s391">They discovered that my father-- ìWhoís he?î ìOh, heís my husband,î Somebody else was signing, and that is what kicked us out of one place to another.</span> <span id="s392">I think that was the reason.</span> <span id="s393">I am not sure what made us move so much.</span> <span id="s394">Or, maybe it was to get away from Polish border, but no, we didnít want to do that so that we wanted to stay as close as we could...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">JF: How much could your parents share with you during this time of what was going on?</span> <span id="s396">What was the role of children in that time?</span> <span id="s397">Were they included in any of this discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">MT: We were excluded from all serious talks, because I donít remember any serious meetings, and they had a whole lot of them.</span> <span id="s399">We had a lot of parties, and, of course, in Europe children are not part of the adult world.</span> <span id="s400">They have their own place.</span> <span id="s401">So even at the dinner table, if there is a big party, children do not participate in that because it is for adults.</span> <span id="s402">Family gatherings, yes, children have their own place.</span> <span id="s403">I remember all those big people coming, with big degrees.</span> <span id="s404">There was an awful lot of intelligentsia that left Poland.</span> <span id="s405">Actually, thatís all that left Poland, educated individuals that could care less about their wealth.</span> <span id="s406">They just took off with their lives.</span> <span id="s407">They would always gather and it seemed like a party, but now I understand that those were political meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">JF: This was the time; that was the cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">MT: And they even had to hide the radios, thatís in Hungary.</span> <span id="s410">Hide the radios and listen to BBC, London.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">JF: What youíre saying is that the parties you are describing were also in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">MT: No, that was in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">JF: This was all in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">MT: I am in Hungary now, It was all in Hungary.</span> <span id="s415">It was in Keszthely.</span> <span id="s416">I remember thatís where a lot of things were happening.</span> <span id="s417">Now in Keszthely also, it was 1942, I believe, or maybe it was later, maybe it was ë44 when Goldreich-- and his first name--I just talked to my parents on the phone yesterday--was Samuel.</span> <span id="s418">They went to our priest in Felicenthal [phonetic].</span> <span id="s419">That was the next village, a German village, and asked him for our baptismal certificates</span></p> <p><span id="s420">JF: This was after you had already left?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">MT: After we left.</span> <span id="s422">And I understand that my parents had made an agreement, or asked the priest when they took-- because they were in custody of the, the birth certificates, for some reason.</span> <span id="s423">They took it to the priest, and if somebody needs it, give them our certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">JF: Goldreich would not have come directly to your parents to ask for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">MT: No, we were not there.</span> <span id="s426">After we left he went, because he knew our relationship, I guess.</span> <span id="s427">The priest knew our relationship or something.</span> <span id="s428">He went and the priest gave him our birth certificate of our cousin because they were trying to match the ages.</span> <span id="s429">Our cousinís name was Walter Turzanski, and he traveled and met us in Keszthely, Hungary, with that birth certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">JF: Mr. Goldreich.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">MT: I remember him, curly hair, tall, good-looking young individual.</span> <span id="s432">Young, he was in his 30's.</span> <span id="s433">Good looking man.</span> <span id="s434">But he came.</span> <span id="s435">I thought my father stole him from the train going to Germany, but it was not so.</span> <span id="s436">When things got very rough in Poland, he took the birth certificate prior to the-- secured it, he left as a Turzanski.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">JF: What about his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MT: His family was very sad.</span> <span id="s439">He told us that his wife-- they were constantly shepherd by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s440">The community was not that big, of us Poles and Jewish, only three families.</span> <span id="s441">They were helped out by certain individuals, certain Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s442">Well, it happened prior to, I believe July 4, 1944.</span> <span id="s443">July 4, 1944, they picked, like a 4th of July celebration to kill off Jews, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JF: The Germans or the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">MT: The Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s446">In that territory, cause my grandfather and Walter told us that.</span> <span id="s447">His wife for some reason went outside and they shot her.</span> <span id="s448">His wife, and we are not certain whether he witnessed that or just did not go out because he knew that he would be destroyed immediately.</span> <span id="s449">But his mother, Goldreichís mother, went out to help her daughter-in-law and she was also killed, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">JF: These were by the Ukrainians who lived in the territory?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">MT: Territorial-- there was organized by Hitler a movement prior to the war.</span> <span id="s452">Somebody must have known about it, and they were given an authority to clean out the territory, and itís going to be theirs.</span> <span id="s453">They always wanted the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s454">So the Poles and, of course, the Jews, had to go.</span> <span id="s455">So, I remember my parents were telling me, one Jewish girl took a refuge in a Ukrainian house.</span> <span id="s456">She took their name.</span> <span id="s457">She took their religion and she took their garments.</span> <span id="s458">She would go to the Orthodox Church with them.</span> <span id="s459">On July 4th, my parents just told me, they took her out of the church.</span> <span id="s460">There was some service and walked her so many kilometers to kill her with the rest of the group there.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">JF: This was the family that had sheltered her, or other Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">MT: No.</span> <span id="s463">The family-- my parents-- the family were not able to stop...</span></p> <p><span id="s464">JF: The family that she was staying with could not stop the other Ukrainians from killing her.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s466">Correct.</span> <span id="s467">So actually they did not do it, but they could not stop this from happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">JF: In other words, it was known that she was not Ukrainian among the...</span></p> <p><span id="s469">MT: It must have been because she...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">JF: Um...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">MT: So, shortly after that, Poles had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">JF: The death of the Goldreich women that you talk about, were the Ukrainians that lived in your immediate area and worked for you and knew you, were they also involved in this?</span> <span id="s473">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">MT: I am afraid, yes, because my father wanted to got to Bayonne, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s475">There is quite a few that came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">JF: Quite a few...?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">MT: Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s478">I work with some.</span> <span id="s479">They were in the same camp, and will describe that later on.</span> <span id="s480">The Ukrainians that were in charge of the deals, I work with them now.</span> <span id="s481">Many times I want to take a camera to work with me, but I am afraid that if I take a picture and show it to my parents, they will die.</span> <span id="s482">So I still donít know what I am going to do with that.</span> <span id="s483">Walter Turzanski--Samuel Goldreich-- needed shoes.</span> <span id="s484">My father took his attachÈ case that he was traveling to Budapest back and forth, to the nearest shoemaker, and I didnít know that at that time, but now my parents say it was illegal for a shoemaker to make shoes for somebody because everything was controlled, leather and everything.</span> <span id="s485">And, even, why you are making shoes for somebody.</span> <span id="s486">But my father paid him He was quite an individual, anyway, because he knew certain men.</span> <span id="s487">He knew who to go to.</span> <span id="s488">Perhaps this was a Jewish shoemaker that he went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">JF: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">MT: Yes, and they made them, and within three hours he had new shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">JF: He needed new shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">MT: He needed shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">JF: He had no shoes.</span> <span id="s494">He had escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">MT: No, he had shoes with an awful lot of holes He said that my brother doesnít have any.</span> <span id="s496">His other brother was Ossias, and they donít know what name he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">JF: He escaped with his brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">MT: Yes, and a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">JF: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">MT: And his sister took my motherís birth certificate.</span> <span id="s501">She was slightly older than my mother, ten years older, I think.</span> <span id="s502">But she ended up as a Ottilia Turzanski, and somebody ran into Ottilia Turzanski in Mexico, in a Polish camp in Mexico, what year I donít know, but my mother was approached, ìWhy were you so snobby?</span> <span id="s503">Why didnít you want to talk to me in Mexico?î</span></p> <p><span id="s504">JF: And it was this woman?</span> <span id="s505">The sister of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">MT: She said, ìI was not,î and she said, ìYes, you were.î This guy must have been bothering her in Mexico.</span> <span id="s507">ìCome on, Ottilia, don't you remember me?î and she probably said, ìNo, leave me alone.î My parents were a little bit hurt by that.</span> <span id="s508">They were going to ask Red Cross to find these people, but then after they found out, I think it was in Williamsburg where we were, that Ottilia Turzanski was, but maybe there was another Turzanski.</span> <span id="s509">Turzanski name is a small family.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">JF: When you say that your parents were hurt...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">MT: That these people did not contact us.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">JF: They never contacted you after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">MT: No, that.</span> <span id="s514">Nobody wants anything but there is always, ìThank you.î That helps a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">JF: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">MT: But, having so many hurts, this is actually-- these people probably got hurt also tremendously.</span> <span id="s517">They are all at an age.</span> <span id="s518">I was going to check in Israel.</span> <span id="s519">If they are alive, they would be in Israel now, because where else could they go?</span> <span id="s520">They could not go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s521">They couldnít go any place.</span> <span id="s522">They would be there.</span> <span id="s523">Someday perhaps-- have to do it fast.</span> <span id="s524">I can do that for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">JF: Were there any children involved?</span> <span id="s526">Were there any Goldreich children from that marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">MT: I havenít heard of Walter saying anything, or my parents saying that there was a child left

left their son in Poland with somebody, and my parents feel that he is still in Poland, that he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">JF: They left their child with a Christian family?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s533">That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">JF: And they donít know what happened to that family?</span> <span id="s535">They assume that they might have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">MT: The Reinharts probably are not alive because whoever ran would be caught eventually.</span> <span id="s537">Jews had one problem in Europe, that they were circumcised.</span> <span id="s538">Nobody else was.</span> <span id="s539">When my boy was born, and I donít know why--first thing I wanted, I insisted on, but my wife was objecting to it, that he get circumcised, ëcause I donít want him to be different from the people that live here.</span> <span id="s540">Heís a native.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">JF: Because the American males are all

Yes, three or four years ago, I donít know why.</span> <span id="s545">Gives me a tremendous, I donít know, something...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">JF: I think you are answering why-- the feeling of that being a differentiating factor from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">MT: I think itís the fear or something, but then you get so much pleasure when you become wanted, just like somebody accepts you, or something.</span> <span id="s548">They had that problem, so I often-- nobody talks to you, because in Europe you donít talk to children about sex or anything.</span> <span id="s549">But I often wondered if he was clever enough, he could have got circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">JF: Walter?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">MT: Sure.</span> <span id="s552">I mean, he was circumcised, the opposite.</span> <span id="s553">Thatís what was bad.</span> <span id="s554">As a child I wasnít exposed to that.</span> <span id="s555">How easy it was to separate the Jewish male from the rest of the people in the territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">JF: Your parents gave their papers, their baptismal certificates, at what point, to the church?</span></p> <p><span

uncertain, whatís going to happen.</span> <span id="s559">I donít think they were planning to go to Hungary, but they were planning to run someplace from where we are because the territory was not proper to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">JF: Did this leave them without any papers of their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">MT: We didnít need any.</span> <span id="s562">In your own country you donít need yourself, but Jews would need the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">JF: So, he assumed, then, that Jews would use these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">MT: Thatís the only reason priest would even have the name of a priest.</span> <span id="s565">Otherwise he would never release it to anybody.</span> <span id="s566">They even gave him the name of the priest, someplace...</span></p> <p><span id="s567">JF: And the priest was cooperative, obviously?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">MT: And the priest gave them-- matter of fact, Walter Turzanski started by saying, ìI hope you forgive me, but I have taken my name because my parents call him Samuel Goldreich.</span> <span id="s569">No, Iím Walter Turzanski; please forgive me I took your name.î</span></p>

my father was going.</span> <span id="s574">I think thatís what happened, they going to jump on the tanks.</span> <span id="s575">The military movement, they were going to join and go.</span> <span

the army and he is probably dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">JF: They never heard from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">MT: No, no, we never heard from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">JF: So, when you talk about Walter now you are referring to Samuel Goldreich?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">MT: Yes, but after the war again, but I donít know why, but Hannah Goldberg, Goldreich, still stayed as Ottilia Turzanski, my motherís name.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">JF: Which is your motherís name.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">MT: Yes, because I would first thing after the war go back, but maybe it was still so uncertain, still scared, perhaps because you never know what can happen, and once you get scared like that you donít trust anybody.</span> <span id="s585">Matter of fact, I donít like to open up to anybody.</span> <span id="s586">I am a closed person.</span> <span id="s587">Even when I go to school, I went to Temple University to take some psychological counseling courses, and

if you donít mind, I would just like to get education here,î and they didnít like that.</span> <span id="s589">That was in Hungary.</span> <span id="s590">Then shortly after that, when Walter

that.</span> <span id="s597">Then we heard that shortly after, it was July 4, 1944, when they finished off the territorial Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s598">JF: Did you hear about that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">MT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">JF: You found out about it later?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">MT: I heard it when Walter in Kesthely, in Hungary, when he

escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">MT: No, it war prior to that, I believe.</span> <span id="s608">I think it was prior to that, but they killed his wife sooner, but this was a mass movement</span></p> <p><span id="s609">JF: A mass movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">MT: It was like they were removing them from the territory.</span> <span id="s611">Not telling us, they would never let you know whatís happening.</span> <span id="s612">They were walking them from one territory to another and then at mid-point they would just kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">JF: And the Ukrainians were doing this in 1944?</span> <span id="s614">Was it a deportation, or was it more a round-up?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">MT: It was like deportation, to remove them from the territory.</span> <span id="s616">They needed that territory, because otherwise the word would get out and they did not want the word to get out, that something is happening to you.</span> <span id="s617">Jews or Poles never knew that something will happen to them.</span> <span id="s618">They were just being moved from one place to another and then something happened, in the meantime, and they were removed from this earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">JF: So, what had happened to his family then had happened on a more of an individual basis before these mass...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">MT: Yes they either disregarded an order not to go out or something that they shot them...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s622">MT: Now, to give you comparison of evil forces working during the war, I talked about Jewish families being round up and killed, and Jews did have a special problem because they wore picked out prior to the rest of the country.</span> <span id="s623">They were put on a list to be eliminated yet nobody knew about that, that this will happen.</span> <span id="s624">That was the sad part about it.</span> <span id="s625">The people that you trusted would actually be the ones that would carry the hidden knife.</span> <span id="s626">My father stayed behind.</span> <span id="s627">My grandfather stayed behind - he was like a mayor of that territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">JF: You are talking now, then, about your motherís father?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">MT: My fatherís, my fatherís father brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JF: Had died...</span></p> <p><span id="s631">MT: Yeh.</span> <span id="s632">So, my fatherís father that died, his brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">JF: So your fatherís uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">MT: My fatherís uncle, he stayed behind, because he did not believe when those Ukrainians said that if Poles are killing, then we are going to no and investigate, so he formed a commission.</span> <span id="s635">He formed a delegation from his village, and they all went to the next place, and they found out that itís not true.</span> <span id="s636">When than came back it was quite late, because things had started already to take place.</span> <span id="s637">Now thatís after we left, and my grandfather did that, after we ran away to Hungary.</span> <span id="s638">At night, he was it must have been in the fall or winter, because he said the stove would not-- a belly-stove, I guess you call them pot-belly stove, it wouldnít burn too well and he had a hard time keeping that going.</span> <span id="s639">There was another man with him, not Ukrainian, though, because they were no lower allowed to be with Poles.</span> <span id="s640">So he stayed out late playing around with that fire and then he heard shots.</span> <span id="s641">He looked out the window and he saw horses driving around one of the Polish homes and shooting at the house, and then they set fire to the house people tried to escape the house and they were shot right there, and then they would go to the next house and again surround and start shooting anybody that tried to escape, shoot them and burn the house down.</span> <span id="s642">One of the guys that stayed with him, I believe-- oh, itís coming next, so my grandfather ran out and this guy, and they hid in the cemetery behind the tombstones.</span> <span id="s643">The cemetery was not too far from our home where I was born, and they observed all this terrible thing going on.</span> <span id="s644">One family had 5 daughters, 5 girls, and the parents, father end mother and 5 girls.</span> <span id="s645">They lined them up, father, mother, oldest daughter to the youngest, they took out a wooden, whatever you call it that you cut wood on...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">JF: An ax?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">MT: Well, an ax plus the wooden block.</span> <span id="s648">They would lay the kids on the block and chop their heads off.</span> <span id="s649">Everybody would scream, they faint, and they would bring them back to it, pour water on them, and then next execution.</span> <span id="s650">And they killed them all like that, the whole family, and then they burned their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">JF: This was a Polish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">MT: Polish family killed by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s653">Thatís right.</span> <span id="s654">They were not political people, but they had rights to the territory.</span> <span id="s655">Jews were not political people, but they had rights to the territory.</span> <span id="s656">They were the owners.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">JF: The family was Polish Christian or Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">MT: Polish Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">JF: But the feeling of the Ukrainians against the Poles who had rights to land that they felt should have been theirs...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">MT: I believe that they had struck a deal with Hitler.</span> <span id="s661">If they cleaned that territory out, itís theirs.</span> <span id="s662">Of course it was false belief on their side.</span> <span id="s663">Later on, Hitler got even with them in Lemberg, in Lvov.</span> <span id="s664">They got a little too independent, and they wanted to form their own government, and Hitler surrounded them with the SS troops and cut them down,.</span> <span id="s665">I think 2000 of them and killed them.</span> <span id="s666">Because he also didnít want organization, he wanted people to work for him, but donít organize on your own.</span> <span id="s667">In the morning, that young man, that was Matkowsky-- heís in Chicago now-- he ran over to his house where his father was and knocked off ashes off his-- his chest was still there, the rest was all burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">JF: Matkowsky was...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">MT: He was with my grandfather hiding in the cemetery and in the morning when the smoke went down and everything, he snuck up to his house and his fatherís body was there in ashes.</span> <span id="s670">Only his chest was still intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">JF: He had been burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">MT: He was killed and burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">JF: He was killed also, and burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">MT: So our house is still there; it was not burned because nobody was killed in it.</span> <span id="s675">Any house that somebody was killed in it, they burned it to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">JF: Matkowsky was Christian, or was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">MT. Was a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">JF: Christian also.</span> <span id="s679">How did you find out these stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">MT: Matkowsky, we met in Germany later on, and grandfather-- we got in Germany after the liberation and after ë45, May ë45, my grandfather was someplace not too far from Bremen.</span> <span id="s681">I forgot the name already because I cannot think too clear now.</span> <span id="s682">He told us awful lot of was happening.</span> <span id="s683">He was on the list once.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">JF: Your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">MT: Yes, to be sent to the old peopleís camp, and what they would do then, a lot of them were sent to the old peopleís camp, because they are unable to work, and it will be easier for you.</span> <span id="s686">They were sent to a special place and they will be given bedding, or at least they were shown a room, a bed and blanket, and given a piece of paper and a pencil to write to their family how wonderful they are being treated.</span> <span id="s687">And right after that they will be poisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">JF: This is in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">MT: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">JF: In Germany.</span> <span id="s691">He was on a list.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">MT: And right after that they would be poisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">JF: How did he escape from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">MT: He worked-- he pretended that he is younger than he is.</span> <span id="s695">Nobody escaped but they worked.</span> <span id="s696">There was a plan to use us to the last minute, and then you go.</span> <span id="s697">The plan was not to kill everybody.</span> <span id="s698">They could have done it, I think, but they starve you.</span> <span id="s699">Day to day you got weaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">JF: Why was your grandfather - actually it was your fatherís uncle - why was he taken?</span> <span id="s701">Why did they want to kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">MT: Well, Poles, in general, were lower than the dirt.</span> <span id="s703">We were the enemies of the state.</span> <span id="s704">Jews were not enemies.</span> <span id="s705">We were the enemies of the German nation.</span> <span id="s706">With Jews they started in Germany.</span> <span id="s707">They had a special reason for it because they start with them in Germany.</span> <span id="s708">Most Jews in Poland had German names, like the ones that I am familiar with: Goldreich, Reinhart, and so forth.</span> <span id="s709">They had German names, but I think that they had a little more freedom in Poland than in Germany, or maybe more opportunity to expand.</span> <span id="s710">Itís a new territory.</span> <span id="s711">They went to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">JF: But not all Poles were arrested in such a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">MT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">JF: What was it that determined that your great-uncle was taken, or your grandfather, as you call him.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">MT: Maybe it was because of the Ukrainian deal, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">JF: Because of that territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">MT: That territory had to be cleared, and the people had to be removed from that territory, probably.</span> <span id="s718">The others wanted it and since he was not killed, he had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s720">So he was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">MT: He went to-- his wife was very ill.</span> <span id="s722">She was paralyzed.</span> <span id="s723">My grandfatherís wife was paralyzed, so they had never children.</span> <span id="s724">Itís prior to that.</span> <span id="s725">I am confusing.</span> <span id="s726">He took her to Stry [Strey: phonetic] which is a big town, nearest town, a big town, to a cousin or to hospital, took his wife, when the whole thing started, when we ran away.</span> <span id="s727">And he found out that the Poles are not killing the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s728">He realized he will not be able to take care of his wife himself, because we had people taking care of her.</span> <span id="s729">He drove her to Stry.</span> <span id="s730">Then he came back, and then all those things started happening.</span> <span id="s731">But Jews went first, and then the Poles, in a very brutal way.</span> <span id="s732">The Jews actually did not have to witness, except in Goldreichís case, the mother witnessed her daughter-in-law being killed in the yard, shot, and then she was shot.</span> <span id="s733">But the tragedy of these others I never heard of before, and it makes you really wonder why people would do that and how could they?</span> <span id="s734">How could you take a, any kind of person and cut their head off and then make sure the other one is watching, and get the big enjoyment out of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">JF: The amount of...</span></p> <p><span id="s736">MT: There wasnít even hatred.</span> <span

questioned this when?</span> <span id="s741">When it was happening during the war, or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">MT: During the war, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s743">Why am I foreigner.</span> <span id="s744">It was a very dirty word, but they did not use the word foreigner it was like American work Pollack,</span></p> <p><span id="s745">JF: Derogatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">MT: Derogatory.</span> <span id="s747">But also with a meaning that we will get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">JF: The Hungarians talked this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">MT: Yes, and when Hitler went through Hungary to go to Russia to fight in Stalingrad, he formed, like Hitlerjugend in Germany, people for Hitler, national guard, young people.</span> <span id="s750">Not too young, not like children, but in their teens and higher.</span> <span id="s751">They would have a special sign on their arms.</span> <span id="s752">It was not like swastika, it was like arrows, on each end of the cross, arrow heads.</span> <span id="s753">They called themselves (Hungarian word) - that means Arrowhead [actually Arrow Cross].</span> <span id="s754">Ever since Hitler went through Hungary, we experienced nothing but fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">JF: On the part of the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">MT: Fear , it was in the air; you could feel it.</span> <span

must be German,î or something and they sent him for wine.</span> <span id="s761">He went to get them a bottle of wine, for the soldiers, and then they let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">JF: This was in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">MT: Yes, from school.</span> <span id="s764">We were in school uniforms, you wore a uniform, and we had special bags, duffel bags.</span></p> <p><span

started my fourth grade.</span> <span id="s781">I didnít finish my fourth grade, when armed Germans were coming back from Russian front and then things started to happen When Germans started coming back, this is when they started persecuting Jews and Poles and that must have been in early ë44 or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">JF: Up until then, you were living in a Hungarian

organization knew at that time was army to defeat Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">JF: So, these were only, then, young men who were going into the Polish army in exile, as opposed to families?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s806">No, families.</span> <span id="s807">I donít recall any, because they had their own-- Jews traveled differently than we did.</span> <span id="s808">Of course, we unfortunately ran out at 6 oíclock in the morning and we ran out without money.</span> <span id="s809">When they decided to go they went prepared, usually.</span> <span id="s810">They went out and they bought their way through the border or whatever, and they knew how far they would go, the ones that did travel.</span> <span id="s811">The ones that wanted to stay behind, the more stubborn ones, older people, they didnít want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">JF: Those were the ones who were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">MT: No, those were the ones that really went through terrible things later on.</span> <span id="s814">Some were deported, some were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">JF: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">MT: In a lot of cases, like in the case where I was born, it was by their own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">JF: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s818">By their own people?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">MT: People that lived in that territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">JF: The Ukrainians</span></p> <p><span id="s821">MT: Sure.</span> <span id="s822">There were some outsiders that were in charge of this movement, I am sure, Ukrainians that were infiltrated, individuals put in there.</span> <span id="s823">They were giving the orders, but still itís the local people that did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">MT: So that when you were living in this town, the Jews that you were in contact with were Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">JF: Were Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s826">As a matter of fact, across a. little yard, big yard, a big empty yard, there was a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s827">There were younger girls, two girls, younger than I was, and I was around seven, but they were my younger brotherís age because they played together.</span> <span id="s828">So it was not something that you stayed away, and I guess it was a blessing to us that we were allowed to play with them, because we were actually nobodies in a new territory.</span> <span id="s829">Hungarian boys we had trouble with, because we had to fight all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">MT: Thatís where the hostility was, with the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">JF: We had to fight.</span> <span id="s832">They didnít want us around.</span> <span id="s833">We were not stealing their women because we were just kids, but we were not part of the deal.</span> <span id="s834">Going back to waiting in line to get food, we would have to form some kind of a set-up where early in the evening we would go and stay in line.</span> <span id="s835">At night it would be my parents, but since my father had to work, he didnít spend that much time in line, because he had to have his sleep, and his strength to work next day.</span> <span id="s836">Now, my mother also worked, but she was a tough cookie, I guess, and younger, by ten years of my father, so it was I and my older brother, and we would stand there for three to four hours in the evening, until we were replaced by the next one.</span> <span id="s837">So I would be the first one since I was the younger one.</span> <span id="s838">My two younger brothers did not participate in it, then my older brother would stay until probably about eleven oíclock at night, and then my mother, no, then my father would go and stay for so many hours, and then my mother would stay until she gets into the store.</span> <span id="s839">Thatís how long the lines were formed outside the stores to buy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">JF: And everything was rationed, I would assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">MT: No, it was not rationed, but they would not sell you too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">JF: Just shortages?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">MT: Yes, they would not, they were not allowed to sell you too much.</span> <span id="s844">That Jewish woman that had the bakery, she would always prepare something for my mother to take out later on through the back door, but for some reason that never worked out because I guess they ran out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">JF: You mean for a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">MT: After you get in you could only buy, letís say 10 rolls, but she had four kids and herself and her husband.</span> <span id="s847">She would say she would put something away for her, a couple more rolls, but then for some reason, it never actually happened.</span> <span id="s848">Because I imagine they were breaking down the door and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s849">Everybody cried and everybody had a child-- things were bad but they were not to the point where you could realize what is happening.</span> <span id="s850">But then, all of a sudden, I noticed yellow stars which now I am familiar with, the Star of David, being worn by some people but not all.</span> <span id="s851">And I would study the star.</span> <span id="s852">It was two right angle triangles.</span> <span id="s853">Cardboard covered with cloth, yellow cloth turned separately and pinned together.</span> <span id="s854">Thatís how they made those things.</span> <span id="s855">Two separate triangles placed on top of each other, turned so that it becomes a star, and they had to carry on their lapel.</span> <span id="s856">I donít remember women wearing it, but I remember men had to wear it, in the city of Keszthely, Hungary.</span> <span id="s857">So, all of a sudden the places we go to buy food, we notice that they have a star on themselves, but still they did not know what is in store for them, because as soon as you would do that to me, I would try to sneak out, if I would know.</span> <span id="s858">But only it shows that nobody knew what the plan was.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">JF: You are thinking that now, or at the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s860">MT: I am thinking that now.</span> <span id="s861">At that time I just questioned why?</span> <span id="s862">So my parents explained it to me.</span> <span id="s863">That that is the Star of David.</span> <span id="s864">These are Jewish people and they are being singled out, like we are.</span> <span id="s865">They are being put on a list, and nobody knows what is going to happen, but it is not good.</span> <span id="s866">So from that moment everybody was so afraid.</span> <span id="s867">We were afraid to go out on the street, and afraid to say something, and you always looked back who was walking behind you from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">JF: About from what point was this that you recall seeing the stars and having this more intense feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">MT: That was when Hitlerís army was coming back all chewed up.</span> <span id="s870">I know we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">JF: Coming back from Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">MT: From Russian front badly chewed up, and there was such a good feeling in us youngsters, politically brought up in hating Hitler, that they are coming back destroyed.</span> <span id="s873">Thatís when they started destroying us.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">JF: It didnít last long, that feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">MT: So they gathered Jews later on into ghetto.</span> <span id="s876">Ghetto was part of the city that they boarded off.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">JF: Was there a ghetto in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">MT: Yes, every city, I imagine.</span> <span id="s879">I was not in every city.</span> <span id="s880">They boarded off with boards.</span> <span id="s881">It was not just a ghetto that was part of the city.</span> <span id="s882">Itís a closed off the city, guarded by armed guards.</span> <span id="s883">Evacuated from their homes into the ghetto with their belongings, as much as they could take, I guess.</span> <span id="s884">What would they take?</span> <span id="s885">The best they had, probably, and thatís what probably the territory wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">JF: That is when the Germans occupied...</span></p> <p><span id="s887">MT: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">JF: Until that time was there any Russian involvement, where you were in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">MT: No.</span> <span id="s890">No, we feared Russians, that was why we ran.</span> <span id="s891">We feared Russians deadly.</span> <span id="s892">We thought that Germans are more humane, but they turn out not to be in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s893">Matter of fact, we would go to church.</span> <span id="s894">I was alter boy.</span> <span id="s895">The Hungarians didnít like us, but the priests did.</span> <span id="s896">For some reason we were more kind, probably, and we were not as arrogant as some of those other boys.</span> <span id="s897">We were always shy and kind because you had to be kind to survive.</span> <span id="s898">You had to be extremely kind to everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">JF: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">MT: Knowing that everybody hates you, you become extremely kind.</span> <span id="s901">If somebody does not kick you or something.</span> <span id="s902">Extremely shy.</span> <span id="s903">At least we were brought up that way, to be kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">JF: It might be a correction, not to show aggressiveness in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">MT: Angry or anything, yes.</span> <span id="s906">German soldiers, not too many, but I remember twice or three times, a single soldier walked in the church and he would make the sign of the cross in the German way, using his thumb and making crosses on his forehead, his chest and arms, his shoulders, with his thumb, and having that uniform on him.</span> <span id="s907">I lifted my head to God and said, ìGod, why canít he be nicer to us when he leaves this house?î We feared him in the church when he walked in, because that was a deadly force that walked in.</span> <span id="s908">A force that had all the rights to life and death.</span> <span id="s909">It was all up to him.</span> <span id="s910">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s911">No courts.</span> <span id="s912">He could decide right on the spot, yet he walked in, because perhaps he had a family in Germany that he thought greatly of.</span> <span id="s913">But, yet, we didnít mean anything.</span> <span id="s914">I never had received one candy from any German soldier or one kind word when I was in Hungary.</span> <span id="s915">Because once we were in Germany, it was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">After two weeks, like I said, they were put into the ghettos.</span> <span id="s917">Shortly after - I didnít think they kept Jews in ghetto more than two weeks - they were transported to Germany.</span> <span id="s918">Now, from that moment when they were wearing their Star of David, the word went around that we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s919">The Poles are in trouble, big trouble, because if in Hungary the Hungarian citizens are being singled out, we are in terrible danger, terrible danger.</span> <span id="s920">I talked to my mother recently-- she said that she wanted the girls that my younger brother was playing with, she wanted to take those two girls before they put them-- when they start putting them in the ghetto, if her parents would allow us to take with us.</span> <span id="s921">But, then, she said that she spread the word that she would like to take those kids, the uproar was such that we knew what would happen to us if we take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">JF: The uproar from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">MT: The Polish community.</span> <span id="s924">ìDo you know what you are doing to us?</span> <span id="s925">Not to yourself.</span> <span id="s926">Do you think about us?î And also, ìHow do you know whether this will be better for you?î I mean, would that be better for them with us or with their own parents?</span> <span id="s927">Nobody knew actually that they are going to be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">JF: There was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s930">JF: Youíre saying then that the Poles were unaware that the deportations of the Jews meant death?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">MT: Death.</span> <span id="s932">And Jews are unaware of it.</span> <span id="s933">Thatís the sad part, because I remember these people walking and nobody cried.</span> <span id="s934">They were just-- it was sad that they had to leave their homes.</span> <span id="s935">I imagine that it was very sad.</span> <span id="s936">But there was nothing like that, ìOh my God, they are being killed.î Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">JF: None of your farther contacts with the underground government gave him any clues as to what was happening in concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">MT: For some reason, when we were taken on the train, we still believed, at least my parents believed, or maybe they just tried to pretend to us, that we are going to be alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">JF: Do you think that your father knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">MT: I donít know, but I think he would have told me by now that he knew.</span> <span id="s941">The gypsies went first in Hungary, I forgot about them, but there were gypsies...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">JF: Did you know any gypsies in the area where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">MT: Yes, I knew one, I donít remember his name anymore, but he was a very famous gypsy in the town, and he would always walk around.</span> <span id="s944">They had axes that they always carried on their shoulder because they used axes to make different dishes out of wood.</span> <span id="s945">That they were selling, and it was legal for them to carry an ax as a gypsy, and gypsies would constantly stop in at our homes, at everybodyís home, when they were eating at dinnertime in the evening.</span> <span id="s946">A whole bunch of gypsies was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s947">You opened the door, and you had to watch everything in your house, because one will talk to you and play on a violin, and the rest of the gang goes around the house and grabs everything that they can.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">MT: So gypsies were known to rob you blind.</span> <span id="s950">They lived in the mountains and caves they did not live in the city, and we would go to the mountain to pick pine cones to heat the home.</span> <span id="s951">That was a big thing for the Poles.</span> <span id="s952">We could not afford to buy anything else, so we would go and we would take sacks and sacks, and fill them with cones and bring them home, on Sundays, on weekends, when we had no school, we [unclear] home to heat the homes with pine cones, so we would hit the gypsy territory, and we would see that their lifestyle was a little bit different, they were a different type of people.</span> <span id="s953">Anyway, they took them.</span> <span id="s954">It was all in summertime and their king-- they had a king that looked like a Buddha, a very fat man, had always something wrapping around his waist.</span> <span id="s955">He was all naked, very fat and he had, like, four women around him, fanning him, I guess.</span> <span id="s956">They were his harem or something, and they took whole bunch of them, maybe around a hundred gypsies, maybe less - but they didnít have much, they just had some horses and whatever.</span> <span id="s957">They took them on wagons, horse-buggy thing.</span> <span id="s958">Shortly after, itís the Jews that went.</span> <span id="s959">It was still in the time summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JF: This is the summer, then, of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">MT: 1944.</span> <span id="s962">In the fall of ë44 the Poles were rounded up and thrown into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s963">Not the same ghetto as Jews were because we were a small group.</span> <span id="s964">We had like a study hall or something they were renting for Poles where they played chess and so forth.</span> <span id="s965">Thatís where they gathered us, it was one big mansion, I think, at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">JF: They gathered you in this mansion in the fall of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">MT: In this mansion they put us all Poles in there.</span> <span id="s968">Now, as a youngster my experience was that they came from one house to another and they arrested everybody in the house, took them out on the street and walked us under guard to the next house where the Poles lived, so you could not give signals or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">JF: Who was doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">MT: Those were the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s971">And Hungarians.</span> <span id="s972">Both.</span> <span id="s973">The Hungarians, I guess, knew where we lived, and the Germans made sure that it was done.</span> <span id="s974">Then they put us into that place, though, it was only German soldiers that guarded us.</span> <span id="s975">They did not trust, maybe, Hungarians.</span> <span id="s976">Perhaps they felt that some Hungarians were too friendly with us prior to this, prior to the arrests, and there might be something.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">JF: They might have some feeling for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s979">I donít remember, for some reason I have so many blanks in my mind, Iíve often tried to figure out why I am scared to ask my parents.</span> <span id="s980">Because each time that I do that it is opening a wound, and then I feel so terrible for such a long time because I know that they feel terrible and I hate to go and visit them to give them a load, to cheer them up; here comes your son and then leave them in such agony.</span> <span id="s981">But I remember my friend Lotsie [phonetic], Louie, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s982">We lived in the same building.</span> <span id="s983">They were occupying the first floor and we were occupying the second floor in that building that my parents were renting.</span> <span id="s984">He was also renting that place.</span> <span id="s985">And his father was sailmaker, for sailboats.</span> <span id="s986">He was very good friend of ours.</span> <span id="s987">As a matter of fact, we spent more time in his place than ours.</span> <span id="s988">When my parents needed us, they always went down and got us.</span> <span id="s989">When they took us into that what I call a prison, one morning I saw Lotsie at the fence.</span> <span id="s990">It was all fenced in, iron fence, real big fence.</span> <span id="s991">The property was all fenced in.</span> <span id="s992">And I went up to him.</span> <span id="s993">ìLotsie,î and he went away from the fence before I got there.</span> <span id="s994">Iím sure he cried.</span> <span id="s995">When he went away, that he was not allowed to have any deals with us.</span> <span id="s996">At that time I didnít understand but it hurt so much; it hurt so much that my best friend, my best friend in the whole world would not speak to me anymore.</span> <span id="s997">He ran away.</span> <span id="s998">From then on I never saw him anymore.</span> <span id="s999">But we did not stay there that long.</span> <span id="s1000">(pause) So then, a few days later, they started to prepare us to evacuate from that building to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">JF: Where did you think you were going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">MT: We were going to Germany to the camps.</span> <span id="s1003">Thatís what I was told, to work.</span> <span id="s1004">For work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">JF: What do you think your parents thought?</span> <span id="s1006">Do you think they believed that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">MT: At that time, looking at it now, they must have believed it, because we already heard the Russian guns at t distance and they chose Germany instead of being caught by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1008">So that actually what they did is choose the better from two evils.</span> <span id="s1009">I believe they trusted the Germans more than they trusted the Russians.</span> <span id="s1010">I believe they felt the Germans were more intelligent individuals, civilized than the eastern Russian hordes There were terrible stories about Russians from the First World War, how they were raping young women and doing whatever they wished to with everybody.</span> <span id="s1011">We were not girls, but parents still didnít want to face that enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">JF: At this time you were 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">MT: I was 11 and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">JF: You had an older brother who was 12.</span> <span id="s1015">And your younger two brothers were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">MT: I think itís about a one year difference.</span> <span id="s1017">So then my younger one was 10 and my youngest one was-- He was born in ë39.</span> <span id="s1018">So he was five.</span> <span id="s1019">My oldest brother was born in ë32 and I was born in ë34, but he was born in November ë32 and I was born in January ë34, so that gives us only two years apart.</span> <span id="s1020">Right?</span> <span id="s1021">And my younger brother was born in ë36 and then ë39 the youngest.</span> <span id="s1022">Now prior to that, they were taking, arresting, after they sent the Jews out to Germany in the summertime, they started to arrest the Polish male, including young boys from age of 12 and over, to walk to Germany.</span> <span id="s1023">My father, at that time, and my brother were hiding.</span> <span id="s1024">We were hiding them in the basement behind a pile of wood to be used in the furnace.</span> <span id="s1025">We formed like a little hideout for them and they stayed there until the men were removed from our territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">JF: Your father and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">MT: My father and my brother were hiding.</span> <span id="s1028">My mother didnít want to let them go.</span> <span id="s1029">ìNo way,î she said, ìwhatever happens we will go together.î So, shortly after, they went through all the homes and they arrested everybody, like I was mentioning before.</span> <span id="s1030">They took us all out into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1031">So now we were ready to go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1032">A lot of men are gone already.</span> <span id="s1033">Younger and younger boys.</span> <span id="s1034">A lot of women are left behind.</span> <span id="s1035">A lot of old women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">JF: They were just left?</span> <span id="s1037">They were just not picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">MT: The first group of males had to walk to Germany because they were able to.</span> <span id="s1039">It was tough, the way we picture, walking all the way to Germany.</span> <span id="s1040">Half of them will die on the way.</span> <span id="s1041">So they took us.</span> <span id="s1042">So now comes this moment of leaving the ghetto, home, for the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1043">The last hurrah.</span> <span id="s1044">We are trying to take everything dearest to us with us.</span> <span id="s1045">The dearest thing that I had was a stamp collection.</span> <span id="s1046">A lot of those stamps were the latest stamps of Hitler, the latest issues of Hitler, but, yet, as a stamp collector, to me, it meant a treasure because I had a full set of each issue and they were beautiful.</span> <span id="s1047">Hitler stamps were large and colorful.</span> <span id="s1048">The other stamps were not as pretty.</span> <span id="s1049">These were extremely large for that time.</span> <span id="s1050">They were like an inch and a half by two inches.</span> <span id="s1051">Stamps.</span> <span id="s1052">So, I had all kinds of stamps; Hungarian stamps and French stamps and English stamps, and I was exchanging with Hungarian boys who collected stamps.</span> <span id="s1053">It was a big hobby.</span> <span id="s1054">There was no drugs that we played around with.</span> <span id="s1055">We were much too young to think about women, so we collected stamps.</span> <span id="s1056">It was a big hobby, and it was something that we got deeply involved in.</span> <span id="s1057">So, I had these two or three books of stamps, and I was carrying them under my arms, and this German soldier kicked me, and the stamps fell out of the books from under my arm.</span> <span id="s1058">So I started grabbing them, and he put his foot on it.</span> <span id="s1059">I was not allowed to.</span> <span id="s1060">So I grabbed one from under his foot.</span> <span id="s1061">Big foot, big boots.</span> <span id="s1062">Very big boots.</span> <span id="s1063">Wintertime.</span> <span id="s1064">And I started tearing up the stamp collection, crying and tearing it up.</span> <span id="s1065">Well, one good kick in my butt made me fly and that was all left behind.</span> <span id="s1066">For some reason, that was the most important thing to me at that moment.</span> <span id="s1067">My parents probably thought about whatís going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s1068">I was thinking about my stamp collection.</span> <span id="s1069">I had spent two years probably collecting it, or a year and a half, or a year...</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">JF: In tearing it up, what were you feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">MT: I didnít want him, them, to have my treasure.</span> <span id="s1072">I wanted to destroy.</span> <span id="s1073">If I canít have it, I will not allow you to enjoy my pleasure, and I felt good about the few pages that I ripped up.</span> <span id="s1074">That ended right there.</span> <span id="s1075">We were allowed to take one, like a box of goodies, goodies of our clothes and so forth, for the whole family.</span> <span id="s1076">It was like a basket type.</span> <span id="s1077">What would you call it?</span> <span id="s1078">A basket type?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">JF: Like a wicker basket?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">MT: Yes, wicker, it was quite large, like a desk size.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">JF: Like a hamper?</span> <span id="s1082">A wicker hamper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">MT: Like a hamper.</span> <span id="s1084">It was rectangular.</span> <span id="s1085">I would say it was not quite a yard in width and maybe 2 yards in length, and maybe another yard in height.</span> <span id="s1086">And we put our things in it.</span> <span id="s1087">Now, prior to that, my mother was preparing, knowing that we were going to be leaving - she was taking - there was no-- it was hard to make up her mind, I guess, what to take with us, but food was important.</span> <span id="s1088">Now, what can you take in food?</span> <span id="s1089">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1090">There was nothing instant like we have now.</span> <span id="s1091">Dried food, none around.</span> <span id="s1092">She would take yeast, a block of yeast and mix it with flour and dry it out that way, and then she packed it into bottles and we took some yeast with us.</span> <span id="s1093">I donít know what for, and one bag of flour, which they didnít allow her to take with us.</span> <span id="s1094">Then my mother started to rip the sack apart, so finally one of them - she went actually wild.</span> <span id="s1095">She couldnít take it anymore.</span> <span id="s1096">A nervous breakdown, I guess, and she started to scream, yelling and crying and they said, ìAh, let her have that sack.</span> <span id="s1097">Big deal.î In other words, ìI wouldnít use it anyway.î So we took it.</span> <span id="s1098">It was December 31, 1944.</span> <span id="s1099">There was a lot of snow all around.</span> <span id="s1100">Cold.</span> <span id="s1101">But for some reason, this excitement, this everything, I donít remember being cold.</span> <span id="s1102">But it was tremendously windy and a whole lot of snow.</span> <span id="s1103">They took us maybe three and a half kilometers, so thatís what about one and a half mile to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">JF: You walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">MT: We walked, sure, and we had to drag that stuff.</span> <span id="s1106">But it wasnít too bad on the snow.</span> <span id="s1107">It was sliding.</span> <span id="s1108">There was no sleds, we just had to carry and drag whatever we had.</span> <span id="s1109">We got to the railroad station and there was a lot of soldiers there.</span> <span id="s1110">All helmets, uniforms, boots, and a lot of guns.</span> <span id="s1111">It was a very uncomfortable set up.</span> <span id="s1112">There was no more civilian life at all.</span> <span id="s1113">Just us; a small herd of people.</span> <span id="s1114">Empty railroad cars, animal cars, with open doors, and us.</span> <span id="s1115">Well, we started I guess, they were cold or something, they started counting us out and throwing us into the animal wagons.</span> <span id="s1116">If I remember, there were 79 people in our wagon, packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s1117">They slammed the door shut - It was a sliding-type door, and they put the kind of lock you put on that if somebody breaks it you know theyíve broken into it.</span> <span id="s1118">With lead, wire and lead, so nobody was allowed to open the wagons.</span> <span id="s1119">There were big cracks in the wagon, just like we see animal wagons.</span> <span id="s1120">You can see animals through the wagon.</span> <span id="s1121">This was December 31, and it was probably like 2:30 or 3 oíclock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1122">They did not feed us that day at all, we probably did not eat anything.</span> <span id="s1123">They locked us in that train and we stayed there till midnight.</span> <span id="s1124">I remember the whistles, the sirens welcoming New Yearís Eve.</span> <span id="s1125">New Yearís and we were all in a cage already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">JF: Just waiting at the station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">MT: Just waiting.</span> <span id="s1128">All those hours cold, windy, but then it got worse because the wind started to whistle.</span> <span id="s1129">And the people started to sing.</span> <span id="s1130">They started to do different things to occupy their minds.</span> <span id="s1131">And I remember that the men were yelling out every so often to change place.</span> <span id="s1132">change place.</span> <span id="s1133">At that time I didnít realize what they were doing, but they were changing places on the outside against the wall.</span> <span id="s1134">Whoever was, had to change.</span> <span id="s1135">First he was facing the outside, then he would turn around back towards the outside and then they would move in and next group would take the outside line, because they realized that they would all freeze.</span> <span id="s1136">Constantly, they had to move their feet and everything with a boom, boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s1137">Everybody was marching someplace, and yet you couldnít lift your feet high or anything because you were hitting next person.</span> <span id="s1138">It was very, very crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">JF: The group that you were with were all Polish refugees like yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">MT: All Polish refugees, and this group was mostly old women and, of course, women with children, wives that had been left behind from the husbands that had already left, and older, intelligent people.</span> <span id="s1141">People that had positions.</span> <span id="s1142">They all had big titles and in Europe it was very fashionable to use a title.</span> <span id="s1143">If you spoke to the wife of a doctor, you would have to say, ìMrs.</span> <span id="s1144">Doctor and so and so,î and if it was the wife of an engineer you would have to say, ìMrs.</span> <span id="s1145">Engineer,î and if it was the wife of a judge, ìMrs.</span> <span id="s1146">Judge.î Titles were very important in those days.</span> <span id="s1147">All those people I remember had very big titles.</span> <span id="s1148">So, finally, around after midnight, after two oíclock in the morning I think, they started moving us out from the railroad station and we started to go and then things got worse.</span> <span id="s1149">When the train picked up a speed then the wind was really cutting right through the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1150">I didnít realize it.</span> <span id="s1151">When we were standing still, we were still warm, but when we started to move, then it was cold, even for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">JF: How many cars were there?</span> <span id="s1153">You said there were about seventy-nine people in your car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">MT: Seventy-nine people to the car.</span> <span id="s1155">I imagine when they let us out, I would say there was around six cars.</span> <span id="s1156">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1157">There was an awful lot of horse manure on the floor of that wagon.</span> <span id="s1158">Later on I heard the adults say that thatís what saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1159">Horse manure has the heating capacity or something.</span> <span id="s1160">Whatever they meant by that, I donít know, but it was the insulation from the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">JF: How long were you on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">MT: We were on the train probably three days until we got to Austria, the first camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">JF: Were you able to get out of the train at any time?</span> <span id="s1164">Or receive any food at any time, or were you totally locked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">MT: No.</span> <span id="s1166">We were totally locked up.</span> <span id="s1167">They were not allowed to unlock that door.</span> <span id="s1168">That door was not padlocked, only was sealed.</span> <span id="s1169">A wire and lead type lock and if you would break it, they would know.</span> <span id="s1170">Somebody would have to answer for it, why it was opened.</span> <span id="s1171">The first stop that they made, that they were allowed to open it, was at some field.</span> <span id="s1172">It was probably very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1173">It was not in the evening.</span> <span id="s1174">It must have been in the morning, because I can remember the sun coming out, shining over the snow valleys.</span> <span id="s1175">They allowed us to make a circle and take care of our needs as human beings; to urinate, etc.</span> <span id="s1176">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s1177">I know we were huddling around my mother and not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s1178">We never did anything like that in the presence of other people, surrounded by people with guns around.</span> <span id="s1179">Circle was small.</span> <span id="s1180">They made so many circles, I guess, each wagon, I guess, was not allowed to mingle with the other.</span> <span id="s1181">They were separate.</span> <span id="s1182">Each circle.</span> <span id="s1183">And I remember just one old lady, she was saying to my mother, "How can I?"</span> <span id="s1184">She also had a very big title, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1185">"How can I do it?"</span> <span id="s1186">I think a judgeís wife.</span> <span id="s1187">"How can I do this?"</span> <span id="s1188">No.</span> <span id="s1189">My mother said, "How can I do this in front of all this?"</span> <span id="s1190">And the old lady says, "Just lift your skirt, and donít worry about it.</span> <span id="s1191">We are in a cage now.</span> <span id="s1192">We are no longer humans.</span> <span id="s1193">Donít worry about that."</span> <span id="s1194">So they kept us there for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1195">I donít know why.</span> <span id="s1196">Whether they couldnít make up their minds what to do...</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">JF: You mean they kept you outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">MT: Outside in the snow.</span> <span id="s1199">Finally they told us to get back.</span> <span id="s1200">I donít know if they were searching the wagons.</span> <span id="s1201">Perhaps somebody was hiding something, some kind of a radio, I donít know, but finally they let us back into the wagons.</span> <span id="s1202">It felt funny.</span> <span id="s1203">When I went back to the wagon, the first time I felt like I am secure again, like I am in a house, in a home, because I was brought in from that terrible snow and wind and everything.</span> <span id="s1204">Back at home.</span> <span id="s1205">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1206">Then they locked us up again and started moving slow, choo, choo, choo-- picked up speed and then there was this very ungodly sound, because it was whistling [makes whistling sound] right through the whole darn thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">JF: The wind was whistling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">MT: The wind, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">JF: Did you know exactly your destination?</span> <span id="s1210">Or you were just told it would be a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">MT: Was told Germany.</span> <span id="s1212">No.</span> <span id="s1213">Exactly where nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1214">Then they stopped at some railroad station, still in Hungary, later on in the day and we were yelling, "Brothers," in Hungarian, "Brothers, water, water, brothers, water," because they were watering the tanks.</span> <span id="s1215">They were not diesels at that time.</span> <span id="s1216">They were coal.</span> <span id="s1217">Trains run by coal and they needed water.</span> <span id="s1218">So they were watering the engine but they would not give us any water.</span> <span id="s1219">We could hear the water going and we needed water.</span> <span id="s1220">We wanted water, but I guess they were not allowed to give us any.</span> <span id="s1221">The next stop was Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1222">That was in the daytime, maybe two oíclock, maybe a little bit earlier.</span> <span id="s1223">They let us out.</span> <span id="s1224">They opened the trains and Czechs spoke similar language as we did.</span> <span id="s1225">Similarity is probably like English to South Carolina or something.</span> <span id="s1226">British to South Carolina.</span> <span id="s1227">You could tell-- you could figure out; it was enough you could be able to figure out what they were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">JF: Was this in the city of Prague, that they stopped the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">JF: In the main railroad station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">MT: Not in the main station.</span> <span id="s1232">They never stopped in the main.</span> <span id="s1233">They pulled over to some side a little further, never where you had a roof over your head.</span> <span id="s1234">Someplace to the side, some kind of spare parking place, probably.</span> <span id="s1235">There we were allowed - I guess Czechs made that deal with somebody - we were allowed to go to the nearest restaurant.</span> <span id="s1236">I know we had some hot dumplings, made over steam.</span> <span id="s1237">And it was so good.</span> <span id="s1238">They were hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">JF: You went under guard to the restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">MT: That I donít remember, whether we all went in a group.</span> <span id="s1241">I know we were in a restaurant and I know they had something red, like red beer, something that people were drinking.</span> <span id="s1242">I think they even gave it to us; they didnít have milk, I think they gave it to us kids.</span> <span id="s1243">Something red to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">JF: Did you pay for this food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">MT: We had money at that time.</span> <span id="s1246">We had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1247">Hungarian money.</span> <span id="s1248">Yes.</span> <span id="s1249">We had actually quite a bit of money, even in the camps, but we couldnít use it.</span> <span id="s1250">Iíll tell you later on what we did with the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">JF: You said that the Czechs made an arrangement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">MT: Yes, we are in Prague right now, in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1254">Again, I donít know whether I seen other people or whether it was just us children that they allowed out, or whether we snuck away from the train to get something to eat, because we became like hunted animals later on.</span> <span id="s1255">On instinct we would run and do things, which I will tell you later on what we did in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">JF: This was after you were in Prague, now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">MT: After we were in Prague.</span> <span id="s1258">I know that we were some small restaurant, not too far from the railroad station; not a restaurant, something like quick-foods something where you could get something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">JF: This was the stop after Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">MT: Yes, in Prague.</span> <span id="s1261">And we had some food but we didnít bring any food with us so I guess we ate some there and drank some red liquid.</span> <span id="s1262">I think it was probably beer or wine; it was probably wine because we drank in Hungary; it was like in France, in Hungary everybody drank wine.</span> <span id="s1263">Not in our house, but we went to Hungarians, to Lotsieís house, and they would give us wine to drink.</span> <span id="s1264">My parents would get tremendously upset.</span> <span id="s1265">We would come back, "What did you drink?"</span> <span id="s1266">We were happy.</span> <span id="s1267">We would say, "Well, they gave us wine."</span> <span id="s1268">"What!"</span> <span id="s1269">Well, in Prague, I think they give us beer, but it was red or at least dark, maybe bock.</span> <span id="s1270">So the Czechs made some kind of deal At that time I didnít know.</span> <span id="s1271">They offered my father, they told him to run, to escape from the train and theyíll help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">JF: Why did they single out your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">MT: He had Czech-- his mother was born in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">JF: How did they know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">MT: I guess he mentioned it to them, probably.</span> <span id="s1276">He probably mentioned something about the place where his mother was born.</span> <span id="s1277">How far is it from here?</span> <span id="s1278">or something.</span> <span id="s1279">He probably asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">JF: Was it in this little restaurant where you were, or were these Czech guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">MT: Thatís something I just found our recently.</span> <span id="s1282">I mean afterwards.</span> <span id="s1283">I do not remember, given this opportunity to hear that we were offered something.</span> <span id="s1284">And, of course, I didnít know what was happening anyway.</span> <span id="s1285">To me it was a great thing that I was eating something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">JF: As he told you about it, where had he met these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">MT: That was in a railroad station.</span> <span id="s1288">I donít know exactly where, but Czechs whispered to him that you may run and we will help you, but then my mother said, "You must be kidding.</span> <span id="s1289">Look at my children."</span> <span id="s1290">And then, of course, we had my fatherís mother with us and a crippled sister.</span> <span id="s1291">She said, "You must be kidding.</span> <span id="s1292">They will shoot us on the first -- They will get us before we have a chance to run."</span> <span id="s1293">So, we stayed.</span> <span id="s1294">I guess they thanked them for the offer.</span> <span id="s1295">Somebody must have approached them and said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1296">We can help you."</span> <span id="s1297">But there was no chance because, yes, you can run alone, but you canít run with a family.</span> <span id="s1298">Nobody can run with four kids, six, eight people just.</span> <span id="s1299">Then they locked us up again and we were on our way to Germany.</span> <span id="s1300">There wasnít much we could see through there-- cracks on the train.</span> <span id="s1301">But we were observing.</span> <span id="s1302">The territory was changing.</span> <span id="s1303">Once it was mountains, one was trees and then city, and then again just open fields.</span> <span id="s1304">Finally we were in Austria.</span> <span id="s1305">We were driving by a big concentration camp, big towers on the corners, and tremendous fencing around like I never saw in my life.</span> <span id="s1306">Thatís the kind of setup-- and they were saying, "That that is where Horthy, Miklos is-- was taken to."</span> <span id="s1307">Now Horthy, Miklos was President [Regent] of Hungary at the time I was there.</span> <span id="s1308">Thatís a name I remember because they had a lot of songs written about him, Horthy, Miklos.</span> <span id="s1309">He was arrested and taken there by Germans and thrown into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">JF: What camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">MT: It was in Austria.</span> <span id="s1312">I donít know.</span> <span id="s1313">I really donít know, and I still donít know because I never did inquire.</span> <span id="s1314">I remember seeing-- I still see the picture and they said, "Thatís where he is," and we wonder what kind of camp we will be in.</span> <span id="s1315">Shortly after that we landed in Vienna, Vienna shortly, I donít know how shortly, but my next memory is Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s1316">A big ferris wheel.</span> <span id="s1317">In Poland, they call it ìVienna wheelî, a big one, not too far from the railroad station that I can see.</span> <span id="s1318">A real huge one.</span> <span id="s1319">Looking at it the way I see it now itís probably like 200 feet in diameter, probably.</span> <span id="s1320">A real huge ferris wheel; the railroad station not too far from it.</span> <span id="s1321">Awful lot of destruction in the area from bombs.</span> <span id="s1322">A lot of small fragments of bombs and a lot of small, like metal, more bigger than beebees that they put into bombs-- shrapnel type things, laying all around and we were asking, ìWhat is that?î ìThatís from the bombs.</span> <span id="s1323">That kills better-- All of that metal flying around.î Then we were let out of the trains because we have reached our destination.</span> <span id="s1324">They were going to do something with us in Vienna, now.</span> <span id="s1325">We had to wait and wait.</span> <span id="s1326">No food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">JF: You had been on the train three days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">MT: Three days.</span> <span id="s1329">Three days, I think, at least.</span> <span id="s1330">Maybe it was four by the time we got to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1331">I think it took about three days to get to Prague and then another day probably from Prague to Vienna, American planes, or, was it some other instance when we were traveling?</span> <span id="s1332">Perhaps it was later.</span> <span id="s1333">It was not that early because I donít think American planes were in that area.</span> <span id="s1334">But one time we were chased by American planes, and they parked the train in a tunnel for quite a while and then they started again, but I think it was later on when they took us from one camp to another.</span> <span id="s1335">In Vienna, here we are in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1336">We are all out of the train now, waiting under guns.</span> <span id="s1337">Now we, as boys, I and my older brother, we were the messengers in Hungary for my father.</span> <span id="s1338">Whatever messages he wanted to send, political messages, signals from him to his subordinates, he would use us and we would deliver the messages, not knowing what is in them but deliver the envelope, deliver the piece of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">JF: You were aware of what kind of work he was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">MT: Yes, and we were very strongly taught that we are Poles and our-- we owe our country our lives, so whatever we did to destroy the enemy, you must remember that you are a Pole.</span> <span id="s1341">So, in Vienna we saw the express trains for the first time in our lives.</span> <span id="s1342">They were electrical trains, full of German brass, soldiers.</span> <span id="s1343">In the windows, we could see them.</span> <span id="s1344">Somehow we got away, me and my brother, far enough that we found a piece of railroad track, a good sized metal, maybe about 4 feet, 31/2 feet in length, and we went and we put it across the railroad track on one side, propped it up with rocks, and ran back to our group, to our parents, and we said, "Do you know what we did?</span> <span id="s1345">Just watch this.</span> <span id="s1346">The next train that comes through here is going to go off.</span> <span id="s1347">We put a piece of steel across the tracks."</span> <span id="s1348">And my mother said, "Do you know what you did?</span> <span id="s1349">We are all dead, as soon as the train goes off, we are all dead, these soldiers with these guns will shoot us immediately."</span> <span id="s1350">We had to sneak back, crawl back, almost, pull and jerk this thing out, we had a hard time pulling it out.</span> <span id="s1351">I donít know how we pulled it out, it was a heavy thing, and within seconds, half a minute or so, the train comes through.</span> <span id="s1352">(makes sound).</span> <span id="s1353">Electrical.</span> <span id="s1354">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s1355">Now we are very happy that we did something wonderful, but it was actually something very stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">JF: You felt good when you did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">MT: We felt good, but it was a stupid act.</span> <span id="s1358">Maybe a hundred or soldiers or whatever would have got messed up but, then, all of us would have been dead, because they never did hesitate to do that, I guess.</span> <span id="s1359">From there they took us to the nearest camp, Strasshof.</span> <span id="s1360">Strasshof from Vienna is probably 3 Ω kilometers, something like that, not too far.</span> <span id="s1361">It is a small community, probably, but it was a camp, with snow all over.</span> <span id="s1362">They had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">JF: This was in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">MT: Austria.</span> <span id="s1365">The first camp we went to, Strasshof.</span> <span id="s1366">As soon as we went in, who meets us at the gate, in beautiful German uniforms, shiny, scary, but the language is Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1367">"Welcome to the camp," in their language.</span> <span id="s1368">I didnít realize what that meant, but my parents must have.</span> <span id="s1369">Not everybody was from the same territory that we were in that group.</span> <span id="s1370">Some people came from Warsaw, some came from completely different parts of Poland, and they just ended up in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1371">Now, we were from the territory that they were after us.</span> <span id="s1372">We ran away from them.</span> <span id="s1373">They recognized one man, two men.</span> <span id="s1374">One was a police chief in one city, another was his assistant to the police chief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">JF: Who recognized them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">MT: The Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">JF: The Ukrainian guards recognized them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">MT: They werenít even guards.</span> <span id="s1379">They were hired.</span> <span id="s1380">They had almost SS uniforms, almost Gestapo-type uniforms; they were the Gestapo-type something.</span> <span id="s1381">They had those dark uniforms, not the regular grey.</span> <span id="s1382">They had the beautiful officerís thing.</span> <span id="s1383">I remember in a barrack, they walked up to him and took out the big gloves.</span> <span id="s1384">They had the big gloves behind their belts, just like knights, and hit him across the face and said, ìMeine liebe Plata,î my dear Plata.</span> <span id="s1385">His name was Plata, and he looked at the guy and he got white all over.</span> <span id="s1386">I didnít know what that meant, and that was the only incident, and they called him out.</span> <span id="s1387">They went out, a couple goonies came in, Ukrainians in regular uniforms, gray uniforms, took him...</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">JF: Took Plata?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">MT: Took Plata, and I forgot the other guyís name, older guy.</span> <span id="s1390">The other guy was like 60 or 70 years old...</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">JF: This was the police chief?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">MT: Police chief.</span> <span id="s1393">Plata was-- I went to school with his children, his sons.</span> <span id="s1394">He was a little bit younger than my father was, I think, the assistant police chief.</span> <span id="s1395">It turned out later on, that they took them out, both of them, and maybe 6 hours later, at night, it was late at night, when the old man came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">JF: The old man was the assistant or the chief?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">MT: The chief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">JF: The chief and Plata was the assistant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">MT: The old man came back to the barrack, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">JF: Holding his head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">MT: Holding his head with no teeth-- I donít know, like a regular train ran through his head and everything.</span> <span id="s1402">And they were talking to him.</span> <span id="s1403">I guess he couldnít hear, just very-- probably beat up.</span> <span id="s1404">The other guy never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">JF: Plata never came back?</span> <span id="s1406">MT: No.</span> <span id="s1407">Plata, I found out, because we were all so curious what happened, we talked to the sons, what happened.</span> <span id="s1408">He arrested a guy for stealing a pig.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">JF: The Ukrainian guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">MT: The Ukrainian was in jail.</span> <span id="s1411">Plata arrested him and put him in jail.</span> <span id="s1412">Now I did not mention it.</span> <span id="s1413">When Germans came to Poland, the first thing they did is they released the prisons.</span> <span id="s1414">All the prisoners got a rank of some sort and they said, "You know whom to get, go and get them."</span> <span id="s1415">So there was the one thing, to control the territory like that when you just take over, you release the prisoners and those people know who the people were in charge, who the people they hated.</span> <span id="s1416">"Go and get them."</span> <span id="s1417">So he was one of them.</span> <span id="s1418">He had already a beautiful position in German hierarchy, in German organization.</span> <span id="s1419">Well, things were very sad.</span> <span id="s1420">Awful lot of Ukis.</span> <span id="s1421">They were very happy.</span> <span id="s1422">They were cheerful at night, they were singing in their quarters.</span> <span id="s1423">They had a beautiful sculpture, a still remember a beautiful sculpture of a naked woman in front of their quarters.</span> <span id="s1424">One of them must have been an artist.</span> <span id="s1425">Made from snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">JF: Made from snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">MT: Snow.</span> <span id="s1428">Because there was so much snow.</span> <span id="s1429">It was a huge sculpture.</span> <span id="s1430">Huge.</span> <span id="s1431">So they had a ball, they had fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">JF: You were totally in a barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">MT: Totally in a barrack.</span> <span id="s1434">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">JF: Just kept in a barrack, with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">JF: Not separated in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">MT: No, with everybody.</span> <span id="s1439">In barrack I guess you can put in 100 people, I donít know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">JF: With any kind of bedding or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">MT: That I donít remember whether we had any bedding.</span> <span id="s1442">I know there was a wooden Pritsche that was a German word, Pritsche they call it, a wooden type, like a table.</span> <span id="s1443">Thatís your bed.</span> <span id="s1444">I donít remember whether they had straw, sacks on top that you could lay on the straw or not, I donít know.</span> <span id="s1445">I donít remember.</span> <span id="s1446">I remember straw from one place, someplace, I donít know which camp, maybe it was Strasshof.</span> <span id="s1447">On straw maybe.</span> <span id="s1448">From there on when we went to the next camps it was just wooden planks and nothing else, and a wooden pillow that tapered off at the end of the bed.</span> <span id="s1449">That was for your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">JF: What kind of food were you given?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">MT: The food in Strasshof I donít even remember, because I guess it was too much of a shock.</span> <span id="s1452">First camp, the first complete captivity, one hundred percent control of our time and everything, but they took us from Strasshof later on to Neumark.</span> <span id="s1453">Neumark is Bavaria, I think.</span> <span id="s1454">No, we went from Strasshof to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1455">We went through Berlin.</span> <span id="s1456">Yeh, we went through Berlin, I remember that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">JF: What is this that you have written?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">MT: Austria, close to Vienna, is Strasshof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">JF: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">MT: From then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">JF: How long were you in Strasshof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">MT: Not too long.</span> <span id="s1463">This was like a processing camp where they did what they had to do.</span> <span id="s1464">They segregated, they divided, they squeezed out all the juices.</span> <span id="s1465">The next one-- we went outside Berlin-- but I remember-- okay, we went into Berlin.</span> <span id="s1466">We were in Berlin maybe three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">JF: You were taken off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">MT: No, from Strasshof, they put us on a train and they were taking us towards Berlin, to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">JF: A camp in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">MT: In Berlin.</span> <span id="s1471">Now, we spoke Hungarian well, and there were Hungarians also in Berlin area that were traveling to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1472">We got mixed up with Hungarians and we spoke very well.</span> <span id="s1473">We mingled with the Hungarians and in the evening - they always had air raids in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1474">It was the first time I saw a big city, huge city.</span> <span id="s1475">Beautiful buildings.</span> <span id="s1476">And I remember air raid shelters had maybe about two feet of rubber cover on the top of the bunker, and it was explained later on that when the bomb hits that it will kick the bomb off, or the bomb will not go off directly on the shelter.</span> <span id="s1477">We were taken as Hungarians, so we were taken into an air raid shelter during air raid.</span> <span id="s1478">After the air raid, they took us into the Red Cross facility, like a hotel, in Berlin to feed us, but before we finished eating, something happened.</span> <span id="s1479">They discovered that we are Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">JF: Were you under German guard at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">MT: Air raid got-- something got messed up during the air raid.</span> <span id="s1482">We were chased-- we joined the wrong group when we were running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">MT: We joined the wrong group, and we went without guns, and these people were taken with guns.</span> <span id="s1485">So, we ran with the Hungarians because we knew what they were saying.</span> <span id="s1486">ìThey are bombing, letís go, letís go, letís go.î So we yelled same way the kids, ìLetís go.î But they start feeding us, somebody discovered that we were talking in Polish or something-- oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1487">It was just like the world came to an end.</span> <span id="s1488">Everything was grabbed from in front of us and we were pushed, pulled, turned, and finally we were back under guns again.</span> <span id="s1489">They wouldnít even allow us to finish whatever we had on our plate.</span> <span id="s1490">So, there we were back, and my parents were saying, "Well, we knew it would happen, but we wanted you to eat."</span> <span id="s1491">I donít know, I think it was my younger brother, the youngest, that made a sound that sold us out.</span> <span id="s1492">Polish sound.</span> <span id="s1493">From there they took us to Wilhelmshaven, about 13 kilometers from Berlin, east from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">JF: And what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">MT: That was a camp, again controlled by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1496">Every camp I was in, Ukrainians fully controlled each camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">JF: Now, in Berlin, were you actually in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">MT: No, in Berlin, we went just through Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">JF: You just went through Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">MT: A couple of days we spent there, because of air raids they could not move us, and we got messed up with Hungarians for about 6 hours or so, and then went back.</span> <span id="s1501">But we stayed in Berlin in captivity there, and another-- it was a facility of some sort, but it was not a nice facility.</span> <span id="s1502">Where Hungarians were, it was a nice facility that we got chased out of.</span> <span id="s1503">Wilhelmshaven was another camp.</span> <span id="s1504">Now this camp, again, is wires, towers, and all this nonsense and everything else.</span> <span id="s1505">There I remember very good food, for a change.</span> <span id="s1506">I donít know why, but I remember a piece of bread in the morning, piece of margarine and a little bit of some kind of jelly.</span> <span id="s1507">Jello.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">JF: Jelly?</span> <span id="s1509">or jello?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">MT: Sweet.</span> <span id="s1511">Made from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">JF: To put on the bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">JF: Jelly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">MT: Jelly.</span> <span id="s1516">Made from fruit of some sort.</span> <span id="s1517">They had that.</span> <span id="s1518">I donít know whether they had milk for us in the morning, but I was surprised, the way I remember, the food was best of everything we had so far, that was in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">JF: What kind of camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">MT: It was a typical camp again for the Poles, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">JF: Primarily Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">MT: It was not a political-- it was for the Poles, I think.</span> <span id="s1523">It was for working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">JF: It was a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">MT: A work camp, I think, because it was not one of those major ones that they had, strictly political where they threw Jews and Poles in.</span> <span id="s1526">Political Poles.</span> <span id="s1527">It was not whatever you call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">JF: Concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">MT: Yeh.</span> <span id="s1530">Well, no, the names I was going to go through [unclear].</span> <span id="s1531">The only one I can think of is Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">JF: Not an extermination camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">MT: No.</span> <span id="s1534">It was not one of them.</span> <span id="s1535">We did not have to wear a striped uniform, but we had to wear a "P" on our heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">JF: "P" for...</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">MT: Pole, but it was a "P" in the color of the Ukrainian flag.</span> <span id="s1538">It was a yellow "P" on a blue background.</span> <span id="s1539">Ukrainians have yellow and blue as their national flag.</span> <span id="s1540">Now ours is white and red, so we had to use their color and you had to wear it on your heart and it was in the shape of a diamond.</span> <span id="s1541">My mother has one and I was going to bring it and I forgot to.</span> <span id="s1542">We still have one.</span> <span id="s1543">Then we had to have it sewn on our clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">JF: This was in Wilhelmshaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">MT: No, that started from Strasshof.</span> <span id="s1546">From then on we always had to have "P".</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">JF: This was on your own clothes, not on any uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s1549">Perhaps maybe in Strasshof we didnít have it because they would have recognized us.</span> <span id="s1550">Maybe it started with Wilhelmshaven, because I know that we were marked later on.</span> <span id="s1551">Maybe it was because of a mishap or whatever.</span> <span id="s1552">But this was organized camp.</span> <span id="s1553">This they knew what they were doing and we had to wear this and then we were started to feel, like I mentioned-- The food, I thought, was excellent, but here they started to dig around about peopleís background in Wilhelmshaven.</span> <span id="s1554">Every individual had to go and be interviewed or interrogated to find out what his background was, what he was doing, what he was doing in pre-Poland, what kind of job he had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">JF: Who was doing the interrogation?</span> <span id="s1556">The Germans or the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">MT: The Ukrainians, because we could not speak German.</span> <span id="s1558">My parents could speak German and Ukrainian because that was the territory that had German colony and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">JF: Were the Germans in control of the camp and the Ukrainians were the workers who were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">MT: The workers.</span> <span id="s1561">Well, Germans were more or less on the outside.</span> <span id="s1562">I could not touch the Germans, but they were the last closing gate, but closer to us were the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1563">The ones that would kick you and talk to you and so forth were the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">JF: You were then interrogated, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">MT: No, I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">JF: Just your father and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">MT: My father and mother and all the elders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">JF: What did they find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">MT: Thatís when, a lot of-- I just remembered that my father said something to my mother one night, that he will not talk.</span> <span id="s1570">"He will not talk.</span> <span id="s1571">I can trust him.</span> <span id="s1572">He will not talk."</span> <span id="s1573">He was-- they must have been talking about underground activities they had in Hungary, the individual that they were suspecting, and they were interrogating more and more and more.</span> <span id="s1574">And my father said, "He will not talk, I am sure.</span> <span id="s1575">He will not talk."</span> <span id="s1576">And so, they were trying to remove all the organization from the group, the way I see it now.</span> <span id="s1577">They didnít want anything to let go, to pass by their fingers.</span> <span id="s1578">If somebody was doing something against the system, or if he was doing something for the system, prior to the war, for the other system, then he is evil and not worth anything.</span> <span id="s1579">But they had pillows and they had sheets in that camp.</span> <span id="s1580">I still canít figure it out, ëcause itís the only camp they had.</span> <span id="s1581">Perhaps itís because it was close to Berlin, to tell somebody that this is how we run the camps.</span> <span id="s1582">I donít know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">JF: So it might have been shown as a model camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">MT: Perhaps.</span> <span id="s1585">Perhaps some Germans, perhaps wanted to see what the camps looked like.</span> <span id="s1586">I donít think the Red Cross had anything to do with it, but I think perhaps some individuals in their hierarchy wanted to know, "What do you mean you are making camps?</span> <span id="s1587">What do they look like?</span> <span id="s1588">And, sure, it was closest to, letís drive up to, we will show you."</span> <span id="s1589">So they had that.</span> <span id="s1590">So perhaps that is why they also had food, but they were very, very nasty, because everybody was tight-lipped, more and more.</span> <span id="s1591">Pretty soon, nobody wanted to talk.</span> <span id="s1592">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1593">Everybody just-- so things were happening there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">JF: You were still with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">MT: Yes, I was still with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">JF: In a mass kind of sleeping arrangement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">MT: Yes, the open barracks, open barracks and latrines, whatever you call them, bathrooms, were outside.</span> <span id="s1598">Never inside a building, you had to go outside.</span> <span id="s1599">It was a wooden type, with a hole in the ground, but you could more or less sit down on it, but in that camp I donít remember if it was too dirty, but in the others...</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">MT: So, we stopped at Wilhelmshaven, the camp.</span> <span id="s1602">It was the first camp that I saw sheets on the bed.</span> <span id="s1603">It was very nice and that was the camp that I finally realized what my mother saved, the yeast, dry yeast.</span> <span id="s1604">It was not in existence at that time.</span> <span id="s1605">The cooks, the people in charge of cooking, people in charge of everything, were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1606">Now, we, living with the Ukrainians, it was no big deal speaking their language for my parents.</span> <span id="s1607">They still felt probably comfortable to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1608">My mother made a deal with the cook, one of the cooks, and I remember him speaking a beautiful Polish language.</span> <span id="s1609">They were all Polish citizens who went to schools.</span> <span id="s1610">Of course, they were just like anybody else, except they were fighting for something that they never had, their country.</span> <span id="s1611">She told him that she has yeast.</span> <span id="s1612">He said, "What?"</span> <span id="s1613">I said, "Yeast."</span> <span id="s1614">And he says, "Yes, but itís probably spoiled."</span> <span id="s1615">And she says, "No, itís dry."</span> <span id="s1616">"Never heard of it."</span> <span id="s1617">She says, ìI have it here.</span> <span id="s1618">If I can, if you allow me to use your oven to bake something" -- we had still some flour from Hungary and yeast-- ìI will give you some."</span> <span id="s1619">He said, "All right."</span> <span id="s1620">So she had to give him a certain amount of yeast and he allowed her to use the oven to put her mixture into it and, then, also as a token of appreciation, he gave her a bottle of butter, melted butter.</span> <span id="s1621">Thatís how how he kept it, in a bottle, so we would have to put it on something.</span> <span id="s1622">So I remember she baked, not too much.</span> <span id="s1623">I guess she didnít have too much flour or he wouldnít give us too much, but she baked cakes, similar to [unclear].</span> <span id="s1624">They had no nuts on them or raisins or anything but about that size, maybe about 30 of them, just ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">JF: Small rolls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">MT: Small rolls.</span> <span id="s1627">I donít know if they had eggs, whether he gave her eggs or not, I donít know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">JF: This was Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">MT: Ukrainian, because he was, that was his kitchen.</span> <span id="s1630">They were in charge of everything, but they allowed her to do that.</span> <span id="s1631">So, she brought to the barrack, and put it under the pillow and I remember each time I went there under the pillow to take one out, I felt so guilty, because I knew that my parents didnít eat any of them, and I was also, I felt terribly guilty that my younger brother probably wants it, that this will run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">JF: Had they designated how many rolls each of you was to have, or did they just put them there-- knowing that you would get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">MT: They just put them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">JF: And you knew that they werenít eating any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">MT: We knew, and we also knew that each other, of each one was not getting their share and I, as an older brother, the other two-- I felt bad about reaching for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">JF: For your younger two brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">JF: You didnít think that they were getting...</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">MT: I felt that I shouldnít-- I should leave it so they have more, because I knew that this was only something that just happened now and we wouldnít have it anymore.</span> <span id="s1640">And that was true.</span> <span id="s1641">We never had that anymore because I guess she didnít have anymore because I guess she didnít have anymore yeast.</span> <span id="s1642">She must have probably used part of it and gave the rest of it away and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1643">But then, again, thatís not quite right because I donít whether you need yeast, no, you donít need yeast for piroges.</span> <span id="s1644">They had bunkers, not bunkers, underground holes, and in those holes they also had little cooking facilities like barbecue things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">JF: Where was this, in Wilhelmshaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">MT: Because constantly the Americans were bombing Berlin, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">JF: Oh, so they built the bunkers as part of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">MT: Built the bunkers underground.</span> <span id="s1649">Yes, oh yes, because you were the necessary commodity.</span> <span id="s1650">You had to hide.</span> <span id="s1651">You could not-- in the first place, you could give Americans a signal.</span> <span id="s1652">You had to hide.</span> <span id="s1653">In the second place, they needed you to clear up the territory after the bombing.</span> <span id="s1654">My mother made some pirogis, I remember.</span> <span id="s1655">Thatís something like-- uh Jewish have something like, a dumpling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">JF: Kreplach, a dumpling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">MT: But something happened.</span> <span id="s1658">They yelled because there was some smoke getting out so that was like a signal to the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">JF: Was she also involved with the Ukrainian cook when she made the perogies, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">MT: No, that was-- I think she still had water-- I mean flour and I think thatís all it is flour and water-- and they had heat like a barbecue thing that you put a few sticks together and you did something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">JF: So, she made it in the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">MT: I remember she made like 6 of them, I think, and again there was that pain of whoís going to eat.</span> <span id="s1663">And, then, shortly after that, one day came the big bombing of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1664">What a sight and what a sound!</span> <span id="s1665">We were tremendously scared but so eagerly happy about the event.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">JF: You were hidden in the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">MT: We were-- yes, but we were only thirteen kilometers from Berlin and that bombing lasted like 4 or 4 Ω hours.</span> <span id="s1668">Wave after wave of Americanís planes were just coming in and dumping all of their load on Berlin.</span> <span id="s1669">For 3 days or more after the bombing, Berlin was on fire and money was coming down even into our camp, German Marks, but they were all burned.</span> <span id="s1670">Of course, what was the difference?</span> <span id="s1671">You couldnít buy anything anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">JF: Where was the money coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">MT: Banks were hit, I think, and the heat took them up in the air and the wind threw them around.</span> <span id="s1674">Tremendous heat.</span> <span id="s1675">It was, like I said, Berlin was burning for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">JF: And pieces of money were actually floating down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s1678">We had pieces was burned.</span> <span id="s1679">But things started getting nastier and nastier.</span> <span id="s1680">The Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1681">Father had to work to fortify the roads.</span> <span id="s1682">They were building-- blockading like roads, forcing the traffic through the middle of the roads.</span> <span id="s1683">They were building site-- something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">JF: Was this the first time that you had been in a work situation in a camp?</span> <span id="s1685">This was the first one you were in long enough to be in this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">MT: This was the first time we were actually put into work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">JF: Were you also working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">MT: Not in that camp, yet.</span> <span id="s1689">In that camp, I did not know what work was, and I donít believe my older brother-- He was 12 already and was still not working either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">JF: He was twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">MT: He was not working either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">JF: How long were you in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">MT: This camp, we were probably 2 months, 3 months.</span> <span id="s1694">My parents, somehow, for some reason my father didnít like that set-up there near Berlin.</span> <span id="s1695">Maybe the Ukrainians were too strong in control or something.</span> <span id="s1696">He was afraid of something.</span> <span id="s1697">They found out, I still donít know how, that somebody needs workers, and they made some arrangements with somebody.</span> <span id="s1698">"Why donít you send us Poles, x number of people to the working site there?"</span> <span id="s1699">I donít know what happened, but finally they did take a whole bunch of us.</span> <span id="s1700">They sent us from Wilhelmshaven to Bayreuth, and there again we didnít stay too long, but Neumark was the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">JF: B-A-Y-R-E-U-T-H.</span> <span id="s1702">Which was the camp that you were at after Wilhelmshaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">MT: Wilhelmshaven.</span> <span id="s1704">But that one I hardly remember.</span> <span id="s1705">There was a short camp and I told my father, "Isnít that something?</span> <span id="s1706">I remember Strasshof.</span> <span id="s1707">I remember Berlin and Wilhelmshaven."</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">JF: Did he volunteer to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">MT: No, they either heard through this Ukrainian that they are thinking about shipping some people, or something.</span> <span id="s1710">But he asked if we could do some work in that area.</span> <span id="s1711">If you need people?</span> <span id="s1712">And now, later on, actually I found out that that was a very good move that they did, because Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1713">I gather the reason they did this, they were, again afraid of Russians.</span> <span id="s1714">Russians were coming very rapidly towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s1715">War was coming to the end.</span> <span id="s1716">My father was working on those preparations to welcome Russians.</span> <span id="s1717">German defense system.</span> <span id="s1718">To stop them, to destroy them.</span> <span id="s1719">We were moved through Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s1720">I donít remember how long we were there, to Newmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">JF: Now Bayreuth was also a camp for Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">MT: They were all camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">JF: But was it for Poles in particular though or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">MT: The only place, where there were non-Poles in the camp was Neumark.</span> <span id="s1725">There were some Russians and there were some French, but all the others-- I never talked to anybody.</span> <span id="s1726">But I still donít remember talking to anybody anyway except your immediate barrack surrounding.</span> <span id="s1727">I donít know if we werenít allowed to go another barrack.</span> <span id="s1728">I never was in another barracks, just my own, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">JF: The people who were in the camps that you are describing were primarily refugees?</span> <span id="s1730">They were not political?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">MT: No, they were all political but they were trying not to be labeled as political.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">JF: Okay.</span> <span id="s1733">The Jews were not in these camps, or Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">MT: I donít recall.</span> <span id="s1735">No.</span> <span id="s1736">No-- where they were-- Gypsies because I would recognize them.</span> <span id="s1737">Jews, I would not recognize them as such, but I would hear...</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">JF: They would be labeled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">MT: In camps, perhaps not.</span> <span id="s1740">I donít know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">JF: You were wearing ìP.î</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">MT: We were wearing "P".</span> <span id="s1743">That is correct.</span> <span id="s1744">That is true, I donít remember a Star of David in the camps, none of the camps.</span> <span id="s1745">I would probably hear Ukrainians use the word, derogatory word "Jew," like "Pole," because that I would recognize and I donít remember anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">JF: The Russians and the French that you are describing do you have any idea how they ended up in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">MT: I believe that they were deserters, or something, some kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">JF: But, not prisoners of war?</span> <span id="s1749">That would have been a separate, totally separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">MT: No, they were like civilians, but some civilians that were not to be trusted, I guess.</span> <span id="s1751">They were captured civilians, just like us Poles, that they could not trust them on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">JF: They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">MT: Yes, they didnít want to leave them free, so they had to lock them up, to keep an eye on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">JF: So, the fifth camp, the fifth location that you were in-- you pronounce it N E U M A R K?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">JF: Which was where, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">MT: In Bavaria, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">JF: This was in Bavaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">MT: I think.</span> <span id="s1760">Neumark.</span> <span id="s1761">I am not sure, but in that camp I was a woman.</span> <span id="s1762">That I labeled myself.</span> <span id="s1763">I think I heard my parents talk about that.</span> <span id="s1764">I had to go to work with my mother until before the war ended.</span> <span id="s1765">Then I went with my older brother and father to work.</span> <span id="s1766">Men were men and any male below 12 was a woman, went to work with the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">JF: This is your label?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">MT: That is my label because I was not allowed to go with men to work, and there were no children, so we went with women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">JF: How did you feel?</span> <span id="s1770">With that separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">MT: There I felt very bad, because I loved my father.</span> <span id="s1772">I loved my brother and I loved my mother, but I felt that I am, even within our own group, that I am something not right.</span> <span id="s1773">I canít go with my brother, and I canít stick to my father.</span> <span id="s1774">I am forced to be with my mother and I donít know-- just felt that I just donít fit into this worldís puzzle.</span> <span id="s1775">Like there is something wrong with me, something terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s1776">I didnít realize that I was actually lucky that I wasnít able to be used fully yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">JF: You understood the technical cutoff of the age of 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">JF: But the feeling of working with the women and not being identified with the male side...</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">MT: It wasn't that much.</span> <span id="s1781">It was my own feeling of what is wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1782">What is actually wrong with me?</span> <span id="s1783">I understand that I am not quite 12 but I am capable, I am the same size as my brother; I am capable of doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s1784">It was actually false man's ego, I think; I wanted to do more.</span> <span id="s1785">Isnít that something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">JF: So you felt that you should have been picked anyway, that the age was an irrelevant issue, that somehow they had not chosen you to go with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">MT: Yes, that I am with women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">JF: What kind of work were you doing with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">MT: It was mostly gathering wood for kitchen.</span> <span id="s1790">They would not allow us to work in the kitchens because then we would grab some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">JF: Did you feel that the work was beneath your abilities, you know, beneath your strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">MT: No, there was-- actually work was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">JF: The work was still hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">MT: It was very hard and I remember one incident that is deeply buried in my mind.</span> <span id="s1795">It was very snowy.</span> <span id="s1796">For some reason it was always snowing.</span> <span id="s1797">Always cold.</span> <span id="s1798">We went out into woods, again Ukrainian guards, no guns, just with big sticks, night sticks.</span> <span id="s1799">Each guard had two people, or something like that, to watch.</span> <span id="s1800">We went into woods, to pick woods, to gather them up, make big bundle, put in on your shoulders and bring it back.</span> <span id="s1801">They tell you when the bundle is big enough.</span> <span id="s1802">Prior to that, airplanes went by and there were some leaflets dropped.</span> <span id="s1803">God help you if you touched a leaflet!</span> <span id="s1804">Somehow, somebody managed to bring one back to camp, and the word went around about what was happening in the world.</span> <span id="s1805">I had no socks.</span> <span id="s1806">I had some kind of shoes.</span> <span id="s1807">Snow was up to my knee, cutting, going up the mountain.</span> <span id="s1808">I told my mother that my feet are freezing.</span> <span id="s1809">She said, "Take off your shoes and start rubbing them with the snow, your feet."</span> <span id="s1810">First she went up to help me and he yelled terribly, so we had to separate, but then she said, "Don't forget.</span> <span id="s1811">Rub your feet with snow."</span> <span id="s1812">I did that and my feet started to freeze up to my ankles, hot ankles, up to my knees.</span> <span id="s1813">They started losing the feel of it, and I remember my mother started again rubbing it.</span> <span id="s1814">She ripped off part of her dress and wrapped it around my feet and told me to stick my feet with that stuff into the shoes.</span> <span id="s1815">She took my load of wood on her back and the jerk ran up and knocked her down and told me to carry mine and she is to carry her own.</span> <span id="s1816">"What do you think this is?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">JF: This was the Ukrainian guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s1819">Then we get to the gate, close to the camp, then the siren blows.</span> <span id="s1820">Air raid.</span> <span id="s1821">Who cares?</span> <span id="s1822">An air raid would probably liberate us from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1823">You are not allowed to go back into barrack.</span> <span id="s1824">You have to crawl into the very ugly hole they have in the ground.</span> <span id="s1825">It was probably about 8 feet, six, seven feet deep and about 4 or 5 feet wide, just like a ditch, with some lumber on top, some cut wood on top and some dirt thrown on it, full of water, mud.</span> <span id="s1826">When you get in it you are in mud up to your knees again.</span> <span id="s1827">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1828">They chase us in there.</span> <span id="s1829">[unclear] My mother says, "When I give you the signal, you run for the barrack."</span> <span id="s1830">I said, "But what about you?"</span> <span id="s1831">"I'll take care of myself."</span> <span id="s1832">So she started arguing with the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1833">"He says, "I guess my cane didn't hit you in the back yet," and she says, "It's not going to," So then he started swinging at her, and she says, "Run!"</span> <span id="s1834">and I started to run.</span> <span id="s1835">Then he realized what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1836">He wasn't allowed to run in the yard, either, because there was an air raid.</span> <span id="s1837">So he takes the stick and he throws it like they used to get rabbits in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">JF: The stick would move in a circular motion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">MT: Yes, so you can get somebody like that.</span> <span id="s1840">Well, I ducked, and it went over me.</span> <span id="s1841">He was a good thrower, you know.</span> <span id="s1842">He had strength.</span> <span id="s1843">And I dove into the barrack and I crawled into a corner under my pritcha, under my bed, and I just stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">JF: Shaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">MT: There was no heat in the barracks either, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1846">Well, after a while, my mother came in, everybody came back.</span> <span id="s1847">He was looking for me and my mother told me not to get out from under the bed.</span> <span id="s1848">He was looking, I guess for me, to do something to me also.</span> <span id="s1849">From then on I always experience problems with my feet, when it gets cold.</span> <span id="s1850">In wintertime, summertime, it's okay, but in the wintertime I start getting this problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">JF: What kind of problem?</span> <span id="s1852">Pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">MT: No, my, it like itches, my skin starts cracking and I have some kind of skin problem I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">JF: A skin problem, primarily, with your feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">MT: In summertime it's okay, but in the wintertime when it starts getting cold, and then it gets pain, like I get cold, like at work, I can be sitting and everybody is warm, and I start feeling this cold all the way up to my knees.</span> <span id="s1856">This cold, real cold.</span> <span id="s1857">At home when I sleep in the wintertime I have to put socks on.</span> <span id="s1858">In the summertime I am okay.</span> <span id="s1859">Maybe it's psychological, or something.</span> <span id="s1860">But it is giving me some pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">JF: Were you ever punished for escaping from the line like that, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">MT: No, not really that I remember.</span> <span id="s1863">The worse thing that I would get was a good kick.</span> <span id="s1864">And then you would fly.</span> <span id="s1865">But that was no punishment.</span> <span id="s1866">For some reason I never cried.</span> <span id="s1867">Never experienced any-- or showed anything that would make my parents' day worse.</span> <span id="s1868">I never asked for food, or asked for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">JF: You never showed anything that made your parent's day worse?</span> <span id="s1870">Were you feeling it, or did you have to push down those feelings at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">MT: I guess you always feel it.</span> <span id="s1872">[Long pause] You try not to.</span> <span id="s1873">Knowing that actually by doing so you would hurt more your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">JF: You were

worst camp period the attitude, everything was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1924">Adults would ask for food and they said, "You need food?"</span> <span id="s1925">and they would call us stinking Polacks, the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">JF: Was there any effort that you know of to try to form some resistance in the camp, or escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">MT: There was actually, probably it was even actually played down.</span> <span id="s1928">There was no escape once you were deep into the enemy's territory.</span> <span id="s1929">It would have actually have been the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">JF: It would have been very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">MT: No, because later on I became, I guess 12, and was capable, or allowed to go with my brother to clean out, after bombing, the men would be sent to town to clean up the place and take unexploded bombs-- some things did not explode and the Germans would hide far away and the Ukies, and tell you where to dig a hole, where to carry the bomb, where to put it in, drop it in-- the men would try to put it in carefully, slowly, and then mark it, mark the place.</span> <span id="s1932">But it was all walking-- was not somebody takes you.</span> <span id="s1933">You walk to town, you walk back.</span> <span id="s1934">You carried those bombs around and you don't bury them in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s1935">You took them far outside the city and bury them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">JF: This is when you were working with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">MT: So what I am saying is that escape was not even thought of, because there were the Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s1938">They were young children.</span> <span id="s1939">They would chase us because my father would try to tell us a few words in German, Knochen.</span> <span id="s1940">We would buy Knochen, bones, Blutwurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">JF: You could buy bones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">MT: We had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">JF: And you were allowed to spend it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">MT: My father would say, "Go try the butcher shop and maybe he will sell you some bones."</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">JF: And you were allowed to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">MT: No, you would have to break away from that-- but as a kid it was no big deal, because kids are sneaks and they can always-- they, I guess, don't pay attention too much to the adults they watch.</span> <span id="s1947">So we would break away.</span> <span id="s1948">But here we had this so we would try to hide that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">JF: Try to hide the [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">MT: And of course we looked like scrounges, like bums from the worst.</span> <span id="s1951">I mean we never washed our clothes or anything.</span> <span id="s1952">Whatever we had was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">JF: You were wearing your own clothes during all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">MT: Yes, whatever it was that we had, yes.</span> <span id="s1955">I would go-- my brother was older, I would hold the door to the butcher shop, first we would look to see if there were any people there.</span> <span id="s1956">If there was too many people, don't try to get in because you are in trouble.</span> <span id="s1957">But if there's only one person or maybe nobody, just the butcher, I open the door and hold it there.</span> <span id="s1958">He walks in.</span> <span id="s1959">Knochen, and if the guy doesn't yell, then I come in also.</span> <span id="s1960">If he yells and the door is open then he runs out like a dog.</span> <span id="s1961">If he says something, whatever he says, probably "Just a minute," he would take out, would not even put it in a bag just throw a couple of bones to us.</span> <span id="s1962">I guess he had to be careful.</span> <span id="s1963">So we would hide the bones under the shirt.</span> <span id="s1964">It was Knochen.</span> <span id="s1965">Then I go in.</span> <span id="s1966">Of course when I opened the door I was hiding.</span> <span id="s1967">He comes out, "Yes, I got some."</span> <span id="s1968">Then I go in.</span> <span id="s1969">Knochen.</span> <span id="s1970">He gives me a bone.</span> <span id="s1971">Then my brother messes up his hair.</span> <span id="s1972">Goes in Knochen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Tape four, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">JF: So your brother and you would alternate going in and asking for bones and if there were more than two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">MT: Yes, and then we tried-- and he knew that.</span> <span id="s1976">Because he would recognize, anybody would recognize, but you were so hungry and so anxious, and here's a person who was willing to give you something, so you keep on going, and so we just keep on switching, and going in and changing our-- take off the jacket and put the jacket on, mess up your hair-- there was no makeup.</span> <span id="s1977">Finally he yells, "Enough."</span> <span id="s1978">I imagine.</span> <span id="s1979">"Heraus."</span> <span id="s1980">[Get out].</span> <span id="s1981">That word we knew.</span> <span id="s1982">So we get out and we go to the next, look around the next butcher shop.</span> <span id="s1983">Then we need Blutwurst.</span> <span id="s1984">Thatís only two things we could buy; Knochen and Blutwurst.</span> <span id="s1985">Wurst made out of blood.</span> <span id="s1986">Delicious if you could get it.</span> <span id="s1987">So they would give us a piece of Blutwurst, the kind ones, usually the older ones, not the younger ones, older butchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">JF: Did they know you were Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">MT: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1990">It was hard to get that.</span> <span id="s1991">That's the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1992">Sometimes we got some, sometimes we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">JF: Were you ever caught by the Ukrainian guards for sneaking in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">MT: No, no, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">JF: How long were you working with your mother and the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">MT: I would say about, almost the whole time except maybe the last two months of captivity, I was allowed to go with my brother.</span> <span id="s1997">I think we were in a camp about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">JF: You were in this last camp?</span> <span id="s1999">Or the whole of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">MT: No, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2001">I think the last two or three months I was working with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">JF: Once you were 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">JF: How did it feel to switch over to the men's battalion...</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">MT: There was no feeling anymore.</span> <span id="s2006">I think all of the feeling was removed.</span> <span id="s2007">There was no transition.</span> <span id="s2008">No big deal.</span> <span id="s2009">Except I knew that my responsibility now was to get something for the family.</span> <span id="s2010">To bring something in.</span> <span id="s2011">To cheat as much as I can, to sneak away from the work force and to buy something.</span> <span id="s2012">We had money, but we used that money instead of toilet paper, just to get even.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">JF: The Polish-- the money you had was Hungarian money?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">MT: But it was changed into German Marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">JF: But you used it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">MT: But we used it because we didn't want them to get it.</span> <span id="s2017">It was on purpose.</span> <span id="s2018">It gave us tremendous feeling to use the German Marks for toilet paper.</span> <span id="s2019">There was no toilet paper anyway.</span> <span id="s2020">But to use that and just destroy it.</span> <span id="s2021">There was nothing we could buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">JF: You've mentioned several things, so-called small things, but things that gave you a good feeling that somehow you were getting back or outsmarting the system.</span> <span id="s2023">Were there any other instances like that that gave you a little boost, sort of an opportunity to give vent to some of your anger and frustration?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">MT: Not really.</span> <span id="s2025">Because when things later on started to happen, when we were being liberated-- I might as well start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s2026">Actually one more incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">MT: We had one at that camp, Neumark.</span> <span id="s2029">I remember when we first arrived, the farmers from the territory came in to the camp to examine the new catch, new people that we were.</span> <span id="s2030">This was the first time again in my life-- I wasn't that old-- I didn't live that long-- to see people checking human muscles, to see a farmer walk up to a man and check out his muscles, tell him to take off his jacket or whatever he had, a shirt or whatever, and check his muscles or check his teeth.</span> <span id="s2031">I knew from that time that's how you were checking horses, I knew that, that you have to check horses by their teeth.</span> <span id="s2032">The teeth would tell you their age and their health.</span> <span id="s2033">And that's how we were examined, and then the farmer says, "Yes, I will take this and I will take that."</span> <span id="s2034">But never a family.</span> <span id="s2035">He just takes what he wants.</span> <span id="s2036">The rest of the people stay in the camp.</span> <span id="s2037">He took them to farm to work for them.</span> <span id="s2038">And that was like being liberated because there should be some food there, there should be something.</span> <span id="s2039">But one of the younger men were chosen like that that we knew, that the parents knew, to go to the farm.</span> <span id="s2040">My father, knowing some German, because with Ukies you couldn't make any arrangement in that camp, none whatsoever, because they were very nasty to us, very nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">JF: What do you mean, the Ukrainians would not let you work in a German farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">MT: No, you could not make any agreements with them.</span> <span id="s2043">Talk to them or anything.</span> <span id="s2044">They were very nasty to us, very nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">JF: And, if the German farmers came to get people from that camp, the Ukrainians...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">MT: That was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">JF: That was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">MT: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2049">But then later on, in camp you couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s2050">Like "Could I cook something or this or that?"</span> <span id="s2051">No.</span> <span id="s2052">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2053">They were in full control, they were in nasty control.</span> <span id="s2054">I was just a youngster but I knew like, they had lice problem or whatever, some kind of problems in camps like that, because there was no cleaning facilities.</span> <span id="s2055">We never took showers, we never did anything, so every so often, I think twice that I remember, they would chase us into the shower room.</span> <span id="s2056">So, again, when I remember, I went with women, but it was all together, anyway.</span> <span id="s2057">One side was women and the other side was men.</span> <span id="s2058">but what they did: there were two tables, small tables, the women were sitting at one table, men had to walk by her table, but his organ on the table and she examined him.</span> <span id="s2059">Not a doctor, a worker, a camp worker -- a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">JF: What was she examining?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">MT: Just him as a male.</span> <span id="s2062">Just for kicks.</span> <span id="s2063">The women went by guys, and they were just regular workers, they worked for us, and they were just exchanging, sitting there, you know.</span> <span id="s2064">She sat there for a certain length of time until she got tired of it and then another woman took over and so forth.</span> <span id="s2065">They were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">JF: The were not there to be looking for some kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">MT: No.</span> <span id="s2068">Not.</span> <span id="s2069">They were just to dehumanize you.</span> <span id="s2070">To remove another part of your natural instinct to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">JF: Modest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">MT: Yes, and to be yourself, not-- and women the same thing.</span> <span id="s2073">Men were just sitting there just making a big deal out of it.</span> <span id="s2074">"There's a woman."</span> <span id="s2075">The woman would stand in front of his desk and he would do his thing, whatever he wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">JF: What would they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">MT: They would just examine them.</span> <span id="s2078">They were touching them and they were joking to each other and so forth, whatever.</span> <span id="s2079">Big kicks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">JF: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">MT: They would not do anything to me, so I guess they did not have gay individuals there or something, and I was not interesting enough for older women, for mature women.</span> <span id="s2082">I was never molested or made a fool of that way, but I had to undress and run around naked.</span> <span id="s2083">I would hide around my mother.</span> <span id="s2084">Then would come the time that they turned the water on.</span> <span id="s2085">I don't remember soap or anything, but they put the water on.</span> <span id="s2086">They would turn the water on.</span> <span id="s2087">It was so cold you could die.</span> <span id="s2088">So everybody's shivering.</span> <span id="s2089">There I was hiding under my mother to protect me from the cold water, and pretty soon the water stops.</span> <span id="s2090">Thank God.</span> <span id="s2091">Aha!</span> <span id="s2092">Another shower, hot, as hot as you can make it.</span> <span id="s2093">You can't stand it.</span> <span id="s2094">You start screaming and the kids were screaming, hiding.</span> <span id="s2095">Just playing around, those people.</span> <span id="s2096">That was showers...</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">JF: Toying with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">MT: Terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">JF: And again, these were Ukrainian guards all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">MT: Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s2101">Yes, and I am working with one right now.</span> <span id="s2102">I don't remember him.</span> <span id="s2103">I know my mother would and I still don't have enough guts to take a picture of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">JF: He-- the Ukrainian man that you are working with, do you think this is someone that your parents knew or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">MT: They would recognize him because we go, once a week, to a dinner, certain groups, individuals that work there, we go outside to dinner.</span> <span id="s2106">It's more or less like a restaurant - beer place, so we have hot meal and a beer or a cognac, whatever, with it.</span> <span id="s2107">Well, this guy had a few brandies and he started talking about Germany and what camps he was in.</span> <span id="s2108">He was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s2109">So I said, "Which camp were you in?"</span> <span id="s2110">and he says, "Neumark."</span> <span id="s2111">Well, I should have kept my mouth shut but I say, "I was in Neumark," and that killed the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2112">I said, "How comes you were in Neumark?"</span> <span id="s2113">You are in Ukrainian," and he says, "Yes, but they kept me as a prisoner."</span> <span id="s2114">"Prisoner of what?"</span> <span id="s2115">Neumark was divided into two camps.</span> <span id="s2116">One side of the wall was the animals, us, and the other side were the privileged people, that that took care of us.</span> <span id="s2117">So he was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">JF: The guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">MT: Yes, the guards, the workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">JF: Workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">MT: The real guards were Germans.</span> <span id="s2122">They walked with German shepherds.</span> <span id="s2123">There were towers.</span> <span id="s2124">It was not a concentration camp where they had uniforms and they were determined to kill you right away, but it was a camp that they were eliminating somebody everyday.</span> <span id="s2125">Just beating them to death until they didn't move.</span> <span id="s2126">You didn't know if they died, they just removed them from the premises and you never saw them again.</span> <span id="s2127">You just-- constantly-- we went to one funeral like that.</span> <span id="s2128">You never went to a funeral, but something happened and my mother insisted that she wants to have a funeral for that woman, I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">JF: This was in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">MT: In the camp.</span> <span id="s2131">So they allowed us.</span> <span id="s2132">Couple, I know that I went there.</span> <span id="s2133">I was always altar boy.</span> <span id="s2134">So there we were.</span> <span id="s2135">There were no priests; they were also removed from our premises.</span> <span id="s2136">They were in separate places, camps.</span> <span id="s2137">Funeral, there was no funeral.</span> <span id="s2138">Somebody said some kind of prayer.</span> <span id="s2139">Guards.</span> <span id="s2140">The body was in a paper sack.</span> <span id="s2141">It was just thrown into a ditch and youíre not allowed to even cover it.</span> <span id="s2142">On the side there were other bodies laying, like ash.</span> <span id="s2143">They must have been burning them.</span> <span

beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">MT: No, there was no-- in those camps I was in, there was nothing like that.</span> <span id="s2150">Other camps they had some.</span> <span

doctor.</span> <span id="s2158">No way.</span> <span id="s2159">When the Americans liberated-- that's, that comes later, we went to that farmer, a young man, that was picked by a farmer.</span> <span id="s2160">Somehow my father made arrangements, like I said, you couldn't make arrangements with Ukrainians, so he made arrangements with a Lagerf¸hrer, or was it a Oberlagerf¸hrer - his assistant lager, camp director, assistant camp director, to allow two of his sons to walk over to that farmer, to go there to visit this guy and came back.</span> <span id="s2161">No way...</span></p> <p><span

bring any food in, but eat as much as you can, whatever you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">JF: And the Lagerf¸hrer...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">MT: No, we were just allowed to go to visit this guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">JF: That was the premise?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">MT: The premise, yes, to go to visit him, because we knew him, and after all, these are young kids and everything, and they were together for x number of years.</span> <span id="s2173">Why can't they go there and perhaps later on they will be working for this farmer, whatever, blah, blah, blah.</span>

them.</span> <span id="s2177">No!</span> <span id="s2178">They would not be interested in any money; there was nothing like that, because everything that they had-- it was all theirs.</span> <span

[unclear] So my father explained, you can't take a piece of paper to show a map or anything-- explained how to go there.</span> <span id="s2182">We went there.</span> <span id="s2183">We found the place, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s2184">You can't ask anybody, you just have to go through the wilderness, never through populated area, and we got to the place.</span> <span id="s2185">We

didn't have the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">MT: No.</span> <span id="s2215">Never.</span> <span id="s2216">You had something very dear left behind; and the only thing you could do is think how to free them.</span> <span id="s2217">There was no way you-- It was a tough situation that you were in.</span> <span id="s2218">Say you could run away.</span> <span id="s2219">So, where could you go?</span> <span id="s2220">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2221">On the way back, there was a German convoy going not too far from the camp, and Americans caught up with them.</span> <span id="s2222">Three planes, one coming down, going up, constantly just working right through the whole convoy, [made noise] dropping small bombs, napalm, I think, and they just destroyed that convoy beautifully.</span> <span id="s2223">We knew-- It looked to us that they were bombing the camp.</span> <span id="s2224">We cried, we kissed, we hugged.</span> <span id="s2225">That was the end of our parents, the end of everything.</span> <span id="s2226">As closer we got to the camp, the more we realized, it's not the camp, it's German soldiers, the convoy was caught.</span> <span id="s2227">They were destroyed right on the road that goes by the camp.</span> <span id="s2228">Horses-- they still had horses, killed, just upside down, [unclear] trucks, vehicles burning, everything.</span> <span id="s2229">Well, we got to the camp and told them the news-- Nothing, Germans killed all over.</span> <span id="s2230">For the next three weeks, I think, all we had to eat, and that is not right away.</span> <span id="s2231">It was-- it must have been summertime, because those horses blew up real big and after they had exploded already they drug them, and we had to-- the man had to drug the horse in one at a time; one day, one horse, and they would cut the horse's head off and put it at the door of the kitchen, where you walk by to pick up your food.</span> <span id="s2232">Flies all over it, prop it up so you can see the teeth they even put one-- you can put the stick into the mouth of the horse so it's open and you can really see the teeth, and all the smell and everything.</span> <span id="s2233">They would give us food made from that meat.</span> <span id="s2234">But you know?</span> <span id="s2235">That didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s2236">That didn't make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">JF: You were too hungry-- or too desensitized?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">MT: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2239">It didn't change the taste.</span> <span id="s2240">It didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2241">It's unreal, you know.</span> <span id="s2242">I think about it now.</span> <span id="s2243">It didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s2244">The food didn't taste different.</span> <span id="s2245">The food was not different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">JF: You said the food in this camp was particularly bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">MT: It was very bad.</span> <span id="s2248">The Ukrainians would cook for themselves, let's say, potatoes, in those big kitchen-- whatever they call them, real huge floor-type pots, like what, 150-gallon jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">JF: The vats?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">MT: The vats, whatever you call them, I donít know what you call them, that steam heats those things.</span> <span id="s2251">They would cook their food in that, then they would throw some soap in or something, I don't know what, something that made it bluish-- they would throw a lot of water, they would throw a lot of potato peelings, unwashed, and whatever leftovers they had, I imagine they would throw into those containers.</span> <span id="s2252">Put water, and I think they were putting some soap in probably to get even with us.</span> <span id="s2253">But soap was hard to get.</span> <span id="s2254">I don't know what made it bluish.</span> <span id="s2255">All bluish water.</span> <span id="s2256">Ugly.</span> <span id="s2257">And then they would feed it to us, not hot, not cold, like lukewarm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">JF: And that's what you would have, when, at noon-time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">MT: Only once a day, once a day they would give it to us.</span> <span id="s2260">It was-- when I was with women-- I guess it was around noon-time.</span> <span id="s2261">Now, in the evening, men, I guess.</span> <span id="s2262">So maybe it was twice a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">JF: But that's the only food you got?</span> <span id="s2264">There was no bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">MT: No, and when we would get us this liquid, and it would go right through you.</span> <span id="s2266">It was unreal.</span> <span id="s2267">And if somebody would find a piece of meat, or something, they would share it, give it to the kid.</span> <span id="s2268">Share it.</span> <span id="s2269">By mistake there is meat in this mixture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">JF: You describe the horse and the horse meat that must have been used at some point.</span> <span id="s2271">Was that-- that was an exception, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">MT: That was an exception because they were killed a couple of days prior to this.</span> <span id="s2273">But that was all not sanitary, and everything was cooked to be sanitary.</span> <span id="s2274">I remember looking around the trash, finding some potatoes and grabbing that.</span> <span id="s2275">That was more delicious than apples.</span> <span id="s2276">If you found a potato some place, that was very good.</span> <span id="s2277">You got completely dehumanized.</span> <span id="s2278">You had no more feelings about anything.</span> <span id="s2279">After a couple showers like that, and all that food, and all that nonsense.</span> <span id="s2280">In the morning, "Good morning" was Ukrainians would open the door and yell, "Alles M‰nner heraus.</span> <span id="s2281">Verfluchte Donnerwetter, alles M‰nner heraus!"</span> <span id="s2282">"Damn it to hell whatever.</span> <span id="s2283">All men, get out."</span> <span id="s2284">That was good morning.</span> <span id="s2285">Let's work.</span> <span id="s2286">Then you had to work, but you always had Verfluchte Donnerwetter!</span> <span id="s2287">"Damn it to hell," or "God damn it to hell!</span> <span id="s2288">All the men out!"</span> <span id="s2289">Then you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">JF: Was there any kind of religious observance in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">MT: There was once that I remember.</span> <span id="s2292">I'm glad that you asked that.</span> <span id="s2293">And I think that's why I can't-- I feel very blue around holidays: Easter, Christmas, I feel terribly depressed.</span> <span id="s2294">We had, I think it was Easter or something, in one of their garages or something.</span> <span id="s2295">I remember a big Hitler's portrait, very high, a very big one and underneath they had some kind of a table, altar, Ukrainian Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2296">Monks were all around it, they dressed differently, and they were singing to Hitler, praying to Hitler, but mentioning God in there, for God to help Hitler, and [unclear] the whole German nation.</span> <span id="s2297">Ya, that was the religious ceremony we went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">JF: This was in the last camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">MT: The last camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">JF: Who was leading them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">MT: There?</span> <span id="s2302">There it was their side that they felt probably we need religion.</span> <span id="s2303">They were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s2304">They were allowed to have their religion but they probably felt that this was a sacred time.</span> <span id="s2305">We should probably allow the rest of the animals to also enjoy this.</span> <span id="s2306">But I still remember praying, not us, but them praying to Hitler in their language.</span> <span id="s2307">I never took Ukrainian, but I could understand, because the words are similar.</span> <span id="s2308">They were Slavish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">JF: It was the one time that that would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">MT: That was the only time that I remember.</span> <span id="s2311">No other thing.</span> <span id="s2312">Never any school, there was never any medical, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">JF: There was no schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">MT: Never.</span> <span id="s2315">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">JF: Were you able to maintain any kind of time, either individually or with your family, for any kind of prayer?</span> <span id="s2317">Did that help at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">MT: It never happened.</span> <span id="s2319">On the trains I remember that they were singing religious songs, never political, just religious, to keep them alive because it was cold.</span> <span id="s2320">Just to get everybody involved, I guess, psychologically to get them involved.</span> <span id="s2321">Not to give up.</span> <span id="s2322">Later on, as soon as we hit the camps, they removed all that.</span> <span id="s2323">Nobody ever talked.</span> <span id="s2324">Period.</span> <span id="s2325">About anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">JF: Did you find that you used or relied on religion at all as an individual?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2328">Yes.</span> <span id="s2329">Deeply.</span> <span id="s2330">For some reason that is the only thing I think that helped us to survive: hoping that there is a miracle around the corner.</span> <span id="s2331">That something will happen.</span> <span id="s2332">This cannot be allowed to go any further.</span> <span id="s2333">May I stop at this point?</span> <span id="s2334">[tape off and on] Religion actually was the only thing that even us as kids helped us to survive from day to day.</span> <span id="s2335">For some reason we could communicate by just looking at each other into the eyes, and we all thought about the same thing, that perhaps tomorrow will change.</span> <span id="s2336">Things will change, but we did not say it out loud because, I guess, you were not allowed to say it aloud.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">JF: This was you and your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">MT: Us.</span> <span id="s2339">Me and my brothers and the parents.</span> <span id="s2340">Every so often would try to catch their eye, which was very sad.</span> <span id="s2341">Once you are in that type of situation, it is so sad that just the glimpse of somebody's eye tells you the whole story.</span> <span id="s2342">You don't want to say why.</span> <span id="s2343">Like my children.</span> <span id="s2344">I get so upset.</span> <span id="s2345">You tell them something and right away comes, "Why?</span> <span id="s2346">Why?"</span> <span id="s2347">And I say, "Well, can't you figure out something by yourself?"</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">JF: There was, in other words, much more non-verbal kind of communication...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">MT: Yes, it was like feeling.</span> <span id="s2350">It wasn't body language, because there wasn't much of a body.</span> <span id="s2351">But I think it was just like a..</span> <span id="s2352">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">JF: There was certainly an intimacy about your experiences, shared knowledge of how you were feeling and what you were going through, really seemed to bring your family very close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">MT: I think that every family at that time was a very closely knit family.</span> <span id="s2355">All the families in Europe, Jewish, Polish, all of them, and it must have been a terrible tragedy in each case, for each one of them, because what I am saying what I went through, which I didn't go through anything the feeling-- What kind of feeling did a parent have when he saw his child killed in front of him?</span> <span id="s2356">We all were starved in front of our parents.</span> <span id="s2357">Something else, something we could not allow right now to happen.</span> <span id="s2358">If you have a child, to see somebody systematically cut down on food and eliminate their health and their well-being, systematically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">JF: Did you have close contacts with other families or with other children in the camp, or was the family unit the key emotional nucleus for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">MT: It was actually a family unit, I would say, even though we were in the one barrack, but we were just a group of family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">JF: The six of you, the eight of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">MT: Yes, I mean as far as the real intimate feeling of sharing this heat, of love that was not allowed to be expressed, I guess, through emotionally, just-- but kindness and sharing there was-- I remember it was throughout the whole system.</span> <span id="s2363">If somebody was unable to walk, everybody would try to help him because soon as he fell, that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">JF: There was mutual support?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">MT: It was mutual because, I guess, they all knew they were in the same boat.</span> <span id="s2366">There is no way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">JF: You talked before about the one boy who was working for the farmer and you and your brother had known him.</span> <span id="s2368">Was there any talking, any dreaming, or remembering of times when you were not in this situation, or fantasies about what would be if you were not in this situation as far as what you would be doing?</span> <span id="s2369">What kind of life you would be leading?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">MT: You see, I went through that same question.</span> <span id="s2371">I asked myself many times.</span> <span id="s2372">I did not have that.</span> <span id="s2373">I believe what happens, once you are reduced to that level, you don't have any dreams.</span> <span id="s2374">You don't recall anything.</span> <span id="s2375">You just are where you are, but all that is not there.</span> <span id="s2376">I don't have any recollection of wonderful-- in my case it was Christmas.</span> <span id="s2377">It was always such a thing where you get presents.</span> <span id="s2378">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2379">Never.</span> <span id="s2380">Never about anything.</span> <span id="s2381">Or my friends, or playing ball, or something?</span> <span id="s2382">Never.</span> <span id="s2383">Yet I was so active before.</span> <span id="s2384">Bicycles, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">JF: You didn't think about these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">MT: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">JF: Do you think that the dehumanization process that you talked about before...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Tape four, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">JF: We were talking about whether or not such memories would have been part of the dehumanization process, or whether it was too painful to dream outside the present.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">MT: Well, I think it was perhaps two, both, but I think the dehumanization did play the major part in it.</span> <span id="s2391">They removed this beautiful human dream, of becoming, of growing up to become somebody and to live up to your parents' dreams or perhaps to-- whatever.</span> <span id="s2392">It was all removed.</span> <span id="s2393">Then it was also painful to go back and, I believe, to play around with something you had before.</span> <span id="s2394">Something that gave you pleasure.</span> <span id="s2395">But, also, I think there was a third factor involved: that we were not given the opportunity, the chance, to actually think.</span> <span id="s2396">That was taken.</span> <span id="s2397">Each time you were yelled at, and you were pushed and you were moved, so whatever they did, somebody either thought of that, that that's the way to handle people or, if not, they did do a good job and they constantly kept you disturbed and ducking or whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">JF: Your energies went toward that instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">MT: Yes, you never had actually a minute chance.</span> <span id="s2400">I don't even remember dreaming.</span> <span id="s2401">I just don't know how I slept, but I never had dreams.</span> <span id="s2402">I often thought that perhaps when somebody is in jail he dreams about his family, dreams of that.</span> <span id="s2403">That's not true.</span> <span id="s2404">I don't believe you have those dreams.</span> <span id="s2405">They are removed, or maybe it's the defensive mechanism in our subconscious mind that locks everything away.</span> <span id="s2406">To keep you from losing whatever you have.</span> <span id="s2407">You had a little mind.</span> <span id="s2408">It is so easy for a child to lose his mind altogether, if you would realize and compare it to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">JF: How was it when you were liberated, as far as this kind of thinking was concerned?</span> <span id="s2410">Were you able to resume the fantasies and the thoughts of normal adolescence and that of an average adolescent at a later point, or do you feel that this time affected what happened to you later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">MT: No, it did do something.</span> <span id="s2412">It was a shock of a tremendous importance in my life.</span> <span id="s2413">When we were liberated, first the Germans at night chased us out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2414">The Americans did not bomb camps.</span> <span id="s2415">Many times Germans would mark the camp with red cross on the roofs just to protect themselves.</span> <span id="s2416">They could hide wherever they wanted in the camps, I guess.</span> <span id="s2417">They were not destroyed.</span> <span id="s2418">At night they switched places with us.</span> <span id="s2419">The army went into the camp and they chased us into the woods.</span> <span id="s2420">In the morning we were caught in the middle of war front.</span> <span id="s2421">Americans are coming.</span> <span id="s2422">We were in the woods, I think for three days.</span> <span id="s2423">Again, no food.</span> <span id="s2424">But we-- my father parked us and we made a little bed of leaves.</span> <span id="s2425">It must have been-- it was May-- when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">JF: This was the liberation.</span> <span id="s2427">You were kicked out into the woods so that the Army could...</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2429">Could take our place so that they would not be touched by the planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">JF: That was liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">MT: That was liberation.</span> <span id="s2432">So then we were caught between the fire, from Germans to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2433">We were right in the middle.</span> <span id="s2434">All the artillery and the machine guns and everything flying back and forth.</span> <span id="s2435">We were very close to a stream, so we had water.</span> <span id="s2436">Right next to the stream bed, we made our beds, just leaves and dried grass and we were laying on it, sleeping on that, just huddling together.</span> <span id="s2437">I don't remember much sleeping.</span> <span id="s2438">Anyway, there was constantly boom, boom and explosions everywhere.</span> <span id="s2439">Every morning when my mother woke up she said, "I smell Darlings."</span> <span id="s2440">Darlings were English cigarettes that she smoked in Hungary.</span> <span id="s2441">They had a specific aroma.</span> <span id="s2442">They were the good cigarettes which she forgot what a cigarette smells like, I guess.</span> <span id="s2443">"I smell Darlings," and my father said, "No, there is no British forces here.</span> <span id="s2444">It's wrong."</span> <span id="s2445">And she said, "I smell it."</span> <span id="s2446">Shortly after two soldiers came out with grenades hanging on their chest, different helmets that I ever saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">JF: British?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">MT: With guns.</span> <span id="s2449">Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">JF: Um'm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">MT: My father had found an old ax, because we went through some caves that were a castle not far away, they chased us out.</span> <span id="s2452">Not too far from the camp was a big castle.</span> <span id="s2453">He found an ancient ax, with a part of the handle on it.</span> <span id="s2454">It was to protect us from what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2455">He reached for the ax and they screamed, and yelled at him and jumped on his hand.</span> <span id="s2456">He said, "Polisher" in German: "We are Polish."</span> <span id="s2457">They called-- the guy didnít couldnít speak any language, I guess.</span> <span id="s2458">The American, he called an interpreter.</span> <span id="s2459">It was a Polish guy from around upstate Pennsylvania, I think.</span> <span id="s2460">He spoke some Polish.</span> <span id="s2461">My father prepared bunkers around the castle, protective bunkers from-- if invasion forces will be coming.</span> <span id="s2462">So he sketched out the plan of the bunker.</span> <span id="s2463">He said, "You are bombing the castle.</span> <span id="s2464">It is not the castle that the Germans are in," and he showed them what-- He said, ìI was working there and I know, and it is so far from the camp, and in the camp there are no civilians anymore, they are army."</span> <span id="s2465">Well, everything went on alert and they sent us back, but they would not give us any kind of protection.</span> <span id="s2466">They just told us to go back.</span> <span id="s2467">My mother ripped whatever she had.</span> <span id="s2468">We put it on a stick and we were carrying it like a flag.</span> <span id="s2469">It wasnít too white, because we didnít have anything white.</span> <span id="s2470">It must have been very grayish, but that was the only cloth that she had.</span> <span id="s2471">Airplanes would be diving right, almost hitting us, and recognizing that we were just a bunch of nothing, that we were not soldiers-- an awful lot of shooting.</span> <span id="s2472">Everybody was shooting.</span> <span id="s2473">Everything was going on and we were just walking.</span> <span id="s2474">Artillery shells were exploding all around, but we thought after we told them that they would give us some protection, and take us on a jeep or something.</span> <span id="s2475">Of course, we didnít know what a jeep was.</span> <span id="s2476">Now we worked our way back towards the American back lines.</span> <span id="s2477">They told us not to touch any food.</span> <span id="s2478">Americans are big eaters; they had an awful lot of cans, cans of food, and it was laying all around, and they told us not to touch it because a lot of it was booby trapped by Germans and it could explode.</span> <span id="s2479">Well, that didnít mean anything.</span> <span id="s2480">Nobody heard that.</span> <span id="s2481">We were grabbing everything we could.</span> <span id="s2482">And Americans didnít finish their food.</span> <span id="s2483">They just start something open, they didnít like it, I guess and we were-- no utensils or anything.</span> <span id="s2484">Just eating all that-- butter.</span> <span id="s2485">They had cans of butter.</span> <span id="s2486">Butter was like-- I wouldnít touch it now.</span> <span id="s2487">Well, we went back and one of the soldiers asked my mother or my father what time it is.</span> <span id="s2488">My mother still had her watch, it was a Wittnauer, not Wittnauer, but Longines.</span> <span id="s2489">As soon as she went like that, he removed it from her hand.</span> <span id="s2490">Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2491">This was when my father went berserk.</span> <span id="s2492">On Hungarian border, he said he wants to see an officer.</span> <span id="s2493">They gave her back her watch.</span> <span id="s2494">It was a mistake.</span> <span id="s2495">I guess they didnít realize weíre Polish, or something.</span> <span id="s2496">Just straight out of-- nonsense camp.</span> <span id="s2497">Thatís the brutality of the war, that actually even the good people will get sucked into it, do things that were not necessary.</span> <span id="s2498">But he thought he will get whatever he can from, because this was his first probably encounter with-- anyway.</span> <span id="s2499">But then, they gave me a bar of chocolate, a soldier, and I went out like a light.</span> <span id="s2500">I ate maybe a Hershey bar.</span> <span id="s2501">I remember.</span> <span id="s2502">I ate maybe one fourth of it and I was out, unconscious for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2503">It was not poison, but my body was not able to handle that rich food, and I was in terrible fever and everything.</span> <span id="s2504">They told me later on I had whatever some kind of poison and they put everybody on a strict diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">JF: Where were you during the time that you were so ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">MT: It was in camp.</span> <span id="s2507">After that they took us back in camp; I donít know how we got back to camp.</span> <span id="s2508">I got back to camp.</span> <span id="s2509">I remember it was night and then everything, the lights went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">JF: This was in Neumark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">MT: Neumark.</span> <span id="s2512">All day we were running around.</span> <span id="s2513">Theyíre fighting and they captured without killing one soldier, without losing their soldiers or killing anybody.</span> <span id="s2514">They captured all those Germans.</span> <span id="s2515">Actually, as a matter of fact, my father should get some kind of prize for that.</span> <span id="s2516">There was nothing: no loss of life, capturing all those Germans.</span> <span id="s2517">On either side.</span> <span id="s2518">They were just surrounded and then they gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">JF: You say your father should have gotten...</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">MT: A medal for that.</span> <span id="s2521">Some recognition for telling them where they are and they were able to take them without a fight.</span> <span id="s2522">They just surrounded them and told them, "You are surrounded and it is up to you."</span> <span id="s2523">Somebody was smart and they gave up.</span> <span id="s2524">Well, I was out for two weeks and later on I developed a brain-cell inflammation.</span> <span id="s2525">It is meninges, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">JF: Meningitis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">MT: Of the brain, meningitis?</span> <span id="s2528">The brain-- it was.</span> <span id="s2529">It got inflamed on me.</span> <span id="s2530">So, again I was out.</span> <span id="s2531">There was no medical facility.</span> <span id="s2532">The first American troops that went through, they did not have medical staff for us.</span> <span id="s2533">They were just a fighting force, and when the second wave came through, the mop-up patrol, they came through with medics.</span> <span id="s2534">But before they got to me, I was already again unconscious, a terrible temperature and nothing to fight it.</span> <span id="s2535">My father had to dig a hole in the ground and have two bottles, like wine bottles, fill them up with water, let them down as deep as he can.</span> <span id="s2536">Cool it, then they would apply compresses to my head to cool me.</span> <span id="s2537">There was nothing, no ice, no aspirin even, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">JF: Who was in charge of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">MT: At that time nobody.</span> <span id="s2540">Nobody.</span> <span id="s2541">It was sad.</span> <span id="s2542">There was nobody but, of course, it was better than those other animals.</span> <span id="s2543">If I would have developed any of that sooner, I would have died.</span> <span id="s2544">They would have just thrown me to the side.</span> <span id="s2545">So, that was it.</span> <span id="s2546">But before-- I jumped over one thing.</span> <span id="s2547">When they did liberate, before I got this brain-cell inflammation, Americans gave the camps, camp people, three days to settle their differences with people that were in charge of them, people in town, whatever.</span> <span id="s2548">Well, for some reason, my parents knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s2549">I guess every adult knew what it meant: settle your differences, because after these three days there would be courts and everything.</span> <span id="s2550">There would be no more free hand, get-even.</span> <span id="s2551">They removed us from that scene, so I havenít seen anything, but later on I heard of terrible things that were happening.</span> <span id="s2552">They removed us to a village nearby.</span> <span id="s2553">Veen, they called it, and I remember I had some kind of sour soup that the German farmer prepared, and they had to take us in.</span> <span id="s2554">Farmers didnít have a choice.</span> <span id="s2555">They had to take us in as guests, into the farmhouse, because that was already occupied by American forces.</span> <span id="s2556">So we went in there and they had rooms and they had to take us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">JF: What was their attitude towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">MT: Not bad.</span> <span id="s2559">I donít remember anything nasty from them.</span> <span id="s2560">The food was tremendous.</span> <span id="s2561">We never saw that much food in our lives.</span> <span id="s2562">They were not nasty, but at night it was very scary, and they were scared and I guess they told my parents that we are making it worse.</span> <span id="s2563">They had those shutters, window shutters, that they had to close at night, because that was the type of territory they lived in.</span> <span id="s2564">At that time there was a lot of German soldiers that were still hiding in the forest.</span> <span id="s2565">They did not want to surrender.</span> <span id="s2566">There was still like guerrillas fighting, quiet tactics, and they would come around to those homes, I remember, at night.</span> <span id="s2567">They would be hitting on the window and telling them in German, "Open up.</span> <span id="s2568">We are your brothers.</span> <span id="s2569">We need food and we need this," and they would not open it for them.</span> <span id="s2570">They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">JF: You were recovered by this time from the illnesses that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">MT: No, it was only the chocolate I had recovered from-- Not from Veen, sorry.</span> <span id="s2573">When we went to Veen it was right after we went through the front.</span> <span id="s2574">We went through the terrible front and everything, and we swung around to the camp and Americans declared three days of cleaning up.</span> <span id="s2575">They finally captured the Germans and they have re-liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s2576">At that time I was given a chocolate bar and I went unconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">JF: And you were in the camp during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">MT: I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s2579">Huh.</span> <span id="s2580">Thatís good.</span> <span id="s2581">I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s2582">But when did they give us?</span> <span id="s2583">So that means the first group, the first group of soldiers that went through, they did not give us permission to kill or anything, but it was the second group of soldiers that came through, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">JF: It was a group of Americans that gave you permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">MT: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2586">They were all Americans.</span> <span id="s2587">The first group is the fighters.</span> <span id="s2588">They just go through like a bulldozer and fight for the territory.</span> <span id="s2589">The second group comes in and cleans up whatever wasnít done by the first group.</span> <span id="s2590">Then the third group was the medical and the full established companies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">JF: So it was the second group that gave you permission to pillage or kill, or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">MT: Not to pillage.</span> <span id="s2593">Just to kill whoever was terrible to you, because they said, after this, they will have to be brought to court.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">JF: Was that common?</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">MT: I think it was, but I think itís very-- not stupid.</span> <span id="s2596">Itís very uncivilized.</span> <span id="s2597">Itís something you donít want to do to a person whatís hurt badly.</span> <span id="s2598">You donít want to give him the privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">JF: To unleash all that aggression.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">MT: To get even, because then he will never live through this again.</span> <span id="s2601">I think it was very, very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">JF: But it was the American army that did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">MT: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2604">I think they did it with the thought that after they saw what was happening to people, that this must be revenged some way.</span> <span id="s2605">But some people, they were still capable of doing it.</span> <span id="s2606">I heard they did capture some Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s2607">They would try, with whatever they had, shovels or anything, to finish them off, and they said that they never knew that a person was so hard to kill, because always an arm or something was still moving.</span> <span id="s2608">Now, I never saw this, because I was in the village.</span> <span id="s2609">When we came to the village-- so that must have been-- it was still the second group that came through then.</span> <span id="s2610">I ate the chocolate and then I went out, but we still did not have medics.</span> <span id="s2611">Then the medical group came through and they put the whole camp on a strict diet of water, warm cereals, oatmeal, I think, water, and then after so many days there was a little milk in it, and oatmeal, and then finally, it was milk and oatmeal; you could drink milk separately, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">JF: So, that when you talk about this brain-cell infection that you had, that was during the time that the medics were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">MT: Nope.</span> <span id="s2614">That was before the medics got there, yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">JF: How was that diagnosed?</span> <span id="s2616">How did they know what was going on with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">MT: There were some individuals in camps from Hungary-- and I donít know how it was diagnosed.</span> <span id="s2618">It was diagnosed that I had a-- thatís a good one!</span> <span id="s2619">There was nothing that they were giving me.</span> <span id="s2620">I think, just cold compresses on my head.</span> <span id="s2621">But I know that my parents were saying-- I always have to remember that because some day I might need to know that if some problems would develop, that I had that.</span> <span id="s2622">I never questioned that.</span> <span id="s2623">Itís a good point.</span> <span id="s2624">I donít know how they diagnosed it, whether somebody knew enough, or whether my parents later on investigated it, and had somebody determine what, I donít know.</span> <span id="s2625">And then things, you said, did things start coming to normal?</span> <span id="s2626">Then, yes.</span> <span id="s2627">There was no schools, but us as young boys-- I donít remember girls.</span> <span id="s2628">We were not interested in girls at all for some reason.</span> <span id="s2629">And I was at an age when I should have been looking already at girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">JF: It was an age, you said, when you should have been looking, but you werenít interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">MT: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s2632">After I got well and so forth, a certain time, I donít even remember, my brother got well, we started to form like boy scouts.</span> <span id="s2633">My older brother was always the leader.</span> <span id="s2634">He would be the group pack leader and we would go and try to imitate what we did in Hungary, when we were boy scouts there, younger, and going with parents, with father into the woods with the rest of the boys, organized.</span> <span id="s2635">We started doing the same things.</span> <span id="s2636">Walking around and trying to pick the berries, because there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s2637">You couldnít make hamburgers or hot dogs.</span> <span id="s2638">But we would pick the berries and so forth, and we would play, not army, but play like we were Knights of the Round Table, or something.</span> <span id="s2639">That was the only getting back to normal.</span> <span id="s2640">There was nothing, no toys, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">JF: You were at that time about 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">MT: Twelve.</span> <span id="s2643">Must have been 12 in ë45.</span> <span id="s2644">I was ë34.</span> <span id="s2645">[born in ë34]</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">JF: Twelve and a half, perhaps.</span> <span id="s2647">You were still living in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">MT: Oh, yes, but that was a sad set-up.</span> <span id="s2649">We lived in camps until we left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">JF: How long was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">MT: Until ë49.</span> <span id="s2652">I arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 27, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">JF: Were you still living in the same camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">MT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">JF: These were different DP camps, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2657">Neumark was the first one.</span> <span id="s2658">Then we went to Hochenfels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">JF: Neumark was the camp from which you were liberated, but you stayed there for about how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">MT: I donít know, probably months, two months, three months.</span> <span id="s2661">At least 3 months.</span> <span id="s2662">Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">JF: And then the next one is H-O-C-H-E-N-F-E-L-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">MT: Hochenfels, correct; Ansbauch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">JF: A-N-N-S-B-A-C-H... [correct spelling is Ansbauch]</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">MT: W-I-L-D-F-L-E-C-K-E-N-- and then there was-- see, what happened, we ended up, Neumark was the camp we were in, but from then on we were in German military camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">JF: These were German military?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">MT: Without Germans in them.</span> <span id="s2669">They were old and some of them were new.</span> <span id="s2670">Military barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">JF: H-E-I-L-B-R-O-N-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">MT: Yes, Heilbronn, thatís near Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s2673">Thatís Wittenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">JF: And the last L-U-D-V-I-G-S-B-U-R-G.</span> <span id="s2675">[Ludwigsburg].</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">MT: Ludwigburg, and then Bremenhafen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">JF: B-R-E-M-E-N-H-A-F-E-N [Bremerhaven]</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">MT: Yes, but now these last two, Ludwigsburg and Bremenhaven [Bremerhaven], they were-- where we were being watched-- we were leaving Germany, so they were pre-- preparatory camps for coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s2679">So in Ludwigsburg, they screened us, they did everything, they checked our health, to make sure that we are capable of doing things for ourselves.</span> <span id="s2680">In Bremenhafen, [Bremerhaven] we just waited for the ship.</span> <span id="s2681">That is the port, from which we left for New York City, but we never made it to New York because of the storm.</span> <span id="s2682">We ended up in Boston, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s2683">We had to go around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">JF: When we spoke before, you told me that after you were liberated and, whether it was in Europe or whether it was upon coming to the United States, that you had dreams that were quite pronounced.</span> <span id="s2685">Could you describe those to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2687">I always would wake up not just dream about it, would wake up in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s2688">The Germans were after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">JF: Was this still in Europe, or was this once you came here to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">MT: It wasnít too much in Europe.</span> <span id="s2691">It was when I came here, when I finally, I believe, I experienced a total relaxation and freedom.</span> <span id="s2692">My dream of my life was to own a gun.</span> <span id="s2693">A gun meant life to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">JF: When you say dream, youíre not talking about an actual dream, you are talking about a wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2696">My wish.</span> <span id="s2697">My desire was to put my hand on a gun, to have a gun, because gun meant so much when I was in captivity.</span> <span id="s2698">A gun meant everything.</span> <span id="s2699">Money didnít mean anything, but a gun meant power.</span> <span id="s2700">A gun meant freedom.</span> <span id="s2701">A gun meant everything.</span> <span id="s2702">So as soon as I had a chance, I bought a weapon to go hunting.</span> <span id="s2703">Ten dollars it cost me to buy a shotgun, a cheap shotgun.</span> <span id="s2704">I treasured it.</span> <span id="s2705">I cleaned it and everything, and then I went into the military, and I bought a 45 pistol soon as I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">JF: You were in the American military?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">MT: Yes, the 82nd Airborne, and I bought a 45 pistol, as soon as I came out of the military.</span> <span id="s2708">Of course, I had it registered and I had to send to the FBI or whatever, and I still have it.</span> <span id="s2709">Iím still the owner of a 45, and I used to play with it something terrible.</span> <span id="s2710">On the weekends I would clean it in the yard so everybody could see it.</span> <span id="s2711">Like a child with a new toy and I had to take it apart, and I had to oil it and pretend that I am looking at the barrel and, finally it left me.</span> <span id="s2712">I am free.</span> <span id="s2713">I donít have to have a weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">JF: How long did that feeling last?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">MT: That feeling was for quite a while, because as soon as I had the weapons, then it rekindled the old memories, I think.</span> <span id="s2716">So when I would go to bed, then the dreams would change that Germans are not just chasing me, but if I could only get to my gun, to my pistol, that was even after I got out of the military, if I just could get to my pistol, things will change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">JF: So the initial dream was that the Germans were chasing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">MT: They were chasing me and I was running away and it is so hard when you are asleep to run.</span> <span id="s2719">Itís like they are getting closer and your legs are so tired.</span> <span id="s2720">You canít run because of blankets or whatever you have over you.</span> <span id="s2721">You canít move.</span> <span id="s2722">And they are getting closer and closer, and finally you wake up and they are not here.</span> <span id="s2723">Phew.</span> <span id="s2724">They are not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">JF: When you got your rifle, or when you got your 45?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">MT: When I got the 45.</span> <span id="s2727">The rifle did not turn me on because they did not carry rifles, but the pistol.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">JF: It was the pistol that was significant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">JF: And then you were trying to get the pistol in your dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">MT: To get the pistol and get even with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">JF: Did you reach the pistol in the dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">MT: I never reached the pistol.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">JF: It was trying to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2736">Never.</span> <span id="s2737">I was always trying so hard.</span> <span id="s2738">So terribly hard to get it, and I never got to it.</span> <span id="s2739">I never had a chance or did kill anybody in my dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">JF: Was there anything in particular that happened around the time that these dreams stopped, as you recall, or did they just end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">MT: Perhaps.</span> <span id="s2742">No.</span> <span id="s2743">I think I loosened up a little bit, mentally, I think.</span> <span id="s2744">I started having more fun and found out more about women.</span> <span id="s2745">And I think it partially moved everything out of my old mind and replaced it with new.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Tape five, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">JF: You said that you loosened up, you were able then to become involved with women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">MT: Then I started to become a human again.</span> <span id="s2749">I started having human feelings.</span> <span id="s2750">I wasnít afraid to-- I was shy prior to that.</span> <span id="s2751">Tremendously shy.</span> <span id="s2752">I never had a chance to play my role as a growing up boy.</span> <span id="s2753">For some reason, perhaps, because I thought I was a woman, I didnít feel right in any kind of situation, so if a girl would talk to me I would blush immediately and I would get so red in the face; I wished I would die right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">JF: You are talking about when you were here already you still had some of those feelings that you did when you were working in the womanís side of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">MT: I think that that perhaps had an effect on me.</span> <span id="s2756">I was just trying to see why I was that way, because I was tremendously shy.</span> <span id="s2757">My brother wasnít like that.</span> <span id="s2758">I was tremendously shy.</span> <span id="s2759">I could not talk to a girl without completely falling apart.</span> <span id="s2760">Completely.</span> <span id="s2761">I didnít want even to get a job where girls were working because I couldnít handle it.</span> <span id="s2762">It was very-- I took shorthand in high school in Williamsport, and I had to drop it because all the girls were in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">JF: You were in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">MT: In high school.</span> <span id="s2765">When I came here I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">JF: So you were in Williamsport, Pennsylvania?</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">MT: Yes, thatís where my parents are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">JF: And thatís when you were put really for the first time in a typical adolescent atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">MT: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2770">I never went to our high school prom; I didnít want to ask a girl and the girls would ask me and I just couldnít do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">JF: It was not until you were out of the service, after high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">MT: Yes, after the service then I started learning something about myself.</span> <span id="s2773">It was, I think, the service probably that did open up my mind.</span> <span id="s2774">I had exposure to the weapons and everything and started even hating that part of the life, perhaps, weapons, in the service because I had so much of it in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">JF: Iím sorry, instead of hating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">MT: Then I perhaps started to hate some of it, I mean, the weapons itself, but, nevertheless, when I did come home I did reach that point where I bought myself a pistol to fulfill my need, and it did.</span> <span id="s2777">It fulfilled my need very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">JF: Did you enlist in the service after high school?</span> <span id="s2779">Was that something you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">MT: I joke around that there were 20 volunteers that left my neighborhood that morning.</span> <span id="s2781">There was I and 20 MPís.</span> <span id="s2782">No, I did enlist.</span> <span id="s2783">And, I had a weird experience in the military.</span> <span id="s2784">There was one German fellow straight from Germany.</span> <span id="s2785">Couldnít speak English too well yet.</span> <span id="s2786">He was in my company, and on the maneuvers, he happened to be in back of me and I ordered him in front of me and I said, "You will never again be in back of me with a weapon."</span> <span id="s2787">And I felt very bad about that.</span> <span id="s2788">He never asked for an explanation, but I did reflect on that many times later on and said to myself, "Why did you do that?"</span> <span id="s2789">Because, I guess, I couldnít control it.</span> <span id="s2790">I couldnít stand a German right in back of me with a weapon.</span> <span id="s2791">Yet here I was in the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">JF: But you still were fighting old battles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">MT: I also told them later on that I was sorry for that but donít ever send me to Germany.</span> <span id="s2794">Send me any place in the world as a soldier.</span> <span id="s2795">Donít send me to Germany, because I will not be able to control myself.</span> <span id="s2796">You donít want to do that and I donít want to do that.</span> <span id="s2797">Later on I got sick and tired of stateside duties, being in the States.</span> <span id="s2798">Everybody was going all over the world and here I am.</span> <span id="s2799">I asked to be sent to Germany, but they would not do it.</span> <span id="s2800">So finally I pressed for it, pressed for it.</span> <span id="s2801">They took out my papers.</span> <span id="s2802">They read a little statement.</span> <span id="s2803">"Turzanski, this is what you said," so I was never sent out, and Iím glad I wasnít because I would have probably done something that I shouldnít have.</span> <span id="s2804">Try to as an adult to undo something that I shouldnít try to undo, because people that I would do to would be the people who actually had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">JF: Is there anything else that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">MT: The only thing that I would like to add is that hatred is the worst thing in our lives.</span> <span id="s2807">Hatred should never be put into childrenís minds because it will destroy, even when it comes to the enemy.</span> <span id="s2808">They should be taught about the enemy, but not actually how to hate them, only what he is.</span> <span id="s2809">I feel quite comfortable with my parents and I still give them credit, more and more credit each time I read something about psychology of the human behavior and so forth; how well they handled that.</span> <span id="s2810">They removed that hatred from us.</span> <span id="s2811">I know what Ukrainians did to us.</span> <span id="s2812">I know what Germans did to us.</span> <span id="s2813">But it happened at that time.</span> <span id="s2814">It does not mean that all of them did that to me, that all of them wanted to do it, etc.</span> <span id="s2815">We made a pledge, all four of us, when we were liberated in Neumark, that we will take 120 Ukrainian lives before we are dead, because we lost all our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">JF: All the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">MT: Yes, during the war.</span> <span id="s2818">All the cousins-- all wiped out.</span> <span id="s2819">We donít have anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">JF: These were people who stayed in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">MT: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2822">And they were executed: one, because he was suspected to be an underground soldier, young man, my cousinís brother.</span> <span id="s2823">She still cries about it.</span> <span id="s2824">And they were also talking about that she married a Jewish guy to save his life.</span> <span id="s2825">She was Catholic and there was a lot of it going on just like anyplace else when things were happening fast.</span> <span id="s2826">I donít believe the women were taking advantage of the situation, but I think also that they felt that they could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">JF: You knew of other cases like that, where Polish girls would marry Jewish men to save them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">MT: Yes, to save them.</span> <span id="s2829">Now, also...</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">JF: Did they stay married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">MT: Yes, this is very strong.</span> <span id="s2832">It is unreal, what happens.</span> <span id="s2833">When you make a bind like that, when you sign a contract like that, a mental contract, I donít think that there is much that can break after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">JF: Did they stay living in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">MT: Oh no.</span> <span id="s2836">They are in New York, in a Jewish community, where they feel comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">JF: They live in a Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">MT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">JF: Did she stay Catholic or did she convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">MT: She didnít stay much one way or the other because she probably didnít care, but her husband, a Jewish fellow she married, wanted to make sure that their daughter will be a Catholic child.</span> <span id="s2841">So, it is actually, thatís a big sacrifice for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">JF: They have one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">MT: Only one child.</span> <span id="s2844">But it was, I think, because of the old man, Mr. [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">JF: Her father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">MT: His father.</span> <span id="s2847">He wanted to make sure that he never leaves this woman, no matter what, even if she loses her mind or whatever, because what she had done for us, for them, and make sure that her child will be protected if he dies later on.</span> <span id="s2848">Tremendous individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">JF: His father told him to raise his child as a Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">MT: Yes.</span> <span id="s2851">And his father...</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">JF: As a way of thanking her for her sacrifices?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">MT: It is sad, you know, when you really think about it, from a human point of view.</span> <span id="s2854">Those are tremendous sacrifices that one does to pay-- you donít pay-- to thank, and I donít even know if thank is the word.</span> <span id="s2855">ëCause she wanted a man and she had a man, but I think itís that other side, his side, that he feels that he should do something, which is another part of being human.</span> <span id="s2856">Now, what really hurts individual like I-- I went through rough things in my life and enjoyed some good times here-- is what I read about Polish behavior in Second World War, where we are worse than Hitler is, in the eyes of the Jewish community, at least I was told that, and there must be reasons for it.</span> <span id="s2857">But then I also did the same thing as you do.</span> <span id="s2858">I also want to reach in and look for answers, because I donít want to build on old tradition.</span> <span id="s2859">I want to build on something I have here.</span> <span id="s2860">And I had a map that I thought I could find and bring it in here of Poland during the Second World War.</span> <span id="s2861">Itís like a map of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s2862">If you would take a pepper shaker and shake it over the map, some places the more pepper would fall than others.</span> <span id="s2863">The whole Poland was one concentration country for Germany, and under each black spot on that map they tell you how many people were murdered, murdered, murdered.</span> <span id="s2864">And then they show bigger spots, and the chimneys where they formed the camps, and how many died there.</span> <span id="s2865">The whole country was totally taken over, terrorized, dehumanized and everything.</span> <span id="s2866">Minorities were given big roles, and also the criminal element was given big roles.</span> <span id="s2867">But I am not a historian, but I just know what I went through and itís tough.</span> <span id="s2868">But, of course, itís always tough if itís sad about you.</span> <span id="s2869">That, again, is human.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">I want to thank you for the opportunity to talk to you.</span> <span id="s2871">By doing this, I think Iíll be a better person.</span> <span id="s2872">I hope I can sleep better, and this is selfish of me and I hope Iíll free myself to become one of you, to freely think and act as one should in the proper manner in a given situation.</span> <span id="s2873">Sometimes I feel I am lacking a whole lot to reach the level of the free society.</span> <span id="s2874">Thank God for a free society and letís hope, pray and hope this will never, never occur again, because if it happens in midst of your own, people that you know, people you had contact with, people you touched, you talked to, itís very hard to remove from your memory, from your mind, but, yet, as a human, intelligent human, you donít want to spread a disease of hatred.</span> <span id="s2875">That makes it much tougher to control that feeling.</span> <span id="s2876">I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">JF: I cannot thank you enough, Mr. Turzanski.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">The Germans began their occupation of Hungary in March

the story about Goldreich [phonetic] being hidden in our house.</span> <span id="s4258">It was not during the German occupation, because we were out of it.</span> <span id="s4259">\par }{\plain \tab

was quite successful dealing with certain things: not selling arms or anything like that, it was some kind of a business deal-- sugar, horses, and things like that.</span> <span id="s4266">Normal

either at that church or in a German church that we were baptized, but I think that it was in the Ukrainian church, because they made some kind of deal that, as long as you didn\'92t have your own, it\'92s the same deal if you go to theirs; it\'92s a Russian Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s4305">As far as with Jewish families, I remember around Christmastime they would come to our house.</span> <span id="s4306">We had a post office--when I say a post office there was always only one post office in a territory, and, of course, they have the big landowners, which one, I don\'92t

not a rabbi--but he had the right to give weddings to Jewish individuals, and he had all those other rights that they needed in that territory as a religious group.</span> <span id="s4309">He would come to visit us, but I think it was only to show us his concern for our holiday, the way I see it now.</span> <span id="s4310">Because why would he stop into our house when there was preparation

<span id="s4317">I did not have a chance when I went up for my father\'92s birthday that I could talk about it.</span> <span id="s4318">It was such a short time, and we just talked about what we went

<span id="s4369">Because later on I heard stories that they were machine gunning the cabbage patches because it looked like organized army or something.</span> <span id="s4370">They were in rows, and

the morning, the dog started to bark something terrible outside.</span> <span id="s4397">We didn\'92t have dogs inside the house, only outside.</span> <span id="s4398">It was to protect the house from the wolves and the strangers, I guess.</span> <span id="s4399">He was on a chain, and then I heard some kind of yelling, screaming, and the dog did not bark anymore.</span> <span id="s4400">Then my
