id="s15">ANSWER: 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Where are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born in Enschede (ph?)</span> <span id="s18">, a small town in eastern Holland, close to the German border.</span> <span id="s19">Then my family moved to too bigger</span></p> <p><span id="s20">villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Where there any Jewish people in these towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: There must have been but I never noticed any distinction between Jews and other people.</span> <span id="s23">I had Jewish friends without being aware of any difference about them.</span> <span id="s24">Religion didn't matter in my family.</span> <span id="s25">My parents told me it didn't matter to them.</span> <span id="s26">For some people it became an issue because of marriage but that was not the case in my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What religion were your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My mother and father were both Protestants.</span> <span id="s29">But my mother didn't impose religion on her children.</span> <span id="s30">She didn't believe that people necessarily had to belong to a religion or that God would punish those who didn't go to church.</span> <span id="s31">When I was nineteen my mother died of cancer.</span> <span id="s32">My little sister was only nine at the time.</span> <span id="s33">I was very close to my mother and I still quote her every day.</span> <span id="s34">Shortly after her death I spent eighteen months in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What was your father like?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My father was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s37">His family was descended from the old Fresian (ph) nobility.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">0:15:0/0812.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">In 1933 I married my husband but I remember Knowing about the nazis in 1927 because my mother's sister had married a German - a German, not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s40">We had heard something about riots in Germany and about the Germans wanting revenge for loosing the war.</span> <span id="s41">We also heard about anti-Semitism and slurs against Jews.</span> <span id="s42">Also inflation was terrible...people had to go to the bank twice a day.</span> <span id="s43">( Mrs. Hilsum's husband adds this last comment) People's money was not worth</span></p> <p><span id="s44">anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: That was in the twenties?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">The Germans didn't like the Dutch.</span> <span id="s48">They called us cheese heads and thought that we were all rich.</span> <span id="s49">My husband was schooled in Amsterdam and held several jobs there.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">There he got the feeling that the Dutch didn't think much of the</span></p> <p><span id="s51">German's either.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: We were both living in Amsterdam and we were both very lonesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">There was never any objection to our marriage.</span> <span id="s55">The fact that I was to have a Jewish husband was not an issue for my father.</span> <span id="s56">I was twenty two and he was twenty five when we were married.</span> <span id="s57">After we were married for a while I went to England and France to work as an au pair for a Jewish family with two little children.</span> <span id="s58">The father was Danish and the mother Jewish.</span> <span id="s59">At the time I didn't know that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s60">They left for Mexico and I went back home to be</span></p> <p><span id="s61">with my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">At this time the war was getting worse and once back in Holland I wrote letters to officials in my government expressing my concern over the events in Germany that I was hearing of.</span> <span id="s63">The government took no notice and things got even worse.</span> <span id="s64">After a while it goes too far and you can't control it.</span> <span id="s65">It's tragic when no one takes notice</span></p> <p><span id="s66">of the signs...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Do you see any similarity between today and the time before the</span></p> <p><span id="s68">War?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No.</span> <span id="s70">Things were much more quiet.</span> <span id="s71">A different world.</span> <span id="s72">My husband's father was a doctor and he rode on horseback to visit his patients.</span> <span id="s73">But in some ways things are similar because even today the Government ignores the problems that trouble the country.</span> <span id="s74">The poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did you get any responses to your letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A:The responses to my letters before the war were always "Don't Worry".</span> <span id="s77">It was incredible; I received the same line right up until the night the Germans invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">(Husband: I remember seeing Germans in trucks out my window.</span> <span id="s79">We could see them because our house was on the main street.)</span> <span id="s80">Yes, that's true.</span> <span id="s81">And they didn't even know that they were in Holland.</span> <span id="s82">They thought that they were in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did you already have children at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes we did.</span> <span id="s85">We have three children.</span> <span id="s86">The first was born in 1934, then 1938, and 1949.</span> <span id="s87">I was very scared for my family.</span> <span id="s88">I love my children very much and I am especially fond of the youngest.</span> <span id="s89">She was a "present" and I consider her "new" because she was not tainted by the War.</span> <span id="s90">At the same time that we were so frightened we knew that a lot of German Jews were still not immediately worried</span></p> <p><span id="s91">about the deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">0:33:0/1825 It was in 1941 while on a weekend trip that the threat became real.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">While we were gone we were sent a message from home warning us not to return.</span> <span id="s94">We were told that the Germans had gone to get the Jews that worked in my husband's factory.</span> <span id="s95">When we got back the Germans were gathering up the jews and giving them one hours notice.</span> <span id="s96">This time they just took the young men living near the German border but upon our return the mayor of the village phoned the SS to inform them that my husband was back.</span> <span id="s97">He was spared because his status was different as a Jew in a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s98">They said they'd get him next time.</span> <span id="s99">I had to prove my christian blood line.</span> <span id="s100">I didn't want to do it but I has to for the children.</span> <span id="s101">So my husband was forced to wear the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s102">There was also an eight o'clock curfew imposed and it was decreed that all jews were forbidden all means of transportation including even a bicycle.</span> <span id="s103">My husband had to walk to work every day and back as well.</span> <span id="s104">It was a very long distance.</span> <span id="s105">Other new anti-semitic laws were enacted.</span> <span id="s106">At least the children were not forced to wear stars because they're mother was</span></p> <p><span id="s107">christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">At this time I started visiting all the jews who were confined to their homes.</span> <span id="s109">I would hear the news on the radio and my acquaintance with someone in the underground also furnished me with news that I could then circulate to all those in hiding.</span> <span id="s110">I was trusted by the jews in the community because my husband was Jewish and I had a lot of Jewish friends for whom I would do things.</span> <span id="s111">One of the things I helped with was the production and distributing of ration cards and false identification cards for the young Dutch boys who were being sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s112">I also hid Jews and other non Jews who were wanted by the SS.</span> <span id="s113">I hid them in my house.</span> <span id="s114">I also had to find three different houses for my mother in law to hide in.</span> <span id="s115">But every time she came back to my house.</span> <span id="s116">She said she couldn't live without her family.</span> <span id="s117">Finally she gave up and at sixty three she was taken to the camp.</span> <span id="s118">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s119">There were new born babies, sick people and old people.</span> <span id="s120">All they wanted was to be able to stay together.</span> <span id="s121">It remains as clear as a photograph in my mind.</span> <span id="s122">At the first place she was taken to which was still within the Dutch border, we tried to prove that she was Christian but it didn't work.</span> <span id="s123">After that I had no idea of her whereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">1:03:00/2500.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Then I started making parcels for members of my husband's family.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">These were parcels made for people going to a special camp in Holland that was reserved for prominent Jews.</span> <span id="s127">For instance, one of my husband's relatives who was also of a mixed marriage, was a member of Parliament.</span> <span id="s128">He was a protected Jew because he was a</span></p> <p><span id="s129">prominent person.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">During this time my husband was still at home but then it became necessary that we travel to Amsterdam in order to obtain a temporary permit which would allow him to stay at home.</span> <span id="s131">There was a policeman, a Dutch Nazi with whom we had to deal.</span> <span id="s132">On the way to Amsterdam my husband was not allowed to sit on the train.</span> <span id="s133">By March 1943 the special permit card was not enough to keep him exempt.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">He would be deported if he didn't go into hiding.</span> <span id="s135">At this time young non-Jews as well as mixed marriage people were put into hiding.</span> <span id="s136">The non-Jews were hiding to escape compulsory labor in Germany.</span> <span id="s137">The SS were not actively looking for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">In my house I hid two boys, a whole family, and another Jewish woman whose family had been sent to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s139">My house was especially difficult because of its location on the main road.</span> <span id="s140">It acted as an intermediate station from where people would stop until safer hiding places became available in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Anyone who looked very characteristically Jewish couldn't stay too long.</span> <span id="s142">Of course I always thought that it was impossible to tell who was who anyway so I found this stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Meanwhile my husband was moving around from house to house himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">2735.</span> <span id="s145">HUSBAND: I remember one very frightening encounter with two SS officers.</span> <span id="s146">I was hiding at this woman's house and one day while she was out running an errand I saw the SS through the living room window.</span> <span id="s147">I thought that they had seen me inside the house so that when they rang the doorbell I had to let them in order not to seem suspect.</span> <span id="s148">They asked me what I was doing in the house and I replied that I was a friend of the woman whose house it was.</span> <span id="s149">I explained that I had been visiting her and that she had to leave quickly.</span> <span id="s150">I remember it being very cold that day and that was what ended up saving me.</span> <span id="s151">Because of the cold I was wearing my coat in the house when the officers made their inquiry.</span> <span id="s152">Seeing my coat convinced them that I had intentions to leave the woman's home BACK TO MRS. HILSUM: That night he walked all the way home in the dark.</span> <span id="s153">I was shocked at how close he had come to being taken.</span> <span id="s154">After he went into hiding I took Jews into my house.</span> <span id="s155">I could do it because my house was very old and there are places to hide people.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">There was no attic.</span> <span id="s157">In stead there was a space between the top floor and the roof where people could lie without being discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Why were you willing to do all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s160">It wasn't ever really a decision I made.</span> <span id="s161">It just happened.</span> <span id="s162">I just welcomed them, What else could I do?</span> <span id="s163">The first people I hid were in their thirties.</span> <span id="s164">Later there were younger ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you hide any children?</span> <span id="s166">Where you ever scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Once I was.</span> <span id="s168">With the last people I was hiding .</span> <span id="s169">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">They had been hiding in a place where arms(fire arms?)</span> <span id="s171">were dropped.</span> <span id="s172">The SS were looking for these places and the people hiding there had to leave.</span> <span id="s173">They were forced to hide in a haystack.</span> <span id="s174">A bucket and some food was all that they were given.</span> <span id="s175">They came to me in February when my husband was hiding in a place that was a long bicycle ride away.</span> <span id="s176">One time on my way to visit him I slid on the ice and broke my leg.</span> <span id="s177">I still went to see him though.</span> <span id="s178">I had to.</span> <span id="s179">.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">1:13:30/3360.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Can you tell us something about the people you hid?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I don't like telling some of their stories because some of the survivors are still alive and I don't Want to hurt them.</span> <span id="s183">There is one couple with whom I'm still in contact.</span> <span id="s184">They never come to</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">They were young when they came to hide in my house.</span> <span id="s187">They were very scared and the husband broke down.</span> <span id="s188">He couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s189">I felt very bad for him.</span> <span id="s190">I never cried during the war though.</span> <span id="s191">There was too much to do.</span> <span id="s192">Someone had to take care of things like this man who could not stop laughing.</span> <span id="s193">I knew that there was something funny going on in his head and luckily I could handle him because I had some exposure to psychiatry.</span> <span id="s194">I was able to understand that he was just reacting to his fear.</span> <span id="s195">I had to feed him because he would not eat and he didn't want his wife or his two boys to care for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">His behavior was very strange.</span> <span id="s197">He walked out onto the balcony naked.</span> <span id="s198">He was jumping around and shouting "murderers, murderers!</span> <span id="s199">I want to give up.</span> <span id="s200">I want to escape."</span> <span id="s201">I had to lock him up because he was endangering himself and the others in hiding.</span> <span id="s202">He would try to run away and I would have to chase after him on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s203">I had a psychiatrist friend come see him but there was little for anyone to do.</span> <span id="s204">He was acting wild and he escaped .</span> <span id="s205">Everyone thought that I was mad chasing him around.</span> <span id="s206">I finally found him in the middle of the country.</span> <span id="s207">He told me that he was going to report me to the police for locking him up.</span> <span id="s208">Luckily the kind owners of a nearby farm understood the situation and called a trustworthy policeman to convince the man to go with me.</span> <span id="s209">Meanwhile there were bombs exploding in the meadows surrounding us.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">We were lucky a second time when the man ran into the police station still accusing me of wanting to lock him up because another good policeman told him to go back with me .</span> <span id="s211">He was not a Nazi but there were Nazi police in the station and one of them figured out what was going on.</span> <span id="s212">At this point I was sure that everything was lost.</span> <span id="s213">This Nazi told me that I would be shot and I replied that it was my business what I did.</span> <span id="s214">He warned me again and I was very scared because I was thinking of the children and all the others in the house.</span> <span id="s215">He came back with information about my family and I and warned me again.</span> <span id="s216">He shouted out that "this man is not an evacuee but a Jew!"</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">At this point the good policeman took me aside and told me that he would help us.</span> <span id="s219">I understood that he was offering this favor at a critical time.</span> <span id="s220">It was only three weeks before the liberation and he thought that once the war was over I might return a favor to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">1:30:00/4040.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Anyway they took him to a hospital and placed him in a padded cell.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">he ran away again, refusing to stay locked up.</span> <span id="s224">Somehow we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">We knew that the Canadians were near.</span> <span id="s226">We were liberated by the English.</span> <span id="s227">It took three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: How were your children affected by all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: They emerged from the war virtually undamaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What about yourself?</span> <span id="s231">What kind of psychological aftermath have</span></p> <p><span id="s232">you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: The war is with me every night.</span> <span id="s234">During the day I'm distracted with daily responsibilities but at night the war comes back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Why do you think you had the strength to do what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It wasn't that much.</span> <span id="s237">There were many people who did a lot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Were you honored at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: By the Dutch Government but not by Israel.</span> <span id="s240">But there is a tree planted for me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Did your children ever say anything to you about the risks you took during the War?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">2:35:00/4343.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No but other people did.</span> <span id="s244">I was accused by many Dutch of being foolish and endangering the lives of my husband and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Do you remember feeling traumatized by the Nurenburg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I remember them.</span> <span id="s247">I would think about it at night.</span> <span id="s248">I started having nightmares in 1972.</span> <span id="s249">I was ambivalent about the Nazis coming home.</span> <span id="s250">I don't hate all Germans though.</span> <span id="s251">I even think that some tiny amount of good came out of those years during the war.</span> <span id="s252">Eternal friends were made and trust was built by those who went through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">I just wish I could have saved my mother in law.</span> <span id="s254">She was the only one I lost.</span> <span id="s255">During the war my sister's support was critical.</span> <span id="s256">It enabled me to help others.</span> <span id="s257">Altruism has always been a feature of my personality, at times even a weakness.</span> <span id="s258">I've brought my own children up with the same values.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Why did so many people not help?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: They were scared to death or they were occupied with more urgent needs like surviving in hard times.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">2:20:00 My husband's first years of hiding were awful.</span> <span id="s262">He was alone all day in a tiny space above someone's kitchen and he couldn't make any noise while the housekeeper worked below.</span> <span id="s263">It was also incredibly cold.</span> <span id="s264">His next hiding place was at a mill in the country which gave him much more freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Why was he hiding at other houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: It was better that people believed he had been sent to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Not all the Germans were bad.</span> <span id="s268">Many helped Jews across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">the Nazis I hated the most were the Dutch ones since they were my</span></p> <p><span id="s270">own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Are you in touch with any of the people you saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s273">With some.</span> <span id="s274">One woman told me that after the war, When she crossed the border, no one was there to meet her.</span> <span id="s275">I really blame the Dutch for this behavior.</span> <span id="s276">It happened to others as well and one man has written a book about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: How many people did you save?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Eight were saved and many more went through my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">.</span> <span id="s280">END.</span></p></body></html>
