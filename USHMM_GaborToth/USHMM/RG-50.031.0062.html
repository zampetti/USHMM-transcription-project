father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father was a shoe merchant and my mother was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">01:00:01:14</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What was your home life like?</span> <span id="s22">Was it religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I came from a religious family.</span> <span id="s24">My parents were very observant.</span> <span id="s25">About half the population of our town (5000 people) were Jewish and most that I knew were fairly observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did your father wear a beard?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: He wore a short little beard with the traditional head covering, a kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Your grandparents, did they live in the proximity?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My grandparents lived in our town and as I understand it the family has lived there for several hundred years.</span> <span id="s30">I remember my grandparents very distinctly.</span> <span id="s31">My grandfather was a very orthodox man and my grandmother always wore a long skirt down to the ankles.</span> <span id="s32">They had a store in the town center where they sold shoes at retail to the farmers from the surrounding countryside who came to the marketplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">01:00:03:15</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q:What type of schools did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: I went to public grade school for seven years from the ages of 7 to age 14.</span> <span id="s36">Classes lasted from 8a.</span> <span id="s37">m. until 1 p.m.</span> <span id="s38">When I finished public school I went to a religious oriented school where at first classes lasted until 6 p.m.</span> <span id="s39">As I matured to the age of 10 or 11, classes lasted until 9 p.m.</span> <span id="s40">We got a half hour recess at 6 p.m.</span> <span id="s41">Our house was walking distance to the school.</span> <span id="s42">The Hebrew school was a very modern mitzraki (ph.) school where the teachers came from out of town and had graduated from schools of Jewish learning.</span> <span id="s43">Classes were usually in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">01:00:04:55</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: When you were in the public school you were with non-Jewish children?</span> <span id="s46">Did you have feelings of antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I went to school with non-Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s48">Until fourth grade it was an all-male school.</span> <span id="s49">With the fifth-class it was coeducational.</span> <span id="s50">It started at 8 a.m. with a Catholic prayer where everyone had to stand, but the Jewish kids were exempt from saying the prayer.</span> <span id="s51">The teacher kept a cross and a crucifix at the front of her desk.</span> <span id="s52">Antisemitism was part of the school system.</span> <span id="s53">Teachers were engrained with the annoying of the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s54">School then was a six-day proposition.</span> <span id="s55">The Jewish children would not go to school on Saturday for religious reasons, but we had to make up the program on Sunday.</span> <span id="s56">Teachers and students made fun of the Jewish children because of their Jewishness.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">01:00:07:31</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What is the most cherished memory you have from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: The house of my grandparents always had a strain of Zionism.</span> <span id="s60">I remember marching from school on Lag BaOmer between the holidays of Passover and Shavout on an outing.</span> <span id="s61">I looked forward to this outing very much.</span> <span id="s62">My second cherished memory is that on Huf (ph.) Tammuz, that is twenty days into the Hebrew month of Tammuz, we marched to the synagogue for a memorial service in honor of Theodore Herzel, the father of political Zionism.</span> <span id="s63">This was back in 1926 or 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: How did things begin to change in 1938 and 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: The government of Poland was considered in foreign countries to be a dictatorial government.</span> <span id="s66">I didn't realize this at the time, probably because I was too young.</span> <span id="s67">The real change began with the death of Pilsusky (ph.) who was favorable to the Jews and a socialist.</span> <span id="s68">Then came to power those who were antisemitic and who looked forward to a way of getting rid of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s69">They propagandized not to buy from the Jewish stores but this was how the Jews earned their living.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">01:00:10:51</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: When did you first become aware of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: When I came of age, like 11 or 12, I joined a Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s73">I heard threats that I would be expelled from school for being political at such a young age.</span> <span id="s74">But I was not afraid because I had an uncle on the Education Committee.</span> <span id="s75">Going back to the Nazis, the war started on Friday, September 1.</span> <span id="s76">We didn't really have radios in the town but there was one in the bookstore which we all huddled around.</span> <span id="s77">We heard that the war had begun and that the Germans had attacked towns on the Western border.</span> <span id="s78">On the third day they began to bombard certain places and sent spies to convince the people that the war was lost and to give up.</span> <span id="s79">On Tuesday, September 5 our town police shot into the air at German planes, which provoked them to drop several bombs on out town, destroying three buildings and those families.</span> <span id="s80">My grandfather went out to see what had happened and he just dropped dead.</span> <span id="s81">The bombardment continued and we had to leave the town for safety, but my grandmother would not leave the body because of Jewish law that says that you must stay with the body until burial.</span> <span id="s82">We tried to convince her but she wouldn't leave.</span> <span id="s83">We left for a while but came back to town even though the bombardment continued.</span> <span id="s84">We got a horse and buggy and brought the body first to the synagogue and then to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s85">The attendant was afraid to bury him, but agreed to watch him.</span> <span id="s86">Our tradition says that you should bury the dead on the same day or the following day but this took three or four days.</span> <span id="s87">By the eighth or ninth day of the war, the Germans arrived in our town.</span> <span id="s88">I was surprised that they talked to their horses in German.</span> <span id="s89">They all gathered in the marketplace.</span> <span id="s90">If they saw a Jewish man they would cut off his beard and injure him too.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">01:00:16:37</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What was your first encounter with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: It was much later.</span> <span id="s94">They gave out laws of how the town should govern itself.</span> <span id="s95">They sent the mayor away to Auschwitz, probably because he was a member of the Underground.</span> <span id="s96">Because I was a part of the Zionist Youth League, we gathered in the woods to plan some sort of resistance.</span> <span id="s97">We said that if there was no way out, we should at least through bottles with some sort of poisonous water to blind them.</span> <span id="s98">Someone in the town told the German-oriented police that we were meeting there.</span> <span id="s99">After that no one met there anymore.</span> <span id="s100">Life was restricted in movement and food.</span> <span id="s101">Religious services kept in family circles at home.</span> <span id="s102">We held services morning and evening at an uncle's house for 11 months to recite Kaddish (ph.) prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Was your family still intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A:Everything was still intact, except that movement was very limited.</span> <span id="s105">My father's shoe business was conducted basically to people out of town.</span> <span id="s106">He was afraid to continue these transactions so I was sent to various cities to sell the shoes.</span> <span id="s107">In July, my feet were cold.</span> <span id="s108">He'll remember this event in 1940 forever.</span> <span id="s109">I traveled 40-60 miles, returned in same day.</span> <span id="s110">Shoe products were very limited and very expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">01:00:21:34</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: When was your family first separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: They first established a ghetto in 1942; Jews couldn't leave ghetto.</span> <span id="s114">My brother and I had to ship shoes through the post office, sending them C.O.D. and picking up money at post office.</span> <span id="s115">We had to go through non-Jewish ghetto by chasing each other as if playing a game.</span> <span id="s116">This is how we got to the post office through 1941.</span> <span id="s117">They organized a Judenrat and demanded labor constantly to make Jews work and disgrace them.</span> <span id="s118">In 1941 they asked for 250,000 dollars or they would punish the city.</span> <span id="s119">It was very hard to make money.</span> <span id="s120">Once we got it, they asked for more.</span> <span id="s121">There were rumors for such time about a resettlement of the Jews in eastern Europe but it didn't materialize.</span> <span id="s122">The first pogrom I heard of was in a city on the other side of the Vistula called Miades (ph.), population 10,000.</span> <span id="s123">It was a prosperous town.</span> <span id="s124">In one day they slaughtered 1,800 Jews and brought them to the famous cemetery of Burlichra (ph.) This was first action against the Jews in Poland; this was in 1942.</span> <span id="s125">A few people escaped to our town; a family named Kuntz came to live with us.</span> <span id="s126">Our family had 5 people.</span> <span id="s127">They spread rumors of a resettlement; so our family escaped to the woods.</span> <span id="s128">When nothing materialized we came back.</span> <span id="s129">One day they came to camp, announcing people could go work at Skowshutzo (ph.), a munitions factory.</span> <span id="s130">Many went but I did not like the idea.</span> <span id="s131">A nephew of the Kuntz family was an assistant to the head engineer of the Umler company that was building a road to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s132">The sons of this family were living with German engineers near Medetz (ph.) My brother, my sister, I, and my two cousins gathered with 10 others on a Sunday night in October to escape to this camp.</span> <span id="s133">Arrangements were made to drive us across the Vistula on barges.</span> <span id="s134">We marched all night.</span> <span id="s135">It was a clear night when we crossed the river.</span> <span id="s136">On the other side, a man arranged for a barn with hot water for us.</span> <span id="s137">In the morning, we marched to the camp.</span> <span id="s138">This was west of our home town.</span> <span id="s139">The head of the Volksdeutsche, a Pole of German descent came out with several dogs and was very rude to us.</span> <span id="s140">After a day without food, we were allowed into the camp.</span> <span id="s141">We were all allowed to work except for my brother who they felt was too young.</span> <span id="s142">To be inside the camp during work hours was dangerous because the SS came there often.</span> <span id="s143">On November 11 he was accepted and allowed to work.</span> <span id="s144">We were building an Autoban through the woods to the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">01:00:33:38</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So how were you treated in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Work started at 5 a.m.</span> <span id="s148">We dynamited the trees in the woods and made a base for the road.</span> <span id="s149">This lasted for quite a while.</span> <span id="s150">This was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s151">A few people got very sick; they didn't know it was typhus.</span> <span id="s152">The two sons of the family who stayed with me got very sick; the SS came for them the next day.</span> <span id="s153">They took them out into the woods and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: How long were you and your brother in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: We were in the camp until 1943.</span> <span id="s156">In 1943 they liquidated this camp.</span> <span id="s157">The older workers disappeared through hunger etc.</span> <span id="s158">We were transferee to a factory that made airplane parts, located in the same area.</span> <span id="s159">There were barracks there.</span> <span id="s160">The treatment here was more harsh.</span> <span id="s161">It was under the jurisdiction of the SS.</span> <span id="s162">I was assigned to work in the factory where they assembled the back wing of the plane with an electric hammer.</span> <span id="s163">They were short of material.</span> <span id="s164">Often we were put to work for two continuous shifts.</span> <span id="s165">At night I had to stencil a machine.</span> <span id="s166">I fell asleep with my hand on the machine and it caught my hand.</span> <span id="s167">I ran back to the camp and was treated by a Jewish female physician named Bikerai (ph) who was from Cracow.</span> <span id="s168">She treated me, putting on a leather cover so it could not be seen that I had lost fingers.</span> <span id="s169">I went back to work.</span> <span id="s170">There were various means of punishment in the camp, to let one hang by his arms for half a day, to whip him on his bare behind, to deny him food for a couple days.</span> <span id="s171">I was very sick; but they called us to the gathering place.</span> <span id="s172">My brother had to support me.</span> <span id="s173">If I had been seen to be weak, I would arrive that same day at Berderoff (ph), the cemetery.</span> <span id="s174">There was a hospital.</span> <span id="s175">If you were there longer then a day or two, you were eliminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">01:00:40:50</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What kind of food were you given there?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A:We were given coffee (not real) in the morning, soup at noon, a piece of bread for dinner.</span> <span id="s179">On Sunday there was a piece of margarine too.</span> <span id="s180">One day they had a soup made of horsemeat.</span> <span id="s181">Although I was very hungry, I could not eat it.</span> <span id="s182">Sometimes we worked on Sunday; otherwise there was a day off.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: How long were you in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I was there until the end of 1943.</span> <span id="s185">My parents were in our town when there was the resettling.</span> <span id="s186">The day before the resettling, they ran into the woods and that’s where they lived.</span> <span id="s187">My mother got pneumonia; so they had to surrender to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s188">From there they were probably sent to Treblinka or something.</span> <span id="s189">They were in the woods from November until the middle of March.</span> <span id="s190">My sister was in a camp near us called Fischer (ph.) She worked on drying the marshes, but got sick.</span> <span id="s191">We tried to arrange to get her back to our home town.</span> <span id="s192">She was shot crossing the bridge on the border but not killed.</span> <span id="s193">From there I don't know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So now you are in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: My brother and I were together.</span> <span id="s196">They loaded us on trains, saying we were going to the salt mines, but in reality we were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s197">In Auschwitz, there was an order not to derail.</span> <span id="s198">We went back to Plasha (ph.) for two or three days.</span> <span id="s199">There was a massacre there; the SS were shooting people angrily and randomly.</span> <span id="s200">Many in my transport lost their lives.</span> <span id="s201">We were sent back to the Vischtka (ph.), but we stayed there only for a day.</span> <span id="s202">There we all got new striped uniforms and caps.</span> <span id="s203">We had been tattooed earlier with a KL (Konstat Lager ph) They had us in rows of four.</span> <span id="s204">If one misses, all four shot.</span> <span id="s205">We were all marched to train.</span> <span id="s206">Everything was closed in, 70-80 to a train.</span> <span id="s207">It was July and the heat was unbearable.</span> <span id="s208">We were brought Germany; it took 7-10 days.</span> <span id="s209">There was a bucket of water for all to share per day and a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s210">Finally we arrived at Floss (ph), a small town in Bavaria near the Czech border.</span> <span id="s211">From there we were taken to Flossenberg (ph.) To give you some background on Flossenberg, it was a notorious concentration camp.</span> <span id="s212">Hundreds of thousands of people had lost their lives there.</span> <span id="s213">There were many political inmates.</span> <span id="s214">As you entered the camp was the phrase, Work will redeem you.</span> <span id="s215">We were counted as if each of us was a diamond.</span> <span id="s216">The place looked like a resort; it was clean and beautiful.</span> <span id="s217">We sat down, but the heat was unbearable, maybe 110 degrees.</span> <span id="s218">An SS doctor had examined us and marked a red number on our foreheads.</span> <span id="s219">I get a number two.</span> <span id="s220">The nights got very cold.</span> <span id="s221">In the morning our heads were shaved, with a mark on our forehead.</span> <span id="s222">My brother and I were placed in different barracks.</span> <span id="s223">Our numbers were 16,971 and 16,972.</span> <span id="s224">We were assigned to work at the messerschmidt; the headquarters was in Plessenberg (ph.)
