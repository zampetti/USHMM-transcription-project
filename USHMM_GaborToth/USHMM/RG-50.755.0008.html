could start, Dr. Tepper, by just stating your name and spelling it for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Well, my name is, uh, Erwin Tepper, and it's E-r-w-i-n and then T-e-p-p-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Okay.</span> <span id="s6">And you were born where, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">I was born in Vienna, and I was born in November 14, 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Okay.</span> <span id="s9">I'd like to start, and realizing, of course, how young you were at the time, but I'm interested, Dr. Tepper, in what kinds of memories, if any, you have of your family and your family life as a young boy in Vienna prior to your coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">00:01:31 Yes, as I said, I was [clear throat] born in Vienna and my parents, uh, my parents actually came to Vienna from Poland because my father wanted to study at the university to become an accountant, and in Poland he was not admitted to the university, so he came to Vienna.</span> <span id="s11">We had a fairly large family in Vienna, mainly my father's family, and, uh, what I do remember, although I was a relatively youngster, we lived in a nice apartment, uh, up on the third floor, as I recall.</span> <span id="s12">The area was a quiet neighborhood because it was very near what they call the...the Dunno [sounds like] Canal, which is the Danube Canal, and there was a nice park there which I visited, and I remember going there and riding on my scooter, and at one point I fell and I put the blade of the scooter bell right above my eye, and that was a mess.</span> <span id="s13">Uh [clears throat], most of the time, as I said, I was a youngster, and we had as a, we went, I went to school there, of course, kindergarten, first, and second grade, and the family social life really revolved around our relatives.</span> <span id="s14">I recall, uh, people coming to our house just to sit and discuss – we had no television, obviously, but I have a picture of, uh, my father and, discussing something or other with a relative and my mother playing chess with a..</span> <span id="s15">.</span> <span id="s16">with a relative, and, uh, I probably was in a crib sleeping, and, uh, so it was quiet, it was peaceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">00:03:21 My best friend actually lived downstairs, and we communicated by me pounding on the wall and he was, he would pound on the ceiling.</span> <span id="s18">We were both in the same grade.</span> <span id="s19">He was not Jewish, and, uh, an interesting thing, what I do remember is thanks to him, sort of, uh, I was arrested.</span> <span id="s20">This happened after the, uh, annexation of, uh, Austria by Germany.</span> <span id="s21">Jews were not allowed into the, uh, parks.</span> <span id="s22">Well, I didn't know anything, and the park was very close to our house.</span> <span id="s23">It was perhaps one street to cross.</span> <span id="s24">We were allowed, my friend and I, to go to the park without parents, during the day, of course, and he went, and I couldn't go, and I said at one point, course I was a little kid, I didn't say it just the way I'm saying it now, but I said, “The hell with this, I'm going with him” So the two of us went, and, uh, and I remember we were playing, and somehow or other, a police, a young, well, I won't say what I thought of him, anyway, a young policeman came, I don't know how he knew that I was Jewish, but he started to arrest me and drag me off and I put up some big fight, kicking and screaming and hollering.</span> <span id="s25">Uh, I heard this from my mother.</span> <span id="s26">[clears throat] We got to the police station, and I was officially charged with trespassing, resisting an officer, disrespect of an officer, and assault and battery on an officer.</span> <span id="s27">Course I was about five and a half years old.</span> <span id="s28">And, uh, I guess the guy was ready to throw me in jail and throw away the key, but the desk sergeant, or what you would call the de-, today the desk sergeant somehow got ahold of my mother, and she came, and the desk sergeant basically told her is get, you know, get him outta here, just make sure it doesn't happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">00:05:19 And that was, uh, that much I remember, but, uh, other than that I had a..</span> <span id="s30">.</span> <span id="s31">a very nice, reasonable time in Vienna.</span> <span id="s32">I don't remember any, uh, particular, uh, incident, uh, except, as I said, we lived near a park, and I remember the park whereas I went there very frequently just to walk, or, as I said, ride my scooter, hang out with my parents, and so on.</span> <span id="s33">And the other thing I do also remember, my parents, liked to walk, so, so to speak, we took walks in the quote unquote Vienna Woods, and, uh, I do have some pictures of me even as a little baby in a carriage, uh, just having a picnic.</span> <span id="s34">And that's a-, I don't remember that much more else, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">So, Doctor, the park that you mention....</span></p> <p><span id="s36">2nd voice: Try to avoid the “as I said,” because we never know whether we will have heard you say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SP: It's a lot to keep in mind, I understand that.</span> <span id="s39">The park that you mention, was that the Prayter [sounds like]?</span> <span id="s40">Was that the big park that was near you, or am I thinking of someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">00:06:44 No, the Prater was an amusement, park, with the big ferris wheel and so on.</span> <span id="s42">That is not the park that I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s43">This was just [clears throat] a park along a canal, just a nice place to walk and sit and relax.</span> <span id="s44">It was not the Prater.</span> <span id="s45">The Prater was a big amusement park, with the appropriate rides and ferris, the famous ferris wheel.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Right.</span> <span id="s47">And would that have been a place that you would have been to as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">00:07:16 I think I might've been a little bit too young.</span> <span id="s49">Uh, if I re-, I don't recall, to be honest with you, uh, but I would think, in a park, I don't know if there would've been much to do for a four and five year old.</span> <span id="s50">I honestly don't know, but, uh....</span> <span id="s51">I mean, the closest thing that I can remember to that would be when I came to the United States, I went to Coney Island, but I was a bit older then.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">We'll get to that.</span> <span id="s53">Did you not have siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">No, I'm an o-....</span> <span id="s55">No, uh, I was an only child, uh, which I guess I didn't mind.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, as I said, I had friends, I went to school, and, uh, my father and mother took me very often with them.</span> <span id="s57">Um, even back in, well, when I was in Vienna, obviously I was only five or six year a-, I was only from age of, age one to age six and a half, but, uh, I don't recall a babysitter.</span> <span id="s58">And if you go even further, I don't recall a babysitter even when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s59">I was with my parents almost all the time.</span> <span id="s60">They were my best friends, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">You had mentioned that your father had studied to become an accountant.</span> <span id="s62">Is that in fact what his occupation was?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">00:08:51 My father wanted to be an accountant, and he went to the University of Vienna, but he had to leave, or quit, because I came along, and obviously there was a financial problem with raising a family.</span> <span id="s64">So my father never completed his university training.</span> <span id="s65">Uh, he worked, after I was born, he worked, uh, as a retail, in a retail shop selling women's lingerie, and eventually he became the manager of that shop, uh, from, I guess 1932 until he left in, you know, in 30, in '38 and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">00:09:32 But he always knew accounting.</span> <span id="s67">He liked it.</span> <span id="s68">Even, uh, here in the United States he worked as a, uh, c-, what they call cutter in the garment industry, and during the war, the, uh, his boss, knowing that he knew, and was accounting, he sort of made him unofficially the assistant accounting of the firm, and I remember my father worked during the day as a cutter, [inaudible] know what that means, and at home, he did a lot of the books for the firm that he worked with.</span> <span id="s69">And his, to me, his greatest, uh, fame was when I finally started working after medical school and all that, my first year, and I proudly had to make out an income tax form, so I made it all out and I said, “Gee, look, Daddy, I made money, and, uh, I owe the government,” I don't know what it was, hundred dollars or something, so my father said, “Lemme look at it.”</span> <span id="s70">And he looked at it, and by the time he got through, the government owed me fifty dollars.</span> <span id="s71">I have no idea how he did it, but after that, I made out my income tax and I always gave it to him, and, uh, he did pretty well.</span> <span id="s72">He liked, he loved accounting and figures, but officially he was a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and he was a cutter in the garment industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">And I'm assuming that your mother, in Vienna, was a housewife?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">00:11:11 Yes.</span> <span id="s75">[coughs] My mother was a housekeeper, uh, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s76">Of course, when they came to the n-, to the States later on, uh, she did work, but also she worked in the ladies, uh, underwear, in the ladies garment industry.</span> <span id="s77">Uh, my, a cousin of ours, and we moved to Bridgeport eventually, and he had a factory and my mother worked there.</span> <span id="s78">And, uh, perhaps later on I can tell you a story about my mother working and not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">You've alluded to this, and you've anticipated pretty much my next question when you talked about the not so amusing story of being arrested as a five and a half or six year old.</span> <span id="s80">I was gonna ask you what kinds of memories you have, both generally once the Anschluss happened in March of '38, and more specifically, if there are any memories at all of the impact on your life and on your family's life of Kristallnacht in November of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00:12:23 The, uh, after the Anschluss, again, I was a fairly young kid and I don't remember very, very much.</span> <span id="s82">I do remember being taken out of one school, which was 'cause after the Anschluss, Jews were restricted in public school to a quota of like one percent, and I do remember being removed out of my normal school, where I had been going with this friend that I told you had, where we went to...to the park, and I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">00:12:55 Other than that I don't reme-, remember very much difference, except on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s84">I remember my father never came home from work that night, and I presume, I mean, to me it didn't make that much difference, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s85">Uh, my mother apparently was quite worried, and in the evening our apartment was visited by the Brown Shirts, in other words, the, I ge-, not the official police or the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s86">The Brown Shirts, as you know, were basically the bully boys of the Nazi party, individuals who had no rights whatsoever, basically, but they knew where every Jew was living in our apartment.</span> <span id="s87">They came to our apartment, looking for my father.</span> <span id="s88">They came in, they didn't ransack or anything, but they looked in every room and every closet for an adult.</span> <span id="s89">My father was not home.</span> <span id="s90">They left.</span> <span id="s91">The next day my father didn't come home; he didn't come home the next night, either.</span> <span id="s92">So he was away for two full nights, and my mother, of course, was frantic.</span> <span id="s93">Um, you also must remember, we had no phones.</span> <span id="s94">The phones were taken away from all Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">00:14:16 The third night, my father came home.</span> <span id="s96">He was fine; everything was all right.</span> <span id="s97">What had happened is a bit of a story.</span> <span id="s98">He was, as I said, he worked as a manager of a women's lingerie shop.</span> <span id="s99">In the summer of 1938, he was laid off.</span> <span id="s100">He was laid off.</span> <span id="s101">He was basically let go because the store owner, who was not Jewish, uh, wanted to have the store Aryanized, in other words, no Jews working there.</span> <span id="s102">So he had no job.</span> <span id="s103">But now came Kristallnacht, and what actually happened, my father's boss was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s104">Somehow he knew what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s105">He got ahold of my father during the day.</span> <span id="s106">How we did it st-, to this day I don't know, 'cause we had no phone.</span> <span id="s107">My father spent that night and the following day and the following night hidden in the back of this guy's store, where he had been working previously.</span> <span id="s108">So as I said, the man was not Jewish, but he wasn't gonna have any of this, and he hid my father until it was safe to go home.</span> <span id="s109">And he did come home.</span> <span id="s110">And actually, his boss also took some risks when he was discharged.</span> <span id="s111">He gave him a letter of recommendation, and he stated in that letter very clearly the only reason he was let go is because he's Jewish, and we want our store to be Aryan.</span> <span id="s112">And I, so I think that took some risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">I hate to ask what may sound like a ignorant question, but I'm not entirely sure....</span> <span id="s114">I know lots of people like your father were rounded up at Kristallnacht, but I'm not sure exactly what the purpose was for those kinds of arrests taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">00:16:11 They were just, to my knowledge, those arrests on Kristallnacht were just because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">They dragged you off, and if you put up a fight, they dragged you off more.</span> <span id="s117">Quite a number of Jews, as I know si-, I don't know just what you read about that, they wound up in Dachau, in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s118">Quite a number of Jews were killed, and it was just a matter of, if you were Jewish, they could do whatever they...they liked, and if you remember the history of the Kristallnacht, it was because a Jew killed a German ambassador, somebody or other in Paris.</span> <span id="s119">And it was just supposedly a, uh, popular uprising, which of course it wasn't, because to my knowledge, and to what most people know now, today's, it was very well planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Needless to say, life changed very, very dramatically for Jewish families, and even more so after Kristallnacht than even after Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">00:17:25 Yeah, there were quite a number of changes.</span> <span id="s122">A-, again, in...in my situation, 'cause I was so young, I don't remember the real, real details.</span> <span id="s123">Uh, I do remember, from what my mother told me, that there was problems shopping.</span> <span id="s124">Uh, the Jews were not allowed to shop during certain hours of the day, but they were allowed to shop from 12 to 3 in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s125">There was only one problem is, in those days and even today, most of the stores are closed from 12 to 2.</span> <span id="s126">So yes, you could go shopping; the stores were closed.</span> <span id="s127">Um, and the major problem that my parents did tell me was sustenance.</span> <span id="s128">My father had no job from nine-, from the summer of 1938 until he eventually went to England in the spring of 1939.</span> <span id="s129">Most of the Jews [coughs] were sustained by the Jewish Welfare Committee, so to speak, of Vienna.</span> <span id="s130">Jews s-, many Jews still worked and had an income, and they shared it with everybody else, et cetera.</span> <span id="s131">And to my knowledge, that's the way we survived.</span> <span id="s132">And as I said, we had a fair am-, number of relatives, uh, in Vienna, my father's, uh, relations, so we had a big family.</span> <span id="s133">My f-, well, my father's siblings, out of, my father was one of, I think, five.</span> <span id="s134">His oldest brother and his oldest sister were in the United States.</span> <span id="s135">They moved in the '20s.</span> <span id="s136">And another brother was in Argentina.</span> <span id="s137">He moved there in the '30s.</span> <span id="s138">A sister stayed behind to take care of my grandfather in Poland, and a third brother died, e-, e-, from tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s139">But my grandfather was like one of nine children, so we had a very large family scattered in Poland and in Austria-Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s140">And I think that's how we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Now before we move on to your story in terms of the episode that brought you to the United States, it sounds as if your father managed to leave Vienna even before you did.</span> <span id="s142">So could you tell me a little bit about what you learned later?</span> <span id="s143">Because presumably you didn't know at the time exactly what was going on with your father, but I'm interested in you telling me about your father's escaping from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">00:20:18 My father [clears throat], I don't know the fine details, but I, my fath-, my mother and father, uh, heard through, again, through the Jewish Committee of Vienna, of a group from the United States coming to hopefully take some children whose parents couldn't go.</span> <span id="s145">But, and I was put in and I was chosen, but my father, I think, also requested or somehow put in an...an application.</span> <span id="s146">I can't give you the details, but he left Vienna, I think through the auspices of Highoss [sounds like], and he went to England and spent time there in a, uh, refugee camp, in a Jewish refugee camp, called Camp Kitchner [Camp Kitchener, a refugee camp near Sandwich, Kent].</span> <span id="s147">He left probably about two or three weeks before I left, or before I was chosen and left, and so he left first, I left next, my mother was alone for about two months.</span> <span id="s148">But again, since my father was in England, again, perhaps through Highoss, my mother came to England, but technically not as a refugee, but she was, came to England with a job and waiting.</span> <span id="s149">She became a servant to some family in London.</span> <span id="s150">So officially she was not a refugee in that sense; she was a hired hand.</span> <span id="s151">But that's how both my parents got to England.</span> <span id="s152">I came to the States directly, but as I said, my father came to England, my father in this refugee camp as a refugee, my mother as a working homekeeper or something of that nature.</span> <span id="s153">Of course, they knew each other and they communicated, and I suppose on the weekends they met and saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">[From british National Archives web site: The Kitchener camp, a derelict site which had previously been an army camp, was taken over by the Council for German Jewry at the beginning of 1939 as a result of pressure from the Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland to rescue threatened Jews from Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s155">Conditions for admission were that inmates must be aged between 18 and 40 and that they have a definite prospect of emigration overseas.</span> <span id="s156">The camp began receiving refugees in February 1939 and ended with the outbreak of war in September after which most of the inmates chose to enlist in the British army.]</span> <span id="s157">Okay.</span> <span id="s158">We're gonna now move on into the Brith Shalom part.</span> <span id="s159">I'm gonna ask a sort of director's question: If you can, as much as possible, maintain eye contact with me, rather than look down.</span> <span id="s160">I know it's a natural thing to do, but it looks a little funny on film to see somebody looking down, so just a minor point.</span> <span id="s161">Again, knowing how young you were, not withstanding that, what do you remember about the the process in which your family, one, learned about the possibility of you coming to the States, and, two, what you and your family had to go through in order to be chosen for that operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">00:23:27 The information that was disseminated throughout the Viennese community, the Viennese Jewish community, uh, came, I believe, from what they call, uh, the Jewish Cultural Organization.</span> <span id="s163">That's an organization, I don't know that much about it, but the official name was called the Yiddish [inaudible], and the first I ever officially ever knew anything about it is when, if you would look at my birth certificate, it was not issued by the hospital, it was not issued by the Polish government, my parents were Polish, it was not issued by the Austrian government.</span> <span id="s164">It was issued by the Jewish Cultural Committee of Vienna.</span> <span id="s165">Thus I became, and my passport states very clearly, that I was a nonentity.</span> <span id="s166">I was a frender [sounds like], a stranger.</span> <span id="s167">I was stateless, officially from the day that I was born.</span> <span id="s168">Now that same committee, in 1930 ay-, uh, 1939, I am sure was notified by the Brith Shalom group that started, or was going initiate, this exodus to the United States.</span> <span id="s169">And [clears throat] my father said, I guess, said, “Fine,” and put in an application.</span> <span id="s170">Uh, I know my cousin also, my mother's sister's boy also put in an application.</span> <span id="s171">Uh, I can't give you the exact dates.</span> <span id="s172">Uh, I know, you know, they wanted birth certificate, who you are, and so on.</span> <span id="s173">I presume, although I don't know for sure, they may have also asked, you know, do you have any relatives in United States, and so on.</span> <span id="s174">We did, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s175">You put in that application, and then there was a series of interviews, with, uh, Mr. Gilbert Kraus, his wife, and there was also a doctor's, uh, guess his name was Strauss, Stauss...?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Schless.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">00:25:46 Doc-, uh, yeah, Doctor Schless, that was his name.</span> <span id="s178">And you had an interview with Kraus, with Mr. Kraus.</span> <span id="s179">I believe also Mrs. Kraus was there, but I'm not a hundred percent sure, and I presume also that Dr. Schless was there to make sure that you sorta passed the quick physical.</span> <span id="s180">After that interview, you heard nothing until one day a letter came and said that yes, you, Erwin Tepper – or the letter came to your parents, and it said, yes, Erwin Tepper was chosen.</span> <span id="s181">Now, the next question that always comes up to me is how in, not how – I was chosen.</span> <span id="s182">Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">00:26:33 Why was I chosen, for instance, and not my cousin?</span> <span id="s184">To this day I have no real idea, although somebodybremarked in one of the books relative to this whole business of getting the children to the United States, that perhaps they were looking for children who didn't look particularly Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">So I was blond and blue-eyed.</span> <span id="s186">Uh, I didn't have a hook nose.</span> <span id="s187">So maybe that's why I was chosen.</span> <span id="s188">But my honest answer to that is I have no clue.</span> <span id="s189">All I know is that I was chosen and the parents were given, the letter that came to the parents gave you basically 24 hours to make that decision.</span> <span id="s190">You were asked to, yes, if you agree, bring your kid, bring your child to this particular place with all the appropriate papers, and we'll get started.</span> <span id="s191">And that's really all I remember.</span> <span id="s192">I don't particularly, I do remember vaguely the interview.</span> <span id="s193">What was I, what I was questioned about, who, what, when, and where, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s194">But I do remember being led into a room, and the questioning was not with my parents.</span> <span id="s195">I mean, my parents were waiting outside.</span> <span id="s196">That much I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">And I assume, Dr. Tepper, that you have a conscious memory of why you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">00:28:08 To be honest, I don't really [clears throat] the fine, the finite circumstances of why I was at this interview.</span> <span id="s199">I knew, I think I vaguely remember knowing I was going someplace.</span> <span id="s200">Again, the whys and wherefores I was going, I wasn't really too clear.</span> <span id="s201">I was only about six and a half years old.</span> <span id="s202">But I knew I was going someplace.</span> <span id="s203">I can't honestly tell you whether I remember that I was going alone, or with, or my parents were coming with me [buzzing noise] Let's pause for just a second. . . .</span> <span id="s204">Okay, let me just remind myself where we were.</span> <span id="s205">We were talking about the recollections or lack thereof of...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">...of the choosing process.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">I really know very little about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">And that thing that I told you about not being Jewish, that comes from that book [coughs] by Bahmels [sounds like].</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Yeah, which I [inaudible].</span> <span id="s212">Okay.</span> <span id="s213">Well, then let's continue on, and let me ask, again, to the extent that you have them, of your recollections of, anything at all about leaving Vienna, including saying goodbye to your family, your parents, any memories at all of the process during which you were preparing to leave your family and Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">00:29:50 Yeah, once, uh, we were notified, or my mother was notified, because she was the only one left, that I was eligible to go, uh, [clears throat] I don't remember that much.</span> <span id="s215">I remember packing a small suitcase, and I remember my mother wasn't exactly too happy in that sense.</span> <span id="s216">Uh, I don't mean happy, but, you know, so sorry and saddened, and then I remember getting on a train at the Vienna railroad station.</span> <span id="s217">I don't remember the exact moment and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s218">Um, I vaguely remember sleeping in Berlin in a dormitory.</span> <span id="s219">That's all that I remember.</span> <span id="s220">As far as being told what happened, I did, uh, a piece and wrote to other, uh, children, and they gave me information as to what was going on, but my own personal recollections, for reasons [clears throat], perhaps they're psychological, but I don't remember really very, very much of the actual time from when I left Vienna, uh, until I arrived, uh, in New York, in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">00:31:32 Uh, of course we know [clears throat] there was a stop in Berlin.</span> <span id="s222">If I look at my passport, the visa stamp is from Berlin, issued by the Berlin Consulate, not by the Viennese Consulate, um, and it states the date that we left Hamburg, 'cause we went from Vienna to Berlin, from Berlin, the next day we went to Hamburg and left, and we stopped in Southampton to pick up passengers, and that's when my father, who, as I said before, had come into England before I left, my father was there, I do remember that, and him coming aboard with a camera, and I have pictures that he took during our stop in Southampton on the boat.</span> <span id="s223">Um, I don't remember very much about the trip across on the boat.</span> <span id="s224">I don't remember being seasick, uh, and I don't remember....</span> <span id="s225">I guess I must have had a good time, because [clears throat] I don't remember anything bad.</span> <span id="s226">And then I remember getting off in New York.</span> <span id="s227">But for some reason, which I've never been able to figure out except as...as I think [coughs and clears throat], excuse me, maybe it's psychological, I just repressed it, I don't have that much recollection of the actual time interval between leaving Vienna and arriving in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Did you know that you were going to see your father in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">00:33:21 I don't think so.</span> <span id="s230">I think that was a surprise.</span> <span id="s231">I do know that I, we were all told that we were going to stop in England, but that's all.</span> <span id="s232">And then, as I said, my father came on board.</span> <span id="s233">To my knowledge, he was the only relative of these 50 children that was indeed on board at that point in Southampton.</span> <span id="s234">And, uh, and of course he got off and....</span> <span id="s235">I never saw the actual photographs until my father came over, obviously, with the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">To say the least, it must have been a bittersweet moment, because on the one hand, you're seeing your father who....</span> <span id="s237">I know he hadn't left all that long before you left, but a little bit of time had passed, and, of course, at that point, particularly as a six or seven year old, you had no real way of knowing when you would next see your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">00:34:27 It's...it's true that when I saw my father there, as I said, I..</span> <span id="s239">.</span> <span id="s240">I guess I didn't really think about the future, because I don't really recall being that much involved in the decision to send me away or not to send me away.</span> <span id="s241">The most that I can recall to date is I know I was going away to see relatives, because [clears throat], and to me, seeing relatives was no...no big deal, because we, as I said, in my life in Vienna was very much centered around other relatives, so it was quite common, oh, well, you're gonna see Uncle This or Aunt That, and, uh, even during my stay in Vienna, vacation time, during the summer, for instance, I remember more because [clears throat] Vienna [clears throat], excuse me, was quite hot in the summer.</span> <span id="s242">My parents came from Poland, so almost every summer that I can remember vacationing from Vienna was in Poland.</span> <span id="s243">My mother took me to Poland.</span> <span id="s244">My father stayed to work in Vienna, but my mother and I spent at least a month or two every summer in Poland with my grandfather, with both my maternal grandfather in place called St'nee [sounds like], and where my mother came from, a little village called Doni-, Donina, which was about ten miles south [clears throat], where the family had, I think it...it was a, uh, lumber mill, where they, uh, sawed big pieces of trees into boards of lumber.</span> <span id="s245">And so to visit relatives was no major event, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">And the relatives that were living in the United States at that point, do you know where they were, where they lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">00:36:41 My relatives in the United States at that point were most, well, my aunt and my uncle were in New York, New York City, and that time, back in the late '30s and '40s, I would, I believe that all of my relatives here in the United States were living in New York City [clears throat], in Connecticut, and one or two families, upstate New York.</span> <span id="s248">It's only later, after the war, et cetera, that some people moved out to California and so on.</span> <span id="s249">But my father's oldest brother and oldest sister were in New York, in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Right.</span> <span id="s251">And so you said, understandably, very few memories of the journey.</span> <span id="s252">I believe it was about a ten-day ship journey, more or less, something like that.</span> <span id="s253">Some of the other kids have told us about eating strange foods, things like that.</span> <span id="s254">I'm wondering if there are any recollections of your arrival in the United States.</span> <span id="s255">What, if anything, comes to mind when you think back?</span> <span id="s256">And indeed, it's a complete coincidence, today is June 3rd, which is the day the ship arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">00:38:20 That's right.</span> <span id="s258">Yes, when we arrived [clears throat] in New York, I do remember, an enorm-, looking over from the ship, an enormous crowd on the dock, and the waiting, and the luggage.</span> <span id="s259">It was just total, absolute chaos, and we were just herded around to go here and go there and not get lost, and I think we were placed on buses almost immediately, from the harbor in New York to [clears throat] the camp that was prepared for us by the, uh, Brith Shalom organization in Collegeville, Maryland, or in Collegeville, uh, Pennsylvania, which was outside of Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s260">Um, as I said, we certainly spent no time in New York at all, and we were sort of whisked away, uh, and in the camp [cell phone rings]....</span></p> <p><span id="s261">So we were talking about your arriving at the camp and around that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">00:39:35 Yeah, when we got to the camp, which was v-, very nice, uh, big, plenty of places to play [clears throat], and food was excellent, and there were interesting foods for us, and the one thing that I do remember very clearly was we were given a dessert, which was some kinda jelly, nice and red, with slices of banana in it, which was, of course, jello with b-, slices of banana.</span> <span id="s263">Now in Europe, I do remember, I don't think I had eaten a banana maybe two or three times in my life, but here was bananas, and everybody thought, “Oh, that's great!”</span> <span id="s264">And of course we very carefully [clears throat] scraped off the jello, because we thought the the jello was the preservative for the bananas.</span> <span id="s265">It took a while to figure out, yeah, you're supposed to eat the jello, too.</span> <span id="s266">But that much I do remember, with the jello, we were standin' there scraping it off, and then somebody, [smacks lips], “Mmm, that's pretty sweet,” and that...that much I do remember.</span> <span id="s267">And of course there were other things that we hadn't seen, corn, for instance.</span> <span id="s268">That was something, I don't ever recall seeing it in Europe.</span> <span id="s269">Maybe I did, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s270">But I remember the thing with the jello, and I vaguely remember corn being a little bit, corn on the cob being something unusual, uh, you know, how do we eat this?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">00:41:13 And, uh, but [clears throat] the camp was good.</span> <span id="s272">We had plenty of places to run and play.</span> <span id="s273">But the most important thing, and this I remember clearly, our most, we had two most important jobs at camp.</span> <span id="s274">Number one was to learn English.</span> <span id="s275">We had English cla-, well, we had English classes going back to the boat.</span> <span id="s276">Every day on the boat, we had English classes, trying to learn English.</span> <span id="s277">At the camp, every day, and, in fact, I think they hired a professional teacher at the camp to teach us English, and we hadda write home, or write to our parents at least once a week.</span> <span id="s278">And I think, uh, that's true, and that much I remember.</span> <span id="s279">And then the rest we had company, and, uh, again, I don't remember the details, but, uh, talking to other people, uh, when they wrote to me about things.</span> <span id="s280">Uh, we celebrated the birsday, birthdays, you know.</span> <span id="s281">Ev-, every time somebody had a birthday during that summer, got a little birthday cake, everybody sang “Happy Birthday,” and so on.</span> <span id="s282">So they tried, and they succeeded, at making everyone happy, contented.</span> <span id="s283">I'm not saying that they weren't people who, uh, missed their parents, but they certainly made it as comfortable as possible.</span> <span id="s284">And again, going back over and over again to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">00:42:49 Now [clears throat], how do you learn English to a group that was from kindergarten age up to teenagers, because we had kids twelve, thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s286">One child had his bar mitzvah there.</span> <span id="s287">And we didn't have classes, you know, you didn't have kindergarten classes and you didn't have, uh, seventh and eighth grade classes, but every Sunday we had a class, and what do you do in the Sunday papers, you read the funnies.</span> <span id="s288">It's a great way to learn a language, because you have the balloons.</span> <span id="s289">You can read and you can look at the picture, and figure out what's going on.</span> <span id="s290">And to this day, I can tell you, I read the funnies on the daily newspaper and on Sunday first, and then I go read the rest of the papers.</span> <span id="s291">And I still think that's a great way to learn English, with the letters and the balloons, people speaking, and then looking at the pictures.</span> <span id="s292">And this, of course, was opposed to what perhaps some of the other children told you, about the movies that we saw on the boat.</span> <span id="s293">They were all in English with no subtitles.</span> <span id="s294">We had no idea what was going on, but we would argue after the movie, trying to figure out what the movie was all about, but it was fun, I hope, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">I'm also told that watching some of the other summer campers who were there playing baseball was a bit of a mystery to all of you Viennese kids, who, of course, knew only soccer, not baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">00:44:24 I presume so.</span> <span id="s297">I don't...I don't really remember that, but I..</span> <span id="s298">.</span> <span id="s299">I wouldn't be surprised.</span> <span id="s300">Uh, there were other kids in the camp.</span> <span id="s301">There was a r-, river there, and there was another camp across the river or something of that nature, as I recall, and, uh, I think were was some, we had some visitors and so on, so that whole summer was well worth it, and again, it made us comfortable, it made us learn [clears throat], and then we all left the camp, obviously, at the beginning of the school year curriculum, and we were factioned out to either relatives and foster homes and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">And where did you go, after the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">00:45:05 After summer I went to the Bronx, New York, to my aunt, my father's oldest sister.</span> <span id="s304">She took me in.</span> <span id="s305">She had two children of her own, two girls, who were, I guess shhhh-, about, they were older that I was.</span> <span id="s306">Uh, the oldest probably was six years older than I was, and the second one was about three years older.</span> <span id="s307">But we lived in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s308">If you n-, you know the Bronx, it was way up near Van Cartland Park, the last stop on the Jerome Avenue line, and we lived, again I was fortunate, I lived right next to a park.</span> <span id="s309">My official address was 95 Reservoir Oval.</span> <span id="s310">If anybody knows anything in the Bronx, there was a reservoir there, which a few years [clears throat] previously had been turned into a park, and, uh, we lived on this side, on one side of the street, and on the other side was the park.</span> <span id="s311">And it was nice.</span> <span id="s312">You, again, you went in, they had swings and playgrounds for the kids, and that's where I lived for about two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">00:46:19 Uh, and then, uh, well, the other problem, I'm sure you've heard from others, was school.</span> <span id="s314">I was officially supposedly, had I stayed in Vienna, gone into third grade.</span> <span id="s315">Now here I am in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s316">All right, I've been in the United States for two months, two and a half.</span> <span id="s317">My English, shall we say, was not the greatest.</span> <span id="s318">So [clears throat] I went to public school, P.S. 96.</span> <span id="s319">I was put into kindergarten.</span> <span id="s320">What do you learn, you know, what do you do with a kid who knows nothing?</span> <span id="s321">You start him in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s322">So here I was, the tallest, biggest, heaviest kid in kindergarten, and, uh, I had a good time there, I remember, and the kids, it's interesting, the kids, as I recall, no one made fun of me, even though I was bigger and older than all the rest of 'em.</span> <span id="s323">And I learned to play, you know, we played in the playground, as I said, in the park, and I slowly skipped, I mean, I didn't spend the whole year in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s324">Once the teacher thought I had [coughs] learned enough English, I was put into first grade, because the knowledge [coughs] you could present in either the German or the English language, and even in math, I mean, if you ask me, “What's two and two?</span> <span id="s325">,” it's either four or feer, what's the d-, the language made no difference as long as you know how to add.</span> <span id="s326">So the overall knowledge that they were looking for me, and I heard this from the other children, was how good was your English.</span> <span id="s327">Your knowledge was all right, because you had already gone to a certain school in Europe, all the way up, as I said, to teenagers.</span> <span id="s328">Their interest was learning, again, English.</span> <span id="s329">And no one in the school there spoke English [sic].</span> <span id="s330">There may have been one or two teachers who were Jewish who spoke a little Yiddish, but basically you learned English.</span> <span id="s331">When I learned so much English, I was put into the next grade, et cetera.</span> <span id="s332">And eventually we moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and there I caught up with my grade, and as I said, in kindergarten in New York, I was the oldest kid in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s333">When I got to Bridgeport, Connecticut, into the third grade, I was one of the youngest kids in third grade, so I had caught up.</span> <span id="s334">And I think all the other children had, went through the same ritual of catching up to their proper grade [clears throat].</span> <span id="s335">Maybe in the older groups they were a half a grade behind, but basically we caught up, and I caught up, and it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">While you were at the camp during the summer, do you have any memories at all of either of the Krauses?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">00:49:10 I do remember Gilbert Kraus, particularly sitting in with English, helping English.</span> <span id="s338">I don't have that much recollection of Mrs. Kraus.</span> <span id="s339">Uh, I just...I just don't remember or recollect.</span> <span id="s340">But I do remember Mr. Kraus as a, in, reading to us, trying to get us to read and think in English, which I think, uh, is very important now, especially what they're going through [clears throat] with a lot of the immigration today.</span> <span id="s341">I mean, there's nothing wrong with keeping your old language.</span> <span id="s342">I can speak German, and I always have.</span> <span id="s343">But having said that, learning English did nothing to detract from growing up, uh, as a Jewish child, the learning Yiddish, maintaining my German language and so on [clears throat], some Jewish heritage.</span> <span id="s344">And I think, I have had arguments with people, uh, when I went, in my own, with children, you know, you go to parents/teacher groups, associations, and they're talking about specializing, and, uh, I remember having a big argument.</span> <span id="s345">They wanted to hire a teacher to teach math in a foreign language, specifically Spanish, and I told 'em, “You're out of your minds.</span> <span id="s346">Two and two is four, whether you're talking about English, German, Spanish.</span> <span id="s347">If you're gonna spend money, hire the teacher to teach English.</span> <span id="s348">The mathematics will come without any problem.”</span> <span id="s349">And, uh, as I said, I have, I've had arguments with this along, as my children were growing up.</span> <span id="s350">And my children, uh, actually spoke German also, because my wife was from Switzerland, my mother-in-law lived with us for ten years, she was older, she never really...really learned English, so my children learned Swiss German, and they can still speak it today, and they can speak English.</span> <span id="s351">There's nothing wrong with that.</span> <span id="s352">So, and we were, I was very proud that my children were bilingual, English and German, and I don't see anything wrong with that.</span> <span id="s353">And in high school, actually, one, two of 'em took French and the other one took Spanish.</span> <span id="s354">That, you know, in the United States, how much chance do you get to speak?</span> <span id="s355">In Europe, if you sneeze across the border you gotta know the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Now I'm assuming, Doctor, that once you and the other kids, by the end of the summer, when you left the summer camp, that there was certainly no formal means by which kids stayed in touch with each other, and I am under the impression, as we were discussing earlier, that there's been one or two sort of reunions over the years.</span> <span id="s357">But going back to the earlier years, before I forget, I wanted you to tell me the story of how you at some point later, I'm not sure exactly when that was, had an unplanned meeting or re-meeting with one or two of the other children in the group in Bridgeport.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">00:52:44 Well, after we left the camp, and as I said, I moved to Bridgeport, uh, I..</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">I moved to New York, I had no contact with the other children.</span> <span id="s361">Um, I did have contact through my aunt because, uh, she was somewhat interested in the Brith Shalom.</span> <span id="s362">She maintained contact with the, uh, overall president of the Brith Shalom group, as I told you, uh, Levine.</span> <span id="s363">But I had no contact, and then [clears throat] we moved to Bridgeport, and I grew up in Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s364">That's really where I grew up.</span> <span id="s365">I got there at third grade and I went through high school in Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s366">There was no reunion [clears throat], there was nothing, until early in 2000 and 2.</span> <span id="s367">I don't know which organization, but there was an organi-, it was, there was an organized convention of Holocaust survivors in Chicago.</span> <span id="s368">There was a subsection of that group for children, and, of course, the Brith Shalom group was included, and the children's organization, they were various groups that had brought children over, as you know, and then there was this, uh, young lady, Iris Pozner, who had looked into the number of children that came without parents.</span> <span id="s369">So before that convention took place, there was a call for a sort of reunion of the Brith Shalom group in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s370">The Brith Shalom group had sold the camp, and taken that money and built an old age home, so to speak, or assisted age home in Philadelphia, and there was a meeting there, as I recall, of the Brith Shalom children that were available and could come, et cetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">00:54:54 And it was asked that someone present the story of the Brith Shalom group, because we were the single largest group that arrived in the United States at that time.</span> <span id="s372">There were other stories where childrens [sic] came in dribs and drabs, two or three there, four there, ten there.</span> <span id="s373">We were the biggest sing-, single group, so we were asked to make a presentation, and the presentation was going to be done, was supposed to be done, by Robert, [inaudible] man, Robert Braun, who he and and his sister had been taken in as foster children by the Krauses, and they lived with the Krauses for, I believe, two years.</span> <span id="s374">The Brauns had a relative, I believe a cousin or an uncle, by the name of Rudolf Braun, a physician, a general practice family physician in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s375">So the two, when he was ready to take them in, he was also, he was a refugee from Vienna, but he came over not really as a refugee, but anyway, so he had a practice [clears throat], and he took these two children, a brother and a sister, in, and the brother and the sister left the Krauses and they moved to Bridgeport.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">00:56:14 Now it turns out Rudolf Braun, the doctor, was my family doctor.</span> <span id="s377">My parents went to him; I went to him.</span> <span id="s378">He fixed, I broke a r-, my wrist, I broke my elbow, I had a cold, et cetera.</span> <span id="s379">He was my family physician, and I remember going over to the office, either with my father, mother, either, and all I remember was there was a young gal who occasionally would help out.</span> <span id="s380">I knew she was a foreigner because she had a slight accent, and I thought it was his daughter.</span> <span id="s381">It turns out that this young lady who occasionally would help out, you know, in the office, stashing paperwork or so on, was Hannah Braun, the broth-, the sister of this Robert Braun, who was one of the fifty kids that came over with me, but I never knew this.</span> <span id="s382">I had no clue.</span> <span id="s383">I knew she was there, I knew her name was Braun, and that's it, until [clears throat] I met this, her brother at this meeting in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s384">Now the reason I never knew was they lived in a st-, section of town that went to a different high school than I did.</span> <span id="s385">He went to Bassick High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut; I went to Central.</span> <span id="s386">We never crossed paths, I never knew he existed, until we met by accident, so to speak, in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s387">Now what happened is [clears throat] he was supposed to write this little talk about the Brith Shalom group for the Chicago convention.</span> <span id="s388">He couldn't come.</span> <span id="s389">He had a family affair; he just couldn't get to Chicago, so I was asked and I said, “Yeah, all right,” and I was the one that wrote, uh, the, uh, presentation for the Brith Shalom group.</span> <span id="s390">Now as I..</span> <span id="s391">.</span> <span id="s392">I didn't have much recollection, so what I did, through Iris Pozner, the lady who organized this 1,000 children group, she had names and addresses of the 50, of many, well, not many, but some of the, I think at least 20 of the 50 children that were still alive, and she had addresses and so on.</span> <span id="s393">I wrote to these 50 children, introduced myself, and I said, “Look, I have to say somethin' about what happened to us, and can you please tell me what happened to you?”</span> <span id="s394">And I wrote, I said, “Number one, I want t-, what happened in Vienna; number two, what do you remember about the trip from Vienna to Berlin,” I..</span> <span id="s395">.</span> <span id="s396">I wrote out a whole list, “from Berlin to Hamburg, on the boat, at the camp, and what happened to you since.”</span> <span id="s397">And they wrote me answers, most of them, and that's what I used as the basis of my presentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Now just to complete your family story, I wanna make sure you tell me a little bit about when and how your parents finally made it to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">00:59:17 Yeah.</span> <span id="s400">My parents got, my father got to England [clears throat] before I..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">I left.</span> <span id="s403">My mother got to England just before the war started, in, I guess in July or August [clears throat].</span> <span id="s404">They were both living in England.</span> <span id="s405">One was in the, my father was in a refugee camp; my mother was working as the maid or household something in London.</span> <span id="s406">Now I was in the States.</span> <span id="s407">My father's oldest sister and oldest brother were in the States, and they started proceedings to bring them over.</span> <span id="s408">They apparently gave the guarantees that were necessary, and, of course, since I was in the States already, a son, that added to their visa application so that perhaps they were moved up a few notches.</span> <span id="s409">I think that was one of the things in...in the visa bureaucracy, that if you had children here, you were moved up.</span> <span id="s410">And they came, uh, I think in 1941, before the United States entered the war, before December '41, [clears throat] and they were also taken in by my aunt.</span> <span id="s411">So now, in this little apartment in the Bronx, we had my aunt, her husband, her two children, me, and my mother and father, and, uh, my uncle had a little jewelry shop on Jerome Avenue, and I worked there.</span> <span id="s412">I learned, he made a little extra money by, if you remember the Bulova watch company, he was given, he would be sent the innards of a watch, the case, the face, and the handles.</span> <span id="s413">He would put the watch mechanism into the case.</span> <span id="s414">He then attached the face, the num-, numerals, and my job was to put on the handles, the big hand and the little hand, and so I helped out in the store with the, I sat there with, you know, with the little magnifying glass and it was fun.</span> <span id="s415">It gave me something to do.</span> <span id="s416">Uh, my aunt could not work.</span> <span id="s417">She was actually crippled.</span> <span id="s418">She couldn't [clears throat], she couldn't use her right hand at all, basically left hand, but she ran her household with an iron fist, lemme tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">01:01:45 And, uh, my father, as I said, his oldest brother was in New York, was president of the Jewish Waiters Union, so he gave my father a job as a waiter.</span> <span id="s420">Well, that didn't go too well.</span> <span id="s421">My father just couldn't hack it.</span> <span id="s422">Turned out we had a cousin in Bridgeport who, uh, had a lingerie factory, and Bridgeport at that time had a, very much a garment industry.</span> <span id="s423">He got my father a job in the women's garment, in-, International Ladies Women's Garment Association.</span> <span id="s424">We moved to Bridgeport just before the actual war started, and, as I said, I grew up in Bridgeport from third grade up.</span> <span id="s425">Um, and of course we always kept in touch and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s426">We had a family circle during the war, and I know that family circle [clears throat] helped quite a number of people getting into the States.</span> <span id="s427">We had two sisters who came.</span> <span id="s428">They, uh, spent most of the war years in the Dominican Republic, which was pretty, uh, generous in allowing Jews to come in, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s429">And it was a lotta fun.</span> <span id="s430">So growing up really I was basically an American kid.</span> <span id="s431">I spoke English.</span> <span id="s432">Uh, my parents went to night school once a week in the public school building to learn English.</span> <span id="s433">Uh, my mother worked as a seamstress in my uncle's factory, my cousin's factory.</span> <span id="s434">My father worked in another factory until, and of course we needed the money, obviously, no problem, but, and this, I think something you have two things to think about, uh, this whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">01:03:30 Number one, the parents letting the children go.</span> <span id="s436">I mean, stop and think, if you were a parent today and some stranger came to you and said, “We'll take these kids and we're bringing 'em over to the States, you may never see 'em again,” would you let them go?</span> <span id="s437">It's a big problem, I would think, number one.</span> <span id="s438">And number two, in our f-, overall family, I know, one of the biggest thing [sic] was education.</span> <span id="s439">From the day that I can remember, I was going to college.</span> <span id="s440">It wasn't a question of if you wanted to go or didn't want.</span> <span id="s441">Your education did not [coughs] finish with high school.</span> <span id="s442">It finished with college.</span> <span id="s443">Then you could do what you want.</span> <span id="s444">So education was a big deal.</span> <span id="s445">I did pretty well in school.</span> <span id="s446">I was a smart kid.</span> <span id="s447">Got too cocky, but, all right, I did well, and I did honor roll every year except seventh grade, English.</span> <span id="s448">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s449">I was getting all As and a few Bs, and all of a sudden this one marking period, I got, not did I get a D, which is failing, I got a red D in English.</span> <span id="s450">I don't remember what happened, but my father and my mother were a bit upset, shall we say, at the least.</span> <span id="s451">They never laid a hand on me.</span> <span id="s452">C-, my...my...my mother would lay a hand, not, also never laid a hand on me.</span> <span id="s453">She would take one of these straw, uh, beaters that you beat the rug with.</span> <span id="s454">That's what I got spanked with.</span> <span id="s455">But anyhow, I got this red D, and my father said, “This can't go on.”</span> <span id="s456">He made my mother stop working so that she would be home when I came home from school.</span> <span id="s457">I did my homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">01:05:18 She never went back to work until I went off to college, so education was a big deal in my family.</span> <span id="s459">And as I said, y-, t-, the Krauses were the heroes, but in my opinion, the parents were the same heroes to let 'em go.</span> <span id="s460">And I think everyone did well, from what I know.</span> <span id="s461">Uh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s462">A lotta parents didn't make it, but even, I think those children did well.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">I didn't keep up with that many, but the ones I've kept up with since this whole, uh, reunion in 2000 and 2 and so on, and met a few others and so on, so we've kept up.</span> <span id="s464">And the story that I've just told you, uh, I have [clears throat], and the story not only that I told you, but the story that I told at the 2000 and 2 convention, I have been asked to give it, I gave it to my local synagogue, and, uh, I gave it to this, uh, senior citizens development where I now live, and they were all very interested because the story of these children coming over without parents, almost everyone that I talked to knew nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">01:06:32 They knew about the war, they knew about the Holocaust, they knew about the persecutions of Jews, they saw the pictures, you know, of smashing windows, the shops and so on, adults being dragged off the street.</span> <span id="s466">What most of the people in, you know, in this, again, senior citizens development where I live, they're all sorta my age, you have to be 55 or over to live here [clears throat], they never realized that during those years, from 1932 when Hitler came and until the end of the war, that children were also taken off.</span> <span id="s467">They were taken out of school, they weren't allowed to do this, they weren't allowed in the park, I got arrested 'cause I went to the park.</span> <span id="s468">No one, I think, really knew that the children were also specifically sought out and sorta persecuted.</span> <span id="s469">And then the other thing, it's still a little bit of a controversy, do we consider ourselves, let's say our group of 50, Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s470">We didn't go through the concentration camps, we didn't go through the burning and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s471">But I consider still yes, because if you would read Mein Kampf, there's no question that if anybody has any sense and understands what was written in there, that this was gonna be the ultimate fa-, fate of the Jews.</span> <span id="s472">So we escaped from the Holocaust, and again, the other thing is a holocaust is the wrong word, because holocaust comes from the Greek holokosten, which means a sacrifice to God, and by no means were these people burnt any sacrifice to God, and that's why I try [clears throat] at the beginning of my talk, all the time I try to explain, don't think of this as a holocaust, use the word showa, which means disaster, and that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">The story of your immediate family, of course, ended well for you.</span> <span id="s474">Your parents were lucky enough to make it here and be reunited.</span> <span id="s475">I hesitate to ask this, but I will just to complete the story.</span> <span id="s476">I know, Doctor, that you mentioned earlier on in our conversation that you had a cousin who had also applied for one of the 50 slots.</span> <span id="s477">Can I ask what happened to your cousin, and other members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">01:08:58 When I [clears throat] started looking into this, I knew that my cousin, who was a..</span> <span id="s479">.</span> <span id="s480">a year older than I was, had applied, because obviously my parents talked to his parents.</span> <span id="s481">His mother and my mother were sisters.</span> <span id="s482">Neither the parents or the child came to the States and so on, and after the war, as I said, this family organization in New York tried to find out what happened, who happened, we wrote to the Red Cross and so on and so forth, and there was no mention of them.</span> <span id="s483">About a year ago, uh, I wrote to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, giving what particulars I knew, name, addresses, uh, birth dates and so on of this family, mother, father, and the single child, and they really didn't have that many records.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, the, they...they tried.</span> <span id="s485">There's no question about that they tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">01:10:04 And then, I guess, this, uh, these records became useful or became known that had been discovered in Europe.</span> <span id="s487">Uh, I forgot the exact name of the organization and so on.</span> <span id="s488">Anyhow, I wrote to them, gave 'em all the particulars [clears throat], and sure enough, they gave me s-, information, but the information even was scanty.</span> <span id="s489">The father was, I wo-, was k-, died in Dachau, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s490">The mother was sent to a work camp, and they have no further information.</span> <span id="s491">The child, in 19, I believe it was 43, whatever, the child, I mean, how old, he's a year younger than, older than I was, was taken into protective custody, I think by the Gestapo or by the police, and that's the last anybody has any record.</span> <span id="s492">So can only guess what happened.</span> <span id="s493">And, uh, said there were other people who [clears throat] looked into their family the way I did and most of 'em never found, or there were records that they were destroyed.</span> <span id="s494">My whole, as I said, my father had a big family, so there're a lotta Teppers in the United States that are related.</span> <span id="s495">My mother had very few.</span> <span id="s496">They all were per-, killed in Poland.</span> <span id="s497">Uh, perhaps...perhaps the only good quote thing that came out of it, a lot of 'em never even went into the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s498">They were in that portion of Poland, Russia, they were just taken out...out of their village and shot, as far as we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">I did notice that, and perhaps you've checked this same source, there is an organization in Vienna that all these years later has posted, and it's available online, a list of all of the Austrian victims of the showa, some 65,000 names, and there are about a dozen Teppers on that list.</span> <span id="s500">I didn't jot down the first names.</span> <span id="s501">I'm guessing that some of them might be relatives, but I don't know how common or uncommon the name Tepper would've been at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">01:12:54 In trying to find out what happened, uh, what little research I've done, uh, haven't found very much, the particular [clears throat] organization [clears throat] in Vienna I have not contacted directly.</span> <span id="s503">I suppose I could.</span> <span id="s504">Um, the, what, if they have the names, the last name Tepper, would ha-, wanna know the first name.</span> <span id="s505">My cousin, uh, I don't know if I stated this before, but when my father, af-, right after the Anschluss, my father decided he wanted to go, he applied for a visa to the United States.</span> <span id="s506">He also applied for a visa for Argentina, 'cause one of his brothers had moved to Argentina in 1930.</span> <span id="s507">That brother's son now lives here in the States.</span> <span id="s508">He's a, also a doctor, does the same thing I do as a radiation oncologist.</span> <span id="s509">He got interested in genealogy.</span> <span id="s510">He has dug up people, gone back to the, way into the 1800s, and if I get a list of Teppers, let's say, from Vienna, I would compare their first name with his genealogy list, and I might be able to come up with something.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">01:14:19 Um, also a lot of our relatives are in...in, uh, Israel.</span> <span id="s512">I went to Israel when I was in the army.</span> <span id="s513">I spent two weeks in Israel.</span> <span id="s514">I can tell you it's a lovely country, I enjoyed every bit of it, and everybody asked me, “Well, what was the food like?”</span> <span id="s515">and I can tell you I have no clue, because there wasn't a single meal for two weeks that we didn't eat in someone, in one of my relatives' place.</span> <span id="s516">The only one that was unhappy was my son, who was six months old, he was my second child.</span> <span id="s517">He couldn't stand the Israeli milk.</span> <span id="s518">He was on orange juice and apple juice for two weeks.</span> <span id="s519">He was only six months old, but he would spit out the regular milk, the condensed milk, whatever kinda milk, he would go [makes spitting out sound], pooey.</span> <span id="s520">So that was fun.</span> <span id="s521">Yeah, we had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">There're some other things that I could tell you about my kids that you can cut it out if you want.</span> <span id="s523">My son, my, this is the little kid that I was telling you about, he was blessed by the Pope.</span> <span id="s524">He sat in the Pope's lap.</span> <span id="s525">He was blessed by the Pope.</span> <span id="s526">John, not the earlier, one, the one that was, skinny one.</span> <span id="s527">If you wanna hear the story, I'll...</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Yeah, I'd love to hear the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">...tell you.</span> <span id="s530">I was in....</span></p> <p><span id="s531">[logistics discussion] ...question, and this has nothing to do with your individual recollections.</span> <span id="s532">It's more just pure sort of theoretical, and I truly am asking this of everybody I talk to about the story, and indeed, it's a question that I'm not even sure there's a good answer to, and the question is why the Krauses did what they did, and perhaps it's something you've thought of over the years, being one of the beneficiaries of what they did, with the help of others, certainly.</span> <span id="s533">But what are your thoughts?</span> <span id="s534">Why do you think they did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">01:16:19 I never, obviously, questioned, at my age, what, six and a half years [clears throat], the whys [clears throat] of the whole trip.</span> <span id="s536">In later years, I sort of thought about it, simply because it happened to me, and not necessarily that I was any bloomin' genius, and then later on when I got into the story, when I had to do this projection for the convention, I just hadda stop and think of the risks that were taken by certain people, and the whys.</span> <span id="s537">And I think the whys, the whole idea of why, I think the Krauses, especially Gilbert Kraus, from what I know, and I'm not saying this to distract anything from Mrs. Kraus, but I didn't know her that well, were just [clears throat] very philathro-, philanthropically oriented.</span> <span id="s538">Uh, he...he was a successful lawyer.</span> <span id="s539">He was an artist.</span> <span id="s540">He had that aura about him that if he felt [clears throat] something could be done that was worthwhile, he would undertake it, uh, and I think he also had, from what other people tell me, had the ability to project to other people the worthiness or unworthiness of the particular cause.</span> <span id="s541">The idea of rescuing children initially, at, way back then, was simply because I, well, not simply, because I think he knew that there were other organizations involved, but those organizations were having a lot of problems, obviously with visa, with transportation, with finances.</span> <span id="s542">I think that he realized that let's also help.</span> <span id="s543">His circle, the Brith Shalom group in Philadelphia, was made up mostly of professionals, so I don't think that there was a monetary problem, or there wouldn't have been, and even if there were, I would be, venture to guess that Kraus, I wouldn't surprised, as far as I know, if he didn't give more than half the money out of his own pocket.</span> <span id="s544">And I think he was just an individual who looked at the pra-, who, number one, realized the problem, now this is the basic thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">01:19:11 As I said before, the, most of the people in the United States knew about the entire anti-Semitic events in Europe, all relegated to adults.</span> <span id="s546">They had seen Jews come over from Europe, Einstein [clears throat], uh, all the guys, uh, Korngold, all the...the guys from the...the movies and so on, uh, even, uh, Peter Lorrie, I don't know if you know him, he was Jewish, he was Hungarian Jew.</span> <span id="s547">So there was this knowledge of adult persecution [clears throat].</span> <span id="s548">There was not that much knowledge of children's pre-, persecution, but he knew about it, I [clear throat], I'm sure by looking into the other groups that were bringing in children.</span> <span id="s549">And I think that started it, and then it was just a question of, of course we have to do it.</span> <span id="s550">This is the right thing to do, this is what we can do, let's go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s551">And I think it was just a matter of philosophy, of knowledge of what was going on, and of the ability to do it.</span> <span id="s552">And then I think he enjoyed the whole thing, to begin with.</span> <span id="s553">I've never, I don't remember that much about him, but I've never seen him when he wasn't smiling.</span> <span id="s554">Although there was one story that one of the children says that he had a big argument with an S.S. officer, and he was poundin' the table and so on, but I don't remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">I've heard the same story, but you never know.</span> <span id="s556">I never met him, but everything you're saying about him certainly [inaudible] with the way members of his own family have described him.</span> <span id="s557">He was somebody who set his mind to doing something and figured out a way to do it, and then saw it through.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Wasn't gonna let anybody stand in the way.</span> <span id="s560">Well, we've covered a lot of ground, and sometimes Dave has a little detail or two that I miss, but let me just ask you if there's anything else that I haven't asked that comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">No, I can't think of anything else.</span> <span id="s562">The, my problem is, as I told you, I don't remember that much [clears throat], very little, and as I said, if it wasn't for the letters that I got from the kid or the pictures that my father took, I wouldn't remember anything.</span> <span id="s563">Well, maybe I just got psychological wipeout [chuckles].</span> <span id="s564">What can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Dave: Just wondering, your father had been out of work for a while, but he managed to make it to England.</span> <span id="s567">Did you get support from other family, support from organizations, and how did your mother make it, just in terms of financially, how did your parents make it to England?</span> <span id="s568">Do you have any sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">01:22:33 My parents made it to England, as far as I know, through, I believe through the or-, HIAS organization.</span> <span id="s570">Um, how, the exact details I don't know.</span> <span id="s571">Um, I've been to the HIAS organization here in New York, but they don't have records of HIAS’ effort to England.</span> <span id="s572">If HIAS had brought my parents to the United States, there would be a record here [clears throat], but HIAS somehow, I believe it was HIAS, got them to England, and obviously they must've paid for it because we certainly had no money, and, although, as I said, many Jewish families were still working and earning some sort of a living.</span> <span id="s573">I don't think that they would have been able to finance, uh, or be in a position to finance two people going to England, although obviously it's not that expensive as going to the States.</span> <span id="s574">But if you have nothin', it's expensive.</span> <span id="s575">And, uh, no one that I know of has really told me anything else, so that's my belief.</span> <span id="s576">I know it was not by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">SP: And so nothing your father told you in later years kind of filled in some of the gaps in terms of his part of the story or your mother's part of the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">01:24:04 Not really.</span> <span id="s579">Not really.</span> <span id="s580">Um, my father and my mother, it's not that they didn't talk about what happened in Europe.</span> <span id="s581">They did, because during my y-, growing up years in Bridgeport, there were quite a number of families, not rela-, well, one relative, but other number of families who had been friends with my father in Europe, and they had made it to the United States, and they, we, no television or anything, we just went visiting, you know, two or three times a week to this person's house or that person's house, and, uh, I was never given a babysitter.</span> <span id="s582">I always tagged along; I sat and read and so on, and the way they talked, from what I remember, is they were all helped by organizations.</span> <span id="s583">Whether those organizations were directly Viennese organizations [clears throat], or HIAS or something, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">SP: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Dave: Do you remember making friends at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Mean at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">01:25:21 I don't remember anything, uh, particular.</span> <span id="s589">Uh, I do have a picture, or no, was it...?</span> <span id="s590">I got a picture that was sent to me by Tamar, and it's me, her, and her brothers, so I guess we were friendly.</span> <span id="s591">And the other friend was this little girl Vera Aberbach, 'cause she's my little girl, you know, my little, I like to call laughingly now my little shipboard romance.</span> <span id="s592">Uh, I have pictures of her, you know, with...with, and, uh, but any particular individual, I can't even remember whether there, I had my own room or I had a roommate.</span> <span id="s593">So for some reason or other, I have these things blocked out.</span> <span id="s594">I suppose I could go to a psychiatrist one of these days and see what's goin' on, but [chuckles], I'm too old for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">SP: When was the first moment you thought of yourself as an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">01:26:31 The day I got, I arrived in the Bronx, because everybody spoke English, and in the apartment house where we lived, we had a lot of young kids my age and so on, and the two, uh, sisters that I lived with, they only spoke English, so after a while, I spoke English and I was an American because downstairs in the back yard, we had a little back yard in this apartment house, and everybody would call, “Mommy, I want somethin',” and I used to call up, “Tante,” my aunt.</span> <span id="s597">And I was an American when finally I said, “Auntie!”</span> <span id="s598">That's when I became an American, when I went from Tante to Auntie.</span> <span id="s599">And actually at one point I ca-, I called her Mommy, and she got very upset, and said, “I am not your mother.</span> <span id="s600">Your mother is coming.</span> <span id="s601">You didn't know, really know, I am your aunt.”</span> <span id="s602">She got very upset with that, I remember, so I called her Aunt, from the back yard in, my back yard in the Bronx, that's when I became an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Good.</span> <span id="s604">Excellent.</span> <span id="s605">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">All right.</span> <span id="s607">You're quite welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">[end of recording] Erwin Tepper page PAGE 10</span></p></body></html>
