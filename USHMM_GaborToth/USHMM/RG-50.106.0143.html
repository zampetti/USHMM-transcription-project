you were born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: No, it is not.</span> <span id="s17">My name at birth was Horst Alfred Taucher.</span> <span id="s18">And Horst – Horst became Horace and Alfred became Fred.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And where you were born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born January 29th, 1933 in Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family first.</span> <span id="s22">Ho – How long had the family been in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: In this area, actually – in Washington, D.C., not very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: No, no, no, I meant in – in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Oh, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s26">Well, I cannot tell you exactly, but I do know that my father was born in New York, New York, in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s27">In fact, he went through high school in New York and then went to Germany with his parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Were – were – were his parents born in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s30">I do not know if my grandparents were born in the U.S. I – I think they were born in Germany, lived here and then went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s31">And when my father was, like I say, 19 years old he went to Germany with his parents.</span> <span id="s32">He learned to be a tailor while in Berlin and he did get married very late in his life.</span> <span id="s33">He was married, I think at – about the age of 42 or 43 years to my mother, who also – it was my mother’s second marriage.</span> <span id="s34">And my mother was born in Oberschlesien, that’s near Breslau, which is now Poland.</span> <span id="s35">And my brother was – she had a number of brothers and sisters all in Oberschlesien and they were dentists and lawyers.</span> <span id="s36">She had one sister who was an opera singer by the name of Rosie Albach(ph) Gerstel.</span> <span id="s37">She actually passed away about a month before I learned that she was living in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was about a two and a half hour drive from where I lived in Seattle, Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What are your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father’s name was Julius Taucher, and of course he succumbed in Auschwitz in 1943, short – almost immediately after he was arrested.</span> <span id="s40">My mother’s name was Teresa, but she was born – her maiden name was Gerstel, g-e-r-s-t-e-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And your brother’s name and his a – and when was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My brother’s name now is Henry Ernest, but he’s born – when he was born it was E-Ernst Henry.</span> <span id="s43">And he was born January 3rd, 1932.</span> <span id="s44">He’s a year older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Yeah, and did – did – do you or did you have other siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, from – a – a stepbrother, so to speak, from my mother’s first marriage, she had son, which was Klaus Gerstel.</span> <span id="s47">And in a way he c-committed suicide.</span> <span id="s48">He was arrested, or on the way to be arrested in 1942.</span> <span id="s49">And when the SS came to arrest him, at that time we – he was living in the apartment, it was kind of ghetto apartment where they forced all the Jews to be in.</span> <span id="s50">And it had a circular type of a stairway.</span> <span id="s51">I think it had about six stories in that building.</span> <span id="s52">And when he learned that the SS were there to arrest him, he ran up to the top of the stairway, the circular stairway and dove headfirst, which of course killed him, but he says I am not going to go to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: How old was he at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: He wa – I think he was 19 or 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you have a – a large extended family?</span> <span id="s56">You’ve talked about your mother’s family, was your father’s family still in the United States or were there any in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, there were two nephews that left, one when all of this broke – came out in Germany about 1938, one nephew of my father’s went to South America, in Argentina, I believe, while the other one couldn’t make it to South America and he ended up in Shanghai during the war.</span> <span id="s58">And after the war, both of – which turned out to be our cousins, my brother and my cousin, they did go to the – came to the U.S. and lived – and settled down in Joplin, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: But while you were growing up, di-did you have co – before the war – while you were growing up, did you have contact with this – these extended cousins and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, we did meet and they were – they lived in Breslau and they were very well off.</span> <span id="s61">One cousin was crippled, but he still was very well off, he was a piano player and I think he also played some kind of a piano.</span> <span id="s62">He di – per-performed a lot of c-c-concert pia – he was a concert pianist, what I’m trying to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: While the other one, I don’t know what he did, but he did own an automobile and he made – drove to Berlin many times to visit us, or actually took us to Breslau and we – my father and his nephews were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Now let’s talk about your immediate family.</span> <span id="s66">Di – again, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Were your parents very politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Not to my knowledge, I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Do you know if they were Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s72">Neither one of my parents were very religious.</span> <span id="s73">We were a very Reform type of a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you have as – any kind of religious training as a very young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, we did go to temple every Friday as long as the temple was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s76">We even learned some Hebrew and we knew how to say the prayers in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And how did you learn these prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We did learn in the Jewish school, the two years – little over two years that I went through school, my brother three years, we did learn Hebrew – ah, the prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Neither my brother or I do know Hebrew now, but I still, amazingly enough I can still say some of the prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s82">What was the name of the temple that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s84">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s86">What kind of neighborhood did you live in?</span> <span id="s87">Was – was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No, I would say 90 percent were Jewish.</span> <span id="s89">My father was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in Berlin, very close to the Kurfürstendamm, which is the main shopping center, one block off from there, and it was primarily Jewish businesses or tailors in other stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s91">You said you went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s92">Again, we’re talking pre-war.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, my parents had a number of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s94">One of them – here’s the amazing thing, one of them was a midwife to my birth, and she was a high ranking member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s95">She had pictures of Hitler and her throughout her entire apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: And how did your father know her?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: That, I wish I had an answer, I do not know.</span> <span id="s98">I don’t know if my father hired her as a midwife, or if my mother did.</span> <span id="s99">But she was the midwife to my birth, may – possibly – my father was a man and ladies’ tailor, he’d sew dresses as well as man suits and maybe he did some clothing for her.</span> <span id="s100">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Her name was Gertrude Noelting, it’s g-e-r-t-u-d-e, which is a pretty common German fir – lady’s first name.</span> <span id="s103">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: T – t-r-u-d-e?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes, Gertrude, and her last name was Noelting, which is – using the American spelling, it’s n-o-e-l-t-i-n-g.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So, how would you describe yourself as a young child?</span> <span id="s107">Were you very independent, or were you more dependent on your parents type of child?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, I would say both.</span> <span id="s109">At first we, of course, were very dependent on our parents.</span> <span id="s110">But when our father was arrested in 1943, we realized – and I say we, my brother and I – realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s111">Well, we already realized what was happening back in 19 – November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s112">Of course, I was not quite six years old.</span> <span id="s113">I was born in ’33, January.</span> <span id="s114">And then I realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s115">And of course the Germans took my father’s store away.</span> <span id="s116">They destroyed his inventory.</span> <span id="s117">They destroyed his sewing machines.</span> <span id="s118">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s119">[coughs] They destroyed everything and then forced us to live, again, in a apartment unit there.</span> <span id="s120">There were – I don’t know how many different levels in that building there was, but we had one room below the kitchen.</span> <span id="s121">And that’s what we had and that’s what every other Jewish family had that had two kids.</span> <span id="s122">They each h-had one room with a kitchen, a small kitchen.</span> <span id="s123">It was one bathroom in each floor for every 10 in – in that floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So much had happened after you were born that you obviously weren’t aware of, being an infant and a – and a toddler and a small child.</span> <span id="s125">Before Kristallnacht, do you have any memories, or is that your first – do you have any memories of people in uniform, of flags, of anything, or is Kristallnacht your first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, no, I do have memory of that.</span> <span id="s127">Si -- again, since we lived in the Jewish area, the Hitler youth already, kids 10 years old, there were many a times when we – the kids spit – spit at us.</span> <span id="s128">We could not defend ou-ourselves, even if we were at such an age where we could have – maybe we’re stronger than those kids that spit at us or kicked us and so forth, but we were not permitted to hit anybody that had a Hitler youth uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: How did you know that, as a very young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: We were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: By?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: By the Jewish community, in school and so forth, that the best thing is walk away, otherwise it’ll be tougher on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So this is something that was discussed openly in school –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: – by your teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What about your family?</span> <span id="s138">Did you talk this over with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I – I – I wished I had an answer, I do not remember that.</span> <span id="s140">I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Now, what about with your brother?</span> <span id="s142">Were you very close to your brother as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: We were [indecipherable] – oh, my brother and I were very close together and even today we still are very close together even though I live in Seattle, he lives in Los Angeles, but we are very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So as two young boys, and I know very young, and you see these frightening situate – or part of these frightening situations, did you talk this over with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Okay, yes we did.</span> <span id="s146">Nowadays, even though my brother is a year older, he hardly remembers what transpired.</span> <span id="s147">He just wiped this whole thing out of his memory.</span> <span id="s148">If I can say here, last week, of course, was Holocaust Remembrance week.</span> <span id="s149">I was asked by the you – army in Fort Lewis, Washington, to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s150">The army there specifically asked Holocaust survivors, preferably concentration camp ho – su-survivors that have also been in the U.S. military, preferably in military service.</span> <span id="s151">I spent time in the U.S. Army, received a warrant officer commission during my service in Korea and I t-talked about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s152">I did want my brother to talk about the Holocaust, but – and the reason I wanted him to talk, he spent time in Vietnam, he spent 22 years in the arm – U.S. Army, retired a major, a much higher ranking officer than me.</span> <span id="s153">But he says he just can’t talk about it, he doesn’t remember it and does not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s154">And he’s [indecipherable] he can’t remember what has happened, yet he’s a year older.</span> <span id="s155">He cannot speak German any more.</span> <span id="s156">While he was in the military he was stationed in Germany, in Heidelberg for three years, but never had anything to do with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: When you were little, in the 30’s, were – did you and your brother talk about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No, not that I can recall.</span> <span id="s159">We started talking about it, together with our parents too, after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s160">And we were told, just try and stay away from Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s161">Don’t get involved, don’t get into arguments.</span> <span id="s162">And of course, in 1941, I think it was, when we had to wear the Jewish Star of David.</span> <span id="s163">And there were – it’s not just wearing the star, there were limitations made, what – we couldn’t go to a store except between five and six o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s164">And there were so many restrictions, we couldn't use public transportation.</span> <span id="s165">And my brother and I talked about it, but we knew there was nothing we could do and just hoping that it will get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What does a man like Hitler mean to a five year old German Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I wish I had an answer for that.</span> <span id="s168">I – I – we knew that he was not good for us, but we always thought it would become better.</span> <span id="s169">And again, we were unique inasmuch our father was an American citizen.</span> <span id="s170">And our father never thought that he would be arrested and sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s171">He figured our family would eventually be given exceptions.</span> <span id="s172">He just didn’t think it would happen.</span> <span id="s173">And – go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: What language did you speak at home, since your father was American?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Only German.</span> <span id="s176">We did not know any English.</span> <span id="s177">In fact, when my brother and I came to the – the U.S. after the war, it was only German.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Do you know why your father didn’t raise you from birth to be bilingual because he’s – he had lived in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I think he was afraid to teach us English.</span> <span id="s180">Just – actually, my father, even though he was an American citizen, he served in the German army during World War I. And again, that was another reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War – World War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested.</span> <span id="s181">And even when my father lost his business, his tailor shop and was moved – a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had to go into slave labor, but he figured that’s the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced him into forced labor.</span> <span id="s182">And – but still he never thought that he’d ever be arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Describe the school you went to in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I wished I could, but I do know we had hundred to 150 kids in class.</span> <span id="s185">And that’s about all I can remember.</span> <span id="s186">I do not know the name of the schools, which I did learn last year when I found the ca – archives in the east of Berlin, in Potsdam.</span> <span id="s187">But other than that I just do not remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: But it was a Jewish school with Jewish children and Jewish teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: That is correct, but there were way too many kids in a class, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How old were you when you began school?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, I began school when I was six years old, in 1939.</span> <span id="s192">There was – was some kind of a school almost e-equivalent to kindergarten here, yeah, when I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So now let’s talk about Kristallnacht, because that was a pivotal point.</span> <span id="s194">As a five and a half year old, what – what do you remember about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I remember it was in the middle of the night, which I really think was about four in the morning, when all of a sudden – maybe I should go back a little bit before the actual Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s196">It was probably two or three days prior to Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s197">The shop windows were just painted with pic – Jude, which means Jew, in front.</span> <span id="s198">And – well, you couldn’t look out, they were just plain painted with cuss words, so to speak, being a Jew and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And you were old enough to know what that implied?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes, yes, I was old enough.</span> <span id="s201">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How did you – how does a young child interpret that?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Again, I wished I had an answer and could gi – tell you how my feeling was, but I thought it was terrible that the shop windows of my father were all painted.</span> <span id="s204">Very bad.</span> <span id="s205">And then my father was forced to clean and make those windows completely clean and it took him all day to have – I think he had two razor blades to scrape all the paint off.</span> <span id="s206">And – but he wer – every other shop owner, Jewish shop owner in the street was forced to do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you see your father do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, I saw, in fact, I tried to help.</span> <span id="s209">We – our – we tried to help him, but very little we could do, especially he only had two razor blades, and he was forced to do it.</span> <span id="s210">And it was two days later, after the windows were all taken – cleaned, that’s when then they shattered all the windows.</span> <span id="s211">And we lived in the back of the store, and of course we saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s212">We were scared, and I knew in my – I still remember my mother’s – my – my mother saying, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s213">They’ve took our store away, they’ve ruined everything.</span> <span id="s214">And I remember my father telling my mother, well don’t worry, that’s what we have insurance for.</span> <span id="s215">We have insurance for vandalism, for theft, and we’ll just have the insurance companies replace everything.</span> <span id="s216">Of course, that never happened.</span> <span id="s217">And I do remember this like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s218">Yeah, it was – I was five years and 10 month old.</span> <span id="s219">And you kind of grew up quickly and became mature prematurely.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Wh – to see Germans in uniform, what is that vision like for a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s222">I – I feared, especially the brown uniforms, which was in the SR, or the SA, or the black uniforms with a skull, which were the SS.</span> <span id="s223">We feared that.</span> <span id="s224">It was something that chilled your bodies, at least that’s what it did to me.</span> <span id="s225">I – I knew what it was.</span> <span id="s226">When I – it goes right back watching the Hitler youth uniform.</span> <span id="s227">When I see a kid in a Hitler youth uniform, I walked and tried not to be seen by them, especially when – going back to 1941 when we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s228">We just shied away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Did you have nightmares of –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Not as a child, but afterwards, and even occasionally when I – I’d – a year ago when I was in Berlin, I visited the old SS headquarters, which was Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9.</span> <span id="s231">And I – that evening I had nightmares.</span> <span id="s232">In fact, I was asked to give a taped interview over there.</span> <span id="s233">They had my record that I was tortured there.</span> <span id="s234">And yes, I had some pretty bad headquarters – I mean, nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So, le-let’s get back to Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Right, Kristallnacht –</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So you woke up the next morning, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s239">Well, I woke up when they shattered the window, just the noise from the window shattering and the noises.</span> <span id="s240">And again, you – down Jews, and so forth.</span> <span id="s241">A-And you – you don’t deserve to be living here.</span> <span id="s242">And I remember that li – again, like I said, like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s243">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Did you – did you share a room with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes, in fact we only had – actually we had two rooms.</span> <span id="s246">One room my brother and I lived – and these were small room, almost – what you almost have a – like a walk-in closet over here.</span> <span id="s247">And then my mother and I had another room.</span> <span id="s248">And we had a small kitchen and a small –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Yeah, but this was in the first apartment that you grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Okay, so then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: And then we had to move from that apartment into a smaller apartment unit.</span> <span id="s253">And this is where I said we had one room per family, plus a kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: He was there, too.</span> <span id="s256">Of course, I wa – remember, this was probably in fi – ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: No, no, no, no, we’re still at – at Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh, still at Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Yeah, let’s go through this –</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Oh, there we just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: – chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Okay, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s263">The Kristallnacht we were actually in the store.</span> <span id="s264">We had two rooms in the back of the store.</span> <span id="s265">In-Incidentally, that same store that I remember from Kristallnacht is still at the same location, it was not bombed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So th-the – the store windows were broken, your father said insurance would cover it, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Right.</span> <span id="s268">Then what happened, of course, insurance didn’t cover it, and the Germans gave my father, I think two or three days to move out and they told her that we have to move to this apartment unit, which was Commandant Strasse 63, I remember that address.</span> <span id="s269">And incidentally, when I again visited Berlin, I tried to look up that old apartment unit.</span> <span id="s270">Unfortunately it – it was bombed, but the entire block is flat because this – the old Berlin wall separating east and west Berlin went right through it.</span> <span id="s271">So that is no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s272">It’s just an empty lot right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: So it was late November, or early December ’38 that you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It was November, probably.</span> <span id="s275">Well, Kristallnacht was November nine and I would say about the 10th or the 11th – 11th or 12th when we had to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Oh, you had to move immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: We had to move immediately, I think the – two or three days.</span> <span id="s278">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Were you able to take everything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, they – they took most of our – everything – most of what we had they took away.</span> <span id="s281">They just scatter it out in the streets.</span> <span id="s282">We had very, very little to take along.</span> <span id="s283">Some clothing.</span> <span id="s284">I think my father had some – he must have suspected something, but some of the material that he made clothing out of, he had someplace else.</span> <span id="s285">And he did some sewing for us once we moved in the apartment, and he did this late at night, because there – after he was forced to work on the railroad, and – which was slave labor.</span> <span id="s286">But at night he would sew some clothing for us so that we had something to wear, because I think everything we owned really, was taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did you have any special toys or anything that you were able to take with you, you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No, they were – we had no toys, or – we – we just didn't grow up with toys.</span> <span id="s289">We – I think my brother and I, I don’t know what we did for play.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t think we played.</span> <span id="s291">We just – we just didn’t.</span> <span id="s292">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Even before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Even before Kristallnacht, yeah.</span> <span id="s295">We did – I probably should mention that.</span> <span id="s296">We lived pretty – pretty close to a small park and so forth, which had a river and so forth and I know there was one time when some Hitler youth pushed my brother into the river in Berlin.</span> <span id="s297">And my brother, of course, did not know how to swim at that time and he almost drowned and some German worker in a bi – on a bicycle saw my brother drowning and he jumped in and saved him.</span> <span id="s298">And of course, he had the Jewish Star on David on my – my brother had that on, but that German still saved him and made sure that my brother was alright and found out where we lived and took my brother actually home, in this apartment.</span> <span id="s299">Well, my father then, again had material and sewed him, this man, some clothing and so forth.</span> <span id="s300">Well, that poor ma – gentleman was arrested because he saved a Jew.</span> <span id="s301">And I do not know whatever happened to him.</span> <span id="s302">He was not permitted to talk to us any more, but I do remember that he was arrested for saving a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, I do not know.</span> <span id="s305">I wished – if I knew his name I would try – would have tried to look him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: So, you moved out of your apartment at – a couple days after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: And then what did you do?</span> <span id="s309">Did you still go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, I think – yes, we did.</span> <span id="s311">We went to school through 1942, again to a Jewish school, and of course there were many, many kids in one class.</span> <span id="s312">And learning, I would say most of my schooling was self studied at our mother.</span> <span id="s313">Yeah, I think probably our mother taught us more how to read than what we learned in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did your mother work with your father in the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No, not really, she pretty much took care of us, and again, gave us classes, how to write and read.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And did anything happen to your extended family on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well again, like I say, I had a stepbrother from my mother’s previous er – marr-marriage.</span> <span id="s318">And of course he killed himself the day he was supposed to have been arrested.</span> <span id="s319">And we’ve had – but most of our extended family, especially from our mother’s side, lived in Breslau, which is now Poland.</span> <span id="s320">And we had one aunt in Berlin, but she too was one of the early ones that was arrested and was in – shipped to Theresienstadt and I do not know if she died over there.</span> <span id="s321">We lost track.</span> <span id="s322">And I’ve done some research on it and I can’t find any record on her.</span> <span id="s323">And of course all of m – most of my father’s relatives either were – remained in the U.S. or went to South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s326">This is tape number one, side B and we’ve already talked about Kristallnacht and your moving into the n – into an apartment.</span> <span id="s327">Let’s now talk about your father, what he did after his store was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: It was shortly after Kristallnacht when his store was destroyed, his property taken away and we were forced into living into a big apartment unit where many, many Jews were forced to live.</span> <span id="s329">And my father was forced to work on the railroad.</span> <span id="s330">Rather than being a tailor he was forced to work doing hard labor.</span> <span id="s331">It was s – definitely slave labor.</span> <span id="s332">And he was actually forced to live there until hi-his arrest in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So, did he come back at night, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes, he did come back every night, completely exhausted.</span> <span id="s335">And I do remember that, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s336">I mean, he could hardly move, but he did come back and he ate what little food my mother had to cook for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Where did your mother get the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Well, that was another problem a-after the Kristallnacht, when she cou – only had a choice to go to – to stores by – owned by Jews, between five and six o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s339">And – and what I think my mother did, she went to the store long before five o’clock so that she would be one of the first in line to buy what necessary food products she could get.</span> <span id="s340">And it was very, very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Prior to that, I understand that the Germans forced the Jewish men to take the name in their identification papers of Israel and the mothers – or the women to take the name of Sarah.</span> <span id="s342">Did that happen to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes, it did.</span> <span id="s344">Their names became – the middle name was always Israel or Sarah and actually, I think even as boys we had – we became Israel, was one of the names.</span> <span id="s345">I just vaguely remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did your – did your parents say anything about that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Not really, not really, but yeah, I think every boy was Israel and every girl was Sarah.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did you have your own papers, or your parents ha-had you on their papers?</span> <span id="s349">A: I do not recall that, I think our parents had the papers, I don’t think we had our own papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, there was the anschluss in – in – in Austria.</span> <span id="s351">Did – were you aware of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: No, we were not.</span> <span id="s353">I did not learn this really, until I was older.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Had your parents, or especially your father, ever thought of leaving at this time, or did they make any efforts to try to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s356">Back in 1934, I understand, they did make an effort to leave and we all got as far as Holland.</span> <span id="s357">But – it may have been 1936, we got as far as Rotterdam I think, but I think the Germans already were doing a lot of things and even though they haven’t – hadn’t invaded Holland yet, but the – the – they forced my father to go back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s358">Apparently the – he didn't have the proper papers to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s359">And of course – and he had to pay – every penny he had, he had to pay just to get back to Berlin, and he just didn't have the financial resources to get us – to get us back out.</span> <span id="s360">But then again he was so convinced, being an American, that they are going to leave him alone.</span> <span id="s361">They’ll give him a rough time, but he felt he’d be left alone.</span> <span id="s362">And again, like a lot of people, especially business people were arrested and sent to concentration camp, going back to 1941 and 1942.</span> <span id="s363">My father wasn’t arrested until 1943, and I think there are records here at the Holocaust Museum, the date he was arrested, even the transport number.</span> <span id="s364">I do not remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: But – but you were saying, to go backwards, that in 1936 he was able to get you – the four of you to – to – th-the four of you in family to – to Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of the dates, cause again I was too young, I – I know we moved someplace, and – but I do not know.</span> <span id="s367">But I know through when I lived with my cousins after I came here to the U.S., they said that he took us all once to Holland then had to turn back, but then he ran out of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Now, you’re attending school, you’re in your new, smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s369">Your father is doing slave labor, your mother is trying to get food and you’re attending school with your brother?</span> <span id="s370">And did you again have any contact with non-Jews then, children your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s372">Other kids, they wouldn’t – they wouldn’t dare associate with Jews, and it was strictly other Jewish kids that we were in contact with.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Did you play games as a child during this time?</span> <span id="s374">Were you ab – were the young children able to – I don’t want to use the word disregard, but you know, b-be normal children and play games during this very difficult time?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I do not remember, I do not think we played games.</span> <span id="s376">I just cannot remember that we ever played games.</span> <span id="s377">I think the times were so complicated.</span> <span id="s378">I think in school the teachers concentrated more in group learning and little bit of Hebrew, you know, we studied like the Hebrew alphabet and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: But your lessons were in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes, in German.</span> <span id="s381">Again, we did learn the Hebrew alphabet, the aleph, bet, gimmel, dalet and so forth, which I still know today.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What did the United States mean to a six, seven year old German child under stress?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It definitely meant, this is where we’re going to go.</span> <span id="s384">Our father always told us how great the U.S. are and someday we’re all going to move to the U.S. after the war is over.</span> <span id="s385">The U.S. will win the w – will prevail and we’re all going to go to New York.</span> <span id="s386">And we were pretty much raised with that mentality, that to live – to go to the United States, it was – we said America.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: What did it mean to you, what did it represent?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: It represented i – I guess you could say freedom and that it is the best country in the world to grow up.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So you continued school in 1940.</span> <span id="s390">Were you aware – granted, you were seven – you know, young, of what Hitler was doing and invading other countries in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s392">We were aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How did you know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Did you have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, we had a radio and we heard it on the radio and we listened to Hitler and his other cronies, and yes, we were fully aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Do you remember his voice on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Oh yes, I remember his screaming, definitely.</span> <span id="s399">Occasionally, which we weren’t supposed to, I – this is just – as we are talking now, I do remember once in awhile, illegally, we took our S-Star of David off and did attend a movie thea – watched a movie, maybe a comedy or something, that we’d go to a public movie.</span> <span id="s400">And of course in these movies they also had all this prop – propaganda.</span> <span id="s401">And I do remember that now, but I never thought about this until right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: How did you know you’d have to wear a Star of David?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Oh that – every – I would say even a five year old kid knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I think it was publicized – told by our parents, and everybody.</span> <span id="s406">We just knew we were inferior citizens and we had to wear that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Did you feel inferior?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: We didn’t feel inferior, but we knew to the Germans we were inferior.</span> <span id="s409">And I think it – I probably shouldn’t compare, but I will.</span> <span id="s410">I think it’s the same way when the Afro-Americans at one time had to sit at the back of the bus, they had separate public restrooms.</span> <span id="s411">And while I don’t think the average child – black person realized that they were treated as a inferior citizen, but they were treated that way, and this is, I think how we felt in Berlin during the war, in Germany during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And t-tell me about the yellow star, where you wore it and how it was put on your clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: The yellow star was on our left chest, really, and it was – had to be sewn on, it had to be sewn on neatly.</span> <span id="s414">And of course our father being a tailor, he did that.</span> <span id="s415">And we – when we went outside into the public streets, we had to wear it.</span> <span id="s416">And if you didn’t wear it you were arrested, whether you were a five year old or a 55 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What did you feel like wearing a yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: I felt scared, always scared, because I knew that other kids could come, even if they were three year old, or four year olds, they could spit at us, they cou – if they had a stick they could hit us and we couldn’t hit back.</span> <span id="s419">And so yes, I was scared and really afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s420">And again sometimes I think we were blessed, both my brother and I, we did not really look Jewish.</span> <span id="s421">So sometimes we did take the chance and did not wear the star and did go out and went to a movie theater and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Wh-When you say you didn’t look Jewish, can you describe yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, you know, there are certain people, you can tell they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s424">Oh, you may make a mistake, like even some Egyptians look Jewish, but we were not obvious Jewish looking, otherwise we never would have survived living in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Were you fair coloring, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes, yes, very fair coloring and sometimes people thought my brother is a little darker colored, but he looked more Italian, and in those days Italy and Germany were still allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So did you – w-were you ever did – spat upon?</span> <span id="s428">Did any of the nay –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Oh yes, yes, we were spat upon many times.</span> <span id="s430">And like I said earlier, my brother was pushed in the water, almost – could have drowned.</span> <span id="s431">And we underwent – probably my brother went through s – more severe pan – punishments than I was, for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Because he was a year older?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, I think so, or it’s just where he was at, we weren’t always together.</span> <span id="s434">And he was – he was mistreated more than I was, I believe, at the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And what about your other Jewish friends, other little Jewish boys?</span> <span id="s436">Did you act out any of this or talk this over with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Again, here is a mind that is blank, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s438">I do remember being with other Jewish kids, sometimes walking to school together.</span> <span id="s439">And I don’t think a day went by where we didn’t – weren't – not beat up, bu-but mistreated by the German kids, especially Hitler youth kids and Hitler youth was 10 years and ol – over.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Do you get used to this treatment?</span> <span id="s441">Does a child get used to this treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, they expect it.</span> <span id="s443">It’s – I don’t think you ever get used to something like that and I know I never did, but I expected it and it’s just something I knew was going to happen.</span> <span id="s444">I don’t know how else I can explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And again, did you confide in your – in your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh yes, oh definitely.</span> <span id="s447">And again, I don’t remember what my parents said.</span> <span id="s448">My mother just said well, those days will pass by, just be patient.</span> <span id="s449">These were, I think, what my parents were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So you felt your parents were a comfort to you at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Oh, very much so.</span> <span id="s452">Very much so.</span> <span id="s453">Our parents did comfort us as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And so then it’s 1941, you’re still at school, your father is doing slave labor –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: – and life goes on.</span> <span id="s457">Any recollection during that year, or even with Pearl Harbor in December, any – the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December and Americans going into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No, we – we didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s459">I did know that Franklin Roosevelt was president.</span> <span id="s460">I do remember this, but I do not remember Japan bombing Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s461">I never even heard of Pearl Harbor, so no, I did not know anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Now, you said this German woman who was your midwife was an acquaintance of your family.</span> <span id="s463">Was there any relationship with her during this time?</span> <span id="s464">Had you known about her at this point in your life, in 1940 – ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her apartment.</span> <span id="s466">And she had a – an apartment in the better part of Berlin, Schöneberg and we did visit her.</span> <span id="s467">Sometimes she had dinner for us.</span> <span id="s468">And, in fact there were times th – when she picked us up where we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with her to her apartment and there we were very safe because she also – I think she had a special I.D. or something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler.</span> <span id="s469">So nobody bothered her when – especially when we were with her, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Was she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No, she was never married and at that time she was probably in her middle 50’s.</span> <span id="s472">She died when she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: I’m sure you’re always asked how do you explain the fact that this Nazi party member was so helpful to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Even at that time, and we’ll get to more later, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn’t figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing what has happened, my guess is that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler and deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s477">She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s478">Once he learns what’s going on, he’s going to stop that.</span> <span id="s479">And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if she would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to Hitler.</span> <span id="s480">A-And I think that’s the only reason that I can think of why she helped us.</span> <span id="s481">And of course she mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world.</span> <span id="s482">And I think that’s the only reason.</span> <span id="s483">And I think I’m the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Did she deli – she did not deliver your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No, she did not.</span> <span id="s486">My brother I think was delivered at a Jewish hospital in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And how is that you were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Again, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s489">I – I – I th – somehow either my father or my mother befriended her, and I guess this would have been my mother’s actually third child, me, and I guess she wasn’t as uncomfortable being assisted by a midwife.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So, were you born at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s492">In fact it was – my father ha – actually, he had two stores, one of them was within two blocks of each other and the first store is where I was born.</span> <span id="s493">I think that was in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse.</span> <span id="s494">And then later on Leipne(ph) strasse, which was at Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So you would go t-to her house and – the four of you a-and visit with her, and fi – through 1941 and did life go on in this difficult way til 1942?</span> <span id="s496">And then what happened in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Well, in 1943, one day our father didn’t come home.</span> <span id="s498">And again, we did have a number of n-non-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s499">And it was one woman that says, leave your apartment, the Germans are arresting everybody.</span> <span id="s500">They took your father away, he’s – he was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: So that’s how you heard, through this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: That’s right, who was a friend of ours and she – I think she owned a – a laundry or something like that.</span> <span id="s503">But, just outside the Jewish section of Berlin.</span> <span id="s504">And – and she is the one that told us, and it’s – really, it was very close.</span> <span id="s505">When we gathered the few things that we owned – as I say we, my mother, my brother and I, the few things we owned, we left the apartment and there was a back entrance.</span> <span id="s506">We went out the back entrance and we understand that the SS came up the front entrance.</span> <span id="s507">So we just barely escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: How much time elapsed between the time the woman told you and the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Again, I’m guessing here, I would say less than an hour.</span> <span id="s510">It was very, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So your father was taken away when he was on the labor battalion?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: That is correct, he was, right from work taken away.</span> <span id="s513">And again, from what I see, the record showed he was shipped to Auschwitz and probably – again, talking to Auschwitz survivors, they say normally what happened is when they arrived in Auschwitz, they had two sides.</span> <span id="s514">One side they were tattooed and they were in the work parade, the other side di – were not even – didn’t even get a number, they were put in the gas chamber and my father was one of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Your father was what, late 40’s, or 50 by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I would say he was – I think my father was in the early 50’s at the time.</span> <span id="s517">Well, my father, I – I can probably figure it out.</span> <span id="s518">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s519">He was born either 1981 or 1991.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Now, you mean 1891.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yeah, I mean 18 – 1891, yes, or nin – 1891, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So he – so he was 53.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Right.</span> <span id="s524">And again, he was murdered in Auschwitz, roughly two days after he arrived there from what other people tell me that have been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So your mother got you two boys together.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: And where did she and you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Okay, again we’re going right back to this Nazi midwife.</span> <span id="s529">She, because of her friendship with Hitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of Berlin.</span> <span id="s530">And only high ranking SS officers could have cabins there.</span> <span id="s531">And this is where she put us.</span> <span id="s532">She told all the other officers, military officers, mostly SS, that our father was a – a – I guess a colonel or something in the army – ar – German army and he was out in the fronts in – in the front line in ka – Russia.</span> <span id="s533">And we lived there, right amongst the SS, or the wives of the SS.</span> <span id="s534">But then of course wintertime came along –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Well – well now wa – wait a minute, what about papers?</span> <span id="s536">Did you mother – wh-wh-when this happened in the beginning, what kind of papers did your mother have?</span> <span id="s537">She didn't have these papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Fraulein Noelting, the midwife, she provided my mother with papers, where we went under different names and us kids went under different names.</span> <span id="s539">And again, she was right up with her party and we ha – there was bombing and a lot of civilians were killed during bomb air raids back in the 40’s.</span> <span id="s540">And so this midwife, she found out what family with – what mother with two children were killed at a certain – our age, were killed at certain a-a-apartments, or houses.</span> <span id="s541">And she got us those types of identification.</span> <span id="s542">And that’s how we lived.</span> <span id="s543">Of course, then after six months or so, people were wondering – sometimes my – maybe I should go – my brother and I would act like we’d go to school.</span> <span id="s544">We’d wear the bags to go as if we were going to school, but we never did go to school.</span> <span id="s545">We didn’t dare go to school because of every child had to go into physical training and then you take a bath.</span> <span id="s546">Well, us being boys, being circumcised would give us away.</span> <span id="s547">So we never went to school.</span> <span id="s548">But then people got kind of suspicious, they – nobody ever saw us in school, other kids.</span> <span id="s549">So this midwife says, you have to leave from there.</span> <span id="s550">And then again we took on different I.D. and we moved from area to area, place to place.</span> <span id="s551">Some of the places I do not know, but I –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So the first location you stayed for six months.</span> <span id="s553">What was your new identification, who were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I was – it so happened I was Horst Grossman.</span> <span id="s555">My mother was a Grossman, I don’t know what her first name was, and my brother was a Grossman.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: These were German, not Jewish Grossmans.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: These were German named people that were killed during an air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: She obviously felt very positive towards Jews then, she had no negative feelings towards Jews, or – or were – or did she and you were just special cases?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: I believe we were special cases because she used to complain about Jews, they all have so much money and they are ruining the economy of Germany.</span> <span id="s560">I used to hear her say things like that, even to my mother.</span> <span id="s561">And yet she said, but our family was different.</span> <span id="s562">She was very strange.</span> <span id="s563">Well, when – after the war, when only my brother and I survived, she was real upset when we told her we’re going to try and go to America.</span> <span id="s564">And she was very upset because she says, you are Germans, you can’t leave.</span> <span id="s565">And when my brother and I did leave Germany, and we wrote to her once we got to the U.S., she would never answer us, she was so upset.</span> <span id="s566">She said we don’t show any thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What would you two boys do during the time the Jew – the German children were in school?</span> <span id="s568">What would you do, you’d take your schoolbags and what would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: What we did, we – this was out in forest type of an area and we would just walk inside the forest.</span> <span id="s570">In fact, we would pick mushrooms, this is what we ate all the time.</span> <span id="s571">My brother and I and our mother too, we got to know every edible mushroom.</span> <span id="s572">And instead of going to school, we would pick mushrooms, so that’s what we had to eat most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: What did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Oh, I think she – she stayed at the cabin and she washed clothes.</span> <span id="s575">I think she did wash clothing fo – wash and did other things for some other people to get some income.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: On – in your free time, or when the German children were not in school, did you play with them, did you talk with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s578">I think we did, but I can’t be sure.</span> <span id="s579">There are so many blanks that I can’t really tell you for sure if we did or not.</span> <span id="s580">I think we did.</span> <span id="s581">I do know – one thing I do remember, during the – there was a vacation period about four weeks or so and there was one kid – a German kid, not Jewish, who drove – he was 15 years old and he drove a milk delivery vehicle, it was a motorized vehicle.</span> <span id="s582">And I – I helped him deliver the milk.</span> <span id="s583">And he was pretty much a real Nazi believer, Hitler youth, but somehow he – he befriended me, and we became friends.</span> <span id="s584">Of course, I didn’t tell him who I was.</span> <span id="s585">And I know there was a time where I helped him deliver the fresh milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: What’s it like – what was it like to see a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Fear.</span> <span id="s588">Just plain fear.</span> <span id="s589">Of course you saw it, no matter where you went you saw it.</span> <span id="s590">And the swastika was actually easier to get used to.</span> <span id="s591">The thing that bothered me was the – the skull that the SS had on, or even some soldiers that were affiliated with the SS all wore that – that skull.</span> <span id="s592">That was, to me, worse than the swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Well, because I knew that were the ones that would kill the Jews – they would kill us, and we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Were you ever afraid when you were with these young German boys that you would let your guard down and say something that was inappropriate?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No, again we were mature enough.</span> <span id="s597">We never were – feared that because we knew we would not let our guard down.</span> <span id="s598">And that includes my brother too.</span> <span id="s599">We knew what to say and what not to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Even – even at such a young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes, yes we did.</span> <span id="s602">And we also knew that we were not to expose ourselves in a restroom or so forth, because we knew if we did we would be dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s605">This is tape number two, side A. Just exactly wa-was this cabin – where was this cabin located?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Okay, it was east of Spandau and the place was called Berger Uplager(ph).</span> <span id="s607">And again, to get there you had to actually walk, probably worth a 20 or 30 minute walk from the train station, and right in the midst of a forest.</span> <span id="s608">And that was the name of the place, Berger Uplager(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: What was the atmosphere like there among the – the SS families, the women and the children, what is – was it a joyous atmosphere, a relaxed atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Very joyous and a relaxed atmosphere.</span> <span id="s611">Again, these were all, like I said earlier, SS.</span> <span id="s612">They had the food, they had everything.</span> <span id="s613">And you didn’t think there was a war going on, to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Did the SS people come to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: No, they didn’t, because again they knew to – as far as they knew, our father was in the Russian front and – and my mother always showed like she was so sad, she didn't know where Father was exactly, that they pretty much left her alone, as far as I can remember.</span> <span id="s616">And we didn't mix too much with the – and most of them didn’t even have kids there, and – because again they were probably, most of the people there were in their late 30’s, early 40’s and they had kids who are – probably were in se – in Seattle, I almost said.</span> <span id="s617">They were probably in Berlin taking training in the Hitler youth, because they were all Hitler youth age.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So you really didn’t talk to the adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s620">I cannot really remember it.</span> <span id="s621">I’m sure we did, but again there’s so many blanks.</span> <span id="s622">I’m sure we did but I can’t – I just cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And you did not know at that time what happened to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No, we knew he was in Auschwitz because he wrote, right after he was arrested he wrote a postcard and said that he is in Auschwitz, things are going fine and will see you all when I get back.</span> <span id="s625">And that’s the – and this postcard was written to this midwife and she was a little concerned that they would watch her because she got a letter from a Jew.</span> <span id="s626">But again, with her affiliation with the SS and with Hitler, they never did anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: What did she do – what did she do, this woman, Frau Noe-Noelting, as a job?</span> <span id="s628">As work, as an occupation.</span> <span id="s629">I know she was a midwife, is that what she continued to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes, she continued being a midwife and she brought a lot of kids into this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: But as a member of a Nazi party – of the – of the Nazi party, did she have any specific duties?</span> <span id="s632">Or she was just a good Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: She was just a good friend of Hitler and some of the other people, but she did not like Himmler, Goering or Goebbels.</span> <span id="s634">She said they’re – those are the people that are at fault what is being done to the Jews, and as soon as Hitler knows about it, it’ll stop.</span> <span id="s635">In the meantime, she did her job as a midwife.</span> <span id="s636">I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Did she ever see Hitler during the time that you were with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I don’t believe she did.</span> <span id="s639">She tried to, but he was so busy that he just didn’t have time to see her.</span> <span id="s640">But I do know she has made attempts to talk with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: How did she get this connection, was it through her family?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s643">I do not know how she and Hitler became friends, but like I said earlier, there were pictures of her and Hitler together, even Hitler had her – his arm around her in pictures of that.</span> <span id="s644">How they became friends, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So then you left this first location because she told you it wasn’t safe to stay and then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Again, sa – I – we lived in different places throughout Berlin, where I do not know.</span> <span id="s647">But then even that got a little bad –</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: You went back to the city then?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: To the city.</span> <span id="s650">We went back to the city of Berlin.</span> <span id="s651">But then – things got bad, but again this midwife found another family that was wiped out, by the name of Schmitz.</span> <span id="s652">And it so happened this woman had children, two boys, almost our age and they wi – they looked a li – somewhat like us.</span> <span id="s653">So we actually took their I.D., pictures of them, and we moved to a reso-sort area in Binz auf Rügen.</span> <span id="s654">It’s a eastern part of Germany and my mother had a job there as a – as a maid at one of the – at a big hotel again, where soldiers took their own rest and recuperation.</span> <span id="s655">And she was – my mother became a maid over there, and had an income.</span> <span id="s656">But again, after about four months we had to move, because again, school.</span> <span id="s657">We didn't dare go to school.</span> <span id="s658">In fact there was a time where all the German kids had to work out on a farm and pick vegetables and things, so there was no school.</span> <span id="s659">And so my brother and I were out there with the other German kids, boys and girls, pulling vegetables and things like that.</span> <span id="s660">But then it got – school started and we had to move because we didn’t dare go to school again.</span> <span id="s661">And so we went back to Berlin, again this midwife, she mailed – via mail she sent us the proper documents that we needed in case there’s an I.D. check.</span> <span id="s662">But at that time we almost has the proper I.D. for Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s663">But we were lucky that there was no I.D. check on our way to Berlin, back from Binz auf Raden(ph) on the train, because we would have been caught of the – it was very, very, very scary when we went in public transportation.</span> <span id="s664">But we ended up back in Berlin.</span> <span id="s665">I think we kept that identification until the end of the war, the – by the name of Schmitz.</span> <span id="s666">I don’t remember what first name we had, but again we moved from area to area and then, I don’t know where now, in 1945, let’s say –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Well, le-let’s wait a little bit.</span> <span id="s668">Did you have any kind of a shorthand communications wi – communication system with your brother, so if you were out together and there was a problem, you could kind of signal him?</span> <span id="s669">Do you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s670">So you wouldn’t have to talk, but you could – either with your eyes, or ar – in – anyway – or hands, or with your mother?</span> <span id="s671">Any – do you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s672">Any kind of back-up protection if things got really bad and you really couldn’t say it openly.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes, we had some notes.</span> <span id="s674">For instance, if we – if one of us, my mother, brother or I noticed something that could be a possible Gestapo checking for I.D., if we thought it was, we’d make some hand notes and we slowly in di – different pe – not together, we’d disappear.</span> <span id="s675">Because some there, sometimes you could almost guess it.</span> <span id="s676">We got so we could feel that that was a Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: So you had hand motions?</span> <span id="s678">A: Yeah, we had the hand motions and then we’d me – le-leave one at a time, and we wouldn’t ha – never go into a restroom, because they – they caught a lot of il – so full – so-called illegal people in restrooms.</span> <span id="s679">And so we usually stayed out and tried to move away within two or three blocks from where we were at, then we’d get back together.</span> <span id="s680">Yes, we – we did have that, just like we always had a meeting place if we got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Wherever you were.</span> <span id="s682">Was this – did this change day by day?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Not day by day but maybe every third day we’d say, well, if we get separated, let’s meet at this train station, or lets meet at this building.</span> <span id="s684">We always decided on a place to meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So you – well then what – again, what did you and your brother do during the day while the other children were at school?</span> <span id="s686">You – you are 11 and he’s 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: [sneezes] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yeah, again, I d – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s690">I just don’t know what we did.</span> <span id="s691">We’d walk.</span> <span id="s692">Of course now you know you had air raids almost daily.</span> <span id="s693">The U.S. used to bomb daytime, the British bombed at night and we spend a lot of time in air raid shelters.</span> <span id="s694">Especially when we’re g – now going to 1944, a lot of our time was spent in air raid shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Did you go to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: No, we never did go to a church, and of course temples were not available.</span> <span id="s697">But we – we did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Why didn't you go to church to show you’re a good Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: We – I don’t think we were at places long enough, but for some reason we never did.</span> <span id="s700">Again, our mother must have had a reason not to go to a church.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Di-Did she always provide enough food for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Well, she tried to, but there were times – there were times where we didn’t have anything to eat for two or three days.</span> <span id="s703">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s704">The – probably where we had most of the food where we did not starve was that short time that we lived in that summer cabin in Berlin and also when we were in that hotel, this resort hotel in Binz auf Rügen.</span> <span id="s705">There was had ample food.</span> <span id="s706">Again, I think my mother took it from the kitchen at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: When you walked down the street in Berlin, were you aware that there were other Jews on the street who were hiding?</span> <span id="s708">Did you sense other Jews being nearby who were under false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: No, could not tell.</span> <span id="s710">We did not.</span> <span id="s711">I’m sure there were and they probably didn’t know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s712">No, I ba – I believe that the – the Jews that were living like we were, under false – assumed names and so forth, did not know anyone else that was in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Di – had she delivered any other Jewish babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I do not know, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s715">I think I was probably the only one that she had delivered.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you know if she sheltered other Jews?</span> <span id="s717">A: Definitely not.</span> <span id="s718">I know we were the only ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: She’d say that, she’d tell my mother that.</span> <span id="s721">She said, you are the only ones I am helping and I know that if Hitler catches me, he’ll free me and everything will be by – will be forgiven and the concentration camps would be eliminated once Hitler knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Did she tell any of her family or her friends about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: She had an adopted daughter, and she’s the only one that knew.</span> <span id="s724">And her daughter was in the photography business and I think she developed things against – for the – for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s725">Pictures that were taken an that were maybe tough to – to really make a good picture out of, she was able to i-improve the – the pictures of it.</span> <span id="s726">I mean, you know, photography was still not too good at the time.</span> <span id="s727">In fact, she would even color them if they wanted colored pictures.</span> <span id="s728">She would actually manually color the pictures.</span> <span id="s729">And, but again, she kept her mouth shut, and she was the only one that knew that we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: And what was her name and did you have contact with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes, m – in fact, my brother saw – visited her when he was stationed in the army in Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: No, I mean, during the 40’s wer – did you have contact with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes, I did have contact.</span> <span id="s734">In fact, this one picture that I showed to you here, she took that.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: I meant during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: During the war, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s737">In fact, she lived with g – Noelting in Berlin, in Schöneberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Traute, t-r-a-u-t-e, I think it was Holinova, h-o-l-i-n-o-v-a.</span> <span id="s740">I could be wrong on the spelling.</span> <span id="s741">But she too has died now.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: So, did you stay in different places once you were back in Berlin, or did you move around?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: We moved around all the time and until the beginni – beginning of 1945 when we lived in different subway stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Why weren’t you in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well, it got so that we didn’t know where to go any more and the bombing was ak – like I said earlier, day and night.</span> <span id="s746">And the shelters, the bomb shelters were overcrowded.</span> <span id="s747">We couldn’t get in, and to be in a bomb shelter again as kids, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s748">And we were afraid to be caught in a bomb shelter, so we stayed in subway stations, which a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the subway stations were pretty deep down and they were probably one of the safest places to be until bef – the day before the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Did people question you on the street why you weren't in a Hitler youth uniform?</span> <span id="s750">Did anybody ever ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Only once I can remember where I was asked, why aren’t you in uniform, I’d say it’s being cleaned.</span> <span id="s752">And that’s the only time I was ever asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: So what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I wished I could give you an answer for that, I do not re – I do not remember.</span> <span id="s755">I don’t know what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: And you still thought your father was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes, we did, yes.</span> <span id="s758">Again, our father had us convinced that he being American, they’ll give him a bad time, but he’ll be released.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: What was your mother’s state of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: She too thought that he would be freed.</span> <span id="s761">She definitely did.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was she calm during this time?</span> <span id="s763">What – how would you describe this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: She – to us she was very calm, and always the – things will get better, don’t fear.</span> <span id="s765">We’ll be together with the father, then we’ll go to America and so forth.</span> <span id="s766">To us she was calm, but I’m sure she was in constant fear.</span> <span id="s767">I’m just certain about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Then she had no contact with any other Jews as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: As far as I know, no.</span> <span id="s770">I know there was a – another person, not Jewish, who helped us out quite a bit, he was a doctor and also analyzed x-rays and so forth, he had a x-ray business.</span> <span id="s771">And he – he was an M.D. and I think the was partly the underground, because th – he was arrested at the tail end of the war.</span> <span id="s772">And I know he is the one that gave my mother quite a bit of information, and where we can stay and where we could not stay.</span> <span id="s773">But other than that, my wa – mother didn’t have too much contact with anyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Ho-How did she get in contact with him and what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I do not know his name and I don’t know how they got into contact, I – I do not remember it.</span> <span id="s776">I do not even know what part of Berlin that was, but I do remember having gone there a couple of times, maybe even more than that.</span> <span id="s777">But I do not know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So now you’re sleeping in the subway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: How do you sleep in this –</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: H-How do you sleep in the subway station?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Well again, we were kids and we’d just go on a bench and lie down on a bench.</span> <span id="s784">It was very cold at times, but you got used to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did you feel very old going through these terrifying experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Well, let’s put it this way, I did not feel like a 10 - 11 or 12 year old.</span> <span id="s787">We grew up, we matured very, very early in life.</span> <span id="s788">And yes, I see other – I would see other 10 year old and I see how – what a child they were and I say, they must be a lot younger than me.</span> <span id="s789">I do recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Did you feel very German then, or very Jewish, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Sometimes I felt German.</span> <span id="s792">I had to feel German in order to save myself, but I – deep inside I felt Jewish, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Were you angry then that you were Jewish and so you had to go through all these terrible – this terrible ordeal?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: No, I was not angry, I was just wishing why can’t we be like anyone else.</span> <span id="s795">I was not angry being Jewish, no, but I just was wishing I could be – that this discrimination against the Jews wouldn’t be, that it would stop.</span> <span id="s796">And why am I different than any other German kid?</span> <span id="s797">I – maybe I regretted it, but I was not angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And – and then what?</span> <span id="s799">So you – you – as I said, you were living in the subway station until?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s801">Actually, what happened is we were at one subway station, and all of a sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing through there.</span> <span id="s802">And all the people that were at that station started moving – the s-subways were not running – on the tracks to another station.</span> <span id="s803">And very few of us had anything to eat or to drink.</span> <span id="s804">Some people started drinking the water that was stuving – coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think typhoid or whatever it brought.</span> <span id="s805">And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it, and we kind of kept each other from drinking it.</span> <span id="s806">We knew that that is dirty, we’re not going to drink it.</span> <span id="s807">And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next station, which was not flooded then.</span> <span id="s808">And we probably spent – and my – our mother was still alive then, and – who kind of kept us, too, from drinking it.</span> <span id="s809">And we got to the other station that was not flooded, and – but we needed water, and so my mother went outside the station upstairs to a fire hydrant to get water.</span> <span id="s810">And she didn't come back down.</span> <span id="s811">And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the fire hydrant.</span> <span id="s812">And actually she was killed, I don’t know if it was German or Russians, but the crossfire between the Russians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s813">And so – and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the subway station by German soldiers.</span> <span id="s814">I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down.</span> <span id="s815">And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that subway station with Tommy guns – machine guns in each hand and everyone – everyone down in that subway tunnel started clapping.</span> <span id="s816">There were a few German soldiers there, they threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s817">And again, this was at Anhalter Bahnhof, which is no longer a subway station, but the station is still there as a – a memorial, so to speak.</span> <span id="s818">And that was the end of the war for us.</span> <span id="s819">And we then –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Let – let – let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s821">I’m sure it’s painful, but you come upstairs and you see your mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: It was very [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: –an-and how did you break the news to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Okay, at the time I didn’t know if she really was dead or just injured.</span> <span id="s825">And I told my brother I saw our mother, she was up at the fire hydrant, but the Germans wouldn’t let me get to it, and I think she is okay, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s826">That’s really what I told him.</span> <span id="s827">And I didn’t know, I – it was just the way I felt.</span> <span id="s828">And of course we never did see her again.</span> <span id="s829">And, in fact, up to this day, I do not know if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of – especially women and children, they loaded them on truck and s-shipped them to Russia, especially women.</span> <span id="s830">In fact, after the war my brother and I were loaded onto trucks many times to be – to go to Russia, but we knew Berlin like a book, we – there wasn’t an address we couldn’t find.</span> <span id="s831">And we, for awhile were guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Previous to you losing your mother, were di – di – wasn’t there a situation where you were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s834">We didn’t – we didn’t cover that.</span> <span id="s835">Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under false I.D., and again in a streetcar, and I was there by myself.</span> <span id="s836">I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us.</span> <span id="s837">And we’d do that, sometimes my brother went to see her.</span> <span id="s838">And this was on April 15th, 1945.</span> <span id="s839">I was caught in a streetcar.</span> <span id="s840">And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check.</span> <span id="s841">And they had an I.D. check and I had the I.D., I was – I don’t remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz.</span> <span id="s842">But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me.</span> <span id="s843">So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn’t have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s844">And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with.</span> <span id="s845">And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they – I was arrested.</span> <span id="s846">They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9.</span> <span id="s847">That was the SS headquarters.</span> <span id="s848">And they had a kind of a basement, like a dungeon where they questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that place.</span> <span id="s849">And again, according to the archives – the archives in Germany do not s-say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15th.</span> <span id="s850">It only showed that on April 17th, I was shipped to Dachau on a t – railcar, a train.</span> <span id="s851">Well, for t – two days there, between the 15th and the 17th, I was tortured, but they didn’t get any information out of me because they beat me and things they did, pulling teeth out, I have dentures.</span> <span id="s852">Pulling out teeth without any Novocain or anything, and usually I’d pass out, and they finally gave up and stuck me in one of those trains.</span> <span id="s853">And that was April 17, according to the archives.</span> <span id="s854">And I ended up, after two days roughly, i-in Dachau, which I believe was the only concentration camp that still was open and there with a route between Berlin and Munich.</span> <span id="s855">And of course Dachau was very close to Munich.</span> <span id="s856">I never left the train.</span> <span id="s857">The train, railcar that I was in was mostly – were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers.</span> <span id="s858">There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know.</span> <span id="s859">Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor of the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer.</span> <span id="s860">I don’t know how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full.</span> <span id="s861">So there were a number of people that I know were dead.</span> <span id="s862">There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities.</span> <span id="s863">And it was – it was the worst hell I’ve ever been in.</span> <span id="s864">And it was either April 19th or April 20th, I do not know.</span> <span id="s865">Again, during th – fr – apar – from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20th.</span> <span id="s866">It may have been th-the day before.</span> <span id="s867">But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the door of the railcar that we were in.</span> <span id="s868">Why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s869">I kind of think is that the German guards – they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29th.</span> <span id="s870">And this was let’s – let’s say this was April 20th.</span> <span id="s871">And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they’d get better treatment.</span> <span id="s872">And so that door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out.</span> <span id="s873">I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s874">There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn’t too far.</span> <span id="s875">We ended up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers.</span> <span id="s876">They were not SS, they were German soldiers, and they were teaching the Hitler youth kids how to fire a rifle because at that time now they made everybody defend the Motherland – the Fatherland.</span> <span id="s877">And anyhow, the Russians overpowered the few German soldiers.</span> <span id="s878">Over half of the Russian soldiers were killed themselves, they were POWs, right, and they didn’t have no weapons.</span> <span id="s879">But in groups they just attacked the Germans, and like I say, over half were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: – of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s882">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Okay, after the Russian soldiers ar – overpowered the Germans, the Hitler youth, even though they had weapons, but they were so frightened, they just froze.</span> <span id="s884">They just looked in awe, and the Russians did shoot every one of the Hitler youth, they killed every one of them.</span> <span id="s885">And then they started to move someplace and I wanted to follow them, and they said nein, nein, no you can’t.</span> <span id="s886">And so what I did is I looked at the Hitler youth kids that were dead and took off the uniform of one of the kids that was my size and put on that uniform.</span> <span id="s887">And I followed the railroad tracks, because I knew there were old Autobahn, the freeway – not – not freeway, highway, was right next to the railara – railroad car.</span> <span id="s888">And so I walked towards there and I decided to flag down a car.</span> <span id="s889">And the first car that went by was a German SS car, a Mercedes and two SS officers were in.</span> <span id="s890">Well, they stopped, and I said I’m – I need to go back to Berlin, I was at this camp here and Russians came by and they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s891">I’m the only one that is left aline, and I want – a-alive, I want to go back to Berlin and meet – and go to my mother.</span> <span id="s892">And they said come on in, jump in, we have a message for Hitler, that’s where we’re going to.</span> <span id="s893">Now remember, I didn’t – the only language I knew was German.</span> <span id="s894">I talked like a German, I was German, except they didn't know I was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s895">There were numerous roadblocks from Munich to Berlin, however, we were waived through every roadblock because they were again – I don’t know what rank they were, but they were high in the SS and they had a little sticker on the windshield, and they hardly even ever slowed down for a roadblock, it was opened up for them to go through.</span> <span id="s896">And they dropped me off at Anhalter Bahnhof, which was – actually, that was our meeting place where we always said if we get separated, this is where we meet, and – and every day we’d go and meet there.</span> <span id="s897">Well, we got to – I got to Anhalter Bahnhof and there was my mother and brother who almost fainted when they saw me in the Hitler youth uniform.</span> <span id="s898">But anyhow, this was – you see, it’s so close to the war and we did then go to the Noelting, the midwife, we went to her home, and I did change clothes.</span> <span id="s899">I didn’t dare stay in the Hitler youth uniform because they could take me like they did take Hitler youth kids and gave them a rifle to defend.</span> <span id="s900">So I didn’t want to be in the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s901">In fact, I think my brother and I both, she put Band-Aids on our feet like we were injured, and then put on civilian clothes and that’s really how we lived until the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: How do you explain how you kept your equilibrium through all of this?</span> <span id="s903">You were so young, you were 12 years old.</span> <span id="s904">Let’s even go back to the railcar.</span> <span id="s905">Well, no, let’s even go back previous to that, to how you were tortured.</span> <span id="s906">Ho-ho – you were 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s908">Well, they were so animal-like.</span> <span id="s909">They had, like I say, after some pain, I passed out.</span> <span id="s910">And by the time – I was never – why I didn’t talk, I do not know, I cannot tell you that.</span> <span id="s911">Another thing I want to mention, which I think nowadays, I was so thin.</span> <span id="s912">I mean when – after the war, when we lived with the Russians, I think I weighed 50 some pounds and my brother wasn’t much heavier, that those SS who I got the ride with didn’t recognize tha – how thin I was.</span> <span id="s913">I probably looked more like an eight year old than a 11 year old, but they didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s914">I think their whole thing was to get to Berlin to let Hitler – probably what I think happened is because they knew the allies were outside, probably to ask Hitler what should be done.</span> <span id="s915">They could have been general officers, I’m – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s916">But, I mean, we practically flew to Berlin.</span> <span id="s917">I mean, they drove that Mercedes as fast as it could be driven and of course they’re – the only vehicles you saw on the Autobahn were military vehicles.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: And then when you were in the railcar, was that a cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: It was a cattle car, and this is why even today, right here at this museum, I – I’ve been here four or five times, I have never been able to step foot in that cattle car that is right here at this museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: How do you explain your keeping your composure, your sanity in a car like that, when you were – when you were going through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Well, I knew I was going to die.</span> <span id="s922">I knew my – that s – that I was caught, they’re taking me to a concentration camp, I didn’t know which one and I knew the end of my life was near.</span> <span id="s923">And I accepted that.</span> <span id="s924">And of course my brother and my mother, we all knew that we are living from day to day and it could be at any time we could be arrested and put to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s925">I mean, we knew our father went to Auschwitz, we knew that.</span> <span id="s926">Even though we thought, again, him being an American, he will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Did you know what a concentration camp was?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yes, yes, we knew and we knew they were gassing Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: It spread.</span> <span id="s931">I believe the – this midwife told us.</span> <span id="s932">But we knew, and th-the word spread.</span> <span id="s933">The Germans knew it.</span> <span id="s934">Of course they said they didn’t know, and now they all say they never knew, which is a lie.</span> <span id="s935">They all knew.</span> <span id="s936">And of course the way they beat people up into the railcars, I mean, not only Jews, also Jehovah Witness was one, gay people and of course Poles or other foreigners that were enemies of Germany.</span> <span id="s937">And they were just beaten, literally beaten up into the railcars and squeezed together like cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Did the older people in the railcar help you, as a 12 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on the ground, because they knew if I would fall, I wou – could be dead, because I’d be trampled on.</span> <span id="s940">And I will say the Russian – incidentally, they treated me well, and treated my brother well after they liberated Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: But in the railcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I-In the railcar they treated me very well.</span> <span id="s943">They kept me up and made sure that I stand up and don’t try to lie down.</span> <span id="s944">And especially, I mean I – sleepy.</span> <span id="s945">You know, I was there at least two days, nothing to eat, nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s946">But they kept me from lying down.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Was it dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s949">There were – there was some light coming in daytime, but very little.</span> <span id="s950">And with all the people stacked in, it was mostly dark.</span> <span id="s951">And it was still – well again, we were so close together.</span> <span id="s952">That’s one good thing, otherwise we would have been freezing.</span> <span id="s953">I mean April in Germany still gets – the nights get very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Was it all men, or was it men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Men and women, men and women.</span> <span id="s956">And it was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s957">There are things that – well, I was young enough really, I didn’t know about a woman having a period.</span> <span id="s958">I didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s959">Of course, that transpired there.</span> <span id="s960">And a lot of people had diarrhea, and again, no sanitation facilities.</span> <span id="s961">And it’s – that’s what went on there and I’m not the only one that suffered like that.</span> <span id="s962">And – but again, the railcar was probably as wor – as bad as having been tortured, because in the torture, so much of it, I passed out.</span> <span id="s963">And though I woke up with pain, but still, the railcar was the worst thing that could have any – happened to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Besides the Russian soldiers being of help to you, did you sense that people were helping others?</span> <span id="s965">Other people were helping –</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: You mean in the railcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: – other victims in the railcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No, I think – I think most of them were in there much longer and were too weak to do anything.</span> <span id="s969">And I think the Russian soldiers that helped me and were helpful, I think were c-caught on the eastern part of Berlin, which the Russian came in on.</span> <span id="s970">I think they were caught shortly – about the same time I was, or maybe it – two or three days sooner.</span> <span id="s971">But of course they were not tortured, they were just loaded on that railcar til it was completely full.</span> <span id="s972">But I don’t think they were in too long and were still strong enough to survive this ordeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: What does death mean to a 12 year old?</span> <span id="s974">You said you knew you were going to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: It meant strictly, that’s it, you’re going to be – you’re going to be away from this world.</span> <span id="s976">It’s – to me, I knew death.</span> <span id="s977">Of course, remember, I saw my stepbrother kill himself.</span> <span id="s978">And I knew he was dead, he would never be alive again.</span> <span id="s979">And that’s really what it meant to me, I’ll be just like Klaus, my s-stepbrother.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Were you afraid of death?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: No, that’s the thing.</span> <span id="s982">My brother, and I think this is probably why he can’t remember anything, he feared death, he – he feared the bombing.</span> <span id="s983">We sometimes had to hold him or he would run right into the fire, practically.</span> <span id="s984">He feared death and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s985">I just took it one day at a time and always took it, and I guess I still feel like that today.</span> <span id="s986">I mean, I spent time in Korea and I just felt like, when the time comes, I – I’ll die.</span> <span id="s987">And I thought my time was there when I was in the train, especially with all the dead people around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: When you got back to your mother and your brother after the railcar, did you tell them what you went through, and the tortures?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes, I told them where I was at, what happened.</span> <span id="s990">And of course, my mother just cried and hugged me and so thankful that I survived.</span> <span id="s991">And she suspected that is what had happened, because we had never been separated more than a – a day, never.</span> <span id="s992">No, I think one time, my mother couldn’t come back and she was gone for one night, but then we got together again.</span> <span id="s993">But other than that we’ve always spent the nights together, wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: You were very, very quick thinking and quick witted to put on that Hitler youth uniform and flag down that car.</span> <span id="s995">What do you attribute that to?</span> <span id="s996">That was a very brilliant decision, and you were 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Well – that’s right.</span> <span id="s998">Well, I think my brother would have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s999">Again, maybe our mother brainwashed us in there – in this.</span> <span id="s1000">And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us whenever things like happen, what to do, I – I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially when I couldn’t follow the Russians and here I was all alone.</span> <span id="s1001">And – and I decided, well, the only way I’m going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn’t be forced to take a rifle and start shooting.</span> <span id="s1002">And again, I didn’t know like, at the time that the allies were out or the – outside the Dachau camp that the ger – Russians were outside, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1003">But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested.</span> <span id="s1004">We knew it was the end of the war coming.</span> <span id="s1005">Well, we knew that and th-the word spread.</span> <span id="s1006">People, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much.</span> <span id="s1007">And I used to hear people say, look at all those tanks there – to other people – look at those tanks, there’s not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they’re out of gas.</span> <span id="s1008">And so the Germans weren’t quite as afraid any more.</span> <span id="s1009">But of course afterwards, and I – I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we’re – we have a secret weapon.</span> <span id="s1010">This just when the Russians were really fighting for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they’re going to kill the – all the Russians that are coming in.</span> <span id="s1011">There were still those fanatics around and I heard women say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I’m going to pour boiling water on them.</span> <span id="s1012">And I’ll do everything, they’ll never get me, I’ll kill them, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1013">Of course, after the Russians came in, oh how sweet you are.</span> <span id="s1014">And – and honestly, the Russians would wa – rape the women right out in daylight in the street.</span> <span id="s1015">Again, things I didn’t know until it came true.</span> <span id="s1016">And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to – I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they’re gonna put boiling waters on them.</span> <span id="s1017">That’s how they felt then, and then they were friends.</span> <span id="s1018">So, the Russians that came into Berlin were completely uneducated.</span> <span id="s1019">They had no common sense, and they were – in fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian – I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other – some reason other arrest.</span> <span id="s1020">And they were – they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well.</span> <span id="s1021">And of – of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French, the British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: When – so you – le-let’s get back just chronologically, you – you – the ra – you found your mother, you saw that your mother had been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: You came downstairs, you told your brother and then the Russian soldiers came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: What happened, we went to the Russian soldiers and we found somebody that spoke German – no, we even found a Jewish soldier.</span> <span id="s1028">We found a Russian Jewish soldier who spook – spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1029">And so we communicated in Yiddish and said we were hungry and we told them we were Yiddish, right?</span> <span id="s1030">And they gave us food, they gave us water.</span> <span id="s1031">They actually nourished us back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did you feel liberated at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes, we felt liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: And what did that mean to you boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Freedom, food.</span> <span id="s1036">We can talk freely.</span> <span id="s1037">We don’t have to worry about being arrested by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1038">We don’t have to worry about being beaten or spit upon by other German kids.</span> <span id="s1039">That’s what it meant, it just meant full freedom.</span> <span id="s1040">And – and after we received food and everything from the Russians, we then – this Russian soldier, I don’t know what his rank was, or what, but he was – this Jewish soldier was a little bit more educated and we became the guide to his officer, and showed him where to go in Berlin from point A to point B, because we knew it so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Wher-Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: We were still living with the Russians, very close to this Anhalter Bahnhof, the train station where our mother was killed, we think.</span> <span id="s1043">In fact, this soldier wa – by the time we went back outside the train station, our mother was not – there was nobody by this fire hydrant.</span> <span id="s1044">And that Jewish soldier did try to find our mother, but couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1045">So we do not know if she was taken to Russia or buried, or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: And you s – you still expected to find your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1048">But then after – after the division between the Russians, the – and the Americans when Berlin was divided up in sectors, and then we went to live with that midwife, we knew that – that – we found out that the people that were in concentration camp by that time would have been back in Berlin or we would have known and our father would have known to get in touch with this midwife.</span> <span id="s1049">And when he didn't – and the same thing with our mother – we knew our mother – again, we didn't know, and of course, I still don’t know.</span> <span id="s1050">Even today I don’t know if our mother died in this crossfire or if she was sent to Russia, because the Russians did take thousands of – of kids and women to Russia.</span> <span id="s1051">I’m sure you are aware of that.</span> <span id="s1052">And so that, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1053">We did, before we came to the U.S., we had to identify our mother, and we had to get a birth ad – a – a – a death certificate of our mother.</span> <span id="s1054">And we said well, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1055">Well, if you want to leave Germany you need to have a death certificate.</span> <span id="s1056">So there were a whole bunch of people and so we just identified yes, that was our mother.</span> <span id="s1057">They showed us pictures of several people, I said yes, that’s our mother, so we could get a death certificate.</span> <span id="s1058">But if she really died there, we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: You stayed with the Russian soldiers –</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: For a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Well, I – I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1063">There must be records.</span> <span id="s1064">When – when Berlin was divided into the four sectors, it was until the division, we stayed with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1065">One thing is, we were their guide, but trains didn’t run and things like this, until the division really, and wa – there was no way we could have gotten to Schöneberg to the – to the midwife, and we didn’t even know if she was still alive or – or what.</span> <span id="s1066">But it was after the di-division that we went to Schöneberg, to the midwife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Before that did you meet with people – meet people who had also been in hiding, other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Well, you saw the picture of the synagogue, but no that was – no, I didn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: I-I meant in the very beginning, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: At the very beginning no, we did not meet anyone that was in hiding.</span> <span id="s1071">No, I’m co – incorrect there.</span> <span id="s1072">I know of about two or three people that also received this concentration camp I.D. that were not in hiding, that were out of concentration camps, because the Russian government, or the Russian military produced these I.D.’s that we were in concentration camp very close to where I was at at that Anhalter Bahnhof.</span> <span id="s1073">And I – I did meet two or three people, elderly people that did get out of a concentration camp and also received this I.D.</span> <span id="s1074">But as far as people that were living in hiding, at that time no, I ha – did not meet anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: So then you – you went back to this woman –</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: -- the – the midwife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: To the midwife.</span> <span id="s1079">And of course – she actually signed us up, we did go to a German school there after the war for a little bit, but not very long, about two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: She was willing to take you back in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yes, she took us back in and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did you assume your old names, your real names?</span> <span id="s1083">A: Yes, we – we assumed our real name and she even provided clothing for us because we wore practically rags.</span> <span id="s1084">But we weren’t the only Germans that wore rags, you couldn’t buy clothing during the war.</span> <span id="s1085">But anyhow, she got us some clothing and signed us up to a school.</span> <span id="s1086">And I think she started me in the second grade and my brother in the third grade in Germany.</span> <span id="s1087">But we only went to that school for about a month or two, and then the British military, they inherited what used to be a – a rest and cu – recuperation camp outside of Berlin, about three or four hours drive out of Berlin in Lüneburg, and where the Germans had a rest and recuperation camp.</span> <span id="s1088">And they took a bunch of – at that time now, kids that were either in hiding or in concentration camp, they looked those people up, including my brother and I, and in British ambulances they drove us to this former [indecipherable] camp in Lüneburg, where we were nursed – we were given complete physical examinations and we were nursed back into health.</span> <span id="s1089">And that is straight – before we went to that camp, my brother and I then got to know some of the Jewish American soldiers who opened up the synagogue, and this one, Werner Nathan was his name, a private in the U.S. Army, and he is the one that actually was responsible in opening up that synagogue at Rosh Hashanah, and he got us in touch, or got the Joint Distribution Committee in touch with us, who sponsored us to come to the States.</span> <span id="s1090">Well, trying to.</span> <span id="s1091">And while we were waiting to co-come to the U.S., we went to this rest camp that the British sponsored, that should have been for, I think eight weeks.</span> <span id="s1092">For two months.</span> <span id="s1093">Well, we were there about three months when a American soldier, not Werner Nathan, some other American soldier came, looked for us and says we are going to be coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s1094">We have our – our visas and we’re going to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1095">So we left that camp early, went back to Berlin and he drove us back to Berlin and I don’t know if it was a private vehicle or U.S. Army vehicle, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: When you were in this rest camp, there were other Jewish children, did you talk and compare stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: No.</span> <span id="s1098">Nobody wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1099">They didn’t really want to talk about it, including me.</span> <span id="s1100">We just survived, and some of them were living in conditions like – you know, maybe in a ceiling someplace and never saw daylight.</span> <span id="s1101">Or somehow that they had – maybe people hid them, and really hid them.</span> <span id="s1102">And mo – and lot of the kids I know were in – out in farms someplace.</span> <span id="s1103">And – but again, lived in hiding where nobody knew that they were in that – a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s1104">And – but nobody really wanted to talk about it too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: What do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: I don’t think – even me at the time, I was still thinking, is this real?</span> <span id="s1107">Am I really free?</span> <span id="s1108">And yeah – and nobody asked.</span> <span id="s1109">I may mention something here.</span> <span id="s1110">Two years ago I met a woman, she too was in this rest camp.</span> <span id="s1111">We met each other in Prague at the Child Survivors of the Holocaust conference.</span> <span id="s1112">And – but if – we just didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1113">And when I went back to Berlin after they rescue – recuperating, and my brother and I, and we told the midwife, Frau Noelting that we were going to America.</span> <span id="s1114">And oh, she was upset.</span> <span id="s1115">She says, you’re German, you can’t go.</span> <span id="s1116">But we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: T-Tell me more in detail how you met Werner Nathan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: After the – Berlin was divided, again our father being an American and being pretty much told that we’re going to come to – go to America some day, we went to a U.S. Army camp.</span> <span id="s1119">And where we lived in Schöneberg was the w – American sector, fortunately enough.</span> <span id="s1120">And so we just went to an army camp and we started telling at the front gate really, is there anybody here that speaks German?</span> <span id="s1121">And most of them don’t, you know, and – and says yes, and they called this one private out, which was Werner Nathan.</span> <span id="s1122">He is ori – was originally from Austria and they went to the States before the war.</span> <span id="s1123">If he is alive he’d be in his 80’s now.</span> <span id="s1124">And anyhow, we talked with him – and he was very Orthodox, too.</span> <span id="s1125">And he says, well he’s in the process of finding a synagogue and they found a synagogue, the only synagogue in Berlin that was not burned.</span> <span id="s1126">And that he was opening up that synagogue for Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s1127">And that’s really how we met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So he stayed in contact with you from that day on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1130">And he is the one that contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Did you go to the Rosh Hashanah services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1133">This is a picture, and here is my brother and I at the Rosh Hashanah services right here in this picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: What were your thoughts during that service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Thanking God that we are alive, and – and afterwards this so – Werner Nathan forced us to study a little bit more Hebrew, and the various prayers.</span> <span id="s1136">And I think it was a month or two later that we – maybe not even that long, I don’t know exactly, is when we became Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1137">My brother and I were the first two Jewish boys Bar Mitzvah in Berlin after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s1140">This is tape number three, side A, and you had begun to talk about preparing for your Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Right, well, having been away from really, the Jewish religion for all these war years, we were taught by this American serviceman, who was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as much as a rabbi, and he made sure that we learned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1142">And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of the Jewish chaplains fr – chaplains from his American company in the army and we were officially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the various prayers.</span> <span id="s1143">And I do not know the exactly – exact date, but I would say it was some time in 1946 and probably I would – I’m guessing now, between March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: So you were already 13, cause you were 13 in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Ah, no I wa – that’s correct, I was 13 in January, so I was th – that’s right, I was 13 and my brother was 14.</span> <span id="s1146">And of course, he was a year late before he could be Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Did you want to have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes, we’ve always wanted to be Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1149">I mean, even though we were never very religious, we were very conservative, but it was always our parents saying that when – I remember always saying when my brother becomes 13 years old he’s going to be a man, he’s going to be Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1150">And the same thing was true with me.</span> <span id="s1151">And yes, I did want to be Bar Mitzvah and we were very proud when we became Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Can you describe what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: No, that I do not remember.</span> <span id="s1154">I do not remember, but I know there was a big party afterwards, at that synagogue, and it was a – a day of celebration, but what we did, I do not remember, but it was probably the most enjoyable time in our lives, from the day I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Who came to the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: A lot of Jewish, as well – Jewish U.S. soldiers, Russian soldiers and I’m not sure but I – something in my back of the mind, I – I’m sure that the midwife’s stepdaughter, who was a photographer, I believe she took pictures.</span> <span id="s1157">I do not have any of those pictures, but I b – do believe she was there taking pictures.</span> <span id="s1158">And that’s all I can really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Was it difficult not having your parents there at your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Of course it was.</span> <span id="s1161">We missed our mother, we wished our father could have been there even though we knew the fact that he was dead and perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1162">And so we – but we did miss our mother and again in – in th – at that time we still were not sure, we did not know whether she was still alive, or – or dead.</span> <span id="s1163">We didn’t know that, so yes, it was very, very hard not having our mother there, though we celebrated, it was joyous.</span> <span id="s1164">But we still wished that our mother could have been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Were you trying to locate your mother still, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Oh yes, all the time, we – whenever we learned of a place that had records, and regardless what section, whether it – whether it was French, British or what, we’d go over there and see if we could find anything on our mother.</span> <span id="s1167">But we, of course, never found anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Did Gertrude Noelting come to your Bar Mitzvah, or just her daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: I do not recall her coming, but I – I’m not 100 percent sure if her daughter came, but I – I really believe she did come and took fi – pictures, but I’m almost positive that Frau Noelting never did come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: So d – and you had the celebration at the synagogue itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: That is correct, they had a big celebration that we had food, and we had fruits that we haven’t – had never seen, like a banana.</span> <span id="s1172">We almost didn’t know how to peel a banana and I believe we had banana the first time since the war.</span> <span id="s1173">I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: And your relationship with your brother then, did it – it was still as intensely close as it had been during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Oh, very much so.</span> <span id="s1176">We’ve been very close, even though after we got older and came to the U.S., just like brothers one year apart used to fight and argue, which we did, too, but still we were very close and even today we’re still very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: And did you two talk about the wartime at that – in 1946, did you talk about the previous years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: No, we never did, even when we came to the States, we hardly ever talked about the war years.</span> <span id="s1179">It’s something that – and it was probably more so my brother than me.</span> <span id="s1180">He just did not want to talk about it and so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1181">He – he took the whole thing a lot harder than I did, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: And in order to get food you said you had this folder, this camp folder, the red – the red side of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Oh, oh, oh, that, yes, most people that were – that have survived from a concentration camp, that were in a concentration camp, first in Berlin were given a little identification by the Russian soldiers, it was in German and Russian, indicating that we were discriminated against and have survived a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1184">And it was a red sheet of paper with the concentration camp logo.</span> <span id="s1185">And once we – if – when we held that certificate going through lines, buying food or other items, we could just hold that and could go to the front of the line.</span> <span id="s1186">And there was not a single German that ever complained, us going to the front of the line.</span> <span id="s1187">In fact, they turned the other way, they didn’t even want to see this concentration camp logo, they all knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1188">And we had full privileges, even when we took a train.</span> <span id="s1189">Shortly after the war, some of the trains started running again in Berlin, and we could go to the train, never had to pay to ride the trains, I mean we had a free hand in Berlin right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Were you able to go back to your original house, original apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: The original apartment – well, the apartment where th – I call it the ghetto type of a apartment, where we were forced to live, that was bombed out.</span> <span id="s1192">That was no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s1193">However, both of the stores, the first store that I remember as a very small child, that my father had in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse and not very far, couple of blocks from there in Leipne(ph) strasse, which was the street where – that suffered from the Kristallnacht, that store was still in existence.</span> <span id="s1194">And I don’t recall us visiting either one of those stores right after the war, before we came to the States.</span> <span id="s1195">But I went back to Berlin for my first time in 1975, I believe, and I did visit that store.</span> <span id="s1196">And it didn’t change much, and I just, a year ago in berli – in April, a year ago when I was in Berlin, I did visit it and of course there’s the one on Leipne(ph) strasse was for rent and the one on Petsalozzi(ph) strasse, there was a Chinese family living there and also they had a store of Chinese artifacts and souvenir type items.</span> <span id="s1197">In fact, I stopped and talked with them.</span> <span id="s1198">Their son, it so happened, graduated from the University of California, spoke pretty good English and I talked with him for probably close to an hour.</span> <span id="s1199">And he found it very interesting that as a child I was living at that place, at a – it did some – was some major remodeling done and more space.</span> <span id="s1200">Well, we had two bedrooms and a kitchen and a bathroom in that store when we lived there before the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1201">A-And now it had some much nicer and more roomy type of bedrooms and it was almost like a very comfortable type of an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: When you were with – studying with this young American soldier, was he helping other Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: If he was, I’m not aware of it.</span> <span id="s1204">I don’t think so because he still was a soldier and I think he was a company cook and he still had to do his duties there and in his off time he worked with us.</span> <span id="s1205">So I doubt very much that he helped others, because we were not as a group.</span> <span id="s1206">He worked with us strictly as individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Did you learn English then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No, we did not.</span> <span id="s1209">We – the only word of English I knew was hello, goodbye and where’s the bathroom?</span> <span id="s1210">And thank you.</span> <span id="s1211">I think my brother learned a few more words of English.</span> <span id="s1212">But incidentally, both my brother and I were able to communicate in Russian.</span> <span id="s1213">We were not fluent, but we were able to communicate in Russian pretty good, because we’ve lived with the Russians for about 90 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: And you were able to pick up the ru – Russian language?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1216">We were able to, and like I say, communicate and pick up, right.</span> <span id="s1217">I have completely forgotten it, I still know a few words, but I could not carry on a conversation and I can understand very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: And then how much longer did you stay in Germany after your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Okay, again, I think the Bar Mitzvah was in the spring of 1946 and we left Berlin in September 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: I forgot to ask you an important question, did you get any gifts for your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I don’t believe we did.</span> <span id="s1222">I don’t recall that we received any gifts.</span> <span id="s1223">We were just so happy to be amongst our own without fear of being arrested.</span> <span id="s1224">That was a gift alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1226">Did you feel connected to the Russian Jewish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: At the time, yes.</span> <span id="s1228">The – we didn’t meet too many of them, but yes, they treated us well, and I was somewhat connected, but not as much as once the Americans came in.</span> <span id="s1229">I mean, we didn't even keep track of the Russian and Jewish soldiers, except some of them were at the Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1230">But we pretty much got connected to the American Jewish soldiers, both enlisted men as well as officers.</span> <span id="s1231">I even remember some of the names, Lieutenant Nowalski(ph), who helped us out, and there were a few other officers.</span> <span id="s1232">And the only names I can remember was Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) and Private Werner Nathan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Important names.</span> <span id="s1234">And the name of the synagogue, you said you’re not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: No, I wished I would know.</span> <span id="s1236">I don’t know the address, I – I do not know the name, but I do know it was the only synagogue not burned out, not burned by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: What was your relationship with the German children your age, the non-Jewish chil-children?</span> <span id="s1238">Did they talk to you, did you play with them, did you do anything with them?</span> <span id="s1239">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: After the war?</span> <span id="s1241">Well again, we went to school for two or three months after the war, and we played with them and I still sensed there was some prejudice towards the Jews by some of them.</span> <span id="s1242">But like I have shown you this – this is – the funny thing is is how I knew there was a write-up in this British magazine, The Illustrated.</span> <span id="s1243">And there were – was a picture of my brother and I in that Illustrated.</span> <span id="s1244">It was a German kid whose parents knew English and subscribed to that magazine.</span> <span id="s1245">And they are the ones that showed us that magazine with our pictures in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1247">You’re talking about the October 6th, 1945 issue of The Illustrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: That is the issue I am talking about.</span> <span id="s1249">And it was really one Jewish boy that was in our class after the war, in Berlin, that brought that magazine to school and showed it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1251">And so you s – how – you said you sensed some prejudice on the part of the German children.</span> <span id="s1252">How – an-an-and can you give an example?</span> <span id="s1253">A: They were not friendly to us aft – they know – knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1254">They could – they could see me go in front of a line to buy a loaf of bread, and they resented that.</span> <span id="s1255">The adults, they didn’t say a word, but th-the kids resented that.</span> <span id="s1256">Of course, they probably didn’t understand why we had those privileges.</span> <span id="s1257">But I-I di – definitely saw resentment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1259">Wat – was there any more overt anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s1260">Any spitting, like you said before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Not that I notice it.</span> <span id="s1262">Not that I notice.</span> <span id="s1263">I have notice anti-Semitism, especially in Munich in the last five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s1265">So you stayed, and you said Werner Nathan made arrangements with the American Joint Distribution – Jewish Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1266">And so can you – let’s just talk about th-those arrangements.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1268">Werner – we again explained to Werner – fortunately he was fluent in German, as he came from Austria – that our father was an American citizen, died in Auschwitz and we want to come – go to America.</span> <span id="s1269">And again he did, on his own, he contacted the Joint Distribution Committee in New York, and a-again, I don’t remember how long it took, but I know in the meantime we went to Lüneburg where we went to a recuperation camp sponsored by the British military, who put us back into health.</span> <span id="s1270">And it was an American soldier – in fact, I think it was that Lieutenant Nowalski(ph) that picked us up from Lüneburg, took us back to Berlin and it was – again, that must have been in late August, because September seventh we left Bremerhaven on the SS Marine Marlin, that was the ship, and went to New York.</span> <span id="s1271">And besides – just recently I met an old man in Seattle, who was a seaman on the sister ship of the SS Marine Marlin, who also brought Jewish immigrants to the U.S. And usually people don’t know anything about, never heard of a SS Marine Marlin, and he knew right away, he said that that was his – the – his sister ship.</span> <span id="s1272">So it’s quite a small world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: What were your feelings about leaving Germany?</span> <span id="s1274">You said that you felt partly German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I felt more – I was German and I acted like a German during the war, living under false or assumed names.</span> <span id="s1276">But the day we walked onto the ship, it was the greatest feeling you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1277">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Did you bring anything special with you from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: No, we did not.</span> <span id="s1280">We didn’t want anything.</span> <span id="s1281">Like when the Russians came into Berlin we – my brother and I each picked up some very expensive Leica cameras from photography stores.</span> <span id="s1282">Everybody else took it, so we took some of this belongings.</span> <span id="s1283">They took our belongings, the German.</span> <span id="s1284">But we did not want anything German.</span> <span id="s1285">We did not bring anything back that was German.</span> <span id="s1286">We – on the ship, we made a few dollars on the ship.</span> <span id="s1287">Well, I did, my brother got too seasick.</span> <span id="s1288">He was sick most of the way across.</span> <span id="s1289">For some reason I did not get seasick.</span> <span id="s1290">And pe – other refugees that were on the ship wanted to buy shaving cream or things that was in the – that you could purchase on the ship.</span> <span id="s1291">And they didn’t want to stay in line and so I used to stay in line for – for them and buy what they wanted.</span> <span id="s1292">In fact here’s a – I still remember this one gentleman wanted chewing gum.</span> <span id="s1293">And I purchased and I took the German pronunciation for ch-chewing gum, which would be shaving gum, and instead of getting chewing gum for him, I ended up with a tube of shaving cream.</span> <span id="s1294">I still remember that.</span> <span id="s1295">And I ended up – I have finally ended up selling it to somebody else, because he wanted chewing gum, not shaving cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Were there – was it all refugees on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: I would say 99 percent were refugees, and again those were people either that were – survived at a concentration camp or lived in hiding someplace, somewhere so – somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: And again, did you talk to each other about what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: No, I don’t believe – I didn’t want to, my brother didn’t want to and I don’t think anyone aboard wanted to talk about what they went through.</span> <span id="s1300">It’s – yes, they wanted to get that out of their mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: And how long did the voyage take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: It took 10 days.</span> <span id="s1303">We left September seventh, we arrived – when I saw the Statue of Liberty in New York, that was September 17th.</span> <span id="s1304">Greatest sight you can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: And what was it like to put your foot down on American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Oh, it was great.</span> <span id="s1307">Something that we thought we would never see.</span> <span id="s1308">And there were quite a few kids like us, orphan kids on that ship, again, also sponsored by the Joint Distribution Committee, most of them had no parents.</span> <span id="s1309">And they were like we were, maybe some of them thought they had a relative there, but again didn't know.</span> <span id="s1310">And again, it was representatives from the Joint that picked us up and took us to 441 Caldwell Avenue, Brooklyn – I mean, Bronx, New York.</span> <span id="s1311">And of course we were fed and treated wonderfully.</span> <span id="s1312">And the next day we were interviewed by German speaking people, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Wa-Was this a family that you went to on – in the Bronx?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: No, it was a – I really would say like an orphan home.</span> <span id="s1315">It was for children, and we were in there and they had beds, several beds in a room.</span> <span id="s1316">And they, of course, separated the boys and the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: And then after your interview, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: And then, of course, we told them that we had two uncles someplace in the U.S. And they said well, were they from Germany?</span> <span id="s1319">And we said yes, they were originally from Breslau, now ber – Poland.</span> <span id="s1320">And they said, well there is a newspaper that has a nationwide publication plus Canada.</span> <span id="s1321">Of course, we didn’t know Canada was a neighbor of the U.S. at the time.</span> <span id="s1322">But they said they will put an ad in the “Aufbau” and see if our uncles – at that time we still thought they were uncles – if our uncles by any chance were to read that newspaper, as most German speaking Jews were subscribers to that newspaper.</span> <span id="s1323">Well, our uncles did not read it, but very good friends of theirs in Saint Louis, Missouri read that ad.</span> <span id="s1324">And there were pages and pages and pages of kids or adults looking for people and most of them – it was arranged alphabetically, I believe, the ads, and these friends of my uncles, which turned out to be cousins, read that and called them.</span> <span id="s1325">They were in Saint Louis, and my cousins – we’ll call them my true things, my cousins from my father’s side, were called up and said there are two kids, just came from Berlin and they are looking for Alfred and Felix tau – Taucher.</span> <span id="s1326">And of course that’s when we learned they were cousins.</span> <span id="s1327">And my cousins were both brothers and they had just, actually not that long ago had come to the U.S., because one cousin lived in Shanghai during the war, while the other one lived in South America.</span> <span id="s1328">But apparently they had kept in touch all through the war and they ended up in Joplin, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1329">How they ended up in Joplin, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1330">But Joplin is a small community of about 35,000 people, and that’s where they ended up.</span> <span id="s1331">And since they were in Joplin when we were found, but they were single people, there was no woman in the house, the social welfare agency, Jewish social fe – agency wouldn’t let us live there and so we went to live with foster parents in Kansas City, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1332">A family by the name of Levinson, and he was a very Orthodox rabbi and of course very kosher and we lived with them for probably four or five months.</span> <span id="s1333">But we had really problems living together, because we were not raised Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1334">And so then we were moved into – in to another family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Did you go to school th-then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yes, we started th – both of us started in the eight grade.</span> <span id="s1337">Now remember, my brother went through the third grade, I went the second grade of school in Germany.</span> <span id="s1338">Even after the war, the short time we went to the German school then was still only the second grade, didn’t know English.</span> <span id="s1339">But we went to school in Kansas City, Missouri for two years, and they assigned a teacher to us who knew a little bit of German, not very much.</span> <span id="s1340">She was Jewish, Mrs. Weinberg, and she worked as – worked with us – tutored us to learn English.</span> <span id="s1341">And what my brother and I did after we started school, we took a German English dictionary and just studied it page by page, word for word.</span> <span id="s1342">And after awhile it got so that we used words that the English teachers didn’t understand, or we used it in the wrong context.</span> <span id="s1343">And my brother then – this was in the ninth grade, I believe, I had a different English teacher than my brother did and my English teacher, she says – a Miss Ulrichi, she says, Fred, you have to buy some comic books and start reading comic books.</span> <span id="s1344">I don’t care what comic books you read, but buy comic books and you will have the – a much – maybe not the best grammar in the world, but you will get English that is being used every day.</span> <span id="s1345">And I will say it really helped.</span> <span id="s1346">Reading the comics, I had a – seeing the pictures and getting most of it out, I probably learned more English from that than anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: And what about your name?</span> <span id="s1348">You were then – by then Fred?</span> <span id="s1349">Was that your decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Oh, ba – my – my cousin who we lived with then, after Kansas City when we moved to Joplin – oh, I should say that.</span> <span id="s1351">We went to school in Kansas City for two years, and then my – in the meantime my cousin brought in one of their aunts who was in Israel, at that time I believe still known as Palestine.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, it was ’48 when Palestine was – became an independent state.</span> <span id="s1353">And they brought her there to Joplin from Israel and then we were permitted to live with them, and we went to the 10th, 11th and 12th grade in Joplin, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: And you s – and – and when did you change your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: We changed our name when we – we became citizen.</span> <span id="s1356">Actually, I did not change my name from Horst Alfred until after I got out of the army.</span> <span id="s1357">Maybe we should go back to that later.</span> <span id="s1358">I finished high school, my brother finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Did the – did the Missouri children accept you?</span> <span id="s1360">Did you feel like an outside in the high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1362">We – in fact, we were asked to speak at assemblies about our – some of our lives in Germany and Berlin during the war.</span> <span id="s1363">And didn’t really want to talk about – we didn’t talk to a lot of the detail because we were ashamed to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1364">For instance, I didn’t want to talk, in fact I didn’t tell anybody I was in a concentration camp or in a train, I was too ashamed of it, especially how I was caught.</span> <span id="s1365">I mean, no 12 year old kid wants to talk about why they were caught.</span> <span id="s1366">And we didn’t say that we were in a concentration camp, but we just talked what it was life, the bombing and how it was life, living in fear, trying not to get caught.</span> <span id="s1367">And that’s really most of the things that we talked about to other kids.</span> <span id="s1368">But we were very well accepted by the kids.</span> <span id="s1369">We made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s1370">In fact, both my brother and I go to reunion.</span> <span id="s1371">In fact we have, in September, we have the 50th year reunion coming up in Joplin, which I plan to attend and so does my brother.</span> <span id="s1372">And we’ve made a lot of friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Did you take part in school activities and sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1375">Not in sports so much, but I actually was in ROTC, Reserved Officer’s Training.</span> <span id="s1376">And we had rifle teams, we had drill teams a – which I participated.</span> <span id="s1377">I also belonged to a – to various clubs, like the Key Club, which is the forerunners, I think to the Kiwanis, and I was very active.</span> <span id="s1378">My brother was not too active, my brother – actually, my a – one of our cousins who we lived with was a pianist and he also taught piano, and my brother always wanted to learn the piano.</span> <span id="s1379">So while I was involved in a lot of school activity, my brother practiced and played the piano, but he, which I was not, got to really enjoy playing baseball, and learned – and became a very good baseball player.</span> <span id="s1380">And he belonged to a baseball team, a high school baseball team and so forth.</span> <span id="s1381">And that’s where his activity was, while mine was in drill teams and rifle teams and Kiwanis clubs and so forth.</span> <span id="s1382">In fact, I even learned how to be a speaker.</span> <span id="s1383">And this is why I do a lot of speaking engagements now and it doesn’t bother me to be – be speak in front of public, or even on TV, where I’ve taught many, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Did you feel very American at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1386">I felt – after I got pretty proficient in English, in fact when I went in the U.S. Army, five years after coming here, nobody believed me that I was a – originally from Germany, I spoke English like an American, rather than a foreigner.</span> <span id="s1387">Through the years I started speaking German again, also learned Japanese and I speak both languages.</span> <span id="s1388">And so I – it seems like I’ve reacquired an accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: – volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s1391">This is tape number three, side B and you were talking about how you kept up – you were – you have an aptitude for languages.</span> <span id="s1392">So then you graduated from high school, and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Graduated from high school in 1951 and then I applied to go to the University of Missouri law school, since I had two uncles from my mother’s side that were lawyers.</span> <span id="s1394">We also had uncles that were dentists, mostly from our mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1395">In fact, I know of one uncle who was in Shanghai during the war, and I met somebody in Seattle who – whose dentist was my uncle in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1396">But anyhow –</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: You – bu-but you were – what about undergraduate at college?</span> <span id="s1398">What do you mean you applied to law – you wanted to apply to law school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: I applied after I got out of high school, I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then eventually go into law school, right?</span> <span id="s1400">Well, when I took the entrance examination for the University of Missouri, apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average.</span> <span id="s1401">And I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it possibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have been in the U.S. I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done.</span> <span id="s1402">At – times have changed today.</span> <span id="s1403">But so – since I could not go to the University of Missouri, I didn’t really know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my parents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist.</span> <span id="s1404">And so I was 18 and a half years old, or almost.</span> <span id="s1405">They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the army and get that out of my – out of my life here.</span> <span id="s1406">And so I joined the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: And this was during the Korean war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: That was ko – during the Korean war.</span> <span id="s1409">And after I took my basic training in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, I was assigned to a replacement company there as a company clerk.</span> <span id="s1410">And then one of the generals who was reassigned from Fort Leonard Wood, who was reassigned to Germany, wanted a native speaking German to be his driver in Germany.</span> <span id="s1411">So I was picked to be the driver for this general, since I was a native speaking German.</span> <span id="s1412">But I, at that time I was not prepared to go back to Germany, and since I was still a citizen of the u – of Germany, I did not have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: All right, you were not a citizen yet of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I was still a non-citizen.</span> <span id="s1415">Now, I did take – this was kind of odd – I did take the examination for citizenship in Rolla, Missouri, a small city near Fort Leonard Wood.</span> <span id="s1416">In fact this was a college town, I think it was a – still is a very well known engineering school.</span> <span id="s1417">And this is where, in that city, I took my exam for citizenship.</span> <span id="s1418">In fact, one of the questions that I was asked by the examiner – and I was in U.S. Army uniform, I was a corporal at the time – and this examiner, one of the questions asked, if I were called to serve in the U.S. military in time of war, would I do that?</span> <span id="s1419">And I looked at him, I said, well… And he says yes, I – I’m sorry that I have to ask that, but that – that is the rule, and I realize you are in the military.</span> <span id="s1420">It k-kind of struck me odd.</span> <span id="s1421">And anyhow, I took my citizenship examination, which I passed.</span> <span id="s1422">Of course, it was everything I had learned in high school, in government and so forth.</span> <span id="s1423">Was a – to me – for me it was a very simple exam.</span> <span id="s1424">And it was really about – shortly wi – thereafter, when I had the orders to go to Germany, but then I looked up the Jewish chaplain in Forth Leonard Wood, and I told him a little bit of my story, and of course he got my a – says no, I don’t have to go and they canceled my order to Germany.</span> <span id="s1425">But abou –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Why did you not want to go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: I-I still had too many bad memories in Germany.</span> <span id="s1428">And the feeling there, I just was not prepared.</span> <span id="s1429">And I also – besides that, I didn’t want to be a driver for a general.</span> <span id="s1430">I wanted to learn something while I was in the military rather than drive a car around and be what I considered a nursemaid.</span> <span id="s1431">And so my orders three days later were for Korea.</span> <span id="s1432">And I had a two weeks leave, went back to Joplin, visited my friends and said the goodbyes and everything.</span> <span id="s1433">And I went to Fort Lewis, Washington, which is about a fr – one hour drive out of Seattle.</span> <span id="s1434">And I kind of fell in love with that part of the country and I said to myself, if I make it back alive from Korea, this is going to be home.</span> <span id="s1435">And I went to Korea and that was 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: How did you feel putting on an American army uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Proud.</span> <span id="s1438">I was very proud to be wearing the army uniform.</span> <span id="s1439">And I think this is why I made, even through the enlisted rating, I made rank much faster than ma – the average American citizen counterpart.</span> <span id="s1440">While these people complained about the military and they didn’t want to work, I did my duty and I was proud of it.</span> <span id="s1441">And I believe this is why in Korea, even though there were sergeants that were 15 years in the army, I passed them up and received the rank of warrant officer appointment, when others way ahead of me should have received it.</span> <span id="s1442">It was probably a responsibility I had at my age that I shouldn’t have had.</span> <span id="s1443">I was only 20 years old when I became a warrant officer.</span> <span id="s1444">21 years old, I guess.</span> <span id="s1445">But I always felt proud to be an American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: What were your duties in Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: In Korea I – my fir – my first duties were to code reports that came from the front lines, and pick out the soldiers that were killed in action, wounded in action, missing, and I also had the locator; an assignment I wasn’t supposed to have had as I was not a U.S. citizen, but I had that assignment.</span> <span id="s1448">And then I got – those papers I got ready to be put into, which now are computers, in those times they were machine accounting, we programmed them with – through plugboard wires and punch cards.</span> <span id="s1449">And the man that was really in charge and doing the actual operating of the equipment was a warrant officer.</span> <span id="s1450">Well, he was killed driving over a mine and – which I didn’t know, but he – he was late in bringing the reports in, which I had to code, for him to process through.</span> <span id="s1451">But instead of him coming in, the – a colonel came in and stuck a couple of warrant officers’ bars on my shoulder, tore off my sergeant stripes and says, you have just been appointed to a warrant officer, you are going to be – replace Mr. Eberhart(ph) – a warrant officer is addressed as mister – who was killed in action, and we will have a replacement for you shortly.</span> <span id="s1452">After my replacement came in, they assigned another warrant officer to that unit and sent me to Japan for three weeks, where I learned how to operate those machines.</span> <span id="s1453">And after three weeks I went back to Korea and continued the duties as a warrant officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Did you ever – when you were in Korea, did you ever see any bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: I see – saw a lot of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: And did that remind you of your experience during the war, being in the railroad car and during the bombing of Berlin, seeing bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: No, it did not.</span> <span id="s1458">It did not remind me at all.</span> <span id="s1459">I s – was sad, seeing American soldiers dead, but it di – it was not even close to reminding me what it was like in the railroad car, because first of all, in the railroad car it was dark and you – most of the time you couldn’t see the bodies, you couldn’t see the faces.</span> <span id="s1460">And even if you could, you didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1461">And you just saw people that were dead and I never related that.</span> <span id="s1462">I felt sorrow for the poor American soldiers that were killed.</span> <span id="s1463">And again, it’s just like I felt that way ever since a child in – during my life in Germany, that when my time is up I’m going to go, and if not, I’ll keep on going and living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: And how long did you stay in Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Until the very tail end of the war, which I believe was September or October of ’53, I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1466">And after Korea I was transferred to Tokyo, where I was stationed for nine months.</span> <span id="s1467">And actually – well, not at the time, I – I took up the martial arts over there, I took both judo and karate.</span> <span id="s1468">And my instructor introduced me to his sister, who was Japanese, of course.</span> <span id="s1469">And – and I fell in love and applied to get married.</span> <span id="s1470">But as an officer – at that time an officer could not marry outside the race unless you go back to an enlisted rating.</span> <span id="s1471">So I was due to be discharged then, so I went back to the States, took my discharge and then went back to Japan to get married.</span> <span id="s1472">We were married in excess of 40 years but we are divorced now, but we’re still friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So you got married in Japan and then brought your bride to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1475">Yes, I was married by the American consul in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s1476">And – oh, one thing I should mention.</span> <span id="s1477">While I was heading to Korea, the army sent my immigration records and citizenship records – that’s to be a citizen, to Germany, where my assignment was supposed to – where the first orders for it – for Germany.</span> <span id="s1478">By the time everything got caught up I was going back to the States to be discharged.</span> <span id="s1479">So I – when I got – before I got discharged again, being a warrant officer, an officer had to be a citizen before they can get discharged from the military.</span> <span id="s1480">So I had to take a 10 day leave of absence, which I wanted to get paid for and the army arranged a special citizenship exam for me in Rolla, Missouri, where all my records were still, where I was taking my – took my examination.</span> <span id="s1481">And they had a special hearing for me to sworn in as a citizen.</span> <span id="s1482">Then I had to go back – I was at that time stationed at Fort Carlson, Colorado, and I had to go back to Fort Carlson, get my discharge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: And to be a udis – U.S. citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: And then to be a u – a U.S. citizen, the greatest feeling that could ha – happen to – could have happened to me.</span> <span id="s1485">And again, I was proud that I could serve in the U.S. Army, and even more proud then, to be a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: And then you came – and then you came back and – when you got discharged, and went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1488">I did not go to school.</span> <span id="s1489">My – then my goal was to go back to Japan to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: And I got a job – at that time, U.S. military people stoo – air force, navy, I – I should say air force, Marines and army were still going overseas to Korea, even though it was after the war, to Korea or Japan on ships.</span> <span id="s1492">And I took a job a – on the military sea transportation service, that’s a civilian group.</span> <span id="s1493">We were taking troops overseas and bringing them back.</span> <span id="s1494">And I took a job on one of those ships and got good pay and went back to Japan to get married.</span> <span id="s1495">And came back after my marriage and took a job in – again I’ll call it computers, in the – doing the same thing except – e-except I wasn’t te – keeping track of casualties, my first job was working for an insurance company where I operated the machine accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Now, did you go back to Missouri or did you go to Seattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: I went to Seattle.</span> <span id="s1498">I went back to Missouri, visit my cousins and took some of the belongings I had there and went back to Seattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: And you’re with your young bride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: No, no, she came – she didn't come o-over until about six or seven months later.</span> <span id="s1501">Since I was a naturalized citizen, and a new naturalized citizen, it took me quite some time to get a passport for her.</span> <span id="s1502">And since I was in Seattle, Washington, all my – again, my immigration and naturalization paper were in Missouri, I had to apply for her visa through Missouri, and it was a – quite a lengthy operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: And then she came and what – then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Okay, she came over here and about a year later we had our first son.</span> <span id="s1505">And six years later we had a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: And your w-work career?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: I worked then – at that time I worked for a trucking company, again in machine accounting, and in 1960 I set up a com – this is when the first part of the computers came around [indecipherable] programming computers, and I took the second programming course in Seattle, back in 1959, learning how to program those new, beautiful computers, IBM computers, which were then the 1401.</span> <span id="s1508">And took a job with a division of Boise Cascade Corporation, and I set up the very first computer installation for Greystone Concrete Products.</span> <span id="s1509">Like I say, that was a division from Boise Cascade, it was – they made concrete blocks and pipe, cement products.</span> <span id="s1510">And I se – they had 11 different locations and I set up the computer department in all 11 locations, and then became, besides being the – what was called the data processing manager, I also was made the assistant controller.</span> <span id="s1511">And I put in many, many hours and in 1963, a – this Greystone division, some of the managers bought the division from Boise Cascade, and I was supposed to have been included as one of the owners but they cut me out, strictly the controller of that company, who was als – see – embezzling from the company.</span> <span id="s1512">And of course, being the – in the accounting department, which was part of the data processing, I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1513">And he cut me out as being a owner of the company.</span> <span id="s1514">So in 1963, I resigned my position and started my own business, and – which is – I still have that business.</span> <span id="s1515">Today, my company, the second oldest privately owned computer company in Seattle.</span> <span id="s1516">I have pretty much turned the business over to my son.</span> <span id="s1517">I am still active in the financial area of the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Speaking of your son and your daughter, when you were raising them, did you tell them about what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Ver – not too much.</span> <span id="s1520">My son was never too much interested in it.</span> <span id="s1521">My daughter was very much interested.</span> <span id="s1522">And when my daughter went to the University of Washington, she decided she wanted to join a sorority.</span> <span id="s1523">And I never pushed it or anything, she decided she wanted to join the AEPhi, which was a Jewish sorority.</span> <span id="s1524">And she has taken a lot more interest in what we went through, and even now she is very much interested.</span> <span id="s1525">I think she belongs to some kind of a Jewish friendship club here in Washington, D.C., where she is living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Did you r-raise your children Jewishly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: No, I did not, as a – neither m – none of my family were that Jewish and we – well, I do consider myself Jewish, but I am not a religious person.</span> <span id="s1528">And of course my wife, being Japanese was not Jewish and is also not religious, that we let our kids do their own.</span> <span id="s1529">And my daughter leans very much towards the Jewish religion, rather than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Are your children bilingual?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: My son is not.</span> <span id="s1532">He never picked up the other language, even though at home we spoke Japanese.</span> <span id="s1533">My son can understand Japanese, not everything.</span> <span id="s1534">He can understand his mother, but other Japanese he can’t really understand.</span> <span id="s1535">But my daughter is very much bilingual.</span> <span id="s1536">In high school she studied German and could communicate very well in German.</span> <span id="s1537">And in Japanese, her Japanese now is much better than my Japanese.</span> <span id="s1538">She – most of her clients – she works as a consultant for a company and all of her clients, not most – most of her c – yes, most of her clients are Japanese.</span> <span id="s1539">She does have one client in London and I think she has two different clients in Spain, where she has visited.</span> <span id="s1540">But most of her clients are in Japan, and of course, she speaks it.</span> <span id="s1541">And the strange thing is, to Japanese, my daughter does not look Japanese, she looks more American, more Caucasian.</span> <span id="s1542">And when she speaks Japanese to the Japanese, they are just flabbergasted because she does not speak like a foreign, like an American Japanese, she speaks like a native Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Are there any sights or sounds today, or smells that remind you of your wartime experience, that kind of triggers a memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Well, a good experience is in Seattle just about three weeks ago.</span> <span id="s1545">Again, like I say, I’m still in the computer business today.</span> <span id="s1546">One of the things we do is we host websites.</span> <span id="s1547">The – we have a election coming up very shortly in Seattle, one of them is for mayor.</span> <span id="s1548">A man that’s running for mayor is presently the city attorney, who happens to be Jewish, and we are hosting his website.</span> <span id="s1549">And his website is Sidran for Seattle mayor dot org, dot com, we’ve used all of them.</span> <span id="s1550">Well somebody who doesn’t like him put up another website and called it Mark Sidran dot com, which is this – this attorney who is running for, his first name.</span> <span id="s1551">Well, his website is only Sidran for Seattle mayor because Mark Sidran was already taken.</span> <span id="s1552">Well, that website has a huge swastika, and compares Mark Sidran as a – a Nazi, as an SS.</span> <span id="s1553">And it’s somebody that is upset with him.</span> <span id="s1554">And that – seeing that swastika bothers me more now than it did when I saw it every day and lived with it in Germany during the regime.</span> <span id="s1555">Another time – and I refuse to go back to Munich, Germany – I – a few years ago I had a client in Munich and we were doing big business, really, with each other.</span> <span id="s1556">And finally – and we always talked over the phone, always in English.</span> <span id="s1557">This was, of course, back quite some time, before email really, where we sent faxes.</span> <span id="s1558">We sent faxes back and forth, always in English.</span> <span id="s1559">And in 1979 I visited him in person.</span> <span id="s1560">And we had a appointment at 15 minutes before 12 at his place.</span> <span id="s1561">I got there at 15 minutes before 12, told his receptionist who I was, and she said yes, I’ll let Mr. – I forgot his name now – I’ll let him know.</span> <span id="s1562">And so I waited, and then I asked the receptionist, in English, she spoke pretty good English, I spoke no German at the time.</span> <span id="s1563">And ask him well, does he have somebody with him, is he busy?</span> <span id="s1564">She says no, but he must be busy, but he’ll be out.</span> <span id="s1565">And at exactly 12 o’clock – and at exactly 12 o’clock he comes out and he starts speaking German to me.</span> <span id="s1566">Herr Taucher, and used the German pronunciation and didn’t say I’m sorry or anything.</span> <span id="s1567">And I spoke in English.</span> <span id="s1568">And he didn’t even know I spoke engli – German.</span> <span id="s1569">We never before spoke German, it was strictly a business relationship in English.</span> <span id="s1570">He spoke very good English when we talked over the phone.</span> <span id="s1571">His communication in English and on faxes was excellent.</span> <span id="s1572">And I said, don’t you s-speak English?</span> <span id="s1573">You know, we’ve been communicating – yes, bu – and in German he answers, but you are in Germany, you have to speak German.</span> <span id="s1574">So I finally said, okay, I’ll play your silly game.</span> <span id="s1575">In German.</span> <span id="s1576">Of course, that startled him.</span> <span id="s1577">And the next thing he says, oh it’s 12 o’clock, I have to go lunch.</span> <span id="s1578">Well, thanks for stopping in.</span> <span id="s1579">I said goodbye, and I have never communicated with this guy.</span> <span id="s1580">And we gave him on an average of 70 to 80,000 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month in business.</span> <span id="s1581">And we gave it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1582">And I have found other times in Munich, that is the mentality I find in Munich.</span> <span id="s1583">Anyplace else, and that includes eastern Germany, I have not found that.</span> <span id="s1584">The people say in eastern Germany you have a lot of anti-Semitism and so forth, I have not found that myself in eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s1585">In Munich, yes, I can see kids even, 17 – 18 year old kids giving the Hitler youth – I-I mean, the Hitler salute.</span> <span id="s1586">That is completely illegal and in Berlin, in east Germany that’s not permitted and they get arrested.</span> <span id="s1587">In Munich the police turns around.</span> <span id="s1588">And I see the Nazi mentality all over again in Munich, and I refuse to go back to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: What does that do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: It – it hurts me, it bothers me.</span> <span id="s1591">And again, if I were younger, I would probably get myself in trouble.</span> <span id="s1592">But I – I will say my training in judo and karate does teach you discipline, and you don’t start a fight.</span> <span id="s1593">But I-I am afraid in my younger days, I could have lost myself.</span> <span id="s1594">It does bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Do you think about your experien – your wartime experiences now often, more often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1597">I do.</span> <span id="s1598">What – when I really we – in fact, that’s the first time in many, many years that I have nightmares is when I took Patricia, who you met, with me to Berlin last year, and I took her to the SS headquarters, the old SS – SS headquarters.</span> <span id="s1599">In fact, that was Himmler’s headquarters, where they also had the torture chamber.</span> <span id="s1600">And they had some records of me, and I was asked to give a taped interview there.</span> <span id="s1601">And the first thing, of course I asked, why do you want it for?</span> <span id="s1602">What do you want it?</span> <span id="s1603">And this gentleman who I talked to, he was in his middle 30’s, I’d say, he says, well there’s so much denial going on in Germany that we want to get interviews from people that have been here, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1604">There were a number of Germans that were also arrested and tortured there, and we’d like to interview every one of them, and then we are s-spreading those tapes through high schools throughout Germany.</span> <span id="s1605">So, of course I agreed to that interview and I had probably a 45 minute interview there, all in German, so that high school kids can fully understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: I wanted to ask you before about that experience.</span> <span id="s1607">How is it that you did not release any information when they were questioning you?</span> <span id="s1608">You were so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: I think it’s – I first knew that if I released information, my mother and my brother would also be caught.</span> <span id="s1610">I knew that first of all.</span> <span id="s1611">Second, every time when I was ready to talk, they tortured me so much that I passed out.</span> <span id="s1612">And when I came to again, again I passed out.</span> <span id="s1613">I mean, there were times, I’ve told you some of them, like pulling teeth, filling teeth without any medication.</span> <span id="s1614">Other times I remember they had me jump in a bathtub full of ice cubes, full of ice, and then immediately go out in very hot water, and – which, I passed out.</span> <span id="s1615">And it – things like that.</span> <span id="s1616">Some of it I – I don’t even want to talk about it, it’s just – but when I did visit that place with Patricia, they make – made a memorial out of it now, maybe you’re aware of that, I had nightmares for the next two or three nights in the hotel.</span> <span id="s1617">Yeah, they really brought back the memories like it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Are there any smells that – that stimulate mem – are any smells that stimulate you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Occasionally so-some things maybe – you smell something, maybe there was a dead animal around in a real hot climate.</span> <span id="s1620">Yes, that – that does remind me, but I try to wipe it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1621">But yes, occasionally that has reminded me, mostly of the train.</span> <span id="s1622">And even – I’ll say it, even smelling dog feces, that reminds me of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher.</span> <span id="s1625">This is tape number four, side A, and we were talking about sounds and sights that – that trigger memory for you.</span> <span id="s1626">Anything else that you wanted to include?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: No, that’s really – I believe again the smell sometimes of dead animal or what I said earlier is probably the only thing that – or when I see a swastika.</span> <span id="s1628">Yeah, when I see a swastika, it’s – it immediately reminds me – it reminds me of Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse neun, or nine, the torture chamber, what I call.</span> <span id="s1629">It does remind me.</span> <span id="s1630">And another thing is, like I said, it does remind me right here at the Holocaust Museum, when I am in front of that train, I cannot step foot.</span> <span id="s1631">I’ve been reminded of this when I visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and they have that train up there on the stand.</span> <span id="s1632">And that train that they have there looks just identical to the train that I was in.</span> <span id="s1633">And I did have some nightmare that night at the hotel in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1634">The rest of it, I can go – another thing I cannot do, I have actually visited the camp in Dachau once, and really I didn’t have too many problems visiting it.</span> <span id="s1635">It did give me an idea had I been out of the train what I – what it would have been like.</span> <span id="s1636">And I was able to visit that.</span> <span id="s1637">When I visited Prague a year ago for the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, they had tours to Theresienstadt and also to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1638">I could not go there.</span> <span id="s1639">I decided not to go, because I lost a lot of my family in both of those places.</span> <span id="s1640">Was some first in Theresienstadt and then in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1641">And I decided there’s no way I could go inside Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1642">So I chose not to take that tour.</span> <span id="s1643">And th – I think in Prague, being in Prague and going through the Jewish cemetery there, even though I had no relatives in Prague, but it sure brought back memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: When you ju – got off of the train car in Dachau, did you see any part of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Well, I jo – only – I’m sorry – I only see the front, with a gate there, freiheit – Arbeit macht freiheit.</span> <span id="s1646">I did see some people walking, mostly Nazis.</span> <span id="s1647">I do remember seeing two or three people walking, I saw dead people.</span> <span id="s1648">And of course some of them couldn’t – no, I don’t think the camp was really bombed.</span> <span id="s1649">I think the – the allies and both – the Russians did not bomb the camp.</span> <span id="s1650">And of course at that time they flew very low.</span> <span id="s1651">I mean, there were some times when I was still in the train I thought the airplanes were going to land on top of the train.</span> <span id="s1652">I mean, you could hear how close they were.</span> <span id="s1653">And – but I saw – I can remember there were soldiers and I saw a few striped jackets, which were prisoners, but that’s about all I remem – remember of inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1654">And I think there were only a few privileged prisoners, I think, that could be close to the gate for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s1655">But other than that I do not remember.</span> <span id="s1656">But like I say again, I jumped off the train and then immediately followed all those Russian soldiers which was crossing the train going the other direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Would you be a different person today, do you think, if you hadn’t had the childhood that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1659">I think I probably wouldn’t be as active in non-profit organizations that I am.</span> <span id="s1660">But I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1661">In fact, this bother me now, I hear kids in trouble, kids taking dope and so forth, drugs.</span> <span id="s1662">And I feel the media is excusing the kids because they have come from broken homes or bad parents and so forth.</span> <span id="s1663">I think it’s still the child that wants it that way.</span> <span id="s1664">I just cannot put all the blames on the parents.</span> <span id="s1665">I think – I think the news media helps make the kids blame their parents.</span> <span id="s1666">And they don’t have to do what they are doing.</span> <span id="s1667">I interviewed one time a former service man for a job, and he started talking that he took dope when he was in Vietnam, but you know how it is like in wartime?</span> <span id="s1668">And I just had to take, and everybody else took dope.</span> <span id="s1669">And I said listen, I’ve gone through a war too, in Korea, and not in Vietnam, but als – also si – was a prisoner in a concentration camp, and I never dreamed of taking dope.</span> <span id="s1670">That’s not an excuse and I – I can’t use you here in my company.</span> <span id="s1671">And I didn’t spend any more time.</span> <span id="s1672">It a – I just wouldn’t buy it.</span> <span id="s1673">Yes, there are some kids that were abused by their parents or so – gran – or foster parents or what have you, but still some of it, it’s up to the ki-kid.</span> <span id="s1674">And I don’t think I became a criminal.</span> <span id="s1675">And – and people have asked me, well how come you have made something of yourself?</span> <span id="s1676">And why do other kids get in trouble?</span> <span id="s1677">I have no answer for it, but I do know that they don’t have to be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Do you seek out other survivors as friends and do you – if you meet one, do you feel a connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Yes, I definitely do.</span> <span id="s1680">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1681">I know what they’ve gone through and they know what I’ve gone through, yes.</span> <span id="s1682">But a lot of survivors, again, they hold a – I don’t know if it’s a grudge, but they don’t want to forget it, they want to live with the past.</span> <span id="s1683">And I say hey, you don’t want to forget it, but don’t live with the past.</span> <span id="s1684">Live with what it is now.</span> <span id="s1685">A good example is we talked about – earlier about Lüneburg, and this recuperation camp put on by the British.</span> <span id="s1686">There is one lady, Dodie Jacobson, I believe her – is her name.</span> <span id="s1687">She fo-found me in Prague, when we were in Prague and we were at a workshop where we talked about our experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s1688">And nobody wanted to speak up, and so I was the first to speak, and I was telling my story in Berlin, and my brother and I survived, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1689">And all of a sudden this one lady, Dodie, interrupted, and she says, were you in Lüneburg?</span> <span id="s1690">And I said yes, my brother and I were there.</span> <span id="s1691">And she went hysterical, because she is one that was in Lüneburg with us.</span> <span id="s1692">And she was never in a concentration camp, but lived in horrible condition in hiding.</span> <span id="s1693">And today she has never gotten married, doesn’t want to, can’t get along with people.</span> <span id="s1694">And again, she said it right at this workshop, she – there is – she – it’s still from her time in Germany.</span> <span id="s1695">She doesn’t really want to make good friends with anybody very long.</span> <span id="s1696">And again I say, Dodie, these are different times.</span> <span id="s1697">You gotta live with what’s now.</span> <span id="s1698">But she doesn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s1699">And too many of the survivors live that way, which I think is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Some say that they feel like two different people, one on the outside to the outside world, and a different person on the inside.</span> <span id="s1701">Do you feel like that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yeah, I do not feel that way, but I do – many of them that do feel that way, and I feel it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s1703">You have to – for instance, I do not hold any prejudice towards the younger generation German, except the ones that – those neo-Nazis.</span> <span id="s1704">And s – but of course, we have them right here in the U.S.</span> <span id="s1705">But the younger generation, the – the people 50 years old, even 60 years old and younger, I really don’t have any grudge against them.</span> <span id="s1706">They couldn’t do anything about it, they were too young then.</span> <span id="s1707">Most of them knew what was going on, but they didn’t know how bad it was and they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1708">The people older than me, 72 years old, let’s say, and older, they could have done something about it.</span> <span id="s1709">And those I just – I can’t be friends with them.</span> <span id="s1710">I have a tough time talking to them.</span> <span id="s1711">But you have to get over it.</span> <span id="s1712">You don’t have to be friends, but you can’t just hold a grudge against the younger generation that couldn’t help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: When you walk down the streets in Germany, I guess excluding Munich, do you feel comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1715">In fact, I can tell you another example that really surprised me.</span> <span id="s1716">Two years ago when I was in Berlin, and as a – at the invitation of Berlin; they paid for my trip, they put me up at the Crown Plaza Hotel, that’s a block off the Kurfürstendamm, one of the main thing of it, like Times Square.</span> <span id="s1717">And wh-while we were having dinner there was a big party going on in the main ballroom.</span> <span id="s1718">And I’m a curious kind of a person and I looked in, and I see a lot of people with a yarmulke on.</span> <span id="s1719">So I kind of walked in and I asked somebody there, he was about 19 years old, with a yarmulke, and I spoke German with him and I said, what’s going on here?</span> <span id="s1720">He said, this is a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1721">Do you know what a Bar Mitzvah is?</span> <span id="s1722">I said yes, and I told him that I lived in Berlin all through the war.</span> <span id="s1723">I didn’t tell him I was in a concentration camp, I said I am an American now, but I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1724">And I asked him, how does it feel for a Jewish person like you, especially your age, living here in Berlin?</span> <span id="s1725">And he looked at me kind of strange, he says, I am a German, he said.</span> <span id="s1726">I am a German, I am a – Jewish is my religion.</span> <span id="s1727">And that’s how some of the Jewish community thinks today as a – that generation, the 19 years and younger generation.</span> <span id="s1728">They consider themselves German and Jewish.</span> <span id="s1729">Of course, Jewish is a religion and j – they should consider themselves as such.</span> <span id="s1730">But that they just come right out and say, I’m German, Jewish is my religion.</span> <span id="s1731">It really – it almost shocked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: What my thoughts were, hang him.</span> <span id="s1734">Just don’t waste the time.</span> <span id="s1735">Everybody know – the world knows he was as guilty as could be.</span> <span id="s1736">And sometimes – I don’t believe in capital punishment, I guess, but Eichmann or any of those, definitely.</span> <span id="s1737">Don’t waste the time and money to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s1738">That’s how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: What are your attitudes towards food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: To – towards food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Towards food.</span> <span id="s1742">You – you went through times of terrible hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Did it affect your attitude today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: It affects my attitude towards food.</span> <span id="s1746">First of all I’ve said to myself a long time ago, that was all the lack of food I’ve had and where I’ve had to eat practically dirt, I ate food that we didn’t know was poisonous or not, like plants, I have said I’m only going to eat food that I like.</span> <span id="s1747">I’m not going to do – eat food that I don’t like.</span> <span id="s1748">For instance, I never could get used to Oriental food, whether it’s Chinese, Japanese, or what.</span> <span id="s1749">Even though I was married to a Japanese for over 40 years, I refused to eat Japanese food.</span> <span id="s1750">I have customers in Japan, I do go to Japan.</span> <span id="s1751">Every one of my customers know that I will not eat Japanese food and they take me to western foods.</span> <span id="s1752">I’m a very fussy eater and I just refuse to eat food that doesn’t agree with me or I don’t like.</span> <span id="s1753">That’s my attitude on food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: Do you feel very safe here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1756">I do.</span> <span id="s1757">I don’t care what area I am in, I do feel safe.</span> <span id="s1758">I just – I’ve never had a problem.</span> <span id="s1759">Yes, in my younger days I did need judo once when somebody tried to rob me, and I was able to defend myself, keep my property.</span> <span id="s1760">I did break this – I was going to say gentleman, he was not a gentleman – break his arm.</span> <span id="s1761">And afterwards the police – tha-that was in Chicago and one of the detectives from the Cook County police department called me in Seattle and asked me how much I weighed, how tall I was.</span> <span id="s1762">And I could almost see a smile through this detective’s face over the phone.</span> <span id="s1763">What happened, the guy that tried to rob me was 180 pounds and six foot tall, and I broke his arm, and his lawyer said I used unnecessary roughness.</span> <span id="s1764">But I was a little younger at that time, too.</span> <span id="s1765">But I do feel safe, but part of it is probably due to my training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: We talked about this before, and maybe just to revisit it again, talking about whether or not you were angry that people your age in the United Sta – Jews in – your age in the United States were safe, and yet your life was in danger and you had these terrible losses.</span> <span id="s1767">Does that anger you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: No, it does not.</span> <span id="s1769">I have absolutely no anger towards that.</span> <span id="s1770">What does anger me a little bit, and that is for instance, the ship the Saint Louis that was turned back to their death, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1771">Even the German skipper wanted to go someplace where he could – he could free the people, and that the U.S. did not admit them, that angers me.</span> <span id="s1772">And again, while a lot of people, especially Jewish people – I know my cousins thought the world of Franklin Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1773">Well, I still blame him.</span> <span id="s1774">He could have stopped all of that.</span> <span id="s1775">He could have saved millions of Jews.</span> <span id="s1776">And so I’m angry towards that.</span> <span id="s1777">But other than that, no, I am not angry.</span> <span id="s1778">But I’m angry, again, for anyone that could have been saved by the U.S., and di – wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1779">In fact, my brother – my brother, my father, my family should have been permitted to come to the U.S., without money.</span> <span id="s1780">And again, I do not know, I was too young, I don’t know if my father ever contacted the American consulate in Berlin, I do not know.</span> <span id="s1781">But I think even if he had, I don’t think he could have gotten out, he didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s1782">And that does anger me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: When your children were the ages that you were from let’s say six to 12, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: – during those difficult times, did that make you think even more of the – of your experiences, when they were going through the same age di – that you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: I don’t know if I can say that, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1787">I, of course remember what has happened, I think about it.</span> <span id="s1788">I think about it right here in this building and of course this interview here.</span> <span id="s1789">But other than that I try not to think about it.</span> <span id="s1790">Of course I’m talking about it more than I used to.</span> <span id="s1791">I have spoken to Rotaries, and like I say, I’ve spoken to the military.</span> <span id="s1792">And it’s much easier to talk about it now than it used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Wh-Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Maybe time and age.</span> <span id="s1795">And I have gotten used to talking about it and feel it is necessary that the world still knows.</span> <span id="s1796">I have found too many young people, educated people that know so little of what has happened.</span> <span id="s1797">In fact, some of these people even believe what they read on the internet, that it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1798">And that’s when I started to talk about it more, and that’s why it’s a lot easier to talk about it now.</span> <span id="s1799">Even today as we were talking there were some times, I don’t know if you noticed, I was getting choked up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1800">And that I can’t help.</span> <span id="s1801">But at one time I just could hardly talk, th – I had to take a break and couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1802">But now it’s – it’s not like that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Did your experience affect how you and your wife raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1805">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1806">My wife – my ex-wife was very good in raising the children, and part of it is the Japanese culture too.</span> <span id="s1807">And I’m very proud of both of my kids.</span> <span id="s1808">And I have to give her the credit for it because I was starting a business and spent not enough time with the kids.</span> <span id="s1809">And that’s probably part of the fault why we ended up in a divorce that should have been much longer ago than it has.</span> <span id="s1810">But I will – I definitely will give her the credit that our kids were raised properly and never have gotten into trouble.</span> <span id="s1811">And of course I’m very proud of both of my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Do you feel a connection to Germany?</span> <span id="s1813">Do you – do you feel German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Not at all, I am an American, and I feel a very loyal American.</span> <span id="s1815">If I were to be asked by the U.S. Army, or any U.S. military force, to serve in the military again due to some emergency, I would not say no.</span> <span id="s1816">I would be ready to do it and I know my brother would go do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1817">I-I definitely feel my allegiance is to the U.S. and not to Germany.</span> <span id="s1818">And of course, I also feel very strongly about Israel, but I’m still an American more than an Israelite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: What – what are your thoughts about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: What my thoughts is, I hope someday there will be peace there.</span> <span id="s1821">I feel very good that finally there is a country that Jews can live there, and hopefully again sometime in peace.</span> <span id="s1822">I visited Israel for my first time in 1998, when Israel was celebrating their 50 year independence.</span> <span id="s1823">I represented the mayor of Seattle.</span> <span id="s1824">And I was – it was quite an experience to be in Israel.</span> <span id="s1825">I enjoyed visiting it and I do hope to visit Israel again.</span> <span id="s1826">I feel it is part of me, but still, my country is the U.S.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Were you active in the Civil Rights movement, or – ve – well, because you lived in a country where people’s civil rights were denied?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: No, I was never active in the Civil Rights.</span> <span id="s1829">Again, I was too young, and of course – well, I don’t know if you ever heard of The White Rose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Yes [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Then you know I mean.</span> <span id="s1832">These were Germans, and they were all executed.</span> <span id="s1833">In fact, I think they were first tortured at the same place I was at, and then hung at Plötzensee, which was the place where the – where the gallows were where they hung the Germans that didn’t go along with the regime or helped Jews or so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: A-And what is the connection?</span> <span id="s1835">We were talking about your activity in the Civil Rights mov –</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Well, I was not – I was not active.</span> <span id="s1837">I was just saying the people that were active did not live very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: No, no, no, I – that’s not what I meant.</span> <span id="s1839">I meant, were you active in the Civil Rights movement in the United States, because you had lived in a country that deprived others of civil rights.</span> <span id="s1840">Did you – was this something that you’ve worked towards as an adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: As an adult, no, I was not active.</span> <span id="s1842">I think – I think you’re going back to the 1960’s and 70’s.</span> <span id="s1843">First of all, in Seattle, we did not have the problems there that you have had in other parts of the country.</span> <span id="s1844">For instance, we’ve had Afro-American mayors in s – in – in Seattle.</span> <span id="s1845">Exec – the present county executive is a – is a black man.</span> <span id="s1846">And lately here we’ve had a few more problems, but that is because we get these activists coming in, not even from Seattle, that demonstrate on – any time there’s something going on, starting when we had that WTO there.</span> <span id="s1847">And these are people that were – are actually being paid to demonstrate.</span> <span id="s1848">And – but lately we ni – didna – we have not had good leadership in Seattle.</span> <span id="s1849">The mayor, even though – the present mayor, even though I supported him, Paul Schell, is not very strong.</span> <span id="s1850">The previous police chief, the present police chief is not very strong.</span> <span id="s1851">And if anything I am an activist now to get those people out.</span> <span id="s1852">And again I’m very much up within the city councilor, like I said earlier, I’m sort of on the sister city council of Seattle and I know most of the politicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: So you are active in the political life of your city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: In the political life, yes, I am very active in the political life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Well, probably it goes back because about 30 years ago the former governor of the state of Washington, Albert D. Rosellini and I became good friends, strictly through my C.P.A. And my C.P.A. is a Sephardic Jew, also speaks Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, he speaks about seven languages.</span> <span id="s1857">And the former governor is an American, but he is from Italian parents.</span> <span id="s1858">In fact, a book has been written on him.</span> <span id="s1859">And my C.P.A., Victor Barkey(ph) introduced me to Governor Rosellini, and they have been long, long friends, and they always speak Italian together.</span> <span id="s1860">And over the years Governor Rosellini and I have become very close friends.</span> <span id="s1861">And he is the man – again probably because I am in the computer business and I did mailings for candidates and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: So it’s not because you were aware of what can happen when a political system goes awry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: No, definitely not, it is just that I helped in the political party and some of them – right now yes, I’m very active to get Mark Sidran elected as mayor, because first of all, he is Jewish and he tries to eliminate demonstration that shouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s1864">Again, people like – that put up that swastika, and he’s definitely, of course, against that, and he is against, naturally, anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1865">And lately we have seen a little bit of that in Seattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: What does that do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: It bothers me.</span> <span id="s1868">And again, that’s why I’m very much in support of Mark Sidran for mayor.</span> <span id="s1869">And hopefully he will have a police chief that can do the right thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: When you see pictures of victims in Rwanda or the Sudan, what does that do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: That bothers me, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Because of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: I’m sure it is, and again I say why does that happen?</span> <span id="s1874">Again, I was all for the U.S. to help out with troops over there.</span> <span id="s1875">I didn't like the way it was taken out.</span> <span id="s1876">And again, i-it bothers me, is just like the U.S. could have helped many million of Jews being saved.</span> <span id="s1877">And why they aren’t helping out further bothers me.</span> <span id="s1878">I don’t like what happened in Iraq.</span> <span id="s1879">I think they – it was good for us to be in there, but why not get rid of the main cancer in Iraq, which is still over there.</span> <span id="s1880">And those things bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Do you think you are more sensitive to that than those of us who did not grow up in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: I’m sure I am, I’m sure I am.</span> <span id="s1883">I know a lot of people, including Jews in Seattle that did not like us going into Rwanda or Iraq and so forth.</span> <span id="s1884">They say why should we get involved?</span> <span id="s1885">I said, the same reason we should have been involved to save Jews.</span> <span id="s1886">And some of them, like I say, even other Jewish people I know, were against that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yes, lately I have.</span> <span id="s1889">I have spoken to two different rotary clubs in the Seattle area.</span> <span id="s1890">I spoke to the troops in Fort Lewis, mostly officers.</span> <span id="s1891">In fact, had a long talk afterwards with the assistant commanding general of Fort Lewis, a two star general.</span> <span id="s1892">And yes, I do talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Again, like I say, it cannot be forgotten and the people, so many of the younger generation, are not learning enough in s-schools.</span> <span id="s1895">And I’m talking about even college students do not know enough about it, and they should know.</span> <span id="s1896">And that’s why it feels very important, people like me, survivors of the concentration camps, should speak publicly.</span> <span id="s1897">And in Seattle now, we have the Holocaust Education Center, and they get the requests for speakers and I am signed up as a speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Do you – have you been to any conferences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yes, I attended the Child Survivors of the Holocaust Conference in Prague, and was the chairman of that ho – Child Survivors Conference of the Holocaust in Seattle, that we had last September.</span> <span id="s1900">And the – prior to this I did not, as my ex didn’t want me to go to any of that.</span> <span id="s1901">But – and now I plan to go, as long as I’m healthy, I plan to go to every one.</span> <span id="s1902">The next one is in Houston in October, and the following year it’ll be in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1903">And right now I’m not at liberty to say there’s another city in another state that wants to have a conference.</span> <span id="s1904">And they have asked me to help them organize it because they were in – the main organizers were in Seattle, and – and again, that state has very few survivors, which of course Washington state has, and I put on, I feel, a fairly decent conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: How is it that you got to be the one to put on the conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Well, first of all, the people in Seattle know what I’ve been very active.</span> <span id="s1907">I serve on the United States Olympic Committee, and we put on several fundraisers that I have headed.</span> <span id="s1908">And incidentally, Governor Rosellini is the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Washington state.</span> <span id="s1909">I have also been involved in professional associations where I have put on conferences here.</span> <span id="s1910">At that time data processing management association, of which – End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: – museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Taucher, and this is tape four, side B, and you were talking about putting on conferences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: And anyhow, some of the people in Seattle, the survivors and so forth, knew that I had been very active in different activities, putting on conferences and banquets and so forth.</span> <span id="s1913">When I was in Prague, at the conference there, I was asked if Seattle could put th – on the conference, since initially it was scheduled for Vancouver, B.C., about a two hour drive from Seattle.</span> <span id="s1914">And if – they cancelled the Vancouver consom – conference, but still wanted it, and then asked if we could put it on in Seattle.</span> <span id="s1915">And I said, if I can get the proper facilities, yes.</span> <span id="s1916">And so I found the proper facilities and then I got the survivors – child survivors of the Holocaust in Seattle, there were about eight or nine of them.</span> <span id="s1917">And I presented that, and with the exception of two people that dropped out, they asked me to be the chairman of it.</span> <span id="s1918">And that’s how it came about that I headed that conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: And obviously you feel a connection to these other child survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Oh, I certainly do.</span> <span id="s1921">And we – we meet monthly.</span> <span id="s1922">And we’re just a small group, but we do meet monthly and kind of talk about how we survived and what we can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Are you proud of yourself that you were able to make a life after such a difficult childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s1925">I am very proud of what has happened, and some of it I blame my parents for it.</span> <span id="s1926">I mean, they tre – they raised us – and I’m saying rus – us, my brother and I, the proper way, even as young as we were.</span> <span id="s1927">And I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my brother’s accomplishments.</span> <span id="s1928">Be – being – going in as a private recruit in the army, no college education, working up to a field grade officer, which a major is, he can be proud of himself, and I am proud of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Did he marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Well, he actually has been – he’s on the third marriage right now.</span> <span id="s1931">And as you probably know, a lot of survivors do have troubles staying married, but he now is married to a girl from s – originally from Scotland, and they’ve been married now for about 22 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Does he have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: He has one daughter from his very first mar – marriage, which he never should have married, and then he has two boys from his second marriage.</span> <span id="s1934">I think he is somewhat in contact with one of the boys.</span> <span id="s1935">And he has two children, a boy and a girl from his present marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1937">Did you, when you c – came to this country, try to stay in touch with Frau Noelting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yes, we did, we wri – have written to her, but e – I think she wrote back once, and it was a very disturbing letter.</span> <span id="s1939">She still – she was just as upset when we left Germany, and also wrote to us.</span> <span id="s1940">First of all, she criticized the ge – the poor spelling and so forth, and grammar we used in German.</span> <span id="s1941">Of course, we had a second and third grade education.</span> <span id="s1942">So of course our writing skill wasn’t very good in German.</span> <span id="s1943">[sneeze] Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: And she criticized that and she really criticized us going to the U.S. And I think we did answer her, but we never heard anything from her.</span> <span id="s1946">Now, my brother, when he was stationed as a military soldier – in fact I think he was a lieutenant or a captain at that time in the army – excuse me – and he was stationed in Heidelberg, he did visit Trowta(ph) Noelting, the stepdaughter, and they did get together.</span> <span id="s1947">And I think they had a very good get together, and I think it was shortly after Frau Noelting had passed away, and they talked about her.</span> <span id="s1948">She – she was very old in age, and really didn’t want to die, but she knew she was dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: So your only contact with Frau Noelting was that one letter, and then her return –</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: That’s what I can remember, and I’m pretty sure my brother will agree to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: And then what was your connection with Werner Nathan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Again, I actually visited him with my ex-wife in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1953">And again, it must have been – I was an officer in the Data Processing Management Association and we had a convention in New York, that my ex went with me.</span> <span id="s1954">And that must have been in ’69 or ’70 and we went to visit him, but then I lost track.</span> <span id="s1955">I n – lost track of him once when I went to Korea in the army, but then I found his address again and actually was able to look him up.</span> <span id="s1956">And he was doing very well, he had a very successful ber – furniture business.</span> <span id="s1957">We went to his house.</span> <span id="s1958">In fact, he picked us up at the airport, I think, in a new Cadillac at that time, I remember it.</span> <span id="s1959">And he was very well off.</span> <span id="s1960">But then again we lost track.</span> <span id="s1961">Again I was in the midst of building a business and spending too much time in the business and didn’t take time to write.</span> <span id="s1962">And then I know I had written him again maybe six months or a year later and the letter came back and no forwarding address.</span> <span id="s1963">So – and that’s when we lost track.</span> <span id="s1964">And he may be – may have moved out of Newark.</span> <span id="s1965">But I have tried to look it up on the internet, but unless they have a listed phone number, you can’t find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Do you receive reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: No.</span> <span id="s1968">And this is again one of my reasons that I’m going to Germany next month.</span> <span id="s1969">It’s one thing – first of all I play to reestablish my German citizenship.</span> <span id="s1970">I have found out a lot of survivors, especially in our new group here, have rees – established their citizenship and I know some people are getting as much as 1100 dollars a month pension from the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: When you say your new group, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: The group that we have formed, each state has formed their own little group, a survivor’s group and then we are combining it as the Holocaust Survivor Foundation, and all the various other groups.</span> <span id="s1973">For instance, in Seattle we have formed the Survivors of the Holocaust Asset Recovery Project.</span> <span id="s1974">And we are going to join as an affiliate.</span> <span id="s1975">We’re still separate corporations, but we will be part of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation.</span> <span id="s1976">And a number of these people, they are all elected officials from their own state, just like I am president of the Washington state group.</span> <span id="s1977">And – and a lot of these people have reestablished their German citizenship because now in the U.S., dual citizenship is permitted.</span> <span id="s1978">And by reestablishing the German citizenship, there is a chance to recev – receive a pension.</span> <span id="s1979">And I’m going to take every penny I can get out of the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Well, they took too much away from my parents and from me, and I think I have a moral right to get some monies out of – I can live without it, I don’t need the money, but I think morally it’s right for me to get some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: What are your thoughts about Holocaust survivors today who are indigent or in – in dire straights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Well, this is – I have a real problem with the – you have the Claims Conference, that has received billions of dollars.</span> <span id="s1984">In fact, the U.S. government gave them four million dollars.</span> <span id="s1985">And the – there are people, especially in Miami that are living out on the street and begging for food, that are concentration camp survivors and not receiving any money.</span> <span id="s1986">We had, at our meeting two days ago, we had Gideon Taylor, the – I guess the s – executive vice president from the Claims Conference talking and say well, half of the survivors are living in Israel, and the Claims Conference also has to look out for the people living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1987">And we have built memorials.</span> <span id="s1988">Well, we don’t want memorials.</span> <span id="s1989">We want money for the people that need it the most, and so we are trying to do something.</span> <span id="s1990">And first of – also, the Claims Conference is made up of mostly self appointed people that are not Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1991">And it should be Holocaust survivors that do the distribution of the funds.</span> <span id="s1992">And that’s what we are working on right now, even if – if it’s necessary, we will sue the Claims Conference.</span> <span id="s1993">And they have to release some money because our people are dying.</span> <span id="s1994">I have the 1999 tax return from the Claims Conference.</span> <span id="s1995">Oh, I didn’t bring it with me.</span> <span id="s1996">I didn't bring it with me, but where they had, in the 1999 return, they had a profit, or income of over 247 million dollars.</span> <span id="s1997">And yet they don’t have money to pay the people that need it the most.</span> <span id="s1998">That is not right.</span> <span id="s1999">And Mr. Gideon Taylor, the executive director, in 1999 his salary was 184,000 dollars, plus 35,000 dollars in benefits, I don’t know what those benefits are, plus expense money that we don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s2000">That shouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s2001">And we are, our group is trying to do something about it, and that’s why we met here in Washington last November, and just this week.</span> <span id="s2002">So in fact, I think you said you were at the – at our meeting place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: I’m afraid not.</span> <span id="s2005">I am hoping that they did, but did they really?</span> <span id="s2006">Look what was going on in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2007">Even going back to Cambodia, the killing fields in Cambodia.</span> <span id="s2008">I don’t think they have learned, but I don’t think anything has been as bad what it was through the – during the Nazi regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Well, were six million Jews – people tortured and murdered.</span> <span id="s2011">Children put to death.</span> <span id="s2012">Yes, there were a lot of them, but I don’t think that many.</span> <span id="s2013">And forced in sof – put into forced labor until they couldn’t stand up any more and then murdered.</span> <span id="s2014">I think when they were murdered, they were murdered a little more quickly than what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s2015">But a – a lesson learned?</span> <span id="s2016">No, I’m afraid not.</span> <span id="s2017">And again, it will take countries like the U.S., Great Britain or other free countries to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: When we were walking in the museum, we saw these young high school students outside.</span> <span id="s2019">What lesson would you like to pass on to those young people who were standing in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: When you see things like this happen, don’t let it happen.</span> <span id="s2021">If you are in military age and you get asked to serve in your military in – of your country, which appear to be American, U.S., serve, and serve proudly.</span> <span id="s2022">I feel very strongly again, about the Vietnam war.</span> <span id="s2023">It was wrong, we all know it was wrong.</span> <span id="s2024">But for every American that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it.</span> <span id="s2025">While Bill Clinton, I thought, forgetting some of his personal problems, as a president he did a fairly good job.</span> <span id="s2026">He was a real friend towards Israel and the Jews.</span> <span id="s2027">But I never voted for him and never would vote for him, strictly because he said when he was 13 years old, I think, he said he was going to be president of the U.S.A. someday.</span> <span id="s2028">And somebody, with that being in mind, avoiding the draft, going to a foreign country, and demonstrating against his own county – country about the Vietnam war, does not deserve to be a president.</span> <span id="s2029">And that’s why I never voted for that man.</span> <span id="s2030">Like I said just earlier, every American man that refused to serve, somebody else went and died for it.</span> <span id="s2031">Look at me, I was in the U.S. for five years, getting out of hell, but I served my country, and I was proud to serve.</span> <span id="s2032">My brother served this country, and proud to serve, both of us as officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: You said that you – earlier on that you lost your childhood, you weren't a little boy after awhile.</span> <span id="s2034">Did you ever get that childhood back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: No, no, that’s – that’s gone forever.</span> <span id="s2036">I will say that when my brother and I first came to the States and lived in Kansas City, we for some reason started loving watching cowboy movies.</span> <span id="s2037">We’d go all over Kansas City, if there was a cowboy movie on like a Roy Roger, or Gene Autry, Johnny McBrown, I can still remember some of those names, we loved to watch those movies.</span> <span id="s2038">And maybe that’s maybe coming back a – a childhood where kids maybe at the age of 10 would love that.</span> <span id="s2039">We were 13 and 14 and we loved those movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Did you t-talk about your parents with your brother once you got to the United States?</span> <span id="s2041">Is it still a topic of conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Yes, at first we definitely did and we always for many years thereafter.</span> <span id="s2043">We talked about it, we wondered where our mother was.</span> <span id="s2044">And probably my brother more so than I, that I quit talking about it.</span> <span id="s2045">We talked about our mother and father and he would start crying.</span> <span id="s2046">And for some reason I – I would not – I – I mean, maybe mentally I was stronger than he was, I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Is – is it that he’s more emotional that you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: He – he is more –</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: What – what do you attribute the difference in response to your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2051">Again, maybe – I was younger and my brother was a year older and I think maybe he matured more – he was more mature in that respect than I was.</span> <span id="s2052">A-Again, I can’t really give you a full answer.</span> <span id="s2053">But I remember more.</span> <span id="s2054">And yet, when it came to memory of our parents, my brother was much more emotional than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Did he have more awareness of the danger that you were in, or do you think it was equal, that your awareness was the same as his?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: We were both aware equally, but my brother was more a-afraid, more scared, not only of being caught by the SS or the Nazis, but also he was scared, very scared of the bombing.</span> <span id="s2057">That frightened him, when he could hear the bombing, the artillery, the anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s2058">He was very, very frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Was it because of sound for – he was more sensitive to sound?</span> <span id="s2060">You said he wanted to be a pianist.</span> <span id="s2061">Do you think maybe the sound was more harsher for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: You know, I never th – gave that a thought, but he is very musically inclined, and now is a very excellent pianist, incidentally.</span> <span id="s2063">And I never gave that a thought, but maybe that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2064">He – his sound is better.</span> <span id="s2065">I mean, I tried to take a – violin lessons, but I’m just not musically inclined.</span> <span id="s2066">But a – I don’t know if that’s it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Was he as physically strong as – as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Probably more so physically strong.</span> <span id="s2069">Again, in sports, he was much better in sports than – than I was, especially in baseball.</span> <span id="s2070">Too bad I bra – didn’t bring it aga – along, I should ha – should make a picture.</span> <span id="s2071">In 1947, the “Kansas City Star” had a picture of us both first coming to the U.S., to Kansas City, and we were playing baseball.</span> <span id="s2072">I think my brother was a batter and I was a catcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: What did baseball represent to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: America.</span> <span id="s2075">And we learned how to play baseball very quickly.</span> <span id="s2076">I was never very good at it and my brother was.</span> <span id="s2077">I was a better swimmer, I – than my brother was.</span> <span id="s2078">I think in – in sports my brother was much better than I was, except for swimming, which I could do better.</span> <span id="s2079">I guess I am more in a individual sport like swimming and martial arts and so forth, while my brother was more in a team type of sports, like baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: What are your children’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: My son’s name is Walter and my daughter’s name is Audrey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Are they named after anybody specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Walter was named after my uncle, who was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s2084">No, I had two uncles by the name of Walter.</span> <span id="s2085">One of them was a lawyer and one of them was a doctor – a – a dentist.</span> <span id="s2086">And Audrey, her middle name we gave to – as Teresa, which was our mother’s name.</span> <span id="s2087">But actually, she thinks – she and her mother are very close, and she and I are very close and she doesn’t hold our divorce against each other.</span> <span id="s2088">She – she understands her mother, and – but she did change her middle name to Cavanno(ph), my mother’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s2089">I mean, my wife’s maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Do you think that the – the interest in the Holocaust now is something that’s permanent or just a passing –</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: No, I think it’s permanent.</span> <span id="s2092">Yeah, I think it’s very permanent and my daughter is very much interested in it.</span> <span id="s2093">When we had the conference in Seattle, the Child Survivors of the Holocaust, my daughter went to Seattle to participate in it.</span> <span id="s2094">Because – I was probably one of the first to include second generation, much to the disagreement of the previous people from the Child Survivors.</span> <span id="s2095">But I included quite a number of the second generation, I had seminars that both second generation and survivors could attend, because I found out some – a lot of the second generations wanted to be involved and hear from other survivors than just their parents.</span> <span id="s2096">And so I did include a number of activities the second generation, and my daughter did attend a lot of the sessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Is there anything you wanted to talk about that we haven’t touched on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: No, I think we have pretty much touched everything, and I have – really feel good being able to give my story.</span> <span id="s2099">And I think we’ve covered anything, unless you think of anything else you wanted to cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Do you feel that you’ve lived a normal life after the war, once you got settled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Yes, I feel I lived a normal life.</span> <span id="s2102">I am fortunate that I was able to build up a business with a very minimum education.</span> <span id="s2103">A lot of my education is self study.</span> <span id="s2104">I’ve led here lately a very comfortable life.</span> <span id="s2105">I will say back in the 60’s when I started the business, it was not easy.</span> <span id="s2106">It was working 14
