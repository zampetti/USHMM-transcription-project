born with.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Marguerite Glicksman.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And you were born with --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: No middle name?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Me neither.</span> <span id="s24">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: In London, England.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And when?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Secrets.</span> <span id="s28">31st of July, 1915.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I had wonderful parents.</span> <span id="s31">Dad came from Poland, my mother was English, born, and I had two brothers, and one sister.</span> <span id="s32">Two boys and two girls, and we were a very, very happy family.</span> <span id="s33">And we had a beautiful childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Tell me what your dad did and what your -- did your mom work also?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">Mom looked after the kids.</span> <span id="s37">Dad was a tailor.</span> <span id="s38">He came to England at the age of 14, and he always tells us he had half a crown and a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s39">He had walked from Poland.</span> <span id="s40">He had his own business by the time he was 18.</span> <span id="s41">He knew an aunt who was in engl -- in London, so that he was able to have somebody to go to when he arrived.</span> <span id="s42">And my mother used to say to him, “Philip, speak Polish to the children, they’ll have other languages.”</span> <span id="s43">He would say, “Yes, Missus, I will.”</span> <span id="s44">Answer in English, of course.</span> <span id="s45">And my mother had a beautiful voice, and she played the piano, and my dad was a smashing looker, and many of his lady clients wanted to go out with him, and occasionally he would be out and meet a lady and then some relative would say, Esther, I saw Philip with so and so.</span> <span id="s46">She would say, yes, but he came home at night.</span> <span id="s47">And anyhow, we -- we were very, very posey family, we used to do most things in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s48">One brother was a pianist, he became an artist as well, but he couldn’t make a living as a pianist, but he would be sitting at the table doing finger exercises and he’d say to me, Marg, what am I playing?</span> <span id="s49">Sometimes I would guess.</span> <span id="s50">My other brother would be -- would be dancing with my sister, who did ballet, and they’d be prancing around and I’d be rehearsing lines for a play.</span> <span id="s51">Mother would be cooking, Pop would come and visit and he’d take something, you know, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So you were a close family?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Were you the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No, I was the second -- my sister was the first, I was the second, then the two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Was your fi -- did your father go to war in 1918 -- 1914, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, but he -- he volunteered as an ambulance driver, and they wouldn’t take him because of his nationality.</span> <span id="s58">But he did go back to Poland at one time to report for duty, and he didn’t stay very long.</span> <span id="s59">He wasn’t kicked out, everything was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So did he become a British citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh yes, eventually, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: But not during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Before the second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: A local school for -- from about five to about 13 - 14, and the school is still there and it’s right opposite Madame Tussaud’s, in London.</span> <span id="s68">And it’s attached to a church.</span> <span id="s69">This is very interesting because although it’s a church school and supplemented by the London council and the church, they had Hebrew classes in the morning while the other girls were having, you know, their Bible, or whatever, and we would have Hebrew classes.</span> <span id="s70">And we had a teacher and a headmaster, there were three classes.</span> <span id="s71">And so I learned a little bit of Hebrew, and of course had some at home, and we learned about the various holidays, and holy days.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: W-W-Were you a religious family at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well, my mother -- until the war, my mother kept fairly kosher.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, she -- we would never have anything that wasn’t, and we had blue -- blue-edged cloths for the milk and red edged ones for the meat, and we had the different things.</span> <span id="s75">We didn't have a dishwasher, Mum was the dishwasher.</span> <span id="s76">And when war came and we were rationed, there was no way -- she would trade her bacon coupons for cheese or eggs or something, or butter.</span> <span id="s77">So we kept as -- but the milk -- milk and meat was -- that just went by the board because she couldn’t keep it up, it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Ho -- how aware were you of the world when you were growing up as a teenager?</span> <span id="s79">You were -- were you keeping -- were you reading the newspapers, listening to the radio, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Oh yes, and we went over to the continent a lot.</span> <span id="s81">I mean, at 14 I went to Switzerland for two weeks with a friend, and one New Year’s Eve with another friend, we went to Paris, to -- where she had an uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s82">And my sister and I would go to the coast of Belgium [indecipherable] and all that.</span> <span id="s83">And you know, we always had a sense of travel.</span> <span id="s84">My father, I think, was a bit of a Gypsy, he loved to travel, and I think I caught -- caught the bug from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: When the war started --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Mm-hm --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: -- in Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: -- did life change very radically for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Not immediately.</span> <span id="s91">As I told you, I was in the British Red Cross, volunteer, and the day that the war was declared, a friend who lived up the street was also a member, and I -- she rang me, and she said, have you got your uniform on?</span> <span id="s92">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s93">She said, do you think we should report to the Middlesex Hospital?</span> <span id="s94">And I said, I don’t know, maybe.</span> <span id="s95">But I said let’s get together.</span> <span id="s96">And we did.</span> <span id="s97">But that was quite a dramatic moment when Churchill announced that we were at war, September the third, 1939, 11 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s98">I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s99">And, you know, we sort of plodded along, and until I was eventually called up for real military duty, I would go twice a week to the Middlesex Hospital emergency, put bandages on and stuff like that, and then I would do three nights a week after I working, and three nights a week I was on duty in the underground stations, doling out cough medicine and aspirin and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Let’s -- let’s go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: You were doing -- before the war started, were you doing secretarial work, or this was during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, oh after school I went to secretarial college in London and learned bookkeeping and commerce and all that sort of thing, and stenography.</span> <span id="s104">And I had got a job just before the war with a place on Fleet Street.</span> <span id="s105">My sister was working for a newspaper on Fleet Street, and I was working for a supplier of newsprint and all that sort of stu -- allied kind of thing.</span> <span id="s106">And when the big bombing in London started, it was impossible to get to work because there was glass everywhere, water, and you couldn’t just go anywhere, it was -- and things were burning and that really brought the war very close to you.</span> <span id="s107">And at that time my mother was nervous and so she went to the country and she took my younger brother.</span> <span id="s108">She went to Malvern, and she found a place to live, and my younger brother, he was quite young then, and when he was about 16, he became the inspector of weights and measures for the area.</span> <span id="s109">And then of course, I was getting very agitated because I hadn’t been called up, and I was -- I thought, here I am, you know, ready to go.</span> <span id="s110">Everybody’s going off to war and I’m not?</span> <span id="s111">And then I got my papers, where did they send me?</span> <span id="s112">To London.</span> <span id="s113">And it was to a hospital that was built for Florence Nightingale by Sir Samuel Herbert.</span> <span id="s114">The hospital was called The Royal Herbert Hospital, and very, very old fashioned, but it was wonderful, and I was very pleased to be there because on my off duty times I could get home to London and see Dad and my sister.</span> <span id="s115">And cousins would come and pop in.</span> <span id="s116">And if there was an air raid, we’d all go down into the basement and everything would shake and then it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Could you explain what it means to be a volunteer in the Red Cross in Britain?</span> <span id="s118">What kind of training you had, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s120">I joined when I was about 16 or 17 as a junior, and when I was 18 I became a senior, and when you were 18 you had to sign a paper to say that you would be mobile or immobile.</span> <span id="s121">If you were immobile, it meant that in case of national emergency, you could be used from your home when you had time.</span> <span id="s122">If you were mobile, you were liable to be called up to serve with the services, whichever forces, and I had to be mobile, so that was why I was called up, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What does that mean, you have to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: You wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes, I wanted to be, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And what sor --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I wanted to be where the action was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And what sort of training, what -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s131">While we were members, every week we would go to classes and lectures and we learned how to do first aid.</span> <span id="s132">We even did chemical warfare, we had lectures on that, and we also, once a year we would have to go to a military hospital and do work in the hospital like a real nurse.</span> <span id="s133">And we had three days on medical, three days on surgical and one day in the operating theater, so that, you know, we had a good background and it wasn’t just bedpans, it was -- and making beds, it was really in depth work.</span> <span id="s134">And we were all bright young things and eager to do our part, so, you know, it was -- it was very interesting and rewarding.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Was it frightening to be in -- in London during all these bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, some nights, you know, when I was going on duty to one of the underground stations, as long as I had my tin hat on and my gas mask, I felt fine.</span> <span id="s137">But the shrapnel was going around, and you know, you just did your thing, and it was dark, and you couldn’t have a -- a torch -- flashlight as they’re called here.</span> <span id="s138">And you just did your thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Were you -- did -- did you ever have any close calls, where --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, but that was when I was at Woolidge, when they were doing the bus bombs.</span> <span id="s141">I would be out with a friend, we’d maybe gone for a walk somewhere up the hill, and he would say, wait a minute, there’s one coming, duck.</span> <span id="s142">And we’d lie down on the ground and we’d count, and then you could tell, from the moment that the engine stopped, whereabouts it might fall.</span> <span id="s143">They were the closest calls.</span> <span id="s144">But you know, when you’re -- when you’re in the thick of things, you don’t -- you don’t worry about that.</span> <span id="s145">You just care about people not getting hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: And were you able to see your mother, did you go visit your mother, or was she too far --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Once, just before I was -- just before embarkation to go to Italy, which was my next port of call, I was given a week’s leave and I went to visit Mum, stayed with her, and then bye-bye, my dear, take care, blah, blah, blah, blah, and off I went.</span> <span id="s148">And that was an experience, because we had to meet at a certain station.</span> <span id="s149">We’d already been given a clothing allowance, and we had equipped ourselves, we had to get battle dress and a beret.</span> <span id="s150">And we had our outdoor uniforms and our indoor uniforms.</span> <span id="s151">And we had an allowance for laundry, three and sixpence a week.</span> <span id="s152">And you know, you had to wear a clean apron every day, and they were the aprons with the big red cross on your bosom, and these caps that you floated around with a red cross on the back, and you had these big starched tails.</span> <span id="s153">Anyway, we -- we went on this tr -- we had no idea where we were going, it was all very hush-hush.</span> <span id="s154">We arrived, and we found out it was Liverpool, and from there we boarded a ship, and the ship I went on was called the Sumeria.</span> <span id="s155">And everybody named it the Spameria, cause that’s all the kind of meat we had.</span> <span id="s156">And we were in convoy, there were 12 ships.</span> <span id="s157">And a convoy moves at the rate, at the pace of the slowest ship.</span> <span id="s158">And of course, going through the Mediterranean, we had various frights when they were doing these land mi -- mines, you know, minesweeping.</span> <span id="s159">And the noise was deafening, absolutely.</span> <span id="s160">And then, after about 10 days out at sea, we were told that if we got up at five o’clock the next morning, we would see an island where a British singer was very famous.</span> <span id="s161">And we knew that was the Isle of Capri, and Gracie Fields, one of the singers of England.</span> <span id="s162">And so we knew we were heading for Italy, but we thought we were going on to India.</span> <span id="s163">However, our consignment stopped in Naples, and we were housed in a nursing sister’s quarters in Vomero, which is just north of Naples.</span> <span id="s164">We had a nice time there, we weren’t working yet.</span> <span id="s165">And there were lots of American troops there, and they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s166">They took us to their PX’s or -- or UF -- USO’s, and we had our first piece of meat, and we had our first orange and our first banana.</span> <span id="s167">Things -- and ice cream, which we hadn’t had for three or four years.</span> <span id="s168">And then they would take us off to dances, which was lovely, and then we went -- after a week there we went by hospital train across Italy to -- where did we land?</span> <span id="s169">Somewhere on the other side, and eventually we were stationed in Barletta, which is just south of Bari, big port, and we were with the American fifth army and the British eighth army.</span> <span id="s170">They had huge medical facilities and we had prisoners of war there, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: The year is what, ’43?</span> <span id="s172">Or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah, about ’44, I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s174">And from there we went by -- eight of us were sent up north, and we went by ambulances, and dust I have never seen the like.</span> <span id="s175">We were covered in dust and we would arrive at a different town, Forlì or Reggie or anywhere, and when the fellows -- the troops heard that we spoke English, oh, the joy.</span> <span id="s176">And we eventually arrived in Mestre, which is the other side of the Venice causeway, so that in the evenings after work if we were off, we could go into Venice.</span> <span id="s177">We’d cadge a ride on the trucks, and there was nothing to buy in the stores, but it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s178">I knew every little bridge, and every little church.</span> <span id="s179">It was great.</span> <span id="s180">And then when I finished there, when -- oh, I think the -- D-Day, and -- and DE day happened while I was in Italy.</span> <span id="s181">And then I was demobbed in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What does demobbed mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Finished, you know, demobbed.</span> <span id="s184">Demobilized.</span> <span id="s185">And I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Wait a minute, I want to stop you for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Tell me what it was like when you fir -- in London, your first assignment, when you went into the military hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Was this very frightening off -- I mean, what was it like in --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: It was a bit awe-inspiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Well, this huge, big place, and not knowing anybody, you go there alone, you didn’t have any mates.</span> <span id="s194">You soon found friends, and your assigned to your quarters, and we were in a little house just outside the hospital which had formerly been married quarters.</span> <span id="s195">And there were four girls in this house.</span> <span id="s196">We became very friendly, and then, you know, you’re -- you’re a little bit nervous because here’s a great ward with about 20 men in bed, coughing and spitting and -- you know, and oh come here nurse, hold my hand.</span> <span id="s197">And then they would want to give you their rations, which you couldn’t really take because some of them would -- oh, and then we had the TB ward, so that was a little bit scary.</span> <span id="s198">And then -- oh, eventually I did six months in the operating theater there, which was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s199">Didn’t perform of course, but you know, for some of the operations you could hold the retractors and some of the casualties were very bad because near -- there’s a famous arsenal at Woolidge, and those civilians were entitled to the military treatment.</span> <span id="s200">So when that place was bombed once, there was a middle aged man who had a terrible stomach wound, and I was assigned to help dress it.</span> <span id="s201">And it was -- you know, you felt you were doing something.</span> <span id="s202">Oh, I remember my first experience, I’d only been there a week and a young boy, and he happened to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s203">He was about 21, young soldier and he was having great difficulty breathing.</span> <span id="s204">And the doctor came up to me and he said, nurse, can you do artificial respiration?</span> <span id="s205">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s206">So he said, well take over from nurse.</span> <span id="s207">Nurse was, you know, leaning acro -- on the bed, and doing this, and I took over from her.</span> <span id="s208">And then they said, keep doing it, and if you can, don’t give it up, bec -- and while you were doing it, you know, the boy was breathing, we’re taking him downstairs to the iron lung.</span> <span id="s209">And we took him downstairs to the iron lung, and here’s me still pumping away.</span> <span id="s210">Got him in the iron lung, and he died the next day, but his parents had arrived, so that made me feel good, and I felt good that I had ma -- managed to keep him alive til he saw his parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And that was one of my first experiences.</span> <span id="s213">And we had a nice group, and there was some very society ladies there.</span> <span id="s214">One of them was a cousin of the queen, Ambose Lyon.</span> <span id="s215">And they had two -- she had two other friends and we used to call them the holy trinity.</span> <span id="s216">They were always together.</span> <span id="s217">And of course there was a dramatic society, and I had to be in that.</span> <span id="s218">So we gave little concert parties and things in our spare time.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: You sang, or you acted?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Acted.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: You acted, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s223">Oh, I don’t have a voice any more.</span> <span id="s224">And that was nice.</span> <span id="s225">And then of course, off to Italy.</span> <span id="s226">And then from Italy I got home, demobbed in December --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Now was it -- let me get -- let me ask you about a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Was Italy different because it was almost a hundred -- was it a hundred percent military that you were dealing with when you were in Italy?</span> <span id="s230">A: Oh yes, yes, but, I mean, we saw civilians and we mixed with them, and we learned a few words of -- of Italian, of course.</span> <span id="s231">We couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s232">And the people were very poor mostly, especially down in the south, and these women would come and they would do your laundry in exchange for a bar of chocolate or a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s233">And you know, you did what you could, and was just very interesting.</span> <span id="s234">And rewarding.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did you like Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Loved it, oh loved it, mm.</span> <span id="s237">But of course, I saw parts that tourists don’t go to even now.</span> <span id="s238">Nobody goes down to Bari and Barletta.</span> <span id="s239">And Barletta happened to have a huge wine growing area, and Asti Spumanti was made there, which I don’t like because I got drunk on it one night at a party.</span> <span id="s240">Anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Did you eat a lot of Italian food, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No, because we were tainted, you see?</span> <span id="s243">We had British slop in the me -- from the mess.</span> <span id="s244">Very unexciting, but substantial and good.</span> <span id="s245">I mean, there were no restaurants you could go to anyway.</span> <span id="s246">You -- you wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s247">And there was nothing in the stores to buy, even if you had a bit of money, you know that?</span> <span id="s248">They had to ha -- had to stop manufacturing and making, and -- and stores were closed.</span> <span id="s249">However --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: W-Was there a lot of devastation in Italy that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Quite a bit, especially on our ambulance drive up north, and crossing the river Po, which was no water, it was just dust, and -- but you couldn’t see too much because you know, you were with the military and you had to go where you were taken, or where -- where they went.</span> <span id="s252">But in Venice, things were much better, and they started opera there, the last month I was there, and I saw two operas in one of the squares, absolutely gorgeous, beautiful.</span> <span id="s253">Course, the Italians last their operas for hours.</span> <span id="s254">They begin at nine and then at about 10:30 there’s a break for two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And it doesn’t end til about one in the morning, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: It’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Beautiful, beautiful --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: When [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Anyhow, Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s262">We -- we’re going to go to Greece in --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: -- in a few moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: When did you find out about what national socialism, what the Nazis had been doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: -- in Europe [indecipherable] the murders?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I knew that before I was -- before I was in the forces, because I worked as a volunteer for a woman who was a member of a -- an organization called the six point group.</span> <span id="s270">And they had six points of things that they were fighting for women’s equality.</span> <span id="s271">Equal ri -- ri -- pay for equal work, equal rights, voting, everything.</span> <span id="s272">And one of the members was Vera Britten, who wrote the “Testament of Youth,” which is about [indecipherable] as well, and Viscountess Rhonda, and this lady for whom I worked, her name was Monica Waitley.</span> <span id="s273">She became an MP for Limehouse, and I learned a lot through her, and she used to talk about the German people that they were bringing over to England, who were trying to get out of that country.</span> <span id="s274">So that’s how I first knew about it.</span> <span id="s275">And of course, you know, there were hints, and of course in the British -- in the Jewish press in England, they were giving out all the details that they could find, but you didn’t know how serious it was until later in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s277">So once you got demobbed --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: -- as you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: -- you went back to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I was in England, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: -- and back to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And so now everybody’s in London again?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well, my brother -- my older brother, Robin, the doctor, he wasn’t a doctor then, he was doing engineering, and because he was in an reserved occupation, he was working for Sperry gyroscopes or something, he couldn’t be released.</span> <span id="s289">But if he got into an active service they would release him.</span> <span id="s290">So he got into the air force.</span> <span id="s291">And he was training for -- to be a pilot, and then he came over to Canada for part of the training, which they did, and then came back to England all qualified, but they had so many pilots that they put him back to Sperry’s for his engineering.</span> <span id="s292">After the war he went to medical school and he became a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s294">So what did you do when you get ba -- you -- and you -- what year did you get back?</span> <span id="s295">When -- when did you come back from Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I think it was end of December, yeah.</span> <span id="s297">And I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">And I was mooching around for a bit, not doing very much.</span> <span id="s301">And then it was in April that I went to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And how did --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: -- how did it happen that you got to Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, because I ran into Amy Zoll.</span> <span id="s306">Amy Zoll at that time, she wasn’t Gottlieb.</span> <span id="s307">And we had known each other and she said to me, “Oh,” she said, “what about coming to Greece, we need somebody there.”</span> <span id="s308">I said, “I can’t go to Greece.”</span> <span id="s309">She said, “Well anyway, come up to the headquarters of the Joint,” which are here in London, and she said, “you’ll meet the lady who is in charge.”</span> <span id="s310">When we got there, this Dr. Schwartz was there.</span> <span id="s311">She introduced him and she said, “Dr. Schwartz, this is Marguerite Glicksman and she’s coming to Greece with me next week.”</span> <span id="s312">And that’s how it all happened, and I thought, well, that sounds interesting.</span> <span id="s313">And then I thought to myself, Greece, it’s a different language, it’s a different alphabet, how am I going to get on there?</span> <span id="s314">Not one word of Greek.</span> <span id="s315">So I bought a Greek book and I started to learn the alphabet.</span> <span id="s316">But the learned the upper case, capital letters.</span> <span id="s317">The -- the others just flayed me, I couldn’t cope with those.</span> <span id="s318">But when I got to Greece, I was -- I was sent to a hotel, the Grande Bretagne, and shared a room with a British girl who worked for the embassy.</span> <span id="s319">And it was temporary because then you could look around and try and find your own place.</span> <span id="s320">Well, I was with this girl, and then I was invited to Amy’s, and anoth -- the deputy director, I don’t know if you’ve heard of her, she’s no longer with us, Belle Mazuer.</span> <span id="s321">She’s quite a character, and she -- she had been an archaeologist in Greece before the war.</span> <span id="s322">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s323">However, Belle and Amy invited me to come to their house for dinner.</span> <span id="s324">And I said, well how will I find it?</span> <span id="s325">They said, tell the taxi driver so and so [indecipherable] whatever.</span> <span id="s326">And course I could see signs, I couldn’t read them, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s327">So I thought, I’ve got to learn the alphabet, at least I can read what’s on the shops and what’s on the stores and what the streets are, which I did, and I was able to cope.</span> <span id="s328">And then I was working for the director as his secretary, but Belle Mazuer asked me if I would do a study of students, and that was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s329">These young men, some had been hidden in the mountains while the Germans were invading, some were returnees, and they had mostly been towards the end of their studies, ready -- almost ready to take their degrees.</span> <span id="s330">But they had nothing.</span> <span id="s331">Some of them had no families left, some of them had a bit of family.</span> <span id="s332">But they were poor because everything they had had been taken away by the Greeks.</span> <span id="s333">And so what I had to do was interview each of these students, find out what they needed; books, a place to stay, food, etcetera.</span> <span id="s334">And there were about 22 of them I think I interviewed, and I am still a friend of one or two of them.</span> <span id="s335">Eventu -- and the students took me under their wing and I would go to the university dances with them occasionally, and we were -- we became good friends.</span> <span id="s336">One of the boys, he, I’m sorry to say died, he became the head of the -- the Greek railway system, engineering.</span> <span id="s337">The other one, who is still around, he became a biochemist, did very well for himself.</span> <span id="s338">Some of the others I lost track of.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Now what -- w-why were you s -- what was the point of the study?</span> <span id="s340">In order to then provide [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, so that the Joint, the American Joint Distribution Committee would be able to help them, to find -- to get the books for them, to give them food, if needed, parcels of food and clothing if they needed it.</span> <span id="s342">We had a big clothing department.</span> <span id="s343">Stacks of clothing were sent by the American Joint to Greece and we had people who would sort it, women’s, men’s, children’s, sizing and all that, and they could go to this depot and get clothes.</span> <span id="s344">And one of the -- one of the young men who was working in that, he was what we call pre-TB.</span> <span id="s345">They were borderline TB cases, and we had a little sanit -- sanitorium for these people and they were looked after.</span> <span id="s346">Well this young man, he was cured, and he married one of the girls at the girl’s home, that was the first wedding they had there.</span> <span id="s347">They were able to emigrate to the States and they went to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s348">Very, very wonderful thing, when I was in the States and I came to visit them, Niko said to me, Marguerite, he said, I would never have had this in Greece.</span> <span id="s349">They had a nice little apartment.</span> <span id="s350">He said, look, a refrigerator.</span> <span id="s351">And he said look, my bankbook, I’ve got some savings.</span> <span id="s352">It was absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="s353">Anyhow, unfortunately -- oh he -- he did very well in Baltimore, and he, one day in his -- he had a store for working men’s clothes, and one day he was shot in the store.</span> <span id="s354">However, he was -- he survived.</span> <span id="s355">They had two daughters, and he was no more, but his wife Renna continued, and why -- we used to go and see her, but we’ve lost touch because she got sick and we couldn’t communicate and we’ve lost touch, which is very sad.</span> <span id="s356">Anyhow, what else can I think of to tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Well, when you arrived in Greece --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: -- in ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: What -- y-you -- you immediately went to Athens [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: And what was it like right after the war?</span> <span id="s364">Wa -- did you see a lot of survivors coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well, they were already there when I got there, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: But had Amy cu -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Amy was there already --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: -- she was there before me.</span> <span id="s370">She only stayed a few weeks and then she was off to wherever was her next appointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: I believe it was Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s373">And my sister went to Austria for the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So she worked with Amy?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s377">So were things sort of more normalized in --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes, and they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: -- Greece when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And they were getting normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: And of course domestically there was great differences because in -- I finally found a little apartment and there was no stove, they had didn’t have stoves, they had a little gas ring that you could cook on.</span> <span id="s383">But this was normal for all the Greek people, that if you wanted to bake anything, you took it to the baker, to the forno, and he would tell you what time to come and collect it when it was ready.</span> <span id="s384">Even the rich people didn’t have a stove at home, and they didn’t have refrigerators.</span> <span id="s385">And the iceman would come and you would ask for ice.</span> <span id="s386">And I would go to work, the ice would be left on the doorstep and I would come home to a pool of water.</span> <span id="s387">But if I came home early enough, I could put the ice in the little icebox.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Would -- this was your first paying job dur -- right after --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: -- the war, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s392">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: And what -- what -- what was your day like?</span> <span id="s394">I mean, you were a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, we had to be at work at eight o’clock in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: And for four days of the week, we left at two.</span> <span id="s398">You worked from eight until two.</span> <span id="s399">One day a week you left -- you came back at five and worked til eight in the evening, and we used to call that black Thursday.</span> <span id="s400">But when we got home at two, it was so hot in the summer, of course, that mostly you’d flop on your bed.</span> <span id="s401">You’d have a bite to eat and you’d flop, and you’d go into a deep, deep sleep.</span> <span id="s402">Well, I was very friendly with several of the young men, one or two who worked in the office, and this young doctor I told you about.</span> <span id="s403">And they would come back to my place because my apartment was on a direct line to a big hospital in Athens called the Evangelismos Hospital, so I had water every day, all the time.</span> <span id="s404">Everywhere else they would have an hour in the morning water, and maybe two hours in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s405">So the boys would come to my place, and they’d all take a shower.</span> <span id="s406">And -- you know, I was happy that I was able to do this, it was great.</span> <span id="s407">And they would bring lunch, they’d bring some cold meat and cheese and bread, and we’d enjoy ourselves, and we’d all flop.</span> <span id="s408">I had a couch in the living room and two couches that were used for beds in the bedroom, tiny place.</span> <span id="s409">And some would sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s410">Sometimes there were four, sometimes there were five, and we would just make the best of -- of the situation.</span> <span id="s411">And in those days, money was absolutely awful.</span> <span id="s412">The drachma was just paper, worth nothing.</span> <span id="s413">And so when you paid rent, it had to be paid in gold pounds, so that your money was given to you in the office every month, and my rent was three gold pounds.</span> <span id="s414">Some -- it was English -- gold English sovereigns, that’s it.</span> <span id="s415">And then they had Swiss gold francs, and I think they had French gold francs.</span> <span id="s416">But you know, it was strange and you got used to this and you thought, well, this is wonderful, it’s another country.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Now these -- these boys that you did the survey of --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Were they all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: And were they all boys who had been in camps, and had come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Some of them had been in camps and some of them had been hidden -- had hidden in the mountains when -- you know, when the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s425">And then, when the civil war happened [indecipherable] many of them were accused of being traitors.</span> <span id="s426">And I don’t know how it happened, but I think in Matsas’ book, he explains that.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And were you affected by the civil war?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, because you couldn't travel.</span> <span id="s429">The only way you could travel was with a special permit, and they had put landmines down in much of the territory towards Salonika.</span> <span id="s430">And I was in the dramatic group, and the general of the British army was so impressed with our last play, he said, that has to go to the troops in Salonika, can you get permission?</span> <span id="s431">So how did we get to Salonika?</span> <span id="s432">The Admiral’s boat.</span> <span id="s433">We could go by sea up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And what was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: That was a wonderful weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: And what was the play?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: “Laburnum Grove,” by Priestly.</span> <span id="s438">Yeah.</span> <span id="s439">And it went down very well, everybody enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s440">I was the mother, and oh yes, for these plays, all the office used to come and see them, and all the embassy staffs, various countries, would come, and we’d put on a play once every six weeks or two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And was it a full play with staging --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: -- or you did a reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Oh we did it, and we got -- we got made up costumes and God knows what.</span> <span id="s449">There was one play called “Saloon Bar” and I was a barfly, an old lady who was there always, a regular, and it was quite funny.</span> <span id="s450">And then another one was called “Flair Path.”</span> <span id="s451">And I remember in that I was a cockney woman with a husband and this Polish fellow’s plane had just come in, and I said [indecipherable] I said, did you see his -- his plane, it’s got an ‘ole in it.</span> <span id="s452">Really crazy stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And you had been doing plays as a kid as well, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s455">I was an extrovert, you know.</span> <span id="s456">I probably still am, however I think I did my bit in the war and I did a bit in Greece and I feel that I, you know, helped in some small way.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you -- did you do social work in Greece at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: The social work was the student bit, and then of course, the helping some of the people when I could, and everybody wanted to learn English from me, so that’s how I didn't learn Greek.</span> <span id="s461">And so I would give these little lessons to people, and in any -- in any possible way that you could be useful, you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Can you describe some other ways?</span> <span id="s463">Didn’t you hide some -- some folks during the civil war?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s465">As I said, these fellows who’d hid in the mountains when the Germans were there, they were sought after by the military and -- as being traitors.</span> <span id="s466">So several of them -- one of the young men was called Alberto Guiladee.</span> <span id="s467">And he went to Israel and he became a member of the government, I forgotten which thing.</span> <span id="s468">And then there was this Dr. Monaliaruf, and one or two others, and they would come before it got dark, come and visit, and then they would stay overnight, and then they would leave when it got light in the morning.</span> <span id="s469">And as I think I mentioned, this apartment was semi-basement and the window looked onto the street and you could see the legs of people, and the lower part of their torsos and we would -- every, about half an hour, soldiers would march by.</span> <span id="s470">They were in a long line, five of them, and they’d have the guns, and they would march by, and it was very ominous.</span> <span id="s471">But we kept very quiet and we had no lights on and they would just pass the way and fortunately nobody was ever caught and nobody was ever in danger, really.</span> <span id="s472">I was in danger because if I’d been -- if I’d been found out the Joint would have sent me home too.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: They would have.</span> <span id="s474">They -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: They would have, oh yes, you -- you mustn’t interfere and you mustn’t do anything that’s politically unsound.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And so why --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Politically incorrect.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And why did you take that risk, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Because I liked the people, and because they had to be helped.</span> <span id="s480">Somebody had to help, and if I had the means, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Did other friends of yours, do you think, did the same thing, or you didn’t talk to each other about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Oh, we never ti -- never mentioned it, no, no.</span> <span id="s483">Was hush-hush.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And can you describe the different kinds of things that the Joint did during the -- you were there for four years --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: -- that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s488">Well, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s489">One of the girls in the girl’s home -- and I saw her when I was back in Greece last year, she was a very pretty girl and she had been engaged -- she’d been on the island of Crete and she had been engaged to a non-Jewish man who had been very much into politics and he was anti this, that and the other.</span> <span id="s490">And I think he was killed.</span> <span id="s491">But she was in Athens and she was one of the girls at the girl’s home.</span> <span id="s492">She’d lost all her family and everything.</span> <span id="s493">Her name was Eka.</span> <span id="s494">Well, Eka -- oh, I have to interrupt.</span> <span id="s495">At the girl’s home -- before the war, Greek girls and particularly girls of good families never worked, all they did was learn how to do housework, cook, embroidery and that was it until they got married.</span> <span id="s496">So that these girls came back and they didn’t work, they had no professions.</span> <span id="s497">So this was a part of what was done for them by Joint, through the National Council of Jewish Women, and what’s the other organiza -- ORT, yes.</span> <span id="s498">And ORT sent sewing machines, and so the girls at the home were learning to sew and do dressmaking and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s499">Well, Eka learned to sew very well.</span> <span id="s500">And they decided that she had a flair and that she should go to the home that they had in Paris and learn haute couture.</span> <span id="s501">So, in order to get Eka to Paris was about six months work.</span> <span id="s502">And I would go to her the -- to the police because somebody who knew her ex-fiancé had told about her, that she must have been a radical.</span> <span id="s503">And so the -- the passport people wouldn’t give her a passport, they wouldn’t give her any permission to leave.</span> <span id="s504">And I would have to go to -- she had to have a representative from the Joint to go with her to all these interviews and police things, and so I used to go with her.</span> <span id="s505">And finally she did get the visa and she did go to Paris and she did learn haute couture.</span> <span id="s506">And when she came back, she started a little business on her own, which was a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s507">And I’m trying to think what else they did.</span> <span id="s508">Course many of the girls at the home were adopted by people in Canada and in the States, and so they were able to emigrate and lots of them came over.</span> <span id="s509">And this one girl I told you about, she’s a cousin of Matsas, Nina.</span> <span id="s510">Nina had a sister, they were both in the girl’s home.</span> <span id="s511">The sister was younger than Nina and she was adopted by a family in Canada.</span> <span id="s512">And so Esther came to Canada where she married and had a wonderful family, four lovely children, and Nina eventually came to Canada, but she didn't like it so she went to New York, where some of her other former girl’s home girls had gone.</span> <span id="s513">And so they had a little sort of clubby kind of relationship.</span> <span id="s514">Nina eventually married and her husband knew people in Washington and they said, why are you staying up there?</span> <span id="s515">Why don’t you come down here and we’ll set you up in a restaurant?</span> <span id="s516">He knew catering because he’d been catering ships.</span> <span id="s517">So Nina and this husband came down to Washington, and I don’t know if you ever went there, but there was a restaurant in Bethesda called The Diplomat.</span> <span id="s518">It was on Wisconsin Avenue, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s519">And then they finally retired, and they sold the business.</span> <span id="s520">Her husband died at the beginning of this year, and anyhow, I spoke to Nina and I said, Nina, would you be willing to be interviewed if they think that you would have a good story?</span> <span id="s521">She said of course.</span> <span id="s522">So anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Did you -- when you met the -- these people who came back from camps or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did they talk to you about their experiences in the concen --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s529">Danny Venamias, whose book you have, he was -- he worked for us in one of the offices, or in the sort -- clothes sorting or something, and he spoke of his experiences, and Danny had a close friend who was with him in the camp called Dario.</span> <span id="s530">Dario lives in California and Dario is some -- he was in some films, very good looking young man, but he and Danny used to shovel the remains from the crematoria.</span> <span id="s531">And -- you know, it was -- it was so heartbreaking to hear what they did.</span> <span id="s532">And Fofoe, the one who was married in my apartment and now lives in Spain, in -- yes, near Barcelona, she had some very interesting tales to tell of how they had the sh -- the heads shaved, and they -- they were just horrified when they looked at each other, they cried and they laughed, and you know, they were hysterical about this.</span> <span id="s533">And how they shared pieces of food.</span> <span id="s534">Somebody would have a nice piece of bread and they would divide it up.</span> <span id="s535">Things like that.</span> <span id="s536">Trying to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: What sort of an impact did that have on you?</span> <span id="s538">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Oh, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s540">Terrible.</span> <span id="s541">Give you nightmares.</span> <span id="s542">And then you think, well thank God they’re here, thank God they’re alive and let’s hope that they can live a normal life now.</span> <span id="s543">But I must say that most of them don’t bear -- you know, they don’t bear grudges and they don’t -- they’re not -- they don’t need treatment for psychological things.</span> <span id="s544">They just started to live normal lives.</span> <span id="s545">Most of --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Does that surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No.</span> <span id="s548">I thought, they’re very good people, they’re solid.</span> <span id="s549">And you know, it is -- they weren’t given to understand that, you know, they needed to see psychiatrists and get over these things, they didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s550">They managed on their own and they managed very well, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Marguerite --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: -- through the years as you would re-meet these people, do they continue to tell you stories about what happened, or did it stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s555">Unless you asked.</span> <span id="s556">No, we talked about how they were living now and what they were doing, and the good times.</span> <span id="s557">And that life goes on, and it’s no good dwelling on the past, it’s not going to help.</span> <span id="s558">No, I think there’s a very nice attitude, and I -- I really was -- I mean, it was surprising because I know a lot of people who’ve suffered, maybe illnesses and stuff like that, and they go on and on and on, and it’s -- it’s bad, it doesn’t help them and it doesn’t help anybody else.</span> <span id="s559">Know, when I -- oh, and how the -- the people went to Spain.</span> <span id="s560">After the war, Charles and Fofoe went to Argentina.</span> <span id="s561">And I don’t know how they managed it, but Charles found that he had two brothers who were living in Spain.</span> <span id="s562">And you know, in -- in years before the war, Jews weren’t in Spain, they’d been expelled in 14 - something and there were no real Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s563">Well, he heard that his brothers were there and they said, why are you in Argentina?</span> <span id="s564">Come to Spain, come to us, we’ll set you up in a business and you’ll be alright.</span> <span id="s565">So they managed to get to Spain and they’re in this luv -- they’re outside Barcelona, but I think they have an apartment in Barcelona, but they have little stores that sell novelties and souvenirs at a resort called Lloret de Mar, where I have been and visited them.</span> <span id="s566">And it’s just wonderful, and as I say, after all the experience that poor Fofoe went through, she managed to have a son.</span> <span id="s567">Lovely boy, and they have -- he married, and they have a little boy who is named Kavlos.</span> <span id="s568">And they travel a lot when the season is over and they can shut shop, they go off.</span> <span id="s569">And this young couple, with their little baby, since he was one, they’ve traveled all over the Pacific and Far East.</span> <span id="s570">And I get cards from them.</span> <span id="s571">[coughs] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Did j -- did the Joint provide a lot of people with housing in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: They helped to get houses.</span> <span id="s574">Now, Lydia Escanazi, who is -- she was Lydia Sabitie, she came -- she was hidden, she and her sister Audette, who was married to Danny, they were hidden in the war.</span> <span id="s575">The parents went into the mountains and she was hidden in a basement of some people, some Greek people.</span> <span id="s576">And they were there for six months and they never saw daylight.</span> <span id="s577">And she used to say, when we came -- when there was peace, and we came out of this basement, this cellar, she said, we just -- we ran.</span> <span id="s578">She said, we just ran and ran and ran, we didn’t know where we were running, but we were absolutely ecstatic.</span> <span id="s579">And anyhow, her parents eventually came back.</span> <span id="s580">Well, they had been quite a wealthy family.</span> <span id="s581">Her father had been with the Austro-Hellenic tobacco company.</span> <span id="s582">And so, when the girls were young, they had a fräulein, so they spoke beautiful German.</span> <span id="s583">They went to the Lycée Francais, and they knew French.</span> <span id="s584">They also knew English, I don’t know how that happened, but they spoke beautiful English and Greek, of course.</span> <span id="s585">Anyway, they -- the family had a house in Athens, it’s 18 Corniavo Street, but the Greeks had taken it over and they could not get it back.</span> <span id="s586">But finally, with the help of Joint, they were able to get one room, and that one room was set up as an office, the regional office for the Joint.</span> <span id="s587">And then, years and years of work and hard labor, they managed to get the whole house.</span> <span id="s588">And fortunately, they had enough money to pull it down and have it built into nice apartments.</span> <span id="s589">And Lydia and her husband live in that building in one of the apartments, they rent the others.</span> <span id="s590">Lydia had a grandmother called Madame Faragi.</span> <span id="s591">I never met her, I think she was gone by the time we got to Greece.</span> <span id="s592">She was very wealthy and she had a house in Salonika.</span> <span id="s593">It was on the water, and after the war, the royal family used it as their summer palace, and the family couldn’t get the house back.</span> <span id="s594">But they eventually -- either they got compensation for it, which helped a lot -- they didn’t get the house, but they got compensation, which was better than nothing.</span> <span id="s595">And of course, Salonika was where the main Jewish community was before the war, and those Germans had desecrated the beautiful cemetery there which was on a hill overlooking the sea.</span> <span id="s596">And those tombstones are used as paving stones.</span> <span id="s597">Very, very sad.</span> <span id="s598">And -- oh yes, when we were in Salonika a -- during our play, there was one young girl, Anna Morthul, whom I’d met, and we went with her -- we found her and we went and had a meal with Anna and her future husband.</span> <span id="s599">Anna, I think, had also been in camp.</span> <span id="s600">I’m not sure, I can’t remember that.</span> <span id="s601">And who else can I think about?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: I think we have to take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Marguerite, is there -- are there any other incidents from Greece that you think that you reme -- remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I’m trying hard to bring back some of these wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s609">Let me think.</span> <span id="s610">Well, just getting to know the people, the ones that we helped, and being taken in as part of their family, that was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s611">And I have been back to Greece about three times since I met some of my friends.</span> <span id="s612">And Lydia, who was the interpreter for our office, she always puts on a tea and invites as many of -- of the old bunch who are still around, to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: What do you think was the most difficult thing for these folks after the war?</span> <span id="s614">The fact that they had no families --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s616">I think that was really terrible.</span> <span id="s617">No families, and occasionally some of the younger people would cry, then they’d get over it.</span> <span id="s618">But on the whole they behaved amazingly well.</span> <span id="s619">They were very composed and --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Were people ever angry, that you remember, at what happened, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I never, never saw any real anger, never.</span> <span id="s622">They were just so thankful to be alive and to be back in their home area and with friends and other people’s families.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Where they warm with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, particularly.</span> <span id="s625">It was a very big bond, the girls in the girl’s home.</span> <span id="s626">And it was a wonderful thing that the National Council of Jewish women did to set up this home because it was a home for the girls.</span> <span id="s627">They had their room, some of them shared, and they were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s628">They’d been through a lot and they’d come through and they were survivors, really survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Did most of them want to stay in Greece, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I think they were too young to -- to realize whether it was a good idea or not.</span> <span id="s631">If they had found people and got married and settled there, that was okay, but many of them were glad to get away because they didn’t have any root any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Wa-Was there training of some kind for -- did ORT train --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Oh yes, well ORT --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: -- both boys and girls, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s636">They were trained in dressmaking and I think some were trained in typing.</span> <span id="s637">Not shorthand I don’t think, but typing.</span> <span id="s638">And I don’t know what else.</span> <span id="s639">Little bookkeeping, too, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Were there academic courses that they took?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, not unless they went to university or school, but they were too old for that and not -- not really good material for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Did the universities open pretty quickly in Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: You know, when I got there, these students were already --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: -- starting back.</span> <span id="s646">And they had to, you know, have the wherewithal in order to continue their educations.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Did you see a big difference from 1946 til when you left in 1950?</span> <span id="s648">Did things change very rapidly, or slow?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Not rapidly, very slowly, but gradually the stores were getting merchandise in.</span> <span id="s650">Many of the Jewish families there were in the fabric business, and they were quite wealthy, those people who had -- you know, they imported fabrics, a lot from England, you know, tweeds for men’s suits.</span> <span id="s651">And they didn’t have ready-made stores, so that if you needed any clothes made, you had the dressmaker come to the house, and she would stay -- she’d come three or four days to ma -- to cut -- to make -- to finish the garments.</span> <span id="s652">And I had a couple of dresses made that way, and you went to this -- the fabric place and you chose your material and you either drew a design you wanted, or you looked in some books and they did the best they could.</span> <span id="s653">And Lydia’s family always had a dressmaker coming to the house because there were three ladies.</span> <span id="s654">Oh, and another thing, although I wasn’t wealthy or anything and I was just a visitor, I had to have a maid.</span> <span id="s655">We all had maids.</span> <span id="s656">Well, fortunately I was brought up where we had maids at home, I mean, they weren't uniformed or anything, it wasn’t “Upstairs, Downstairs,” but I was used to having somebody around to do things.</span> <span id="s657">And my maids name was Salome.</span> <span id="s658">She was a very large, round lady.</span> <span id="s659">And a friend of mine had Cleopatra, who was tall and skinny.</span> <span id="s660">The names were just hilarious really, cause they didn’t fit the picture that one had of these characters.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So you decided to leave in 1950 or did the job end in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, the job ended more or less because they were able to transfer the work to local personnel.</span> <span id="s663">So why pay foreign personnel larger sums when they could get the people locally to carry on.</span> <span id="s664">And I was glad really, it was -- it was time for me to go.</span> <span id="s665">And I mean I -- I regretted leaving my friends there and everything, but you have to adjust --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: And then you went to England, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I went back to England, yes.</span> <span id="s670">And then -- my brother had emigrated to the States, arou -- yes, and he said, why don’t you come over.</span> <span id="s671">And my sister, who had finished working in Munich, or Vienna, she said, you know what -- we had made lots of American friends, because we -- oh yes, this is another thing, we used to have groups of Americans from UJA come over to see what was going on, and then we would be their guides around and show them where to have dinner and -- and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s672">So we made a lot of American friends and many of them said, why don’t you come over, you know, we’ll give you a good time, etcetera.</span> <span id="s673">Well, my sister and I decided that it would be lovely to go to the States.</span> <span id="s674">We could visit relatives that we’d discovered there and also we could do a tour.</span> <span id="s675">And if we got emigration papers, we wouldn’t have to hurry and if we ran out of cash we could get a job.</span> <span id="s676">So we decided to do that.</span> <span id="s677">And in those days it was easy to get a visa.</span> <span id="s678">Even -- my sister and I were able to get a visa without having a sponsor, because we had enough money to take -- although you weren't allowed to bring much money out of England.</span> <span id="s679">So I went ahead and joined my friend who was living in -- she had just moved to the States, living in Manhattan, and I joined her and waited for my sister to come for this big tour.</span> <span id="s680">She was asked to go and help with the reparations -- things in The Hague, so she was delayed for six months -- no, three months.</span> <span id="s681">And by the time she got there, I had run out of cash and had to get a job.</span> <span id="s682">I also wan -- didn’t want to stay at my friend’s house any longer, it was not right.</span> <span id="s683">So I had found an English girl and we collaborated and we shared an apartment, but I had signed the lease and it was two year lease and I couldn’t get out of it.</span> <span id="s684">So when my sister arrived she took off and had a holiday in Mexico and when she came back we -- you know, it was too late to start our trip, so we got jobs.</span> <span id="s685">And then in 1956, we decided we would go back to England and see if we could stay there, or if we didn't like it we could come back to the States.</span> <span id="s686">We got to England, we had a very good year doing practically nothing but visiting and enjoying ourselves.</span> <span id="s687">And then in 1957 we were asked to go to Vienna because of the Hungarian uprising and they needed people in Vienna to help.</span> <span id="s688">So, both Leba and I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s689">I stayed for a year, but after three months Leba was asked if she would go back to London because there was trouble in Egypt and they needed somebody in London to help with the Egyptian immigration.</span> <span id="s690">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And who were you hired by, Joint again?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Joint, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you work for the Joint in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, no, only in Europe.</span> <span id="s695">And because we were from England, we got a British salary.</span> <span id="s696">We didn’t know the difference, so that we didn't get very much money, but it was adequate.</span> <span id="s697">I mean, it was a nice job.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And that was secondary to the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And the work was important because you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: -- you were doing again what you had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes, yes, it was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And then what -- then what happened, then you came back to England or you came to the States again?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Well, we had to get back to the States or we would have lost our re-entry permits.</span> <span id="s706">You’re allowed one year and 11 months, and then you -- either you do or you don’t.</span> <span id="s707">And we decided well, we’ll come back because by that time my brother had settled in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s708">He’d opened a practice there, and so we came.</span> <span id="s709">He said, you come and you can get jobs in Washington and it’s very nice, and you can stay with us until -- so we came and after about three months -- oh, we stayed with Robin for a week or so and then we found an apartment in -- that’s another story -- in Washington, and then my brother moved down to Petersburg, Virginia, so there we were.</span> <span id="s710">We found a wonderful sublet apartment in Washington and became very, very friendly with the lady who sublet it to us and her family.</span> <span id="s711">And although she and her sister and all that have gone, I still am very, very friendly with and fond of the daughter, who now lives in Winston-Salem.</span> <span id="s712">That’s another of my travels.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s714">And so you’ve been here in Washington ever since?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s716">But not -- we’ve only been 20 years in this -- in this apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: We lived further up 16th Street for while.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: And what did you do when you started working in Washington, once you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Oh, I worked temporarily for a little while and then I got a job with a law firm, you may have heard of it, Arnold and Porter.</span> <span id="s721">It was wonderful when I first joined, it was just -- those -- it was Arnold, Fortis and Porter, and those three were the most brilliant, wonderful men, absolutely terrific.</span> <span id="s722">And then, of course, it spread like Topsy, and it’s now like a commercial place, it’s too big.</span> <span id="s723">But it moved three times from the little house we had on 19th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Well, I want to thank you so much for talking with me.</span> <span id="s727">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well thank you for listening to my stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Well, and what I’d like us to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: -- we’ll stop the camera for a moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: -- and then we’ll start showing some of the photographs and you will tell us what we’re going to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Very --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And who do we have here?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: This is a portrait of Amy Zoll, who became Amy Zoll Gottlieb, when she was working in Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: About what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: And it was through Amy that I went to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Do you know about what year that might be, the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: It must be soon after I arrived in Greece, which was 1940 -- was it ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: I don’t know, you have down here the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: April ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: -- look at Greece, underneath her photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Oh, well she was ready to leave, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So it must have been ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: ’46 yes.</span> <span id="s749">It was about two -- about a month after I got there.</span> <span id="s750">Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And who is this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: These are colleagues of mine.</span> <span id="s753">The gentleman on the far right was Alberto Guiladee.</span> <span id="s754">He, I think had -- yes, he had been in one of the camps.</span> <span id="s755">He later went to Israel and became a member of the Israeli government.</span> <span id="s756">He married a New Zealand girl.</span> <span id="s757">The next person is Dario Gabi, who also had been in camp.</span> <span id="s758">The next one with glasses is Mario Montiano, who became a correspondent for The London Times and The Kemsley Press.</span> <span id="s759">The next one is yours truly.</span> <span id="s760">The next one is Dr. Manoli Aruch, and the next one is a Greek girl called Elli, I don’t know her last name, she married a friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: And the date was about 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: [indecipherable] Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: This was at a party and we were asked to come in costume, and we managed to get some Greek evzone outfits, and the gentleman on my left is -- he was born in Cairo, he married a Greek girl and they settled in England.</span> <span id="s765">He had British nationality because Egypt, you know, was British in those days.</span> <span id="s766">The other chap was a friend of Bill’s, and his name was Vasili something or other, and he was in the British army.</span> <span id="s767">How, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: What’s going on here?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: This was taken at the girl’s home, which was started by the National Council of Jewish Women of America.</span> <span id="s770">And the -- the directress is in the picture, I think, and some of the girls who were returnees from DP camps, and some of the -- I think one or two of the fellows were -- were hidden in the mountains during the invasion of -- of the Greeks -- of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And this was 1947?</span> <span id="s772">That’s what it says in your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Probably, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: In Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s776">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: That’s alright, we’re set now, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Right.</span> <span id="s779">Occasionally we were very fortunate in being able to send some of our Jewish people to Israel, and this is a group who were able to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: There anyone in particular you would identify there, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I -- I don’t think I know -- except at the bottom right hand corner is Harold Goldfarb, who was the director in Greece for the AJDC.</span> <span id="s782">And he was there to see them off at the dock.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: That’s the gentleman down here?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s787">On one of my vacations, I teamed up with a girl from the British embassy and we did a little cruise around the Aegean with a special stop in Alexandria for five days.</span> <span id="s788">And while in Alexandria, we were able to visit the sphinx and the pyramids, and as you see, we met the livestock and we were the only people around the sphinx and pyramids, there were no tourists in those days.</span> <span id="s789">And this was a professional picture because our cameras were confiscated at the dock and we couldn’t take pictures.</span> <span id="s790">But we traveled by train from Alexandria to Cairo, and in Cairo, the gentleman you’ve seen in other pictures, Bill Brudo, he was in the evzone costume, his parents were still living in Egypt and we were able to visit them, and that was quite an experience, to see a home in Egypt, it was great.</span> <span id="s791">And they had the manservant with the white robe thing on and the fez, serving the cold drinks.</span> <span id="s792">Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: And this is 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: In Greece, the house is a speety, and if it’s my house, you tack on the my at the end of the word, so that was speetymou, my house.</span> <span id="s797">And it was sort of semi-basement, tiny little place, and it was lovely.</span> <span id="s798">It was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s799">Sparsely furnished.</span> <span id="s800">In Greece they didn’t have carpeting on the floors, they were marble floors or stone floors and in the winter you’d put down a rug.</span> <span id="s801">In the summer, out with the rug.</span> <span id="s802">And as you see the window at the side, behind me, that’s where we could see the soldiers marching.</span> <span id="s803">You just -- maybe in another one you can see that, but that’s how it was, you see, the window was half way up the s -- up the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Opposite --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So there’s the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s808">The door is where my hand is.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: And you went down two steps for it, so it was not really a basement, it was just a little below street level.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s813">We had some very happy occasions and one of them was when my dear friends Fofoe and Charles were married, and they were married in my little apartment.</span> <span id="s814">And this is some of the wedding guests.</span> <span id="s815">Celia Bloom of the National Council of Jewish Women is there with her lovely hat.</span> <span id="s816">The director is over by -- by the wall above, and other guests and friends.</span> <span id="s817">That was a very lovely occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And that was 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Here is the rabbi performing the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And who is the woman on the left of the couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Oh, that’s Celia Bloom, the directress of the girl’s home.</span> <span id="s824">And the man on the right of the groom is Dr. Manoli Aruch, who was the best man.</span> <span id="s825">And you wo -- just see the chuppah over the top.</span> <span id="s826">Interior of speetymou.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Very sparsely furnished, but very cozy.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Fresh flowers?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s831">Probably sent by a boyfriend, I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: That’s okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s834">Another corner of speetymou.</span> <span id="s835">The gadget on top of the cupboard is a radio, not a television set.</span> <span id="s836">They didn’t have them in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Was it shortwave so you could listen to BBC?</span> <span id="s838">You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: As they say in Greek [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s840">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s841">Has lots of knobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404 PAGE
