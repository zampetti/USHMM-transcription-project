bring them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: But I’m still confused.</span> <span id="s938">How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: How?</span> <span id="s940">Oh, officially?</span> <span id="s941">We didn't tell the truth always.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: But what was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: To say how much we make, you know, if we are working or
