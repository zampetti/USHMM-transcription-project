to make aliya to Israel from Atlanta, Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">JP: We decided it while the children were still in high school.</span> <span id="s14">We decided that they’ll take a year off between high school and college and would spend it in Israel.</span> <span id="s15">And after one of our sons decided to stay after a year, it started us thinking about living here.</span> <span id="s16">Since I came from Poland where life is regimented, like in Israel, I knew what we were in for.</span> <span id="s17">Nevertheless, we made aliya in l981.</span> <span id="s18">I don’t think it had anything to do with a particular Zionist draw.</span> <span id="s19">But since two of our sons, Ronnie and Jeff, expressed a desire to come, we felt that we should come too.</span> <span id="s20">Of course, knowing how hard life here would be by comparison to the U.S., I decided to bring over as much as possible so that we wouldn’t end up going back.</span> <span id="s21">My family hadn’t been Zionistic, just religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: Did you find work here?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">JP: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s25">I managed a commercial laundry.</span> <span id="s26">In the U.S., I was a textile salesman—linens, so it’s somewhat related.</span> <span id="s27">This is a commercial laundry which cleans hotel linens.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">WH: What town where you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">JP: Lodz.</span> <span id="s30">I was in the ghetto until 1944 and was then shipped out to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s31">I was born in 1927.</span> <span id="s32">I had two sisters and two brothers of whom one sister is still alive.</span> <span id="s33">She lives in Toronto.</span> <span id="s34">I was liberated in Allach, a camp near Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: When did you come to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JP: In December 1949.</span> <span id="s37">I had been in Feldafing and then moved to Bamberg where, with a friend, I rented two rooms.</span> <span id="s38">I lived in Bamberg from 1945 until 1949.</span> <span id="s39">I came here on the General Ballew from Bremenhaven.</span> <span id="s40">We spent a lot of time playing cards, chess, and talking and singing.</span> <span id="s41">The crew was very nice to us but we didn’t know English too well.</span> <span id="s42">I thought going to America was the best thing that could happen to anybody.</span> <span id="s43">My sister went to Israel, but she is one of those who couldn’t make it and left.</span> <span id="s44">(Despite this, he came.)</span> <span id="s45">I was supposed to go to Israel, too, but when the DP Act was passed, a friend convinced me that you can always go to Israel but you can’t always go to the U.S.</span> <span id="s46">It didn’t take much convincing because throughout the world people know that coming to the U.S. is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so you go.</span> <span id="s47">I do know that with the circle of friends I had who came here, had I come to Israel then I wouldn’t be religious today, as I am, because none of them were religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: Are you friends with these people now?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JP: Yes, but because we’re observant there are limits, since we can’t eat in their homes.</span> <span id="s50">It’s also very hard to explain to someone who knew you when you weren’t observant that you are now.</span> <span id="s51">They say, “What are you trying to do, fool me?</span> <span id="s52">I knew you then.”</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: As I sit here listening to the muezzin the background, I think of anti-semitism in the U.S.</span> <span id="s54">Did you feel the anti-semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">JP: You definitely felt it.</span> <span id="s56">But most of my clients were not Jewish and I was very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s57">I traveled throughout the South.</span> <span id="s58">Nobody ever called me a name or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: Religion is pretty important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">JP: Yes.</span> <span id="s61">Even when I wasn’t religious I always believed in predestination.</span> <span id="s62">My father predicted that my sister and I would be the ones to survive.</span> <span id="s63">He said on his deathbed in 1943, “You two will have it good.”</span> <span id="s64">And this was when my other brothers were still alive.</span> <span id="s65">I did not have the strength in the camps to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s66">On both occasions, when I wanted to, others didn’t let me.</span> <span id="s67">They picked me up and carried me.</span> <span id="s68">So that was bashert, too.</span> <span id="s69">I don’t know who picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: Who met you at the pier?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JP: Jewish Agency people.</span> <span id="s72">My friend and I went to Cincinnati where I lived for 10 years until 1960.</span> <span id="s73">I came to Atlanta because of business.</span> <span id="s74">When we came to Cincinnati, there was no one there to greet us.</span> <span id="s75">Instead a taxi came for us.</span> <span id="s76">We stayed at first in a boarding home owned by a Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s77">She was paid by the Jewish Family Service to put us up.</span> <span id="s78">We stayed about a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: Where did you meet Lilah?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">LP: We met in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s81">My mother did not approve because Jack was European.</span> <span id="s82">Her husband was European, from England, and the marriage did not work out that well.</span> <span id="s83">So she put two and two together and concluded that European men aren’t nice to their wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JP: We’ll we still got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">LP: Jack is a very good husband.</span> <span id="s86">Actually, my parents later told me on many occasions that I wasn’t good enough for Jack.</span> <span id="s87">They saw how he treated me.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: (text illegible in original transcript copy)</span></p> <p><span id="s89">JP: Yes and some became very wealthy.</span> <span id="s90">Survivors in general have done very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: Did the survivors meet as a group in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">JP: There was a club started by German Jews who had come during the war.</span> <span id="s93">They had a soccer team and we got together and played.</span> <span id="s94">Most of us were single then.</span> <span id="s95">Others played poker, looked for girls.</span> <span id="s96">So people had invitations to lunch and get-togethers, parties.</span> <span id="s97">It was definitely a group.</span> <span id="s98">We often met at Meadow Park.</span> <span id="s99">Of course, many Americans went there to.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: What did the war teach you about people?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">JP: People did things under extreme pressure that they thought they’d never do.</span> <span id="s102">Some were animals and some weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Do you dream about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">JP: Off and on, but less now than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Isn’t there a tremendous sense of humiliation about how one was forced to live by others, and how does one recover from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JP: Just by saying, “I know what I am.”</span> <span id="s107">But does that person know who he is?</span> <span id="s108">How do you feel when you humiliate someone else?</span> <span id="s109">Do you feel proud?</span> <span id="s110">If you do, then you’re not a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WH: Did you feel a desire for revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JP: Well, my revenge, maybe because of my Jewish upbringing, was not a physical revenge.</span> <span id="s113">My revenge is, and I spoke at my niece’s wedding about it, our children are getting married, they’re having their own children, and we’re still Jewish.</span> <span id="s114">Israel is a state and this is our land.</span> <span id="s115">Thus we did not let Hitler accomplish what he (intended?)</span></p> <p><span id="s116">WH: Do you feel your life here is richer than in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JP: I have mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s118">I lived much better in the U.S.</span> <span id="s119">It was a nice community.</span> <span id="s120">I sacrificed the easy life and conveniences for the feeling that I am here as a Jew in my country.</span> <span id="s121">I became a citizen here because that way I became a part of the country for better or for worse.</span> <span id="s122">I felt that way, for example, about the rescue at Entebbe.</span> <span id="s123">We burned our bridges by selling, rather than renting the house, in order to make aliya.</span> <span id="s124">(Their apartment here is quite beautiful, American style, with all the conveniences that exist in America; well, most of the conveniences.</span> <span id="s125">It doesn’t compare to the house with a private pool that they had in Atlanta.)</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WH: Were you very involved in the Jewish community in Atlanta?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JP: Not really.</span> <span id="s128">I ran once for the synagogue board, but I was defeated.</span> <span id="s129">I traveled and couldn’t be too involved.</span> <span id="s130">I gave money to Israel Bonds and to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: What are you most proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">JP: Our children and how they brought us to our present level of observance.</span> <span id="s133">My son came home one day and said he wasn’t going to go to public high school.</span> <span id="s134">When they started observing Shabbat, our agreement was: You do what you want and don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s135">And they just bided their time and little by little, there came a time when I said if I have to sleep on the floor, I will not drive to shul on Yom Kippur or Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s136">That was the turning point.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: In all the years you weren’t observant, did you question how God could have allowed the Holocaust to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">JP: (text illegible in original transcript copy)…happened and would happen again—to Jews and to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WH: So when you believed in bashert, who was responsible for that happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">JP: That belief came after I became religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WH: Do you believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JP: That’s a very hard question to answer.</span> <span id="s143">What do we mean by “believe in God?”</span> <span id="s144">I believe in some being who controls the world.</span> <span id="s145">Is my putting on tefillin, praying in the morning, part of it?</span> <span id="s146">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s147">Do the rabbis saying you shouldn’t move the light (on Shabbos) mean something?</span> <span id="s148">I feel that’s absurd, no matter how smart the sages were.</span> <span id="s149">Or that you should tear the toilet paper before Shabbos?</span> <span id="s150">There was no toilet paper in the old days, so how do you know you cannot tear it?</span> <span id="s151">Is it work?</span> <span id="s152">How come you can open up a box of food because you’re going to eat it?</span> <span id="s153">I mean, these things, I’m not a learned person.</span> <span id="s154">If people say this is what you should do, I’m not going to question.</span> <span id="s155">I’m a follower.</span> <span id="s156">I’m not going to go out and shout, “I’m not going to go out and follow the thing of not cutting the toilet paper.”</span> <span id="s157">(The Perrys live in Arzei Habirah, a very religious section in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s158">She covers her hair.</span> <span id="s159">They are Baalei Teshuvah.)</span> <span id="s160">But I will not feel bad if I forget and tear the paper.</span> <span id="s161">I won’t run to shul and say I sinned.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t say you should move the light, but to say you should move it this way and not that way, this is a little far-fetched.</span> <span id="s163">I definitely believe there is a higher being.</span> <span id="s164">Does He expect me to do everything the sages say He expects?</span> <span id="s165">This I question.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WH: (text illegible in original transcript copy)</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JP: According to the sages we weren’t doing what He told us to do.</span> <span id="s168">We were punished because we strayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WH: Do you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">JP: Do I have a choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WH: Yes.</span> <span id="s172">Lots of people I’ve interviewed have told me they don’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JP: But I choose to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: One person asked me why those who didn’t believe and came to America missed the Holocaust and so many who believed and who stayed, were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">JP: But some Jews who were Orthodox came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">WH: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">JP: Well, the Jews had a choice.</span> <span id="s178">I do question.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WH: What makes you follow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">JP: It’s a combination of a lot of things.</span> <span id="s181">Once I took on this life, I’m going to follow it.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t want to offend those around me.</span> <span id="s183">Like I used to smoke on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s184">And when I did it, the kids would just leave the room.</span> <span id="s185">So I did it in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s186">And then I said, “Who am I kidding?”</span> <span id="s187">It was hard but I said I’ll do without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">WH: Where are you politically in terms of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">JP: Well, keeping the territories is one thing.</span> <span id="s190">Killing for that is another.</span> <span id="s191">We have a strong right and a strong left here.</span> <span id="s192">If we have to till or transfer by force, I’d rather give it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: (text illegible in original transcript copy)</span></p> <p><span id="s194">JP: I really can’t say I had any special ability but a normal person picks up the pieces and doesn’t brood.</span> <span id="s195">Maybe it was the idea I mentioned before of raising a family as revenge over Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WH: Do you have any habits from the war like freezing bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">JP: No.</span> <span id="s198">I knew I could always get something at a 7/ll.</span> <span id="s199">Only in the very beginning did I think like that.</span> <span id="s200">Eventually you accept your losses and go back to a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: What do your kids do?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">JP: Jeff is a computer programmer for the New York Stock Exchange.</span> <span id="s203">Ronnie is an insurance salesman in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s204">Mayer works for Feldheim Publishers in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s205">Jeff’s wife is very keen on living in Israel.</span> <span id="s206">He was here for three years, but was laid off.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s208">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0088
