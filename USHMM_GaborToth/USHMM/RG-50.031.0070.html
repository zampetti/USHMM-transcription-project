General James Gavin (US ARMY) visited the camp soon after liberation.</span> <span id="s19">We were told that at one time the camp had 4,000 inmates.</span> <span id="s20">But it wasn't a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s21">Not a death.</span> <span id="s22">General Gavin said, "We were uniformly very depressed and saddened by this whole thing.</span> <span id="s23">It was...it is beyond human experience."</span> <span id="s24">Manfred Steinfeld (the speaker here) was born on April 29, 1942 in Germany.</span> <span id="s25">He came to the U.S. in 1938.</span> <span id="s26">I was drafted into the U.S. service in 1943.</span> <span id="s27">My serial number in the U.S. Army was 36737899.</span> <span id="s28">I was with Military Intelligence Specialist Unit attached to the 82nd Airborne through the entire Normandy Invasion, Holland, and Central European Campaigns, until we occupied Berlin in July 1945.</span> <span id="s29">I landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944, during the invasion, I was also in the invasion at Nijmegen (Netherlands).</span> <span id="s30">I was with order (unsure of word) battle team No. 16.</span> <span id="s31">We were attached to the 82nd Airborne until we occupied Berlin in 1945.</span> <span id="s32">Our unit was fluid at that time, first week of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s33">The Germans were surrendering in masse.</span> <span id="s34">There were two contracts made with the Russians.</span> <span id="s35">First at Torgau.</span> <span id="s36">Then at Grabow.</span> <span id="s37">We had crossed the Elbe River on April 29.</span> <span id="s38">We were at that time attached to the Second British Army.</span> <span id="s39">And we were the only Army unit ending up so far east.</span> <span id="s40">We were close to the Baltic.</span> <span id="s41">We were two-thirds on the way to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: How were you attached to the British Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The airborne units were fluid units.</span> <span id="s44">During Normandy we were part of the American Army.</span> <span id="s45">During the Holland Campaign the 19th Airborne Corp. was attached to the British Army.</span> <span id="s46">Then we were part of the 15th Army Group holding the West Bank of the Rhine near Cologne.</span> <span id="s47">Then on April 25, or 23, we were reassigned again to the Second British Army.</span> <span id="s48">We proceeded to a town called Bleckede near Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s49">I am doing this from recall.</span> <span id="s50">(Manfred speaking) The 82nd Airborne linked up with the Russians at a town called Grabow.</span> <span id="s51">On April 25 or thereabouts, maybe April 23, we were reassigned to Second British Army in a town called Lukleshullse (ph).</span> <span id="s52">We had crossed the Alps on April 29th.</span> <span id="s53">We were in the town of Schwerin.</span> <span id="s54">This was close to the Baltic Coast.</span> <span id="s55">Schwerin is a Baltic port.</span> <span id="s56">If you drew a straight line on a map between Berlin and Hamburg, we were two-thirds of the way to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s57">On the morning of the 4th or 5th, we contacted the Russians.</span> <span id="s58">I remember distinctly when we came back to Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s59">I was involved in translating the unconditional surrender document which was being executed by General Gavin.</span> <span id="s60">(I spoke German.)</span> <span id="s61">The German Commander of the 21st German Army Crew, Tipilkirch (ph) had contacted General Gavin and surrendered to him for all the German troops surrendering to the 82nd at the time.</span> <span id="s62">The 82nd crossed the Elbe River and really encountered the final resistance of World War II because resistance had stopped.</span> <span id="s63">The Germans were surrendering en masse.</span> <span id="s64">We proceeded tpâ€¦between cities of Blacked or Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s65">I believe the same day we heard about 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s66">It is difficult to describe the sights that I encountered at the moment.</span> <span id="s67">It is almost 40 years later now.</span> <span id="s68">The camp was an ordinary working barracks camp.</span> <span id="s69">The guard house had been deserted.</span> <span id="s70">There was barbed wire.</span> <span id="s71">But everything was open.</span> <span id="s72">The Germans had left.</span> <span id="s73">The first barracks we went into we found among the living many bodies.</span> <span id="s74">Some of the bodies were being removed by the medics.</span> <span id="s75">And by just moving them, they died.</span> <span id="s76">We received very substantial support from the medical units from the Second British Army HQ.</span> <span id="s77">They had substantial experience because I believe just a week earlier they had liberated Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s78">Bergen-Belsen was not too far.</span> <span id="s79">Only about 50 miles to the west.</span> <span id="s80">We were the one unit that wound up furthest east in Germany.</span> <span id="s81">No troops further east that we were.</span> <span id="s82">Bergen-Belsen was to the west We received substantial medical support to salvage whatever lives could be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Had you heard of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">They had received publicity in Stars and Stripes but we did not expect to be the ones to liberate one.</span> <span id="s86">But reading about it and liberating it are two different things.</span> <span id="s87">You cannot believe really the horror of seeing the degradation of human life that existed.</span> <span id="s88">Among the living we found many bodies.</span> <span id="s89">Just moving them, they died.</span> <span id="s90">When we came to the camp the Germans no longer resisted.</span> <span id="s91">All the German guards had taken off.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What struck you?</span> <span id="s93">What was your first impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Just the horrors.</span> <span id="s95">The conditions in the working barracks.</span> <span id="s96">Three, four, five people in one bunk, some dead, some alive.</span> <span id="s97">People crowded onto the floor in a corner, some dead, some alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">As we found them.</span> <span id="s99">People had not had substantial food for probably the past month.</span> <span id="s100">Just sheer starvation.</span> <span id="s101">That was the method of extermination in this particular camp.</span> <span id="s102">There were all nationalities.</span> <span id="s103">I remember talking to Hungarians, Polish, French, Russians and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Any stories from camp inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: At this stage I don't recall anything except the horrors.</span> <span id="s106">We were only concerned to make them comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What was their attitude toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: We were the liberators.</span> <span id="s109">Thank God.</span> <span id="s110">If only we had come sooner.</span> <span id="s111">The camp was pretty much cleaned up by 2:45 hours.</span> <span id="s112">All of the dead and the living.</span> <span id="s113">At that time General Gavin decided to have a public funeral.</span> <span id="s114">I was in charge of talking to the Burgemeister (mayor) of Ludwigslust, since I spoke German perfectly.</span> <span id="s115">We had to get laborers to remove the dead bodies, wrap them in sheets or whatever was available.</span> <span id="s116">And clean up the camp.</span> <span id="s117">We arranged for a funeral for about 2000 bodies.</span> <span id="s118">Right in the town square, right in front of the castle.</span> <span id="s119">City of Mecklenburg Schwerin.</span> <span id="s120">It was one of the feudal duchies of Germany.</span> <span id="s121">It was the Headquarters for the Duke.</span> <span id="s122">The headquarters was in this beautiful castle.</span> <span id="s123">Huge, enormous castle.</span> <span id="s124">Adjacent to the square, in front of this beautiful castle, we held the funeral.</span> <span id="s125">Of course, all the Germans said they knew nothing.</span> <span id="s126">It was only a labor camp.</span> <span id="s127">They all pleaded innocent.</span> <span id="s128">They had suspicions, but no one admitted they knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s129">The civilian population was made to attend the funeral.</span> <span id="s130">There weren't any Nazis in Germany in 1945.</span> <span id="s131">(Manfred jokes.)</span> <span id="s132">They denied all knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you speak to military personnel?</span> <span id="s134">Anyone in charge of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No.</span> <span id="s136">All those in charge of the camp fled.</span> <span id="s137">They knew they would be prosecuted as war criminals.</span> <span id="s138">So they took off, probably in civilian clothes pretending they knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s139">They just disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Getting back to the camp itself.</span> <span id="s141">Other than the barracks for the prisoners, what other buildings did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: At this stage I don't recall.</span> <span id="s143">The basic barracks, the guard towers.</span> <span id="s144">As far as the kitchen... I am sure there was something for first aid, medications, but basically it was all wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s145">It was not a large camp.</span> <span id="s146">It's total population at its peak was 3,000.</span> <span id="s147">Average 300 per barracks.</span> <span id="s148">Ten to twelve barracks.</span> <span id="s149">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What was the response of other GIs?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: All GIs manifest this feeling against German citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: The only incidents I can tell you about was that some of the GIs, when they saw some of the inmates or displaced persons we found wearing camp uniforms, or they recognized a German who was a guard, we let them beat up occasionally a German captain in one or two instances.</span> <span id="s153">We closed our eyes to it.</span> <span id="s154">At the funeral there were probably several army chaplains who officiated.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did any say anything say anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: The one who made the eulogy was Captain Wood of the 82 Airborne Division Chaplain.</span> <span id="s157">I don't remember all the remarks he made.</span> <span id="s158">They were typical of that time.</span> <span id="s159">"Let the world never forget what we are witnessing here today."</span> <span id="s160">We remained in that vicinity awhile.</span> <span id="s161">Then I was assigned as part of the 82nd Airborne to military Office of Boizenburg on the Elbe.</span> <span id="s162">Town about 25 miles west of Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s163">I was in charge and two others.</span> <span id="s164">One officer and a master argent.</span> <span id="s165">We were the military government of the town.</span> <span id="s166">About May 20, or May 15.</span> <span id="s167">We were walking down the street when a women in a concentration camp dress came up to me and said, "Mr. Officer, the man walking on the other side of the street is a criminal."</span> <span id="s168">She identified herself that she had been a concentration camp inmate.</span> <span id="s169">I understood German.</span> <span id="s170">The others didn't.</span> <span id="s171">The man was Ludwig Lamdor (ph).</span> <span id="s172">He had been the concentration camp administrator at RavensbrÃ¼ck and survived.</span> <span id="s173">Based on her information, we followed and arrested him.</span> <span id="s174">He did not deny who he was because we had positive identification.</span> <span id="s175">He gave the usual excuse.</span> <span id="s176">"I had orders."</span> <span id="s177">We interrogated him.</span> <span id="s178">We had a fairly substantial confession based on the responsibility he had.</span> <span id="s179">Based on some atrocities that took place in the camp.</span> <span id="s180">We left that part of Germany about June 15.</span> <span id="s181">We went back toFrance.</span> <span id="s182">Our unit was being reassigned.</span> <span id="s183">We turned him over to the British Military Tribunal in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s184">Approximately four years later he was hung by British authorities for war crimes.</span> <span id="s185">The woman was the sister of Martin Buber, the famous German philosopher who had gone to Palestine in 1934.</span> <span id="s186">She had been married to Heinz Neiuman (ph) who was the communist leader of Germany before Hitler.</span> <span id="s187">This woman and her husband had fled to Soviet Union in 1933 when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s188">In 1935 her husband was sent to fight with the Loyalists in Spain.</span> <span id="s189">When the Loyalists were defeated by Franco, he found his way back to Russia, put on trail as a traitor and executed.</span> <span id="s190">She was then sentenced to Siberia labor camp by the Russians.</span> <span id="s191">In 1939 she was repatriated during the German/Russian non-aggression pact.</span> <span id="s192">She went from a Russian labor camp to a German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s193">But she survived.</span> <span id="s194">I arranged for her to go to the American territory because all the territory we vacated was Russian territory, and they would have liked to get their hands on her and sent her back to Siberia.</span> <span id="s195">Later I heard she wrote a book about being under tow dictators in 1950.</span> <span id="s196">Her name was Margaret Buber.</span> <span id="s197">RavensbrÃ¼ck was Notorious.</span> <span id="s198">He did admit to medical experimentation that took place in RavensbrÃ¼ck, basically with women.</span> <span id="s199">it was difficult to deny it, based on the atrocities, but he said he was only following orders.</span> <span id="s200">He showed no remorse at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: When did you return to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was sent on leave to Berlin in July, 1945.</span> <span id="s203">I was with the 82nd Airborne.</span> <span id="s204">I left Germany...discharged on October 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: During those last months in Germany did you speak with camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: In Berlin when I was stationed there we were finding those expected to be living in Berlin who were under the automatic arrest category.</span> <span id="s207">I became part of counter-intelligence unit.</span> <span id="s208">We arrested many Germans.</span> <span id="s209">We had good intelligence.</span> <span id="s210">We knew who we were looking for.</span> <span id="s211">We arrested 700 potential Nazi criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did you interrogate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s214">A number.</span> <span id="s215">The uniform response was typical.</span> <span id="s216">No admission of guilt.</span> <span id="s217">Only occasionally, someone said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s218">Usually they said, "I was following orders.</span> <span id="s219">I was only a soldier.</span> <span id="s220">I was a member of the Party."</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Those few who did admit to some wrong.</span> <span id="s222">Do you recall any particulars?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Only a few Germans civilians I ran across.</span> <span id="s224">As an American soldier, I went back to my home town where I was born -- beginning of June, 1945.</span> <span id="s225">Since my mother and sister did not leave when I left, they perished in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s226">We were able to determine that they died in the last two or three months of the war.</span> <span id="s227">At the beginning of 1945.</span> <span id="s228">The last we knew was that they were interred in Camp Stutthof, (he spelled it) near Danzig.</span> <span id="s229">A first cousin of mine who was with my mother and sister also.</span> <span id="s230">Then the cousin was shipped to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s231">I assume most people perished during the winter.</span> <span id="s232">It was cold.</span> <span id="s233">The Russians were advancing.</span> <span id="s234">The Germans were evacuating them (the prisoners) and they were just dying en masse.</span> <span id="s235">They were deported in the beginning of 1942 to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s236">From the end of '43 they were in various concentration camp and at the end they were in Concentration Camp Stutthof.</span> <span id="s237">They tried to get out of Germany when I did, but it was difficult.</span> <span id="s238">My mother was a widow with three children.</span> <span id="s239">We tried to get her out.</span> <span id="s240">A brother of mine went to Palestine in 1938.</span> <span id="s241">So he was saved.</span> <span id="s242">But he died in 1945 fighting the British.</span> <span id="s243">My mother got me out with an aunt in Chicago.</span> <span id="s244">So I returned to my home town, a small agricultural town in Hesse.</span> <span id="s245">They had many casualties.</span> <span id="s246">They had a population of about 4400.</span> <span id="s247">Twenty-five percent were in the army... perished in Russian front.</span> <span id="s248">Many killed.</span> <span id="s249">There were small towns in Germany, although they were Nazis, they were agricultural communities and were not aware of what was happening on the scale, The overall scope of the rest of Europe.</span> <span id="s250">I met acquaintances I had known before ... non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: They were glad to see me back.</span> <span id="s253">They could not believe the atrocities of the camps.</span> <span id="s254">I would say that in many small communities of Europe they were not really aware of what was happening on the much larger scale.</span> <span id="s255">You got to keep in mind ... in 1944, '45 in Germany these people had no cars, maybe one radio in town ... fairly primitive living conditions.</span> <span id="s256">Getting newspapers maybe one or twice a week from the next larger town, Frankfurt or...and they were reading Nazi propaganda.</span> <span id="s257">They were Nazis and they belonged to the Party, but they were not informed.</span> <span id="s258">They were anti-Semitic, anti-Jews ... no question about it.</span> <span id="s259">That was part of Policy.</span> <span id="s260">One thing that took place in Germany during the rise of Hitler.</span> <span id="s261">It [Nazism] went down to the lowest level of German Society.</span> <span id="s262">There were Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s263">It was part of the entire German psychology.</span> <span id="s264">But it's difficult to realize, unless someone from the immediate family was a camp guard or assigned to a camp, they would have no knowledge of the camps.</span> <span id="s265">And there was no camp in the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: How did you feel going back to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Mixed emotions.</span> <span id="s268">The first thing I looked for ... in a small town you would go to the next town for services.</span> <span id="s269">We had to go by several homes between the two towns and every Saturday morning we went by and they would let the dogs loose to chase us.</span> <span id="s270">My first inclination: I would (find) and shoot the S.O.B.</span> <span id="s271">But he died in the war.</span> <span id="s272">There couldn't be a nicer fate.</span> <span id="s273">I went back to the cemetery where my grandfather and great grandfather and father was buried.</span> <span id="s274">The cemetery in the middle of Frankfurt is in fairly good shape.</span> <span id="s275">I am amazed.</span> <span id="s276">Maybe it explains the Germans Psychology.</span> <span id="s277">The Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt in the middle of 1945 is not desecrated anymore than any other German cemetery.</span> <span id="s278">They took metal and glass headstones.</span> <span id="s279">Stone and marble they left intact.</span> <span id="s280">Maybe that explains the German Psychology.</span> <span id="s281">Lots of respect for the dead and none for the living.</span> <span id="s282">I found no Jews in our town.</span> <span id="s283">There had been six Jewish families when I left.</span> <span id="s284">An additional three families migrated to Argentina.</span> <span id="s285">Two to the United States.</span> <span id="s286">My mother and sister were killed.</span> <span id="s287">Another family, the husband, wife, and one daughter were killed.</span> <span id="s288">And one spinster woman about 50 years old.</span> <span id="s289">They were the ones who were killed.</span> <span id="s290">Now the town is like other small towns.</span> <span id="s291">I am going back probably in September.</span> <span id="s292">I am having a monument put in the cemetery in my mother and sister's memory.</span> <span id="s293">I have been meaning to do it for a long time.</span> <span id="s294">I made arrangements to do it.</span> <span id="s295">They are cooperating.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you discuss what you had seen in the concentration camp in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">You have to keep in mind that in 1945 the newspapers, magazines were filled with the atrocities.</span> <span id="s299">The atrocities from Birkenau, Auschwitz, all of them.</span> <span id="s300">Life, Time, Newsweek were just filled with atrocities of World War Two.</span> <span id="s301">In 1948, '49 when the Nuremberg Trails died down, you didn't hear about it so much.</span> <span id="s302">It is good that today an effort is being made so people should not forget what has happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You feel that giving testimony is good?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: It should have been done in 1945 when people had better recollections of everything that had taken place.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Do you think most GIs would tell what they saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s307">no question.</span> <span id="s308">They would have been willing to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What sort of lesson or meaning can we derive out of what you saw, out of your family's experiences, out of the tragedy of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I have always taken the philosophical view that just because these horrible things have happened there is still much good in most people.</span> <span id="s311">But this can only happen when you take a certain segment of society and relegate its people to sub-human status.</span> <span id="s312">Then you are willing to accept that someone is inferior, because you have been given a reason for what you are doing.</span> <span id="s313">The lesson we have to learn is that we can never permit any segment of society to be persecuted, to be delegated to a sub-human environment.</span> <span id="s314">It is a constant need among us.</span> <span id="s315">Look at what is happening at other parts of the world.</span> <span id="s316">Cambodia, Vietnam.</span> <span id="s317">Basically it comes down to saying these people are expendable.</span> <span id="s318">Life is cheap when you fight for survival.</span> <span id="s319">And people quickly forget.</span> <span id="s320">I was nine years old the day Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s321">The doctor came from a town 50 kilometers away from where we were living to care for my grandmother.</span>
