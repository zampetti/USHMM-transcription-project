1994</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Tell me your full name and tell me when and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My full name is Blanka Erma Rothschild.</span> <span id="s13">Born Fischer.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Poland in Lódz, which is a large city considered Polish manufacturing city.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Tell me when you were born, and then tell me a little bit about what your childhood was like before the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in August of 1922.</span> <span id="s17">I was the only child.</span> <span id="s18">My family was very close, well educated.</span> <span id="s19">I had a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s20">I attended a private school, and I had a lady at home who took care of me.</span> <span id="s21">I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters, and my mother had two brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s22">And each one of them had one or two children.</span> <span id="s23">So we were a very close family, very devoted.</span> <span id="s24">Something that I treasure.</span> <span id="s25">My childhood gave me a very good background, strength, and love.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father was -- he actually had two faculties.</span> <span id="s28">He was an architect and an engineer.</span> <span id="s29">He studied outside of Poland because Poland had very strict admission for Jews in their universities, so my grandparents sent him to Czechoslovakia and then to Italy.</span> <span id="s30">And he was mainly an engineer in his last years.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So around about -- well, tell me what you remember of the middle 1930s.</span> <span id="s32">Do you remember changes happening and --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s34">Well, in the middle 1930s, I -- in the beginning of the 30s, I attended the German gymnasium, which was the best in the city.</span> <span id="s35">But with the change in the political situation, my parents switched me to a Polish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s36">And, unfortunately, I was sort of isolated.</span> <span id="s37">I didn't feel any pressure, any political pressure.</span> <span id="s38">Anything that was coming, I was unaware of it.</span> <span id="s39">We had a group of friends.</span> <span id="s40">In the summer, we were going away, and we had a small place in the country.</span> <span id="s41">And it was quite a satisfactory life.</span> <span id="s42">However, in 1938 and '39, the changes started to occur.</span> <span id="s43">We read about the rise of Nazis in Germany, which was neighboring Poland.</span> <span id="s44">We were aware of the speeches; however, we still felt pretty safe and secure.</span> <span id="s45">My uncle, who was a physician, had many patients</span></p> <p><span id="s46">01:04 who were of German origin, so-called Volksdeutsche then living in our city.</span> <span id="s47">And when he visited them, because at that time, a doctor visited patients in their home, they were wearing signs.</span> <span id="s48">They were wearing swastikas in the houses.</span> <span id="s49">There were pictures of Adolph Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">And we still didn't take this too seriously.</span> <span id="s51">Seriously enough of thinking of leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And then tell me what happened when the war started and how you remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I remember distinctly September '39.</span> <span id="s54">The 1st of September was the first day of war, and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory.</span> <span id="s55">They're etched so deeply, and I remember exactly the moment.</span> <span id="s56">I was sitting on a balcony, reading a book.</span> <span id="s57">And all of sudden, I heard a thud, a tremendous thud sound, and I saw planes circling above the city.</span> <span id="s58">I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this, that this was the day that the war started, and the planes came over Poland.</span> <span id="s59">I did not know that they crossed the border at that moment, but I remember the planes and the thud.</span> <span id="s60">And it startled me, and I got up and went to the room.</span> <span id="s61">This is something that is etched in my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did your parents talk?</span> <span id="s63">Did you hear your parents talking?</span> <span id="s64">Did they know what was happening?</span> <span id="s65">Were they afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: My father died a year before the war.</span> <span id="s67">Two years before the war, excuse me.</span> <span id="s68">Two years before the war.</span> <span id="s69">He suffered from uremia, and at that time, there was no cure for it then.</span> <span id="s70">There were no dialysis known to medicine.</span> <span id="s71">And I was with my mother, and my mother was being courted at the time by a friend, a physician.</span> <span id="s72">So they were rather happy.</span> <span id="s73">The clouds of the war were sort of coming, but yet we did not realize to the fullest the seriousness of the situation of -- in school in lyceum, which was equal to junior college here, I would say.</span> <span id="s74">And the radio started to play national Polish hymns and the patriotic speeches, and we were listening to people telling us that we were invincible, which was very laughable because Poland did not have the technology that Germany possessed.</span> <span id="s75">In a few days, the Germans went in our city, which was not that far from the border.</span> <span id="s76">And while Germans were coming with their tanks, the Poles were fighting on their beautiful horses with lances, dressed beautifully.</span> <span id="s77">Being</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:07:45 patriotic and brought up in the spirit, everything was beautiful to me, but the reality of what was happening was ugly.</span> <span id="s79">Very soon after that, the Germans started to issue laws.</span> <span id="s80">Curfew was one of the first.</span> <span id="s81">We were not permitted on the streets past, I believe, 5 o'clock, I'm not too sure about that hour.</span> <span id="s82">We were required to wear yellow stars with the sign Jude identifying us as Jews.</span> <span id="s83">The money was frozen in the bank, and we started to be very frightened.</span> <span id="s84">One particular time, I was walking on a street not too far from my home, and I was called by a German officer.</span> <span id="s85">He called me, motioning with his hand to come over.</span> <span id="s86">My heart was beating wildly.</span> <span id="s87">I crossed the street.</span> <span id="s88">He asked me to go upstairs to his apartment, and being a young girl, I was just petrified.</span> <span id="s89">He asked me to clean the place.</span> <span id="s90">He took his gun off, put it on a table, and was sitting on a chair next to it watching me.</span> <span id="s91">Well, I didn't know too much about cleaning, but I cleaned very fast, and I did what he asked me to do.</span> <span id="s92">And he looked at me, and he said in German "It is a shame that you are a Jew," and he let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">This is another of the moments that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s94">After that, I wasn't going out too much.</span> <span id="s95">My mother and my grandmother tried to shield me.</span> <span id="s96">Since the apartment that we were living in belonged to -- this was a large building which belonged to us, we knew many German people in the city, Polish people of German origin.</span> <span id="s97">And my grandmother, who is very wise, asked one of them to come and be sort of a supervisor of the building, so she made an office in our apartment.</span> <span id="s98">It was a large apartment, and we did not have to display anything on the door identifying us as Jews.</span> <span id="s99">So for a little while, we were spared.</span> <span id="s100">However, pretty soon the Germans caught on.</span> <span id="s101">One day -- this is another of these moments -- one day there was a ring.</span> <span id="s102">An officer with an aide came to the door.</span> <span id="s103">The officer had a scar on his face identifying him as a student who had dueled probably in</span></p> <p><span id="s104">01:11:30 Heidelberg, Germany University.</span> <span id="s105">He also had a black skull on his head, a skull which identified him, I think, as a member of SS, and we knew what that was, Gestapo SS.</span> <span id="s106">He walked into the place.</span> <span id="s107">My grandmother, who was very fluent in German and knew that he represented danger, asked him if she could contribute to the German Red Cross, money.</span> <span id="s108">She thought that she would mollify him and that he will leave.</span> <span id="s109">At which point, he hit her.</span> <span id="s110">He had suede gloves, and he hit her with a gloved hand across the face.</span> <span id="s111">He proceeded from room to room with a man and was pointing to things which struck his fancy, and the young man started to pack them.</span> <span id="s112">At the end of one of our rooms was a small alcove filled with fern greens, and there was a cage with a canary hanging there.</span> <span id="s113">Once he saw the canary, his whole appearance changed.</span> <span id="s114">He became enchanted with the bird, and he asked us "Is this a male or a female canary?</span> <span id="s115">How lovely does he sing."</span> <span id="s116">He was a changed man.</span> <span id="s117">At that moment, I realized that a canary was more important, had more meaning to him than all of us human beings.</span> <span id="s118">This is one of the moments that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s119">The man was an educated man; I knew that.</span> <span id="s120">And we were nothing, but the canary represented something wonderful to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">He was mesmerized by the canary, and he beat my grandmother.</span> <span id="s122">Well we were staying in our apartment for some time until the Germans started to throw people out to ghetto -- I need to explain the term of "ghetto" to many people and children who are listening to me.</span> <span id="s123">A ghetto is an isolated part of our city situated in what used to be a very poor neighborhood and consisted of several blocks of buildings and small houses.</span> <span id="s124">And we knew that we are going to be thrown out.</span> <span id="s125">And since we knew somebody that was an engineer who was well acquainted with my family who lived at the outskirts of the city, and he asked us, since he was being evacuated, if we could live in his little house and take care of it, which we agreed to greedily because it was clean.</span> <span id="s126">It had three rooms and a kitchen, and had a garden.</span> <span id="s127">And a garden was very important because there was some food growing there and we moved there.</span> <span id="s128">After a while, they started to send Czechish refugees, Jews from Czechoslovakia, and they were being assigned spaces in ghetto.</span> <span id="s129">The ghetto was small; there was not much space.</span> <span id="s130">Well, we received a couple, a husband and wife -- a charming, lovely couple whose children were being kept by some Czechish neighbors, Christian people who helped to save the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">And the couple stayed with us for a while.</span> <span id="s132">But we were being already used to the rations, and we were deteriorating at a slower rate than they.</span> <span id="s133">They were thrown in directly from the good life to the very, very bad, and they both died fairly soon.</span> <span id="s134">We were all being starved, and my grandmother had an</span></p> <p><span id="s135">01:16:30 idea.</span> <span id="s136">The so-called "Aelteste der Juden", you wouldn't know which one.</span> <span id="s137">The man who was in charge of Lódz Ghetto was named Chaim Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s138">Before the war, he was an agent for an orphanage and collected money for the orphans.</span> <span id="s139">Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the orphanage, my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help.</span> <span id="s140">There were so- called talons (ph), small pieces of paper for some food distribution, and I went to see him.</span> <span id="s141">It's another moment in my memory.</span> <span id="s142">It was a long room with a long table.</span> <span id="s143">He was at the end of the table, and I was at the other one, at the other end.</span> <span id="s144">I was led in the room, and I said to him in Polish " Panye President," which means Mr. President.</span> <span id="s145">And at that moment, he picked up a cane and wanted to hit me because he resented the fact that I didn't speak Jewish to him, which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s146">So I quickly told him "I am from this-and-this family."</span> <span id="s147">And at that, he stopped and said, "Where do you live?"</span> <span id="s148">Then I gave him the address and I left.</span> <span id="s149">He sent next day somebody with few of the pieces of papers for some sugar and for me to work in a bakery for three months.</span> <span id="s150">And that was a life-saving because I could eat some bread in the bakery, and I could take some small pieces home, and my ration card was being used by my family.</span> <span id="s151">This lasted three months.</span> <span id="s152">Three months later because they were changing -- three months later, he remembered me.</span> <span id="s153">He had fantastic memory.</span> <span id="s154">He switched me to a place which was called kitchen -- some sort of kitchen.</span> <span id="s155">They were feeding for two weeks soup to workers who were essential to their production in ghetto.</span> <span id="s156">You see, ghetto had several establishments working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s157">In order to stay alive we were obligated to produce some work.</span> <span id="s158">In that kitchen, I worked as a waitress.</span> <span id="s159">And one day about a week later, this Mr. Rumkowski's sister-in-law came to the room, and she saw me and she said, "Cut your hair," and I didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s160">And said, "Out," and she threw me out of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s161">Well, that was a tragedy because that's where the food was.</span> <span id="s162">I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski, who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in ghetto.</span> <span id="s163">People had very wrong ideas about themselves.</span> <span id="s164">He was instrumental in assigning me to the kitchen where they were peeling potatoes, and I was very happy about that.</span> <span id="s165">I was peeling potatoes all day long, and trying to steal some of the peels to take home, because peels meant food.</span> <span id="s166">All this ended soon after.</span> <span id="s167">The ghetto was being systematically emptied.</span> <span id="s168">There were transports; people were being sent away.</span> <span id="s169">At that time, even Rumkowski couldn't help.</span> <span id="s170">He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the orphanage or whatever, and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:21:30 women to a place at the outskirts called Mariánské in ghetto.</span> <span id="s172">And we were there, working there in some meaningless work we performed.</span> <span id="s173">We were supposed to build cement blocks for the houses that were being ruined in Germany.</span> <span id="s174">They were trying to have cement blocks to build some sort of shelter.</span> <span id="s175">We were there for a while, and the ghetto was being systemically emptied, one transport after another.</span> <span id="s176">And Rumkowski amongst them.</span> <span id="s177">The transports were going then from August 1944, and after a while the ghetto was almost empty.</span> <span id="s178">My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that place to go to a hospital, which contained 500 people.</span> <span id="s179">There were two groups left in the entire ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">One was ours from Mariánské, and one was hidden on a street called Jakuba.</span> <span id="s181">I only know about it because I had a friend who was hidden there.</span> <span id="s182">At that time, I was not aware of it.</span> <span id="s183">The 500 of us were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s184">The hospital had a couple of physicians with their families.</span> <span id="s185">There were children.</span> <span id="s186">We slept, my mother and I, in a very large room with about 20 other people.</span> <span id="s187">I think we had -- I don't remember if there were mattresses, but we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s188">We would lie down in rows.</span> <span id="s189">For a small infraction, a couple of people were being taken away and sent away.</span> <span id="s190">The German who was in charge of this place was called Hans Bebolt (ph), typical, extremely good-looking man.</span> <span id="s191">Blonde, typical Aryan appearance; he was brutal.</span> <span id="s192">He selected one of the girls and then he shot her.</span> <span id="s193">This was the story of ghetto.</span> <span id="s194">There was one incident in ghetto which I forgot about.</span> <span id="s195">If I may, I'll go back to this.</span> <span id="s196">When we were still living in that house of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry, we decided that I will try to go to city to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our building.</span> <span id="s197">They were of German origin, but Polish.</span> <span id="s198">Their name was Mensel family.</span> <span id="s199">I took my star off, the Jewish star, and I smuggled myself through the wires, and I walked through the city.</span> <span id="s200">with the fear in my heart looking at people, looking at little dogs which reminded me of my dog that I had to leave at home, everything seemed very normal to me.</span> <span id="s201">But I knew that I didn't belong there.</span> <span id="s202">Finally, I reached the building that we left, and I walked up a very broad staircase, my heart was beating</span></p> <p><span id="s203">01:25:40 wildly because I didn't know how they will react to me.</span> <span id="s204">Will they let me in?</span> <span id="s205">Maybe they moved.</span> <span id="s206">It was a long time, and the door opened and it was opened by young Nina, who was the daughter of the family.</span> <span id="s207">As she looked at me, I saw the terror in her eyes.</span> <span id="s208">She was stricken with terror looking at me.</span> <span id="s209">And I was taken aback, but after a minute, she composed herself and put a finger to her lips indicating that I shouldn't speak.</span> <span id="s210">I found out that there were some German people invited to dinner.</span> <span id="s211">They were some sort of relation of Mr. Mensel, and she brought me to the room, and Mr. and Mrs. Mensel saw me and hugged me and gave me dinner.</span> <span id="s212">I ate with them dinner.</span> <span id="s213">I was sitting at that table looking at the tablecloth, looking at the proper appointment on the table.</span> <span id="s214">And I ate like a normal human being, and I started to resent the fact that I had to go back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s215">I almost forgot about everybody else that I left.</span> <span id="s216">But, of course, the situation changed in a minute.</span> <span id="s217">After some small talk, the man was -- the German was in life, he was a professor.</span> <span id="s218">He had a great deal of knowledge, and the conversation was so welcome to me, so normal, and I was not used to it anymore.</span> <span id="s219">And young Nina helped me, she said to explain to them that I came for some books.</span> <span id="s220">And the books, of course, was food.</span> <span id="s221">And she and her mother prepared some food, and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming.</span> <span id="s222">And they gave me some parcels and said that I'll be back.</span> <span id="s223">The young soldier wanted to see me next week, and all my friends said that they will let him know if I'll be in the city.</span> <span id="s224">And I took the parcel, and I started to walk towards the wires, towards the ghetto.</span> <span id="s225">Again, my heart was beating wildly.</span> <span id="s226">I was so, so very frightened because there were German patrols going on both sides of the wires.</span> <span id="s227">And I had to time myself to a split second when they turned around and won't be there.</span> <span id="s228">And when I saw that he turned around, I ran to the wire, so I spread them through the parcels, and I caught part of my dress on it.</span> <span id="s229">And I saw it, so I retrieved a little piece, grabbed the parcels, and ran towards the house.</span> <span id="s230">The house was not too far from the wires.</span> <span id="s231">And when I reached my home, the stress of the entire day gave up to tremendous, tremendous sobbing.</span> <span id="s232">I just couldn't believe what I did.</span> <span id="s233">I knew that with my family I had to move from this place after certain couple of months because the Germans were making the ghetto much smaller.</span> <span id="s234">And we moved to a house on Zierske (ph) Street.</span> <span id="s235">This was a main street in that part of the city, and there was a streetcar passing by.</span> <span id="s236">Since we were -- and the streetcar belonged to the population -- since we were not supposed to cross the street, it was cutting ghetto in half.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">They built a wooden bridge over the street.</span> <span id="s238">When we lived, for instance, on one side of the wire, and we worked on the other, we had to cross the wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s239">And the apartment assigned to us was right next to the bridge.</span> <span id="s240">That was before I went to Mariánské where Rumkowski sent me to the girls and then back, I went back to the hospital, which was my last stay in ghetto.</span> <span id="s241">There was a German -- I cannot recall his name -- I tried so hard the last few days to recall his name because I was looking forward to this interview.</span> <span id="s242">He promised to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s243">He was to take this group to his place of work and spare us Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s244">I knew about a terrible place that they were gassing people because there was a hidden radio in the hospital, and once even I listened to this radio.</span> <span id="s245">This German reassured us that when you will be taken away, we won't go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s246">When we walked through the ghetto to work after the entire ghetto was empty, it was a very weird feeling and the streets, open windows, flowing curtains blowing with the wind.</span> <span id="s247">No people.</span> <span id="s248">Once we thought that we saw a glimmer of somebody in the window, or a candle or something, and, of course, we averted our eyes not to give away to the German escorts that somebody was there.</span> <span id="s249">In November of 1944 came our time we had to be taken out.</span> <span id="s250">The entire population of our hospital was walked to the place where the cattle cars were, and we were loaded.</span> <span id="s251">It was a horrible thing because people had to stand.</span> <span id="s252">There was no place to sit or squat.</span> <span id="s253">If somebody was sick or even dying, he died on his feet standing up.</span> <span id="s254">It was just unbearable.</span> <span id="s255">Water was the worst, lack of water, the thirst was the worst.</span> <span id="s256">I tried very hard to suppress some of the moments because the life is beckoning, life is normal.</span> <span id="s257">I want to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s258">I want to be part of my family, which is very wonderful to me, but from time to time, these things keep on coming back and they haunt me.</span> <span id="s259">And I'm particularly happy that I am able to speak of it and to leave something behind me for mostly the young people, the people who never will, never heard, or heard a little bit about it, what it is about man's inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s260">This</span></p> <p><span id="s261">01:34:30 train took us to first camp, which was called Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s262">Ravensbrück was mainly a women's camp.</span> <span id="s263">It was large, we never knew about it.</span> <span id="s264">We didn't go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s265">We were the only transport from Lódz Ghetto that did not go to Auschwitz; he kept his word about that.</span> <span id="s266">Ravensbrück, though, was a hell.</span> <span id="s267">We were stripped of our clothes.</span> <span id="s268">We went through a medical examination, which was -- I cannot even say the word "embarrassing" because the people who conducted it were less than human.</span> <span id="s269">They were less than animal.</span> <span id="s270">We were many young girls who never undergone gynecological examinations, and they were looking for, God knows, diamonds or whatever.</span> <span id="s271">We were subjected to that.</span> <span id="s272">I had never seen chairs like that before in my life.</span> <span id="s273">We were humiliated at every moment.</span> <span id="s274">Our clothes was taken away from us, and we were directed to a heap of clothes which probably was left from the group that was killed previously.</span> <span id="s275">I received some sort of a dress.</span> <span id="s276">I tried hard to remember, but I can't remember.</span> <span id="s277">But there was some sort of a dress that was a little warmer.</span> <span id="s278">My mother, on the other hand, was given a long, silk dress, and it was November and it was cold.</span> <span id="s279">I don't know what kind.</span> <span id="s280">The food we were given was, of course, of no nutritional value, no value whatsoever.</span> <span id="s281">It was watery soup, one slice of bread.</span> <span id="s282">We had no possessions.</span> <span id="s283">All of us stopped menstruating because we had no nutrition in our bodies.</span> <span id="s284">We started to resemble skeletons.</span> <span id="s285">I developed on my right arm large pus deposits that would swell to the size of egg, which I covered under the sleeve because there is still a will to live and to survive no matter how horrible the circumstances.</span> <span id="s286">Our family, when we were still together, promised each other that if one of us would survive, we should try -- at least one -- to shout to all the world, to all the nations, to all the people and to bear witness to what we were going through.</span> <span id="s287">To what people were capable of doing.</span> <span id="s288">In this camp, we had to get up at dawn -- it was dark -- to be counted.</span> <span id="s289">These were so-called appells, an Appell Platz.</span> <span id="s290">We were standing in rows, long rows of miserable looking human wretches, and we were being counted.</span> <span id="s291">They were twice a day, the Appells.</span> <span id="s292">One day I was fainting because between the hunger and malnutrition, I was just fainting.</span> <span id="s293">And the Germans had dogs with them, large German Shepherds, who were being trained to attack people.</span> <span id="s294">And they let one go as I was lying down, and the dog came to me and licked my face.</span> <span id="s295">That's another moment.</span> <span id="s296">And I came to.</span> <span id="s297">I adore dogs and animals, and I don't know if it's true if the dog sensed it or not, but that's the truth.</span> <span id="s298">The dog did not touch me, he licked my face.</span> <span id="s299">And my friends picked me up, and I was again standing there as a number.</span> <span id="s300">That was Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s301">Ravensbrück had many women prisoners from different nations.</span> <span id="s302">We did not see them because the block -- there were blocks.</span> <span id="s303">The block that we were in was so temporary, we were coming and going, all being killed or sent somewhere to work.</span> <span id="s304">They were mixed bunch of women.</span> <span id="s305">The wooden bunks were about two or three tiers high, and I was with my mother on one middle one and across from us were German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war.</span> <span id="s307">The were murderers; they were all kinds of outcasts of the society.</span> <span id="s308">However, they were superior to us because they had the German blood.</span> <span id="s309">We were only Jews.</span> <span id="s310">The two German women who were across from us were two women; one of them was called Peter and she was the man.</span> <span id="s311">I was 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, I don't remember, and this was the first time that I was exposed to something like that, and she could hit us.</span> <span id="s312">We had no right to say anything.</span> <span id="s313">She was German.</span> <span id="s314">In that camp we were issued triangles of different colors.</span> <span id="s315">The black triangles, which the murderers wore, were given to the murderers and to the prisoners of crimes.</span> <span id="s316">The green ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses -- no.</span> <span id="s317">The green ones, excuse me, the green ones were given to the thieves, common thieves.</span> <span id="s318">The purple ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses, who were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s319">These were Germans who did not believe in violence, and they were thrown with us and shared our lot.</span> <span id="s320">I promised myself that if I survived the war, I'll help them -- let me compose myself.</span> <span id="s321">I kept my word.</span> <span id="s322">I never sent the Jehovah Witnesses from my door, never excuse me.</span> <span id="s323">May I have a tissue?</span> <span id="s324">This was first time that I saw some sparkle of humanity in this Gehenna, in this hell that we were going through.</span> <span id="s325">They were gentle and they told us to hold on because the war will end and the good will come back.</span> <span id="s326">Going back to the triangles.</span> <span id="s327">Pink were given to homosexuals, which Hitler didn't consider as pure German.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">One of his balonies there.</span> <span id="s329">And we, the Jews, had red one with a yellow.</span> <span id="s330">Pure red one was political prisoner, but with yellow was a Jew.</span> <span id="s331">We were on the lowest rank of this diabolical system.</span> <span id="s332">We were nothing.</span> <span id="s333">In this camp there was niece of and Audette (ph), a French resistance fighter who was well known.</span> <span id="s334">They were kept separately because they were valuable to Germans as eventual exchange prisoners.</span> <span id="s335">We were there about four weeks.</span> <span id="s336">Our work to which we were assigned was carrying stones from one place to another and then back again.</span> <span id="s337">There was no purpose; it was hard; it was almost impossible; it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s338">We had no clothes.</span> <span id="s339">We had no food, but we had to do it.</span> <span id="s340">One day there was announcement made that the people from our group are to assemble.</span> <span id="s341">We were being shipped somewhere else.</span> <span id="s342">We were shipped again in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s343">We reached a camp called Wittenberg on River Elbe, which is in the eastern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s344">Of course, Germany's united now.</span> <span id="s345">At that time, it was the eastern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s346">Wittenberg was a medium- sized town.</span> <span id="s347">The population of Wittenberg had two things that they were proud of.</span> <span id="s348">One of them was airplane factory called Arado, which produced a small fighter plane.</span> <span id="s349">And the other was the church in which Martin Luther put the 95 theses to the door of the church.</span> <span id="s350">That was in the city, so the city had a deep religious background.</span> <span id="s351">However, this did not prevent the</span></p> <p><span id="s352">01:47:40 population of being cruel and less than human.</span> <span id="s353">We were placed in barracks, numbered barracks, and the only fortunate part of it was that we, the Jewish girls from our transport, were all in one barrack.</span> <span id="s354">We were together.</span> <span id="s355">One lady amongst this group was pregnant.</span> <span id="s356">She was about, I say, about four or five months pregnant, and we tried to shield her as much as possible because we were all so skinny.</span> <span id="s357">Because she was skinny even being pregnant because there was no nourishment there.</span> <span id="s358">Being on our own in this barrack proved to one point was good that we selected the person who was in charge, and she was very fair.</span> <span id="s359">She cut the pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s360">The other barracks had Germans.</span> <span id="s361">There was one German woman who came up once and hit me and broke five of my teeth.</span> <span id="s362">But it was all right because she was German, and I was a Jew, so I couldn't even report this.</span> <span id="s363">We were taken to this place because we were needed to work in the airplane factory.</span> <span id="s364">The previous group that worked there, I believe there was an accident, and they needed replacement.</span> <span id="s365">Since we were the meat they handled, we were sent there because there was a great supply of this.</span> <span id="s366">We had to get up at dawn.</span> <span id="s367">We were counted again on an Appell Platz.</span> <span id="s368">And then we had to march to the factory.</span> <span id="s369">The factory was -- I don't remember how long was that march, but when we reached the factory, we crossed a few streets of the city.</span> <span id="s370">And the people who saw us walking were spitting at us.</span> <span id="s371">Children were taught that we are goddamn Jews, no good, dirty.</span> <span id="s372">We didn't look too appetizing; that's for sure.</span> <span id="s373">But did they ever think what the circumstances were that brought us to this point?</span> <span id="s374">Because I remember watching documentaries.</span> <span id="s375">How did the German soldiers look when they were in Russia and they were being defeated and they walked through the snow with the rags on their feet and rags on their heads?</span> <span id="s376">They didn't look any better than we did at this time, because they were being reduced to subhuman state.</span> <span id="s377">It is the circumstances that makes people look this way, and we were being made to look this way by other people.</span> <span id="s378">By other people who during the day beat us, tortured us, spit at us, killed us, and then went home to their wives and children and dogs and played with them and ate their dinner, and they never even gave a thought to what they did as what they considered work.</span> <span id="s379">The work became to them a hobby.</span> <span id="s380">They were being conditioned to like their work.</span> <span id="s381">They did not consider us as somebody who has brain equal or better than theirs.</span> <span id="s382">Who can think, who can feel, who can love, who can teach, who give and share good things with other people.</span> <span id="s383">The man who was in charge of our camp lived right across from the camp, the camp was surrounded by barbed wires and had high towers with machine guns manned by the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s384">When he left the camp at sa certain hour, he had his God that he loved.</span> <span id="s385">He had children running around the place.</span> <span id="s386">I could never reconcile the fact that he was called a man, and I couldn't say that he was an animal because I like animals.</span> <span id="s387">Well, we marched through the city to our place of work.</span> <span id="s388">We were supposed to work for 12 hours straight.</span> <span id="s389">The work was divided into two 12-hour shifts: day shift manned by us, and night shift which was manned by the Russian prisoners of war who were kept somewhere there.</span> <span id="s390">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s391">We were assigned to different parts of the factory.</span> <span id="s392">They were called Halle A, B, C, D and so forth.</span> <span id="s393">My misfortune was to be assigned to Halle Ha, which is H.</span> <span id="s394">There were only a few of us that were assigned there.</span> <span id="s395">My supervisor was an elderly German man, so-called Meister, who knew that the war was being lost.</span> <span id="s396">It was 1945 already.</span> <span id="s397">He took his revenge on me.</span> <span id="s398">He beat me, stomped on me mercilessly.</span> <span id="s399">One day , the work in that particular place of work to which I was assigned was to rivet parts of the plane, the wings.</span> <span id="s400">I had a riveting gun, which was made of steel and was very heavy, and rivets.</span> <span id="s401">I had to put the rivets through two holes to join the places, and they were spaced every so often.</span> <span id="s402">The work was very hard because it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s403">You can imagine how tremendous the place was for the planes being assembled.</span> <span id="s404">Huge, and it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s405">And the steel gun froze to the flesh of my hand when I was riveting.</span> <span id="s406">There were four of us that I knew that were in this place, H.</span> <span id="s407">One day I noticed a very tiny script on part of the wing in a different script that I knew.</span> <span id="s408">It was a Russian script.</span> <span id="s409">And one person knew how to decipher this, and it was written there "Try if you can to skip every so often when you rivet and leave a little bit of opening."</span> <span id="s410">Now, we realized that if we would do that, we risked death, but this was a lifesaver for us.</span> <span id="s411">We can do something positive because logically if the plane's in the air, the force of wind may force this rivet out because it's not completely sealed.</span> <span id="s412">And if enough of them would be blown out, the part would disintegrate.</span> <span id="s413">And we were delighted, and we started to do it.</span> <span id="s414">I did this for a little while, and one day I infected my finger with part of steel.</span> <span id="s415">And I knew that the infection was bad because I had a red stripe going up my arm and swollen glands underneath my armpit, so I knew that's bad.</span> <span id="s416">And here it was already March '45, going towards April.</span> <span id="s417">April, it was April.</span> <span id="s418">I don't recall the dates exactly, and my friend said, "You must survive."</span> <span id="s419">We could hear the sounds of war.</span> <span id="s420">We knew that the armies are coming closer and closer and closer because we were being sent more and more towards middle of Germany.</span> <span id="s421">And I developed high fever, so we had so-called Krankenrevier, which is place the sick people were taken.</span> <span id="s422">Prior to this, they were taken away and shipped somewhere in Kiev.</span> <span id="s423">But since this was already so late, they took me there and two of the prisoners amongst us, the Jewish group, were doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Two young lady doctors, and one of them Dr. Levine, who I don't know if she's still alive, pulled my nail without any anesthesia, without anything -- she had nothing.</span> <span id="s425">Pulled the nail off me and squeezed the pus.</span> <span id="s426">Normally, if this would happen here, if you don't have penicillin or streptomycin or antimycin, you probably die.</span> <span id="s427">I didn't die of it.</span> <span id="s428">It some sort of healed over.</span> <span id="s429">I had no nail.</span> <span id="s430">I had some straps all around it, I think, from the dress.</span> <span id="s431">I don't remember what she wrapped around it.</span> <span id="s432">I was in pain.</span> <span id="s433">They permitted me to stay in this place for sick, and I was sitting in the corner.</span> <span id="s434">All the windows were blackened because there were air raids already coming.</span> <span id="s435">And one day an SS woman came and she asked, "Who can knit?"</span> <span id="s436">And I said to myself I knew how to knit.</span> <span id="s437">I knew that properly brought girls were supposed to play piano, speak French and German, knit, and cook, besides the schoolwork.</span> <span id="s438">I knew how to knit, so I raised my hand.</span> <span id="s439">And she said, "I have to have a sweater within few days."</span> <span id="s440">And she brought me knitting needles and wool, and I was knitting without this finger, constantly.</span> <span id="s441">But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it.</span> <span id="s442">As I was knitting for few days, one day they came to the barrack; they boarded the windows.</span> <span id="s443">They didn't let anybody out.</span> <span id="s444">The Russians were already at the doors of the city, and the fighting was going on and we heard the fighting.</span> <span id="s445">We didn't know who was coming, but we knew whoever it is, it's the liberators.</span> <span id="s446">So to us, it didn't mean much.</span> <span id="s447">So we all stayed in the barrack.</span> <span id="s448">The plan was to destroy us, but they didn't have enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Just a minute.</span> <span id="s452">But what I think we should do is why don't you back up to the SS woman coming in saying, "Can anybody knit?"</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: All right.</span> <span id="s456">The SS woman, a heavy, big woman, came to the place where we were, the few sick people, and asked if anybody can knit, and I thought that maybe this will help me to survive since I'm the one -- I'm still here.</span> <span id="s457">I said, "I can knit."</span> <span id="s458">I raised my hand and she brought knitting needles and wool and asked me to make her a sweater as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s459">Evidently, they wanted to shed their uniforms, which we found later on spread around there, and have civilian clothes on.</span> <span id="s460">They were big, heavy people; they had sticks with them to hit.</span> <span id="s461">And I started to knit in spite of my broken ribs and finger which was bandaged superficially and pain.</span> <span id="s462">I knitted and knitted.</span> <span id="s463">And she brought me some soup, some cold soup, and so- called bread, which was made with some sort of sawdust, I believe.</span> <span id="s464">And I ate very greedily, and I knitted the sweater until few days later, I found out that nobody could leave the barrack because the doors were boarded and so were the windows.</span> <span id="s465">And we didn't see through the cracks, we didn't see anybody manning the towers.</span> <span id="s466">The German soldiers were gone, so we realized that we are sentenced to be disposed of.</span> <span id="s467">It was almost a tonic.</span> <span id="s468">We heard the sounds of fight -- guns, couldn't identify what it was.</span> <span id="s469">The sky was turning almost crimson red, and we were huddled.</span> <span id="s470">Then one of the girls who was very enterprising, she said, "Nobody's here.</span> <span id="s471">Let's break the door and go to the kitchen."</span> <span id="s472">Food was on everybody's mind.</span> <span id="s473">Food, food was life.</span> <span id="s474">They broke the door.</span> <span id="s475">Now, I couldn't; I was lying down.</span> <span id="s476">They broke the door from the main place, from the main barrack and from the sick place, and they ran to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s477">What they found in the kitchen were bars of margarine bars, and raw potatoes and couple of eggs.</span> <span id="s478">They scooped the margarine with their hands, and they brought two eggs and some potatoes.</span> <span id="s479">And since the door was broken down, we decided to leave the place.</span> <span id="s480">My people took me by my arms and grabbed me, and we crossed the street to where the commandant's house was.</span> <span id="s481">Well, his house was empty; he ran away with his family.</span> <span id="s482">So we went inside.</span> <span id="s483">There were six or seven of us -- seven, I think.</span> <span id="s484">How to cook the two eggs and divide, and the raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s485">While they were busy cooking and as they were cooking, the commandant came back with a cocked gun facing us, the seven of us.</span> <span id="s486">There was group of subhumans watching this man, this well-fed, big man with the gun, and he was afraid of us.</span> <span id="s487">It was -- if it wouldn't be so tragic, it would be comical.</span> <span id="s488">He backed out with the gun and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s489">We decided it's not safe to stay there, so we started to run towards the fire because where the fire was coming from, whoever tried to liberate, was there fighting.</span> <span id="s490">As we were running, we encountered two young men.</span> <span id="s491">They happened to be Polish, and they were there not as prisoners, but they were taken from Poland to work in the fields because their young people and old people and whoever was capable was fighting.</span> <span id="s492">They needed people to work the fields, and the two Polish people joined our group.</span> <span id="s493">One of the girls was killed by a piece of shrapnel in the very last moment before liberation.</span> <span id="s494">And the rest of us started to run toward the fire.</span> <span id="s495">They were holding me all the way, and we reached a place -- it's another moment -- where a dirty, strange-looking man in filthy uniform with Asiatic-looking face, very tiny eyes, with a little cappy sort of a hat and big boots, and we realized that this is not a German at that time.</span> <span id="s496">We were ready to kiss his boots as filthy as he was, but he told us dawai, "In the back, in the back."</span> <span id="s497">We were so called liberated, we didn't know what was ahead of us yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">We went behind -- this is still the war line.</span> <span id="s499">They are fighting -- go.</span> <span id="s500">Food, they had a bottle of herring.</span> <span id="s501">We started to eat this herring, one after another.</span> <span id="s502">And we were tremendously thirsty, and there was no water because the pipes froze.</span> <span id="s503">We all got sick, very sick from it.</span> <span id="s504">See, the Russians are, I must say, very sturdy people.</span> <span id="s505">They were fighting eating the herring.</span> <span id="s506">It was incomprehensible to us, but that's the fact.</span> <span id="s507">And they told us to get away from there, so we started to go away.</span> <span id="s508">This was a village.</span> <span id="s509">The village was not touched.</span> <span id="s510">The little houses, neat houses, lovely gardens, and sounds of starving animals because the Germans ran away and left the poor beasts unfed.</span> <span id="s511">They were running for life, so there were cows, there were pigs howling.</span> <span id="s512">We got to one of the houses, and since the firing was going on both ways, we went to the basement.</span> <span id="s513">There were the two Polish guys and man and five girls, five women.</span> <span id="s514">We went to the basement which was very well appointed.</span> <span id="s515">They had sleeping accommodation.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">They had shelves stocked with jars with conserves, with meat, with whatever.</span> <span id="s517">And they had a barrel of water.</span> <span id="s518">They were very well prepared.</span> <span id="s519">We ate and we lie down.</span> <span id="s520">The basement was approachable by some sort of a door which swings out and up and down, and in the middle of the night two Russians came and opened the door and came down.</span> <span id="s521">And they wanted women.</span> <span id="s522">I became hysterical because if I survived to this point, I don't want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s523">And I told one of the Polish men that if he would save me, I would do anything possible because my family's very influential.</span> <span id="s524">I thought they were alive.</span> <span id="s525">And he put me down on one of these wooden benches, which was prepared for sleeping and covered me and sat down on me.</span> <span id="s526">The other girls did the same.</span> <span id="s527">The third girl hid in a corner, and two girls were raped.</span> <span id="s528">One of them is still alive that's in Israel, but I understand that she's in a mental institution.</span> <span id="s529">Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes, these were people who were fighting the war.</span> <span id="s530">The closest I can identify them, they were grunzens (ph) or kalmucks??</span> <span id="s531">.</span> <span id="s532">They couldn't understand the difference, what's the difference?</span> <span id="s533">A woman's a woman; I mean, a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">What's wrong?</span> <span id="s535">They were childlike.</span> <span id="s536">Here they were fighting, and here this is quite all right, everything.</span> <span id="s537">They drank whatever was there, and then one of them took a gun and started to shoot the jars with the fruit.</span> <span id="s538">And the pieces of glass and the red fluid from them started to seep all over, and I had glass embedded in my left leg throughout the winter because I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s539">I reached that point.</span> <span id="s540">I was going to tell the world.</span> <span id="s541">I remembered my promise, so I had the glass in my leg and the red fluid all over me.</span> <span id="s542">And I was -- and the Polish young man was sitting on top of me, and that was till the morning.</span> <span id="s543">When the morning finally arrived, we decided to leave the place, and we walked, walked, walked to the next village.</span> <span id="s544">Next village, there were beautiful homes all beautifully prepared.</span> <span id="s545">Food, chickens, china.</span> <span id="s546">We went to the house and we scouted it.</span> <span id="s547">We saw that there was an attic there.</span> <span id="s548">So we ate.</span> <span id="s549">I remember the two young Polish guys were running up to the chickens with a stick to kill them.</span> <span id="s550">We cooked the chickens.</span> <span id="s551">We ate.</span> <span id="s552">We took the china with the tablecloth, threw out of the window.</span> <span id="s553">We weren't going to save anything there.</span> <span id="s554">This was our little revenge.</span> <span id="s555">Silly as it might sound now.</span> <span id="s556">We decided we would sleep in the attic.</span> <span id="s557">We took the ladder.</span> <span id="s558">We climbed the ladder and slept quietly in the attic.</span> <span id="s559">One of the girls was a little bit different.</span> <span id="s560">She decided she liked one of the Russian officers, so she stayed downstairs, and she went with him wherever she wanted to.</span> <span id="s561">In the middle of the night, we went to -- we were alone on the top in the attic.</span> <span id="s562">The two Polish younb men are sleeping in one of the rooms downstairs, and we hear German voices.</span> <span id="s563">It seems the houses were facing a young forest, and there were Germans hiding in the forest.</span> <span id="s564">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s565">They wanted to get some food.</span> <span id="s566">They got to our house to the kitchen, and they were eating food in our kitchen.</span> <span id="s567">So we were very frightened, even though we were in the attic.</span> <span id="s568">We went underneath the bed.</span> <span id="s569">They had a bed there upstairs.</span> <span id="s570">We went underneath the bed.</span> <span id="s571">One of the girls could not hold her bladder from fear, and that's how we were lying in it.</span> <span id="s572">And two Polish young men jumped out of the window because there was low part there, and they went to the Russians wherever they were.</span> <span id="s573">They had already so-called stabilized the place, and they told them that there were Germans in the house.</span> <span id="s574">So the Russians came over, and we hear them outside.</span> <span id="s575">"Let's throw grenades," or whatever the name is of it.</span> <span id="s576">They were going to kill the Germans or dynamite the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">They didn't care about property either.</span> <span id="s578">But here we are, four of us, under the bed.</span> <span id="s579">So we started to scream, "No, no.</span> <span id="s580">There are Polish people here.</span> <span id="s581">There are Polish people here."</span> <span id="s582">The two Germans opened the kitchen door and started to run to the garden, and they were shot.</span> <span id="s583">They were lying there for a few days.</span> <span id="s584">Each one of us took something from the German body.</span> <span id="s585">I had a pair of scissors, little scissors that he had on his body.</span> <span id="s586">I still have them.</span> <span id="s587">The next day there were French prisoners, ex-prisoners of war, who lived in another house there.</span> <span id="s588">Now, I could communicate with them, and I told them that I'm scared to death.</span> <span id="s589">The other girls decided they want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s590">I was afraid to make one step outside.</span> <span id="s591">So the French people invited me to stay with them, and that's how I parted company with the Polish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">And I went to the French house, and they said they would protect me; they did it.</span> <span id="s593">Each one is a separate story, and there are numbers of them.</span> <span id="s594">Numbers.</span> <span id="s595">Because the brain is supposed to be a storage of all these things, but yet it's almost impossible.</span> <span id="s596">There are things that I omitted.</span> <span id="s597">There are things that are coming back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Can I ask you a couple of questions?</span> <span id="s599">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I'm not going to go in chronological order, necessarily.</span> <span id="s601">Your mother was with you when you were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And your mother was with you for how long, and what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: My mother was with me until we worked in that -- until Wittenberg, and then she was taken somewhere else.</span> <span id="s605">My mother was taken away from me in Wittenberg, and I didn't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s606">I found her after the war in Oranienburg Sachsenhausen, which was another camp, and she was already mortally ill and she passed away.</span> <span id="s607">If somebody was not capable of carrying the work, they were useless to the Germans.</span> <span id="s608">And even though she was quite young, she was 42 years old, but she had swollen legs.</span> <span id="s609">She was skeleton-like.</span> <span id="s610">She deteriorated very badly.</span> <span id="s611">She was useless.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">02:22:30</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: But she carried stones with you at Ravensbrück?</span> <span id="s614">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: And when she was taken away, do you remember how that happened?</span> <span id="s616">I mean, were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: I wasn't even there when she was taken.</span> <span id="s618">I was in the -- I was sick with my finger, so I don't know the real details.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: In the camp, tell me what you used as a support system.</span> <span id="s620">Did you use your imagination?</span> <span id="s621">Tell me about what --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: My support system was very much the family background.</span> <span id="s623">The basis that I was given from my family.</span> <span id="s624">The love, the support, the thirst for education and living, and, most of all, the promise that we would try to survive.</span> <span id="s625">We would try to bear witness.</span> <span id="s626">We would try no matter what and how, even if it would require something that is out of ordinary.</span> <span id="s627">For instance, my grandmother was an observant Jewess.</span> <span id="s628">We were not, but she was.</span> <span id="s629">She was not supposed to eat meat that was not slaughtered in a certain way.</span> <span id="s630">She was not supposed to eat horse meat.</span> <span id="s631">But when we were in ghetto in the beginning, they were sending some sort of horse meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">And she ate it because, as I understand, our religion teaches that in order to survive if you are very sick there are certain things that are permissible and this was one of them.</span> <span id="s633">Like an absolution, she ate horse meat which would be unthinkable under normal circumstances.</span> <span id="s634">So the thirst of being here, surviving, and telling the people -- you have no idea how very much I look toward today, the moment that I can share some of my experiences to leave behind me.</span> <span id="s635">To be part of the oral history, I will feel that I accomplished something very important.</span> <span id="s636">I am more than delighted that this museum came into being.</span> <span id="s637">I feel that it's a tremendous tool for all humanity, that it is the most necessary tool to teach people of all persuasions that such a thing must never happen again to any people anywhere, anytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: In the camps, religious practices were forbidden, I assume, and did you witness any?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: As I previously said, I was not brought up religiously.</span> <span id="s640">My religion was mainly the tradition of our people, and we were invited by grandparents for the observant holidays that we shared together.</span> <span id="s641">I loved them.</span> <span id="s642">I loved them; I observed the tradition.</span> <span id="s643">It's still something that will stay with me and something that my daughter now values and my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s644">She said to me, my granddaughter, which is the future -- the young person that will carry on.</span> <span id="s645">She said, "Nanna, no matter who I will marry, I will remember my background, and I will always carry on in my heart and life the thought of who you were, who we are, and what has to be done."</span> <span id="s646">So this is like carrying the torch.</span> <span id="s647">It is, to me, religion, and the religion observances are not as necessary as in my heart I feel I am a righteous person.</span> <span id="s648">That's what my father taught me.</span> <span id="s649">My father said that God surrounds us all, no matter what his name or image is.</span> <span id="s650">God is in every blade of grass.</span> <span id="s651">God is in every river that flows.</span> <span id="s652">And if I observe the commandments, which all of us should, then I am a religious person.</span> <span id="s653">There were some people who would have liked to have observed candlelighting or somebody that would have it.</span> <span id="s654">In ghetto, there are still some candles which my grandmother had.</span> <span id="s655">But later on, we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s656">I didn't even -- I was not even aware which day this is, what holiday, what day.</span> <span id="s657">The days were melting into one another.</span> <span id="s658">You were not aware of it.</span> <span id="s659">You were busy trying to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Did you ever have dreams about food?</span> <span id="s661">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s662">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Tell me about it.</span> <span id="s664">And did you form friendships with others?</span> <span id="s665">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Tell me, describe one or two of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s668">Our food was very important of our dreams and our talks, naturally.</span> <span id="s669">The body needs fuel.</span> <span id="s670">Food is the fuel.</span> <span id="s671">Once your body is satisfied then you can function properly, so we shared the dreams of food.</span> <span id="s672">In one particular instance when I was in camp with my mother, and we were issued the daily portion of small piece of bread and soup, my mother taught me to share the bread.</span> <span id="s673">To share, that means to divide into two portions: one to eat when I go to sleep and the next one in the morning before the long day of this horrible work.</span> <span id="s674">I tried to obey her, and I put this piece of bread underneath me and she put hers, because we slept together.</span> <span id="s675">And I dreamt and I dreamt of bread and the thoughts were coming how wonderful bread can be.</span> <span id="s676">Fresh and sweet smelling and when you put the knife to it, you can smell the aroma.</span> <span id="s677">I said (sniff) oh, I</span></p> <p><span id="s678">02:30: could imagine the aroma of bread, how wonderful bread can be.</span> <span id="s679">We never thought of it, how luxurious bread can be.</span> <span id="s680">And I was thinking what I would put on my bread.</span> <span id="s681">I was making it up, stories.</span> <span id="s682">Plum butter, butter, wonderful.</span> <span id="s683">And, of course, that was a revelry because the Ukrainian woman who was the Kapo, I don't know if this term is being explained is where the helpers for the German soldiers, the women who took care of us in the camp.</span> <span id="s684">The Kapos started to wake us up, heraus,heraus means.</span> <span id="s685">"Get up, out."</span> <span id="s686">Always roughly, there was no normal language there.</span> <span id="s687">And I didn't want to wake because I still had this image of bread before my eyes.</span> <span id="s688">And my mother said, "We must, my child.</span> <span id="s689">we must.</span> <span id="s690">We have to go to the Appell platz to be counted."</span> <span id="s691">And we looked for the bread, the precious piece of bread, and it wasn't there.</span> <span id="s692">It was stolen during the night.</span> <span id="s693">All ethical upbringing sometimes disappears in times like this.</span> <span id="s694">Some people were not capable of preserving their humanity, and somebody stole this precious piece of bread.</span> <span id="s695">And I wrote a story about it, and I ended the story with if I should hate the thieves.</span> <span id="s696">And I came to the conclusion, no; I should hate the perpetrators who reduced these people to this level.</span> <span id="s697">That the people who stole the bread were not strong enough.</span> <span id="s698">Their hunger was greater than their morality.</span> <span id="s699">There were some of them who couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s700">There were some of us who had to.</span> <span id="s701">My mother wanted to share her piece with me.</span> <span id="s702">I wanted to share my piece with her.</span> <span id="s703">This is what differs us.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Was there ever singing in the camp, at night maybe?</span> <span id="s705">A: In the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Uh-huh (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Or in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Or either one?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: In ghetto, we did sing.</span> <span id="s710">When we were together the group of young women, we were singing some longing, beautiful song.</span> <span id="s711">Some romantic songs, we were young.</span> <span id="s712">We were ripe for love, for life.</span> <span id="s713">We had dreams, so we sang longingly about it.</span> <span id="s714">It brought many memories from the school proms or whatever.</span> <span id="s715">Then there were very sad songs which Jewish music has some haunting, haunting things, and we were singing some if we didn't even know the words.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Some people knew it, yes.</span> <span id="s717">There was somebody who had violin.</span> <span id="s718">We didn't have piano, so we couldn't play piano.</span> <span id="s719">Maybe some people did in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s720">I don't -- I wasn't aware of it.</span> <span id="s721">In camp we didn't sing anymore.</span> <span id="s722">But in camp when I walked and I looked through the wire sometimes, and I saw flowers growing, I had such love for flowers and I said, "The flowers are here."</span> <span id="s723">And I look up and I saw the blue sky and birds flying, and I said, "This is the same sky on both sides of the wire, and these people look at it as I do now.</span> <span id="s724">And they must love it as do it."</span> <span id="s725">And I followed the birds that were flying, and I said, "And they followed the flock of birds."</span> <span id="s726">What divides us?</span> <span id="s727">Why?</span> <span id="s728">The why is so tremendous that it's -- I will never be able to explain.</span> <span id="s729">I wanted to reach for the flower, to see, to handle the flower because it was such a symbol of beauty and a symbol of my past.</span> <span id="s730">But I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s731">They had gardens they cultivated, and so they loved their flowers and I loved the flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">02:35:</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Tell me about your beatings and how you were hurt and why.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: The last beating that I received was in April of 1944, and it was done not by SS, but it was done by the German supervisor in my factory where I worked Arado, the airplane factory.</span> <span id="s735">I was very sick at the time.</span> <span id="s736">I had fever, my finger.</span> <span id="s737">I couldn't perform the work.</span> <span id="s738">He didn't know that I was sabotaging all along, but the beating was about my inability to perform my work.</span> <span id="s739">He threw me down.</span> <span id="s740">He wore high boots, and he started to stomp on me.</span> <span id="s741">They didn't have guns, the Meisters.</span> <span id="s742">He was stomping on me breaking my ribs.</span> <span id="s743">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s744">I had a fever anyway because my finger was infected.</span> <span id="s745">And the two girls that worked in the same division, the same horrible place, had come back after our work and that's when I went to that place where the sick people were.</span> <span id="s746">And they said, "Don't say a word because in a few days we will be liberated."</span> <span id="s747">We knew the fire was -- we were liberated April 20-something when the Russians reached Wittenberg and displaced the people from the camps.</span> <span id="s748">They had no time to kill us.</span> <span id="s749">The plan was to kill us, but they just plainly didn't have time and I survived.</span> <span id="s750">As a result of the beating, I have to wear a brace for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s751">I did not have proper medical care, because the Russians were too busy fighting.</span> <span id="s752">They did, however, provide bandages which they rolled around me, strapped me when we reached the village.</span> <span id="s753">I asked them, so I was rolled in their bandages.</span> <span id="s754">And that was maybe one thing that I was not very useful to them.</span> <span id="s755">I wear a brace.</span> <span id="s756">As a result of the brace and the ribs that didn't heal properly, I developed tremendous curvature of the spine which worsened with the advent of my pregnancy.</span> <span id="s757">The doctors warned me that this would occur, but I didn't care.</span> <span id="s758">I thought that I do have to have a child.</span> <span id="s759">I owe it to my family.</span> <span id="s760">I owe it to myself, and I owe it to my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">And I have been blessed.</span> <span id="s762">I have a wonderful daughter, a wonderful son-in-law, British.</span> <span id="s763">I have a a wonderful grandchild.</span> <span id="s764">I have wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s765">So in some way, somewhere my family up there knows that I have been blessed.</span> <span id="s766">I will never forget.</span> <span id="s767">Many times I am asked, especially in two places.</span> <span id="s768">One was a Catholic school that I spoke last year and the nuns and the children were wonderful.</span> <span id="s769">And another place there was very good reception was the Navy Intelligence Unit.</span> <span id="s770">And one of the questions that always pops out is "How did you permit this to happen?</span> <span id="s771">Why didn't you defend yourself?"</span> <span id="s772">See, young people in the Navy, strong, hopefully intelligent -- if they are in the Intelligence Unit, they must be very bright.</span> <span id="s773">They cannot perceive the conditions that we were in.</span> <span id="s774">We were surrounded by population which was not only unfriendly, but openly hostile to us.</span> <span id="s775">We couldn't have a gun if we would beg them on knees.</span> <span id="s776">We had nothing, we had no food, we were starved.</span> <span id="s777">We had no strength to do the most minor, meaningless things.</span> <span id="s778">We were absolutely helpless.</span> <span id="s779">Many people gave up, committed suicide.</span> <span id="s780">A number of them, because they did not want to continue this way.</span> <span id="s781">Many people gave up because they thought somebody from the family would stay.</span> <span id="s782">Many people said, "Is this what God wanted for us?"</span> <span id="s783">And yet, many people died with God's name on their lips, so there is no one answer to this</span></p> <p><span id="s784">02:41: question.</span> <span id="s785">Then they asked me "Can you forgive?"</span> <span id="s786">That's different question.</span> <span id="s787">I cannot forgive the people who did it.</span> <span id="s788">I can't ever forgive them, but I have to forgive the younger people in Germany because they were informed.</span> <span id="s789">And I have to give them the opportunity to show their outlook on life.</span> <span id="s790">They are not guilty.</span> <span id="s791">They did not participate.</span> <span id="s792">Some of them who were born of Nazis trying to repent for their fathers.</span> <span id="s793">Of course, there are some pro-Nazis.</span> <span id="s794">There are neo-Nazis.</span> <span id="s795">But we have everyone everywhere, wherever we are.</span> <span id="s796">We have always a group of people who are, I would say, inferior, and to show their so-called superiority, they think that other people are not up to their par and do not deserve to live or do not deserve -- whatever is their philosophy.</span> <span id="s797">But I dismissed them.</span> <span id="s798">I have to forgive the young people.</span> <span id="s799">There is nothing to forgive, the ones who didn't do it.</span> <span id="s800">As a matter of fact, when I lived in New York City through the Quaker Society, I arranged to have German young people who were exchange to visit us, to share our meal and to discuss things with them.</span> <span id="s801">Not of the past, but for the future because that's what we are talking about, the future.</span> <span id="s802">We are interested in the future, and I think that I made some strides there.</span> <span id="s803">I think that's important.</span> <span id="s804">I think this is part of the philosophy of our Holocaust Museum, to talk about the future.</span> <span id="s805">That the past should never be forgotten, but it should never be repeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Don't you think that your sabotage was fighting back?</span> <span id="s807">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Tell me again about your sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: That's very interesting story.</span> <span id="s810">I did what I was told to do because it wouldn't have occurred to me on my own, and it was a great deal of satisfaction that I was able to do something against the war machine, against the enemy.</span> <span id="s811">It was some food for my soul.</span> <span id="s812">I was doing something that they didn't know of, something to help to dismantle the war machine in as little a way as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s813">And one day when I was living in San Diego -- I am an ardent book reader -- I came upon a book.</span> <span id="s814">It was a story about mother and daughter in camp, and the story sounded so much like my story that I decided to write to the author.</span> <span id="s815">I didn't know who wrote the book.</span> <span id="s816">It was a mother and daughter working in a camp near a bomb site factory, and they were going to take the mother away because she was not able to perform the work.</span> <span id="s817">And the daughter begged her to leave the mother and she would do work for two.</span> <span id="s818">They refused, and they took the mother away.</span> <span id="s819">There are three subplots in that book.</span> <span id="s820">One is that there are some American airmen who know that there is a group of German airmen who are planning to bomb Downing Street Number 10.</span> <span id="s821">Now, this was the seat of Winston Churchill in London.</span> <span id="s822">So here you have the story of the American airmen, the German airmen, how they trained, and the story in the camp.</span> <span id="s823">And to make the whole story shortest, the air raid is on.</span> <span id="s824">They German whole planes is flying towards London, and so do the Americans from the other side.</span> <span id="s825">And the Americans are able to shoot every plane with the exception of the leader plane who was able to reach Downing Street 10 and release the bomb.</span> <span id="s826">And the bomb falls and does not explode because this is the bomb that the girl didn't put the inside as a revenge.</span> <span id="s827">That was the bomb.</span> <span id="s828">Well, when I read this book, I just had goose pimples because I did something with the planes.</span> <span id="s829">So I wrote a letter and I sent to the publisher of the book.</span> <span id="s830">And a month later I received a letter from England, which I have it with me, from a British writer who wrote the story and wrote me a beautiful letter.</span> <span id="s831">And who said, "It is people like you, the little, quiet people, individuals who tried to do something to whom we in a way may owe a lot.</span> <span id="s832">You performed some" -- I have this letter which I'm going to give Mrs. Jones, and it makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s833">Incidentally, I receive every year greetings from Mr. Clyde and I write to him.</span> <span id="s834">And we keep up a correspondence.</span> <span id="s835">He knew the factory; he knew the planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: In the camps, were there -- did you ever witness torture or executions or --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Torture, yes; beatings, yes.</span> <span id="s838">I experienced it myself.</span> <span id="s839">I did not experience murdering before my eyes because they were taken away.</span> <span id="s840">I've seen, though, girls running to the wires, the electric wires and being executed -- exterminated, well, they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s841">Incidentally, which reminds me that I never, never, ever, when I speak to groups, I never use the word "extermination."</span> <span id="s842">Because in my mind you exterminate vermin, but you murder human beings.</span> <span id="s843">You don't exterminate them, you murder them.</span> <span id="s844">So you exterminate roaches.</span> <span id="s845">We cannot be compared to roaches.</span> <span id="s846">We are human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Do you remember incidents of unusual courage or selflessness in the camps or in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s849">Sharing food was one of the most unselfish things that one can think of because food represented life.</span> <span id="s850">There were people who were giving away part of their portion to others; that was unselfish.</span> <span id="s851">One of my school friends -- I went to a private school for girls -- one of the girls from my school was in ghetto, as well, with her mother.</span> <span id="s852">And she became very, very ill, and they wanted to deport her.</span> <span id="s853">All of us who were her friends from our meager portions decided to take a little bit and get it together and bring to her every day.</span> <span id="s854">You can't imagine the value of food in those days to give away.</span> <span id="s855">I had a glove, somehow, somewhere, in ghetto and we were freezing.</span> <span id="s856">So the glove was being worn by everybody by my friends.</span> <span id="s857">We were sharing the one glove, so one hand for few minutes was getting out of the numbness.</span> <span id="s858">I don't know who the glove really belonged to, but I was given it, and we shared this glove.</span> <span id="s859">And I remember this glove, and when I met one of the girls after the war in England, she said to me, "Blanka, do you remember your glove?"</span> <span id="s860">"Yes, I remember the glove."</span> <span id="s861">This was something that was very important at that time, the glove.</span> <span id="s862">Like the bread, like the canary, like the little flower, the glove was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Is there -- do you think -- maybe you can't answer this, but do you think there was something different about the experience in the ghetto or in the camps for women, in general, versus for men?</span> <span id="s864">Do you think they confronted it differently?</span> <span id="s865">I know the sabotage is one thing that got suggested to the women by the men who worked at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s867">And the men, the Russian men, they were all killed.</span> <span id="s868">None of them survived, but they were trained for war, and they knew what to do and they told us what to do.</span> <span id="s869">We, the four of us working , had no idea.</span> <span id="s870">We needed somebody to tell us, and these people were soldiers and they had some idea what to do.</span> <span id="s871">And once this occurred to us, it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s872">It gave us a shot of energy, of being useful, of doing a little part.</span> <span id="s873">In ghetto, we were together, women and men, and I worked in several places before I went to Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Rumkowski (ph).</span> <span id="s875">One of them was knitting factory, sweaters, which we were turning.</span> <span id="s876">And there were only women in my division, so I couldn't tell you that.</span> <span id="s877">There were men and women in the distribution place where the food came, but I had nothing to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">That's why we were starving so fast.</span> <span id="s879">Women sometimes, as enemies sometimes can be more vicious than men.</span> <span id="s880">The women SS were very, very vicious.</span> <span id="s881">For instance, when the dog came to me, he was directed by a man.</span> <span id="s882">And the dog didn't bite me, but licked me and came back to his master.</span> <span id="s883">He did not do anything to me.</span> <span id="s884">He could have.</span> <span id="s885">I wonder if this would be a woman, if she wouldn't have killed me.</span> <span id="s886">I don't know the answer, but the men somehow realized that the dog heard that I was his friend, and he let me live.</span> <span id="s887">There is so many incidents that collectively helped me to survive, and this is another moment.</span> <span id="s888">It's like carved in my memory forever.</span> <span id="s889">It's a moment, it's an etching.</span> <span id="s890">And this was one of them, the dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Tell me about some of the women SS that make you say that they were brutal.</span> <span id="s892">Maybe describe one to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: They were very brutal.</span> <span id="s894">Most of them somehow were very heavy.</span> <span id="s895">They were very busty.</span> <span id="s896">And I don't know if they ate so much or if they had such good positions, but they were extremely heavy, the ones that I knew.</span> <span id="s897">And they were brutal; they were -- the hatred came from the eyes already and the Peitsche (whip) was always ready to strike.</span> <span id="s898">They were -- they felt so superior and, God knows, they were nothing.</span> <span id="s899">But they felt so powerful, they thought that this will never end.</span> <span id="s900">But when the one came for the sweater, she cowered.</span> <span id="s901">She took the sweater because I finished the sweater and she ran.</span> <span id="s902">I never have seen her since.</span> <span id="s903">And my memory -- I don't remember her face.</span> <span id="s904">I think it's merciful.</span> <span id="s905">I think that certain things, subconsciously, you don't want to keep before your eyes.</span> <span id="s906">I erased her from my mind.</span> <span id="s907">I don't recall what she looked like.</span> <span id="s908">I don't remember the face of the Meister who crippled me for life.</span> <span id="s909">I remember his hatred.</span> <span id="s910">I remember the beating.</span> <span id="s911">I remember the terror and the pain, but I don't remember his face.</span> <span id="s912">That's another situation that I probably want to erase the face from my conscious and from my memory.</span> <span id="s913">I don't want to be haunted by this face.</span> <span id="s914">Merciful.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Let's just stop for a minute.</span> <span id="s916">I think maybe you should put up another roll, don't you?</span> <span id="s917">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: My aunt, I want to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s921">Why don't you first talk about that?</span> <span id="s922">Explain to me and set the context for me.</span> <span id="s923">Set the time and reestablish how old you were at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s927">In September of 1939, when the Germans already occupied our city and after they ordered the curfew and all the other restrictions on the general population and especially on the Jews, people became panicky.</span> <span id="s928">My mother had one sister who was married to a physician.</span> <span id="s929">He was mobilized as an officer in the Polish army, and with the Red Cross left the city.</span> <span id="s930">He was going toward the east.</span> <span id="s931">Unfortunately, not knowing that eventually the Russians will cut them off and start war against Poland from the east side, east quarter.</span> <span id="s932">And he was caught and eventually we received a small, small notification from him from a place called Katyn', which became very infamous in years to come because there were 10,000 Polish officers who were killed in Katyn' and buried in a common grave.</span> <span id="s933">After the war, the Germans accused the Russians, and the Russians, in turn, accused the Germans who killed the 10,000 Polish officers.</span> <span id="s934">In the meantime, his wife was left with one son with us, and in the panic the rumor started that the families of the officers would be deported or arrested.</span> <span id="s935">So my aunt with her son, who was at that time about 11 years old, decided to leave Lódz and go to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">There were no vehicle.</span> <span id="s937">People started to walk.</span> <span id="s938">Walking sounds very innocent, but this was an unbelieved movement of masses upon masses of humanity moving in one direction in darkness of the evening and in silence.</span> <span id="s939">You could only hear the footsteps.</span> <span id="s940">We looked from our windows and there were tens of thousands of people just going.</span> <span id="s941">Where?</span> <span id="s942">They didn't know where, but they were going.</span> <span id="s943">All kinds of rumors were flying around.</span> <span id="s944">The building in which we were living at the time with my grandmother was -- had five stories.</span> <span id="s945">And one day during an air raid, we were standing on the staircase because we didn't have places to hide.</span> <span id="s946">Somebody ran in and told us that they saw somebody on our roof with a flashlight.</span> <span id="s947">There were many, as I said before, German-origin people living in our city, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s948">They were called Volksdeutsche, and they were showing signs to the enemy, to their friends with flashlights.</span> <span id="s949">We couldn't even realize these were neighbors, friends.</span> <span id="s950">Watching the masses going and going, we were discussing should we go.</span> <span id="s951">Grandma couldn't walk that far, so we decided to stay.</span> <span id="s952">My mother decided to stay because this was her mother.</span> <span id="s953">I decided to stay because my mother stayed and my mother's two brothers.</span> <span id="s954">And that's how we stayed there.</span> <span id="s955">Then they threw out some of our neighbors who were actually renting their apartment from us in the building, so they moved and stayed with us.</span> <span id="s956">And, eventually, there was a group of about 13 people, but we had a large apartment, so this was still no hardship.</span> <span id="s957">Remembering the moving humanity at darkness at night silently was one of the very traumatic memories that I keep, and this was the very beginning.</span> <span id="s958">Eventually, my aunt reached Warsaw.</span> <span id="s959">I don't even know how, but I know that she reached Warsaw.</span> <span id="s960">And as a wife of a doctor, she was given a place with her son in a hospital.</span> <span id="s961">Since her husband was a physician and he was an officer on the way to war, they gave her space and she was in that hospital.</span> <span id="s962">We had couple of communications from her until 1942, where the communications stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: When the Lódz Ghetto was formed at first, you still lived outside the ghetto for a while, didn't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Can you give me some idea of the dates, as well as you remember them, the periods of time that were involved, and when your family actually moved into the ghetto if you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: I wouldn't remember the exact date, but I know that the war started in September.</span> <span id="s967">Sometime late in September, my aunt left with her son for Warsaw.</span> <span id="s968">We stayed, we had some helpers at home, a cleaning lady and -- who lived with us.</span> <span id="s969">They had their own room.</span> <span id="s970">Unfortunately, they were less than sympathetic forgetting all the good years they spent with us, and they very brazenly came to the room and demanded this fur coat and this and this.</span> <span id="s971">And they said, "Now, we are the ones who can tell you what to do."</span> <span id="s972">And they took it and left, and, actually, we were glad they left because they could have done much worse.</span> <span id="s973">One of them was very pretty and acquired a German boyfriend, so at that time, we thought, "Well, it's better that she's gone that she would come with him there."</span> <span id="s974">So we stayed without her, and you can get used to any kind of situation that you are thrown in.</span> <span id="s975">I remember we didn't have fuel, so we had installed a little stove in the middle of the beautiful living room.</span> <span id="s976">And we had the bread rations.</span> <span id="s977">We were toasting the bread on top of this little stove.</span> <span id="s978">Why do I remember this?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Because I thought the bread tastes so good.</span> <span id="s980">I never realized it before, so I remember this detail.</span> <span id="s981">I also remember that before the war, I attended Polish private school, many girlfriends.</span> <span id="s982">I remember with sorrow that not one of my girlfriends thought of coming over and bringing me some sort of food, not one of them.</span> <span id="s983">And yet they were good friends before the war.</span> <span id="s984">They used to come and sleep over, stay.</span> <span id="s985">I gave them help with work, small work.</span> <span id="s986">We were very friendly.</span> <span id="s987">That hurt me.</span> <span id="s988">But in the scope of time, it became very unimportant.</span> <span id="s989">At that time, I was very bitterly disappointed.</span> <span id="s990">The people who moved with us, from the other apartment, which was occupied, were very nice.</span> <span id="s991">They lived a number of years with us.</span> <span id="s992">Also, the family, Mensel family to whom I went once, smuggled myself through the wires, were people who lived in our building, and they were lovely people.</span> <span id="s993">We entrusted them with several valuables because we thought that after the war we would be able to retrieve them.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">And strangely enough, after the war was over and after my experience after the liberation, there was a period of time of two weeks that I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s995">There was -- I don't know how to explain this, but this was a Polish man that had several little carts, and they were leaving the German village.</span> <span id="s996">They had a large Polish flag, and they said anybody that wants to go and join him back to Poland can do so.</span> <span id="s997">And I lived with the French ex-prisoners of war at that time, and I said to myself, "I should go because maybe my mother came back.</span> <span id="s998">Maybe my aunt came back.</span> <span id="s999">My first responsibility is to see who came back, so I will go back to my city."</span> <span id="s1000">So I joined this caravan, an indescribable journey, we finally reached Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Warsaw was reduced to rubble.</span> <span id="s1002">It was unrecognizable, and I had to go to Lódz from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1003">I had no money; I had no clothes; I had no luggage; I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1004">I was just -- and there was a man with a semi truck, sort of.</span> <span id="s1005">When I found out that this man standing there, he said, "Hop on.</span> <span id="s1006">You can go with me."</span> <span id="s1007">And I hopped on, and we traveled to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1008">And he stopped on the way, and he went to eat.</span> <span id="s1009">I didn't want to tell him I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s1010">We drove all the way to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1011">He never thought of giving me piece of bread, but I reached Lódz.</span> <span id="s1012">And when I went to the house that we lived in before, the Polish superintendent who took care of the building reacted with tremendous surprise; not elation, but surprise that I survived and came back.</span> <span id="s1013">And what for?</span> <span id="s1014">He said, "You don't even have to go to your place because the Germans emptied it.</span> <span id="s1015">They took the carpets and everything.</span> <span id="s1016">There's nothing left and other people live there."</span> <span id="s1017">I said, "Maybe something is left.</span> <span id="s1018">I want to go up."</span> <span id="s1019">And I went up, and they wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s1020">So I went down again, and I asked him if other people came back.</span> <span id="s1021">He said, "No, nobody came back here."</span> <span id="s1022">But about three blocks away there was a place set up by the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s1023">He said, "You can go there."</span> <span id="s1024">And I went there and I found out the list of names didn't contain any of my relatives.</span> <span id="s1025">But there was name of my school friend who survived the war because she was in the group in ghetto that was in hiding.</span> <span id="s1026">There were two groups: one in the hospital in which I was, and one in hiding.</span> <span id="s1027">And she survived, so I went to her and I stayed with her for about ten days.</span> <span id="s1028">And I said, "There is no need for me to stay in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Nobody came back from my family.</span> <span id="s1030">Nobody wants me here.</span> <span id="s1031">This was my fatherland.</span> <span id="s1032">If they don't want me, I don't want them.</span> <span id="s1033">I'm going to go away."</span> <span id="s1034">At that time I already knew that there were displaced person camps, and my girlfriend, because she was in hiding and her husband, they were able to recover some things that belonged to her parents.</span> <span id="s1035">She gave me few Polish zlotys, which is our money, and two bottles -- when I think of it -- two bottles of Vodka.</span> <span id="s1036">She said, "This will be very valuable to you when you go through the border," which turned out to be true.</span> <span id="s1037">I met another girl who was in the same situation as I, and we decided we are going back to a displaced person camp and we would see from there on who will want us.</span> <span id="s1038">We reached City Poznan in Poland, which had a large station, and at the station, there were Russian soldiers sitting all along waiting for a transport.</span> <span id="s1039">Now, we had no money, but we had Vodka.</span> <span id="s1040">So we were walking around very frightened of Russians after the experiences I had, very frightened.</span> <span id="s1041">And we said to ourselves, and I hope people forgive me this, "Let's look for a Jew.</span> <span id="s1042">A Jew will help us."</span> <span id="s1043">And we walked, and I said, "Do you think he looks Jewish?</span> <span id="s1044">What does Jew look like?"</span> <span id="s1045">And we spotted one man and we decided to risk it; this was a big officer in a long coat that was flowing behind him.</span> <span id="s1046">He had very prominent nose and he was very dark.</span> <span id="s1047">And I said, "Well, let's try it."</span> <span id="s1048">And we approached him, and he was a dentist in the Russian army, and he was most helpful to us.</span> <span id="s1049">We said, "We want to cross the border.</span> <span id="s1050">We have no money.</span> <span id="s1051">We want to go to Germany to the displaced person camp and see if the organizations will help us."</span> <span id="s1052">He took us to his car.</span> <span id="s1053">He took his dirty overcoat and covered us with it completely.</span> <span id="s1054">He hanged it up and covered us and he said, "Whatever happens, you be quiet."</span> <span id="s1055">And when the train started a couple of hours later and reached the border, we heard a lot of screaming.</span> <span id="s1056">The Russians were raping the German women.</span> <span id="s1057">We heard this, but we were safe underneath his coat sitting there.</span> <span id="s1058">We reached Berlin, I don't remember that frame of time.</span> <span id="s1059">I don't remember how long it took us, but we reached Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">And he said to us, "Don't go back east."</span> <span id="s1061">We got off, and here we are.</span> <span id="s1062">Where do we go?</span> <span id="s1063">We left the Vodka with him.</span> <span id="s1064">We were looking and looking and looking.</span> <span id="s1065">Finally, the evening is coming, and we are very frightened.</span> <span id="s1066">We saw two men -- I don't know, it must be the fifth sense that told us to approach these men and ask them where are places that concentrate the displaced people.</span> <span id="s1067">We have no money.</span> <span id="s1068">He put us on a streetcar.</span> <span id="s1069">He paid our fare, and they took us to a street -- I remember the street all the time.</span> <span id="s1070">I don't remember now.</span> <span id="s1071">We got off, they welcomed us.</span> <span id="s1072">They gave us two beds to sleep and food to eat, and we stayed there for a little while, about a month or two.</span> <span id="s1073">We found out about another place that was in a different part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1074">Berlin was being divided into sectors.</span> <span id="s1075">There was a Russian in which we were, English, French and American.</span> <span id="s1076">One day -- Erika was the name of the girl -- we decided to go to a movie.</span> <span id="s1077">We were all ready to act almost normally.</span> <span id="s1078">We went to a movie and that was a Russian movie in Russian sector.</span> <span id="s1079">We didn't understand too much, but we watched the movie.</span> <span id="s1080">So we whispered to each other in Polish, and all of a sudden the darkness -- this is one of the moments in my life, a big hand on my back.</span> <span id="s1081">I heard " ."</span> <span id="s1082">They took us out of the theater.</span> <span id="s1083">They accused us of being spies because we speak Polish.</span> <span id="s1084">We are spies, and they took us to a so-called Kommandantura where the Russian police was.</span> <span id="s1085">They opened a big gate, and they pushed us in.</span> <span id="s1086">And there was about 300 people standing there, and we joined the group.</span> <span id="s1087">This very day my friend, Erika, had a toothache and before the movie we went to a dentist who pulled her tooth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">03:20: The Jewish committee paid for it, and she had a toothache after they pulled the tooth and she started to cry.</span> <span id="s1089">Unbelievable what little things mean a lot in life.</span> <span id="s1090">She started to cry, and I stand with her.</span> <span id="s1091">"Erika, don't worry.</span> <span id="s1092">It will go away."</span> <span id="s1093">And she cries and she cries.</span> <span id="s1094">They got so nervous with us, so annoyed that they opened the gate and threw us out.</span> <span id="s1095">And this is what saved us, because the rest of the people were taken away.</span> <span id="s1096">Once we were out, the very next day, we crossed to the American sector and decided never to step in the Russian sector again.</span> <span id="s1097">But in Germany, you need papers.</span> <span id="s1098">We have no papers, and the Jewish Joint Relief Distribution was giving rations, and we had card.</span> <span id="s1099">So we went to the Jewish Joint Distribution, we got coffee.</span> <span id="s1100">Coffee was to Germans a God-send; they were crazy about coffee.</span> <span id="s1101">So we went with the coffee to a police department in the American sector and asked him to register us in American sector, which he did for the coffee.</span> <span id="s1102">I'm talking about this now.</span> <span id="s1103">This is ridiculous, but this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1104">This was another little moment that saved us, and we went to the displaced person camp in American sector, which was called Schlachtensee.</span> <span id="s1105">After a while, they gave us a room with a German lady.</span> <span id="s1106">We lived with a German lady.</span> <span id="s1107">Then one day, it was a Jewish holiday -- I don't remember which one -- and we went to the Chaplain, American Army Jewish Chaplain, and we went there and we feasted on something or other.</span> <span id="s1108">And he asked if we had any relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s1109">I said, "I know that my grandmother had a half-sister living in Detroit, but I don't know her name.</span> <span id="s1110">I know that the original name -- I know they changed the name.</span> <span id="s1111">The original name was Pozowsky (ph)."</span> <span id="s1112">He took my address.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn't hear from them for a while, and one day somebody came.</span> <span id="s1114">They found my family.</span> <span id="s1115">They had changed their name from Pozowsky to Sauls (ph), and my grandmother's half-sister was still alive.</span> <span id="s1116">And she said that if this is the last thing she can do, she wants to bring me to the United States.</span> <span id="s1117">So it took some doing.</span> <span id="s1118">One of them was attorney connected with Washington, and they secured my trip January 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">And I came on the ship called Marine Marlin, which took 17 days because we lost part of the boat in a tremendous storm, and everybody, including the crew, was deathly sick.</span> <span id="s1120">And we arrived finally in New York.</span> <span id="s1121">We were sitting on the benches with the name -- the letters A, B, C, and I was sitting under my letter which was F, Fischer.</span> <span id="s1122">And everybody was being picked up, and I was still sitting there.</span> <span id="s1123">Finally, when I was almost the last one, a gentleman with a picture was walking around with the picture.</span> <span id="s1124">And I looked at the picture, I said, "That's my grandmother."</span> <span id="s1125">Well, I couldn't speak English, and he couldn't speak any of my languages, but the picture was the common thread between us.</span> <span id="s1126">So he picked me up.</span> <span id="s1127">I had no luggage, very easy.</span> <span id="s1128">And he took me outside and I saw a gentleman there.</span> <span id="s1129">And when I saw him, an elderly gentleman, I said to myself, "This must be family," because he looked like my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1130">This was her half-brother.</span> <span id="s1131">She had a half-sister and a half-brother, and he lived in New Jersey, and he could speak some Polish and German yet.</span> <span id="s1132">He came here many, many years ago, and that was how I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: One thing, was the Russian dentist on the train with the big coat -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: -- was he a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1136">I knew the word Jew in Russian is Yivreh, and I said, Yivree," and he said, "Da," which means yes.</span> <span id="s1137">And he said in Polish he understood we want to go to Germania, Germany, to displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1138">"Da, da."</span> <span id="s1139">In the car, covered us with his coat.</span> <span id="s1140">The whole life of one person is like a necklace of beads.</span> <span id="s1141">Each bead represents a different story, and this was the most unusual because it was coincidence that we decided to look for somebody like that, that we found somebody like this.</span> <span id="s1142">That he was willing to help us, and that's how we came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1143">After all, we were helpless, we had no means of support or help or food or whatever.</span> <span id="s1144">It is very unusual now in a civilized way to think that you can survive under all kinds of circumstances, you really can.</span> <span id="s1145">And when I hear people complaining of very minor things, it is -- I always try to tell my family, but, of course, life goes on.</span> <span id="s1146">The little things become big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Now, let's go back to Lódz and the ghetto and the timing.</span> <span id="s1148">The ghetto was formed, but for a while your family lived outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Tell me about how long that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Well, the ghetto was formed -- they started to throw people out couple of months, I think, later, and it was closed on May 1st, that I remember.</span> <span id="s1152">May 1st, 1940, it was hermetically closed.</span> <span id="s1153">You could not leave anymore.</span> <span id="s1154">It was surrounded by the wires and the guards and the bridges were put up, and you couldn't leave anymore.</span> <span id="s1155">And I had one little cousin, my father's brother's son, he was an only child who decided he's not going to stay in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1156">He is going to get out, and he smuggled himself out.</span> <span id="s1157">Without the star, he looked very -- he had an Aryan look, very handsome young boy.</span> <span id="s1158">And he disappeared; we didn't hear about him until one day my aunt, his mother, received a postcard which stated in a printed way, "Your son, Nickoden (ph), died of pneumonia."</span> <span id="s1159">And it was sent from a city near the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1160">Evidently, he reached the border, and what happened then, I don't know if he was not permitted by the Swiss to cross, or if he was apprehended before; we have no way of knowing, but he was killed.</span> <span id="s1161">He was young.</span> <span id="s1162">He was strong; he did not have pneumonia; he was full of life.</span> <span id="s1163">He wanted to live, and he was killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: When the ghetto was sealed, was your family still outside?</span> <span id="s1165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Once it was sealed, we were all in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1168">And tell me about things you've witnessed in the ghetto about actions or other things that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: There were many actions in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1170">They were trying to get rid of people, older people, people who were unable to perform work in the establishments put to their use.</span> <span id="s1171">They were catching people on the street at random taking them to the camps.</span> <span id="s1172">I've seen a couple of them while I was working.</span> <span id="s1173">There was one that we knew beforehand because there were certain signs.</span> <span id="s1174">More troops were coming to the main parts.</span> <span id="s1175">We buried my grandmother once in bed, made the bed over her, and this succeeded twice.</span> <span id="s1176">But on the third time when we came home, she and my uncle were gone.</span> <span id="s1177">So, evidently, they discovered the ruse.</span> <span id="s1178">My uncle, I don't know how he was hidden, but they discovered it.</span> <span id="s1179">And at that point, one uncle died from starvation in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1180">The other stayed with grandmother at home.</span> <span id="s1181">And when my mother and I came from our work, they were gone.</span> <span id="s1182">The bed was thrown apart.</span> <span id="s1183">So we didn't witness how did they go to the room, but we knew what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: You and your mother, for a long time, were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1185">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">03:29:</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: And your mother had been being courted just -- A: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: And so whoever was courting her was not in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No.</span> <span id="s1190">He was a physician and he lived in Warsaw, and she was supposed to marry him.</span> <span id="s1191">And we were supposed to move to Warsaw, but the war interrupted it.</span> <span id="s1192">The private life ceasesd, the individual ceased.</span> <span id="s1193">We became a mass, a number, robotons, just performing tasks and the starvation took -- a lot of people died there, a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1194">Incidentally, the friend of mine who was so sick in ghetto that we gave some food to, all of us, a little bit of ours, she was taken away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1195">Her mother said, "I had one daughter.</span> <span id="s1196">Now, I have seven daughters," because the six of us were coming trying desperately to help, but it didn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Now, after you were deported and you were in the camp, I want you to tell me a little bit more about the everyday living conditions, the cold, the sanitation, sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: There was no sanitation.</span> <span id="s1199">We did not have latrines.</span> <span id="s1200">There were holes with wooden -- there was a wooden board with two holes, and since many of us were sick from whatever they gave us to eat, it was a constant walk to the latrines, to the holes.</span> <span id="s1201">There was tremendous degradation of human beings.</span> <span id="s1202">It was the human spirit suffered more than the physical spirit.</span> <span id="s1203">Our bodies didn't listen to us, didn't obey us.</span> <span id="s1204">We had -- as I mentioned before, we lost our menstruation very gratefully because we couldn't have taken care of this.</span> <span id="s1205">It was -- everybody knows it was the lack of food and vitamins.</span> <span id="s1206">We slept two, three to a wooden bunk.</span> <span id="s1207">The tiers in Ravensbrück was packed with human beings.</span> <span id="s1208">There was stench in the air, horrible stench, between the latrines and the bodies.</span> <span id="s1209">The one who was in charge had a special little room and special privileges and special food.</span> <span id="s1210">We the Jews never got close to it.</span> <span id="s1211">The Germans who -- and the Ukrainians were in charge.</span> <span id="s1212">One Ukrainian girl, in particular, was as beautiful as an angel with gorgeous blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1213">A Satan in human form.</span> <span id="s1214">A brutal Satan, looking angelic, brutalized us in every possible way.</span> <span id="s1215">The food that was distributed in Ravensbrück was -- we fought, we screamed.</span> <span id="s1216">They cut wrong portions.</span> <span id="s1217">We were deprived of every shred of civility.</span> <span id="s1218">People were fighting over everything, with exception of a few of us.</span> <span id="s1219">And the fear of the Germans, the German prisoners, was always ominous.</span> <span id="s1220">They were always over us.</span> <span id="s1221">With exception of some of us the Jewish girls and the Jehovah Witnesses, we still preserved some sort of civilized behavior.</span> <span id="s1222">The rest of it was unbelievable because they</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">03:37: survived the camp life from before the war.</span> <span id="s1224">They were in prisons first; then they went to the camps.</span> <span id="s1225">To survive in camps for that many years, you have to do things, all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s1226">You have to be brutal.</span> <span id="s1227">You have to have some sort of position there.</span> <span id="s1228">You have to bribe.</span> <span id="s1229">In that way we were very innocent.</span> <span id="s1230">We were completely unaware of anything when we first came there.</span> <span id="s1231">Our experience with the selection, we had to stand naked in front of the -- I don't know -- doctor or whatever.</span> <span id="s1232">You couldn't have a pimple on your body.</span> <span id="s1233">You had to be perfect for work, and then looking for the jewels, the vaginal experiments that -- it was -- the hell started right there.</span> <span id="s1234">We were stripped of every, every human trace of behavior.</span> <span id="s1235">The brutality, the killing, the siccing the dogs -- the dogs were sicced at the people.</span> <span id="s1236">They were ripping the people apart with the exception of me, I think.</span> <span id="s1237">And they had pleasure, the people liked to look at it.</span> <span id="s1238">The same people who lived a normal life outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s1239">They had two kinds of life, and they completely reconciled with it.</span> <span id="s1240">It was their work, and as they cleaned up in the war, they were assigned to it.</span> <span id="s1241">But they embellished their love of it.</span> <span id="s1242">They did it with pleasure.</span> <span id="s1243">They didn't have to sometimes to do things that they did, but it became a badge of honor.</span> <span id="s1244">Human beings reduced to beasts, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1245">To preserve sanity, to function after surviving this war, I don't think that we are 100 percent, but we try to pull on our reserves from our background, from our civilized way of living, from our teachings, our parents, and our teachers.</span> <span id="s1246">We try to create environment for us, ourselves, for our children, and we try to share our knowledge and forewarn future generations of the horror of what human beings are capable of.</span> <span id="s1247">That we must be on guard.</span> <span id="s1248">We must protect.</span> <span id="s1249">We must speak up.</span> <span id="s1250">Like Pastor Niemoeller said in his very famous speech, which I don't remember verbatim, but he said, "First, they came for the cripples, and I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1251">Then, they came for the Communists, and I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1252">Then, they came for the Catholics, I said" -- I don't remember completely.</span> <span id="s1253">"Then, they came for the Jews, and I said nothing because I was not one of them.</span> <span id="s1254">Then, they came for me, and there was nobody to speak up for me."</span> <span id="s1255">That's why we must have the red flag.</span> <span id="s1256">We must teach, we must educate, we must do the very least we can and we are capable of.</span> <span id="s1257">This is one of the reasons why I wanted so badly to come here and to speak up in my own little way to contribute from my past, from my knowledge, from my experience, from my broken down body.</span> <span id="s1258">To tell the people the horror, the tragedy, the Gehenna that we went through must never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: I think that I have covered everything that I had.</span> <span id="s1260">Do you have anything else that you want to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Well, I do hope that my message -- I don't know if it's going to be in the Archives, in Oral History Department or whatever, that it could be shared with people.</span> <span id="s1262">That I'm sure that many people before me said the same things, that they are being widely distributed.</span> <span id="s1263">I hope that in my own way I was able to impart and bare my soul and expose the horror that I was witness to and forewarn people and beg people to think and to pool their own resources.</span> <span id="s1264">To read, to see if there a movie of it.</span> <span id="s1265">Not be protected of themselves, like some people say, "I've seen enough of it.</span> <span id="s1266">I can't take it anymore."</span> <span id="s1267">I don't think it's right because once you see it, you're alerted.</span> <span id="s1268">It reinforces you.</span> <span id="s1269">It helps you.</span> <span id="s1270">That's why I feel that if one person can do something, it's important.</span> <span id="s1271">That's why Schindler was important because he was one.</span> <span id="s1272">His ideas maybe were different in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1273">Maybe he did this for personal gain, that's how he started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">But, eventually, he was the savior.</span> <span id="s1275">No matter what his motives were, he did save a group of people.</span> <span id="s1276">And these people multiplied, and they have future generations.</span> <span id="s1277">And they're grateful to him and his memory.</span> <span id="s1278">That's why individual counts.</span> <span id="s1279">That's my message.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1281">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
