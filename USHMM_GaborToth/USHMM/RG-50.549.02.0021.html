recording at Orchestra Hall in Chicago, which is my second home, being assistant concert master here for the last 44 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And you’re about to start the season, I guess, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And you just -- you just come back from a tour of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: We just came back from -- from a scenic tour of Europe and Friday is opening night.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: When -- this is jumping ahead some, actually, but since you mentioned you’ve just been in Europe, I imagine, with what you do in life, you go to Europe fairly often?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, it started in ‘71.</span> <span id="s25">Until then the Chicago symphony was an unknown, great orchestra.</span> <span id="s26">But ‘71 with Shorty, we went to Europe the first time and since then, several times to Europe and to Japan and Russia and Australia.</span> <span id="s27">We were all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So, you’ve been going back then for, you know, since the early 70’s, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: -- quarter of -- quarter of a century.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Quarter of a century, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What is it like to go back?</span> <span id="s33">Does it -- does it ever bring up memories of what happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s34">Do you ever -- have you ever been to, or near any of those places again?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: At ce -- at certain -- at certain times it happened, but generally speaking, not.</span> <span id="s36">But at one point, when we were in Hamburg, I went out to see the -- the place where the Caparkone wa -- bombing happened and since then there were some books written and there are -- there is a museum there and I didn’t feel at home too much when I went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s37">We went -- we were in Russia and then we went to Hungary and -- and Vienna, to play a concert each.</span> <span id="s38">It ba -- it brought back memories, but for some reason, I wasn’t too upset about what happened.</span> <span id="s39">But as concertmaster of the Berlin opera house since -- I mean from -- for ‘50 -- f -- ‘50 til ‘54.</span> <span id="s40">I took this as a rehabilitation -- kind of restitution, because I made it -- I play in a proba -- a -- a -- an audition and I ma -- got the job and I lived there for three years, almost four.</span> <span id="s41">And I made some very good friends.</span> <span id="s42">Not -- not all of them were -- were -- were avid Nazis.</span> <span id="s43">And they treated me very nicely, so I -- I didn’t have any bad feelings about being back to Euro -- to Germany, specifically, and Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So you feel like your time in -- in those years in Berlin right after the war, it was almost like there was a timeta --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yeah, it is --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Some sort of reconciliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: It was -- it was like that, I took it that way.</span> <span id="s48">Some -- some people couldn’t understand how can you live in Germany.</span> <span id="s49">But everybody is little different.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s51">You mentioned the Caparkone.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Ho-How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: C-a-p-a-r-c-o -- no, a-r-k-o-n-e.</span> <span id="s55">Caparkone.</span> <span id="s56">Well, in English it’s with a c, I think in Germany it was also the same way, the spelling of the -- of this ship.</span> <span id="s57">That was a 37,000 ton Hamburg - South America liner.</span> <span id="s58">And since then I discovered, by accident, that when the Germans made a f-film of the Titanic, in ‘41, they used this ship for the feeling of that -- of the Titanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: They made a movie about the Titanic?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: They made they -- they are the -- very famous movie, it was during the war time.</span> <span id="s61">And this is the -- the ship they used.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: We should mention -- I mean you go into description at some length in your interview with the Holocaust Museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: -- and also with the S-Shoah Foundation, you tell the story of being on the ship, it was a ship where they had taken thousands of prisoners, the Germans had put thousands of prisoners on these ships.</span> <span id="s65">It was right at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: There were three -- three big ship in the Bay of Lubec.</span> <span id="s67">And that’s the North Sea and what we found out afterwards, there was no fuel on the ships.</span> <span id="s68">So what they planned with us, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s69">M-Most likely, they wanted to do something to -- to get rid of all this per -- concentration camp prisoners, but the British took it into their hands on -- on May third.</span> <span id="s70">And they were on the ships in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s71">And there was about 7,000 who died and maybe 400 who -- who are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: The British bombed it --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Who were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: The British bombed it because everything was going -- going north.</span> <span id="s76">The -- the -- the Germans were evacuating and -- and sending all the troops further north and they thought that thasat -- these ships are transport ships for -- for German military.</span> <span id="s77">But what came out later -- what was found out, that the -- Bannerat, the -- the Swe-Swedish Bannerat -- the Swedish what?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: I think he -- he was called Count.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Count.</span> <span id="s80">Yes, Count Bannerat had a meeting with Himmler in -- in Lubec.</span> <span id="s81">That’s where they -- they shipped us in f-from.</span> <span id="s82">To the -- to the big ships.</span> <span id="s83">And he found out that there are sh -- pris-prisoners -- concen-concentration camp prisoners on these ships and by eight o’clock in the morning, the British got the mes-message that don’t bomb these ships because they are innocent survivors of -- of the concentration camps and the British supposedly said, “It’s too late.”</span> <span id="s84">And at 2:30 they bombed the ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: So, coincidences happened, nobody knows what happen -- really caused them.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: It’s still being investigated to this day, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: It sure is.</span> <span id="s89">There is a film that was made by a German young man who -- who happened to -- to be spending some vacation time at the North Sea, and he’s -- heard about that there is a -- a memorial for the Holocaust ma -- victims, 7,000 of them.</span> <span id="s90">And he started to dig in and -- and look -- look into it.</span> <span id="s91">And he found ca -- found out all kinds of details and he found a few survivors, including me.</span> <span id="s92">And he made a film at -- a documentary about it.</span> <span id="s93">Unfortunately, the film is not well known at all, because the English subtitles are not legible.</span> <span id="s94">Very -- they didn’t have enough money to -- to do the right subtitling.</span> <span id="s95">And that’s -- that’s where it is.</span> <span id="s96">It was played in -- I mean, it was shown in -- in Germany several ti -- several places, in France and in Holland.</span> <span id="s97">But, many people know about the Titanic, everybody knows about the Titanic.</span> <span id="s98">Nobody knows about the Caparkone and the Deutschland.</span> <span id="s99">And the Athena, there was three ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: And the vast majority of people on those ships died.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Right.</span> <span id="s102">There were only -- only about 400 all together that survived.</span> <span id="s103">And 7,000 are at -- known dead.</span> <span id="s104">So they -- they knew the numbers that -- that were shipped -- put -- put on the ships.</span> <span id="s105">So this film was done on a very si -- very low budget.</span> <span id="s106">This is a one man operation, basically.</span> <span id="s107">The guy is from Berlin and he was trying his best.</span> <span id="s108">But a -- without enough backing, is not going to be well-known anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Right.</span> <span id="s110">So you’re experience actually, on the -- you know, your quote unquote, “Day of Liberation” --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: -- consisted of diving off the side of this --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Of jumping into the -- into the cold sea and being lucky enough to be fished out by -- by some little boat that was around the ship and getting into the -- o-on land, when the British came in, that was a -- a -- barracks -- some kind of barracks when we -- we came on -- on shore and the British tanks were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the flags.</span> <span id="s114">And then we -- we had nothing.</span> <span id="s115">Basically zero.</span> <span id="s116">What we had on was wet and that -- that was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived.</span> <span id="s117">So the British went into different houses and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give these people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: When -- do you remember, when you were with the British and they were telling Germans to give you something to eat and to give you clothes, I guess, how were the Germans reacting to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, they -- they had no idea what’s going on.</span> <span id="s120">They only saw the -- the British come in and they didn’t know what were these wet -- wet people came from.</span> <span id="s121">They -- they saw some bombing maybe, but they didn’t know that those -- those -- the concentration camp prisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had anything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they were.</span> <span id="s122">Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards.</span> <span id="s123">But it was hairy.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Hairy?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Very hairy.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: In very many ways.</span> <span id="s128">You -- you didn’t know who you were talking to, whether it was a -- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who is now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident.</span> <span id="s129">Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s130">Then it was difficult to get -- get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified.</span> <span id="s131">But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer’s club.</span> <span id="s132">I didn’t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I -- I survived somehow and I played a little bit.</span> <span id="s133">Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same.</span> <span id="s134">But I had to make myself understood.</span> <span id="s135">And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in -- in Turkey.</span> <span id="s136">And I knew his address.</span> <span id="s137">I didn’t have a chance to send anything to Budapest, because I -- I didn’t know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly there was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that.</span> <span id="s138">But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive.</span> <span id="s139">So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest.</span> <span id="s140">Mayas -- with a Czech transport.</span> <span id="s141">There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians.</span> <span id="s142">But I -- I joined at that Czech transport and I got back somehow.</span> <span id="s143">On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of course.</span> <span id="s144">And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father.</span> <span id="s145">That’s where they -- they deported me from, originally.</span> <span id="s146">And so they were alive.</span> <span id="s147">And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra.</span> <span id="s148">They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position.</span> <span id="s149">And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult.</span> <span id="s150">There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing.</span> <span id="s151">Basically, it was terrible times.</span> <span id="s152">And it was basically Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s153">So, we went through all kinds of horror stories.</span> <span id="s154">But I played.</span> <span id="s155">I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left.</span> <span id="s156">Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et-etcetera.</span> <span id="s157">And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived.</span> <span id="s158">Because the world wasn’t open.</span> <span id="s159">In France, you couldn’t -- couldn’t get a job if you didn’t have nationality -- I mean, didn’t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn’t have the right kind of papers, you couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s160">So when I went back, I played an audition for the opera.</span> <span id="s161">They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the job.</span> <span id="s162">I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s163">Twas like -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same.</span> <span id="s164">And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in -- in Sweden.</span> <span id="s165">And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in Sweden.</span> <span id="s166">So I got the passport, I didn’t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition.</span> <span id="s167">And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah.</span> <span id="s168">And then I never went back, afterwards.</span> <span id="s169">I didn’t go back, I went out to Sweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years.</span> <span id="s170">Then there was an opening in Berlin and they wanted me to come.</span> <span id="s171">I played an audition again.</span> <span id="s172">I got the job and that’s when I started in the opera house.</span> <span id="s173">This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas.</span> <span id="s174">They had three in -- in Berlin -- in West Berlin and in East Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were famous.</span> <span id="s175">The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin.</span> <span id="s176">My opera, the Shtetisher oper was West Berlin.</span> <span id="s177">And I never went over to the east side, because I wasn’t interested in it.</span> <span id="s178">I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn’t interested.</span> <span id="s179">But that was an interesting life.</span> <span id="s180">West Berlin was -- was an island in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s181">And that was very good, until I got my American pa -- visa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa.</span> <span id="s182">And when I got it, I couldn’t say, “No, I don’t come, because I have a good job in Berlin.”</span> <span id="s183">So I came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Let me -- before we take up that part of the story, let me ask you a couple questions.</span> <span id="s185">I’m curious -- you know, you’re -- most -- most of the people that I’ve interviewed who survived the Holocaust, they have very vivid memories of their day of liberation.</span> <span id="s186">And usually it’s soldiers march into a camp or they’re -- they’re in hiding and they -- they see the Russians coming or the Americans coming or whatever and it’s a -- it’s a very distinctive experience.</span> <span id="s187">Now your day of liberation is actually being bombed, scrambling for --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Much more distinctive.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: -- scrambling for you life --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Just looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: -- tremendous -- tremendous chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s193">It was -- it was -- I was right in the middle of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s195">So my -- my question is -- do you know, or can you remember, when was -- you know, all these other interviews I’ve done, people say, “And th -- and then, when we went out and met the Russians, then we were liberated.”</span> <span id="s196">You know, they knew they were liberated.</span> <span id="s197">They -- people knew what their -- that their moment of liberation had come and I’m wondering, when was the time you ever felt that, given how crazy it was that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I -- I never really verbalized it, but I suppose it was the time when I saw the English soldiers cam -- coming in the -- in the tanks, into this Ubertshooter -- what is an Ubertshooter -- un -- submarine school, basically.</span> <span id="s199">It was in the submarine school where -- where the left side of the -- the harbor, that we hit land with these little boats that helped.</span> <span id="s200">Not too many.</span> <span id="s201">And at the same time, this Bri-British tanks were coming from the right and those British soldiers took down the Nazi flag that was still o-on -- on the flagpole.</span> <span id="s202">And I suppose that was the time that I was liberated, because now -- now I could speak English to the English soldiers.</span> <span id="s203">So that was -- that was the end of the war for me.</span> <span id="s204">I didn’t know it’s -- May three is -- is just a date.</span> <span id="s205">And now I know what it was, cause they were -- five more days they -- they went on with the war, but that was almost the ho -- the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: But even now, when you’re talking, you say, “When I saw them take down the flag, I suppose that was it.”</span> <span id="s207">Sounds like --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yeah, I suppose that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: -- y-you say you suppose that was it, sounds like at the time, it didn’t really strike you.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I didn’t -- no, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s211">I was wet and cold and I was worried.</span> <span id="s212">I really didn’t -- didn’t feel liberated, but that was it, cause I was liberated, basically.</span> <span id="s213">And I survived.</span> <span id="s214">The other 7,000 died.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did you ever have any discu -- I mean you s -- you s -- you spoke some English, so I believe in your other interviews, you mentioned that you were able to speak with the British about what had happened.</span> <span id="s216">Did you ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Nobody -- nobody really asked me what happened.</span> <span id="s218">They -- they just -- somehow they -- they must have known it from other people, too.</span> <span id="s219">I probably told them, I don’t remember exactly what -- what I told them, that we were on the ship and the ship was bombed, that -- and who we are.</span> <span id="s220">Maybe I did, but they -- they seem to have known that these are people who should be helped, these are not Nazis coming out of the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did you feel -- you know, the British saved you on the one hand, but had bombed you on the other hand.</span> <span id="s222">Did you feel grateful, resentful?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: After -- after the fact, I’ve -- I felt very resentful, but I was glad that it was over.</span> <span id="s224">It was over because of them.</span> <span id="s225">That was a big, big mistake that they made and nobody can explain how it happened.</span> <span id="s226">Nobody really could find out details.</span> <span id="s227">This guy who -- who made the film went all -- all the way to -- to the British command and --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: If you could move --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: -- he interviewed -- he interviewed some of the pilots -- no, that was in the Stern magazine, that was a -- a -- a serial that they had an interview with the pilots and they really did not have any inkling what they did.</span> <span id="s230">But then when they found out, it was -- they had regrets, too.</span> <span id="s231">So thousands -- thousands perished and a few hundred were survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Could you tell me a little more about what it was like when you went back to Budapest, where you were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: The war was over now, what was the city like, how did it feel to be there?</span> <span id="s235">How did you feel as a -- as a Jew, being back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It was very difficult for everybody, basically because -- because of the Russians.</span> <span id="s237">The Russians took as much as whatever could they -- could take out besides the -- the -- the -- the Nazis ruined Budapest with street fights.</span> <span id="s238">And I remember when -- when they deported me, first they took us -- that was night -- evening, raids during the day and during the evening, they put -- put together I don’t know how many hundreds of Jews into the big synagogue -- that’s the biggest in Europe, the hung -- the -- the Budapest synagogue, and that’s where we were -- we were kept and during the night, we heard de-demolition sounds.</span> <span id="s239">All but one bridge -- bridges were detonated and -- and there was no connection between Pest and Buda, other than one that they left.</span> <span id="s240">And that’s where we went over to the Buda side.</span> <span id="s241">In the morning --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Now, this is when -- when is this happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: And this is -- this is November four an -- ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So this is during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: During the war when -- when the -- the Hungarian Nazis took over the government and they rounded up all the Jews.</span> <span id="s246">Most of them into ghettos, but some of us were deported right away.</span> <span id="s247">And we walked to vie -- to Vienna under -- under guns.</span> <span id="s248">So that was coming back to -- to this place, to -- to Budapest, it was ruined by -- by the Germans and it was ruined by the Hungarian Nazis and then it was ruined by the Russians.</span> <span id="s249">So it was a pretty bad situation, but everybody tried to survive and there was no -- no difference between Jews, non-Jews.</span> <span id="s250">We -- we were musicians.</span> <span id="s251">We played in the orchestra and -- and there was craving for -- for some culture after awhile, but we played in this overcoats because there was no heat.</span> <span id="s252">So it was a very, very strange situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: But the Jewish community of Budapest had been devastated, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah, most of it, most of it.</span> <span id="s255">The only place where -- where there were some surviving Jews, was in Budapest, because of the ghetto situation and there was -- there were some -- some houses that were under Swedish and Swiss protection, supposedly.</span> <span id="s256">Well, they took me from a Swedish -- Swedish pro-protected house, too.</span> <span id="s257">But in general, Jews from the countryside were deported much earlier than -- than what happened to me, or us.</span> <span id="s258">And the surviving Hungarian Jews were all either in hiding or in -- in ghettos that were so-called liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What would -- what did it feel to -- like, to be walking down familiar streets in Budapest, where once, you know, you had family, friends and all this life in this community and what was it like then, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: We didn’t really know too much in the beginning, who survived, who didn’t survive?</span> <span id="s261">Who was around, who wasn’t around?</span> <span id="s262">It was a strange world all together.</span> <span id="s263">And I remember that a school -- school friend of mine, I didn’t see him again, not until just a few years ago, he was in -- in Chicago and he talked to me.</span> <span id="s264">I knew his father was in the same transport, walking to Vienna and then on the -- on the cattle car wizness going to -- being transported to Hamburg mayan gummer.</span> <span id="s265">And I saw him die in -- in the camp.</span> <span id="s266">He was in the same barracks where -- where I was.</span> <span id="s267">So, I didn’t see him when I came home, but I knew certain things.</span> <span id="s268">And I saw one of my friend from school, who became a -- a partisan in -- in -- in Russia, fighting on the side of the Russians, against the Germans.</span> <span id="s269">He came back with the Russians to Budapest and became a high positioned police officer, who was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were responsible for most of the atrocities that took place.</span> <span id="s270">So it was strange, it was a very strange world and -- and -- and I left it behind and came back to it.</span> <span id="s271">But by then it was a little better, where I was concertmaster in the opera house, but we still didn’t have peace.</span> <span id="s272">Not just peace, but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and very little -- very little food.</span> <span id="s273">The Russians took as much as was movable, they took.</span> <span id="s274">They -- they dismantled toilets in the hotels and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them, because most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem -- rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury.</span> <span id="s275">So they -- they got -- they went wild.</span> <span id="s276">They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had five, six watches on their arms.</span> <span id="s277">Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word.</span> <span id="s278">Give, give, whatever you can.</span> <span id="s279">And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and it was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk about it.</span> <span id="s280">Otherwise, I don’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s283">45 -- more then 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you feel that -- I mean, your life is a life of music, do you feel -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Francis Akos.</span> <span id="s286">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- talk about it.</span> <span id="s288">Otherwise, I don’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s291">45 -- more then 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Do you feel that -- I mean, your life is a life of music, do you feel that -- were you sort of mentally and emotionally, maybe even spiritually, sort of cu -- yo -- is so much of your life bound up with the music that -- do you think it was any help in surviving what you survived?</span> <span id="s293">And do you think it was a help after the war in taking your mind off what was going on all around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well, not that -- not in that vein, what you were just saying, the last sentence.</span> <span id="s295">It -- you just keep on living.</span> <span id="s296">But help, yes, because in the concentration camp, I survived because the -- the guy who was in -- in charge of my barracks -- for some reason, I don’t know why and how he -- he found out that I am playing the violin and -- and there was sudden-suddenly there was a violin.</span> <span id="s297">And every evening they were -- they were trying to -- to keep up their spirits and they were singing -- there were Polish people, German people, Hungarians, all mixture.</span> <span id="s298">And I was playing the violin for them and this guy liked it.</span> <span id="s299">So he really saved my life, basically, because there were transports going out of that camp to Bergen-Belsen and to Auschwitz and he always saved me.</span> <span id="s300">So that’s sh -- music helped me a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s302">Well, we should say that you tell that story in both of your video interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Actually at -- at greater length, so if anyone wants to --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: -- check them, they can just --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: It’s -- it’s -- it’s my story, so -- and that I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Later, when I was concertmaster in Berlin, somehow I connected with him -- either he connected with me or I connected with him, but then I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s310">So we are now back in America, ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: How -- let me ask you, you said it took eight years to --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: To get the visa, because of -- of the -- the what do you call it, quota system.</span> <span id="s313">Okay, a Hungarian, no matter where you -- I ask for my visa in Paris, but I was born in Budapest, so it went under a Hungarian quota and it took -- took six years until -- or s -- eight years until I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: When you first applied for the visa --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: This was soon aft -- not too --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: That was in ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Why did you want to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Because America was -- was everybody’s -- in everybody’s mind, that was the place where to -- where to escape, where to go.</span> <span id="s320">A free country and -- and you -- you get what you -- what you deserve as far as, you know, your -- your knowledge, your talent, whatever.</span> <span id="s321">And that was well-known before the war, during the war, after the war.</span> <span id="s322">America was the place where to go.</span> <span id="s323">Many people went to Canada, many people went to Australia.</span> <span id="s324">Sweden wasn’t bad either, but I -- I didn’t feel like I belonged to Sweden, because it was so even.</span> <span id="s325">Everybody had everything, basically and no big difference between ups and downs.</span> <span id="s326">The -- the best and not -- not -- and the worst.</span> <span id="s327">It was very much in equilibrium.</span> <span id="s328">I -- somehow I didn’t feel -- when I went this German -- the Berlin position was offered to me, that I should come and play -- audition -- audition, I didn’t hesitate.</span> <span id="s329">I could have stayed in -- in Sweden and become a -- a satisfied, even keeled person.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: But that -- so, Sweden was -- well, it sounds like you’re saying Sweden was a little boring?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, it -- you can -- you can say that somehow, yes, but there are some Swedes who are not boring, either.</span> <span id="s332">But I was too young for -- for settling down for good -- good life, in general.</span> <span id="s333">I had a good job and it was very nice, but it wasn’t exciting enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: By the time your visa was coming through --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: -- after -- eight years after you applied to come to America, did you still really want to come to America or did you have some thoughts of maybe you were settling in in -- in other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Well, I was concertmaster in Berlin, I didn’t want to go anywhere else, but I had an offer from Swede -- Switzerland, also.</span> <span id="s338">I p-played -- played a solo in [indecipherable] with the -- with the orchestra there and they wanted me to come from Berlin to -- to Switzerland, but th-then the American visa came and it was really difficult to say no, because that was, you know, originally the idea, to come to America, now here is a visa.</span> <span id="s339">I couldn’t say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Where -- when and where did you finally come over to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I came over in January, ‘54.</span> <span id="s342">And the previous summer, I was concert -- I was one of the members of the Casals Festival Orchestra, that has several concertmasters from -- from America and from other places, from Canada.</span> <span id="s343">And I made friends with -- with a few and they told me it will be very difficult.</span> <span id="s344">First of all, you have to become a member of the union before you even can -- can play an audition.</span> <span id="s345">And then you have to settle for what -- what’s -- what’s available.</span> <span id="s346">So it wasn’t an -- an open book.</span> <span id="s347">So I came over, I had to stay in New York, I was staying in New York for awhile.</span> <span id="s348">And I couldn’t play an audition for the opening for the following years, but I was offered a -- a position that was not a union position.</span> <span id="s349">The Aspen School of Music, the Aspen Festival was av-available for me and that’s where I we-went during the summer, which wasn’t a bad summer, to spend the first summer in -- in America in Aspen, which was very nice.</span> <span id="s350">And then I had to fly back to -- to New York to get my union card and then I played an audition and made it into the Minneapolis Symphony, as leader of the second violins.</span> <span id="s351">And that lasted one year.</span> <span id="s352">I mean it would -- could have lasted longer, but I wasn’t -- wasn’t satisfied, I -- I wasn’t happy with just being third or fourth member of the -- of the hierarchy in the violins.</span> <span id="s353">And there was an opening in -- in Chicago.</span> <span id="s354">I played the audition in Chicago and got the job and moved to Chicago.</span> <span id="s355">That was ‘55.</span> <span id="s356">And I stayed, got married, have two daughters and I am here now for -- assistant concertmaster for 44 seasons, which is long time with one orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What is your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Phyllis.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Phyllis?</span> <span id="s360">And your daughter’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Daughter are Katie, or Kate, as -- as she likes to be called and Judy.</span> <span id="s362">And Judy has two little ones, Justin is 11, well 10, basically and Melissa is eight.</span> <span id="s363">And I am a proud gra-grandfather.</span> <span id="s364">Phyllis has three daughters, they are older.</span> <span id="s365">My -- my -- my older daughter is 40 and her older d -- older daughter is a little more than 40, I think 42.</span> <span id="s366">She has three lovely ladies and I have two, so we are f -- a family of five girls and her oldest daughter has two sons, so we have three grandsons and one granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Did you meet your wife over here, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah, over here, yeah.</span> <span id="s369">She is from Chicago.</span> <span id="s370">And she graduated as a piano major in -- at Northwestern.</span> <span id="s371">So music brought us together, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Do you ever talk with your -- or years ago, did you talk with your daughters about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s373">Have you ever talked to your grandchildren about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes, s-s-slowly and -- and a little bit.</span> <span id="s375">Not -- not much.</span> <span id="s376">But my daughters know most of it and they -- they know the -- the tapes -- the -- the interviews that I made, it probably gives them more than what I gave them before.</span> <span id="s377">And with the grandchildren, not -- not yet.</span> <span id="s378">Not yet, but after awhile I’m sure they -- they will find out.</span> <span id="s379">It’s very difficult to, you know, to just give them one part and not the whole story and the whole story is too long and too difficult to understand and -- so I’m -- I never really sat down, now you look, you -- you listen, okay?</span> <span id="s380">I didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Would they -- was it more that they had to ask you something to -- for it to become a subject of discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Not really, I -- it was no subject, but I think now that they are old enough to -- to understand, at least partially, what -- what I can tell them.</span> <span id="s383">I -- I s -- really thought -- the other day I just -- I was just thinking I will sit down with the older ones together and -- and talk -- tell them a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: These are your grandchildren you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah, these are grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What about years ago, though, in your house, with your daughters?</span> <span id="s387">Did you talk about it much with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: There was a time when we -- we belonged to -- to a Temple and there I -- then I was talking to them a little bit, because I was still -- I was asked to talk to the class to -- you know, Sunday school.</span> <span id="s389">And I told them a little bit, very little.</span> <span id="s390">It’s very difficult to -- to make them understand.</span> <span id="s391">When they go to the Holocaust Museum, they will understand much more than the -- what I -- I can give them, I think.</span> <span id="s392">But this is a wonderful thing that -- that interview business, that they are going to try to -- to make the next and the next generation understand what -- what it is and what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What about you, yourself?</span> <span id="s394">Would you -- your own preferences, just going all -- along in life, with your family, whatever, is it something that you prefer not to dwell on?</span> <span id="s395">Is it something that you don’t think about that often any more?</span> <span id="s396">Is it something that y -- that is with you a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, I -- I have met people who think about it all the time and who talk about it all the time and I wasn’t that way.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t know, it’s -- it’s my nature, probably.</span> <span id="s399">I got over it.</span> <span id="s400">Somehow I -- I probably got hurt by it, but I didn’t dwell on it for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s401">Then -- then I became more interested in it when -- when it became -- I think mostly with -- with the interview, with the Holocaust Museum interview, that I should remember it more and -- and talk about it more.</span> <span id="s402">The first time this Caparkone story came out, a friend of mine from London sent me a clipping from -- from the Times that was kind of a description of the Stan magazine’s articles that came out every week, as a serial, about the Caparkone.</span> <span id="s403">So, the only -- only reason I knew about it, because he send me a Time mag -- and then I -- I started buying the Stan magazine issues.</span> <span id="s404">And that’s how it all s-started, really.</span> <span id="s405">And then I -- I knew about the -- the man who -- who wrote the book a little bit, who -- who wrote the -- the articles, the serial in the Stan Magazine, he also put it in a boo-book form and I got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s406">And then later I sent them some -- sent him some material that I had, like the -- the first identification card that I got from the British [indecipherable] in Noistat and other stuff.</span> <span id="s407">Then we -- we became friendly, because he -- he looked me up when I was in Hamburg with the symphony.</span> <span id="s408">And he took me back to the memorial that -- that’s on the beach in Noistat, over the Lubec Bay.</span> <span id="s409">And so I got into more -- more and more to discuss, to talk about it, to -- to think about it.</span> <span id="s410">But I am not -- not upset any more.</span> <span id="s411">I was -- it was a long time ago and I survived, that was the main -- that -- that’s my main feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What about when things happen, like you know, in the 70’s there was -- I believe it was in the 70’s, there was a series on American television about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s413">When a movie like “Schindler’s List” --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: -- comes out, do you watch those things?</span> <span id="s416">Do you avoid them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well, I went -- I went to see “Schindler’s List” and I was very -- very much taken by it, because it was very close to what I understoo -- what I -- what I experienced.</span> <span id="s418">So yes, I do -- I do see it [indecipherable] lot, the last -- what was it, the six days of -- the invasion.</span> <span id="s419">“The Longest Day” was a film and -- and things like that, yes, I do see it.</span> <span id="s420">I do -- I do remember a lot, but I -- I wasn’t going to see the “Titanic”, it -- I don’t -- I don’t care much for the -- for the story, because I have my own story and -- and it was -- with all the love story that w-went with it and all that, I -- I really wasn’t interested in it.</span> <span id="s421">It’s bad enough that it happened, but to me that’s not entertainment.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s423">You had your own version of the Titanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s425">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Are there -- have there been, during your -- you’ve been here 40 -- 40 -- what, 41 years, I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: In ‘55, yeah 43 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: 43 years here.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: 53 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Wait, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: 40, oh now, fif -- 43 years, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: 43 years here at the symphony, are there members of the symphony now, or during the time you’ve been here, have there been other members who were also survivors of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, I think so.</span> <span id="s434">Well, there’s one -- one Hungarian colleague of mine who is -- who is here, who -- who hasn’t been in concentration camp, but he was in -- in -- in -- d-drafted in the Hungarian army just like I was.</span> <span id="s435">And he is a survivor, because he was around, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s436">And I don’t know too many.</span> <span id="s437">We have -- we have several who were not born in this country, but I don’t -- don’t know of anybody who is -- or the -- the guy who is a Czech.</span> <span id="s438">He -- he came out after the war, so he survived the -- the war.</span> <span id="s439">But he is not Jewish, so it’s not the same category.</span> <span id="s440">I don’t -- I don’t know of any other.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s442">When you were with the academies in Europe after the war -- I mean, you were concertmaster or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Were there -- were there ever any -- what was it like being Jewish in that setting?</span> <span id="s445">Were there ever any problems, did it ever come up?</span> <span id="s446">Was it just not an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, it was -- it was just not an issue.</span> <span id="s448">It -- it was too much of an issue before and during the war.</span> <span id="s449">See, before the war, when I -- I was in the academy as a student and we had a competition and I won the competition as the best student of -- of the first year of -- of the course, of academy.</span> <span id="s450">And -- and they had some bad demonstrations before and during.</span> <span id="s451">After that, I was coming down with the violin that -- that I just won, who -- where the director of the academy handed it to me and as I was coming down the st -- the steps, some of them were screaming about the girl who didn’t win, that was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s452">They said, “Never mind, you have your violin in your hand, but she is the winner anyway.”</span> <span id="s453">S-Stuff like that, there was -- there was numerous clauses that was a -- the 10 percent what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Quota system in the universities and the academies counted as university.</span> <span id="s456">But I was in before -- before the -- became worse.</span> <span id="s457">And at the end there was no-nobody who was Jewish who -- who could play publicly.</span> <span id="s458">We had to play concerts in the private homes.</span> <span id="s459">This is during and -- during the war -- before, during the war, basically.</span> <span id="s460">Because the war started in 1939 and ended in ‘45, so it was six years and in -- during that time, I finished the academy and got my -- my diplomas, etcetera.</span> <span id="s461">There was no -- no anti-Semit -- open anti-Semitism after the war, basically, because there were too many Jewish people who -- some -- some survivors basically, but the -- on -- on -- in positions, because they came in with the Russians or the Russians put them in, so as I -- as I mentioned, this friend of mine, who became a -- a high -- high official officer of -- of the Hungarian -- well, it’s police - sickel -- sickel police, whatever it was, I don’t know exactly, but there were many of those who were put in.</span> <span id="s462">So no open anti-Semitism e-existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: In the camp, you said, in a way, you know, being able to play the violin saved your life.</span> <span id="s464">I’m wondering if there is any way -- but then you went through long periods where, I guess you didn’t have the opportunity to play at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: I’m wondering if -- what do you think the whole experience, did it have -- do you think it had any affect on your musical development in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Well, it might have, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s468">A-All I know is that I had -- had to practice a lot to make up for all the time that I didn’t see a violin, when I came back to -- to Budapest after -- after the war.</span> <span id="s469">And it -- it took quite a while to get back to normalcy.</span> <span id="s470">I don’t know if -- if the development had -- had anything to do with -- with the experience.</span> <span id="s471">I mean, yo -- yo -- my -- my musical development -- I was pretty well developed, I think, because I wasn’t a youngster any more when I came back.</span> <span id="s472">It might have had some influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Maybe, but you’re not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s475">No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s477">You know, there’s always that -- that thought that gets raised often when people talk about the Holocaust and they talk about the Germans and it’s -- it’s sort of this notion of, you know, the Germans, you know, a people with such a high culture, with such, you know -- you know, wonderful things to their culture, such amazing music and how could -- how could a people capable of all that, also be capable of the monstrosities of the Holocaust, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Better minds than I couldn’t answer this question.</span> <span id="s479">It was the most organized disorganized kind of life.</span> <span id="s480">When I tell you that they -- they took transports -- th-the camp -- Neuengamme was basically a -- a transit camp.</span> <span id="s481">They had -- I got sick when I -- in -- I think two or three weeks into -- into the camp life, I got -- I think pneumonia and they -- they put me in the hospital barracks, that they had a hel -- hospital barracks, where they took care of you with m -- with medication and then from the hospital barracks, they took them to Bergen-Belsen, on the transport, to -- to put them in -- in gas chambers, so if that can explain anything, it’s organized disorganization, it’s impossible to -- to -- to get an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: I-It’s not a question you dwell on very often, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, no, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s484">That “Schindler’s List” shows you basically what -- what went on behind this -- behind this scenes of -- of themselves.</span> <span id="s485">So the -- the officers and -- and some of those people who -- Schindler himself was -- was a Nazi, basically, to begin with.</span> <span id="s486">That’s -- some -- some -- some of them had better human feelings than -- than others.</span> <span id="s487">No, it was -- it was something that -- that nobody can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Is there any piece of music that makes -- brings up any memories or -- or recalls anything to you, in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Not -- not really, I -- I don’t -- I don’t think there is any specific piece, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Nothing you associate with those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: None.</span> <span id="s492">No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s493">The times I -- I associate with this -- is probably my -- my youth, when I -- when I learned certain pieces and then later the -- when I played them again.</span> <span id="s494">But has very little connotation.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What about -- you mentioned in the camp where this guy gave you --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: -- a violin and that saved your life and you played folk songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I played folk songs.</span> <span id="s499">I don’t know what I played and how I played them.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Do you remember them any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s502">They were singing and I was trying to -- to emulate what I heard.</span> <span id="s503">But there was -- you know, lots of Polish non-Jews in that camp -- in that barracks where I was and Austrians and Germans and Czechs and Hungarian -- very few Hungarians, by the way.</span> <span id="s504">And it wasn’t a -- a -- a Jewish barracks at -- at all, it was all mixed.</span> <span id="s505">And so we had blackouts, because the bombers were going over Hamburg, to Berlin and Leipzig and all the other places that they were bombing.</span> <span id="s506">This was right in the middle of the last winter of -- of the war.</span> <span id="s507">And so the blackouts, th-they turned off the lights and there was nothing else to do, either -- either you -- you -- you were sleeping or you were singing.</span> <span id="s508">Yeah, it was a strange, strange world, but I was lucky that -- I don’t know how I would have survived, probably never -- I wouldn’t have survived.</span> <span id="s509">But th-this -- playing helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Have you ever in any of your trips to Europe, gone to some of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, my wife went -- went to Dachau when we were in Munich and she was very, very touched and impressed by that and -- and she will never forget it.</span> <span id="s512">And, as I told you, I went -- went out with -- with this guy to -- to the memorial -- to the memorial at -- in Nice-Nicestadt, which is in Lubec Bay.</span> <span id="s513">And I went out to see the old camp once when I was in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Neuen-Neuengamme, my camp.</span> <span id="s516">And that is just a -- a big obelisk and -- and names of all the countries that were represented by -- by pro -- prisoners and how many from -- from which country.</span> <span id="s517">I didn’t see any of the -- the -- I saw an interesting thing when I was in -- we were in Brussels and we took a -- took a sightseeing bus with my wife.</span> <span id="s518">And next to the highway, the -- the driver slowed down and he said, “This is the place where they kept the Jews before they were sent to -- to Germany, and this is Belgium.”</span> <span id="s519">So that’s -- that’s the other place that I have seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s521">What was it like -- I guess, so you went back to your camp, but the -- the camp itself really wasn’t there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: It wasn’t there, no, it wasn’t there at -- many, many, many years later, it was just a -- the mem-memorial to the camp and s -- fields, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s524">And you haven’t felt any desire to see any of the other ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Because I know what it is like, or what was -- what it was like.</span> <span id="s528">There were barracks everywhere, but what was interesting that -- that we saw in Paris, there is a -- a memorial to the -- to the French -- it doesn’t say Jews.</span> <span id="s529">It -- it is behind the Notterdam, sunk in the -- in the ground.</span> <span id="s530">You ge -- go down many, many steps and the sign outside says, “To the memory of deportees” and then the number, hundred some thousand.</span> <span id="s531">And you go in, downstairs, underground, there is lights and every German concentration camps name, because there’s a lot of French Jews who were in different camps.</span> <span id="s532">But it has nothing to do with Jews, it -- they don’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s533">And so that’s -- you can cut this out if you want to.</span> <span id="s534">It -- that -- that’s another place where -- where we saw a memorial.</span> <span id="s535">It’s -- it’s a very touching scene because it’s underground, it’s like a cellar and it’s like bars and lights, little lights.</span> <span id="s536">And Yad Vashem, of course, we saw Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s537">That’s -- when we were in Israel we went to see Yad Vashem and that’s the first time my wife saw the name written, Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s538">So it -- it wasn’t fictitious, it was real for her, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: After the war, did you ever think about going to Israel?</span> <span id="s540">Moving to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: No.</span> <span id="s542">No, for some reason, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s543">I was brought up -- we were never really -- really religious.</span> <span id="s544">We were Jewish and that meant all the troubles that came with being Jewish, but -- and we went to -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents only went to -- to high holidays.</span> <span id="s545">And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn’t brought up religious.</span> <span id="s546">So that was one of -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Francis Akos.</span> <span id="s548">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents only went to -- to high holidays.</span> <span id="s550">And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn’t brought up religious.</span> <span id="s551">So that was one of the reasons, probably, that I never sort of go into Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah, I have to mention -- I have to mention that my wife was always much more Jewish than I was.</span> <span id="s554">I mean, in her life.</span> <span id="s555">And she went to -- to -- after school -- she went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s556">She know -- she knows how to read and write Yiddish, so she’s much more into Judaism than I was.</span> <span id="s557">But she enjoyed it when she went -- went -- after school, she went to this school and she enjoyed it and she still knows how to write and read.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: How to talk -- how to speak Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: I’m not sure if this is covered in any of the other interviews, but what -- what eventually happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Oh my -- my father was deported, but my mother somehow got -- got him out.</span> <span id="s562">They were in a -- in a open air, giant -- not a stadium, but it -- it’s a -- the factory kind of thing.</span> <span id="s563">And my mother got him out, he -- he was sick, too.</span> <span id="s564">And they survived in the apartment where -- where we lived.</span> <span id="s565">And my father died in the end of the revolution in ‘56.</span> <span id="s566">And I brought my mother out in ‘57.</span> <span id="s567">I paid -- paid in for -- for those wonderful Russians who -- who were doing this humanitarian deed, to bring people out of Hungary, into Austria, across that little bridge that was ma -- named in one of those books, for good money -- good do -- good dollars they got f-for their humanitarian act.</span> <span id="s568">And she came out here and she died here.</span> <span id="s569">She was 94 and a half and she died.</span> <span id="s570">And that was about six years ex -- I think it’s six years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: You mention your father died in ‘56, during the uprising, was it -- did it have something --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: -- to do with the uprising, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No, no, no, no, no, just -- it was very difficult times, but they couldn’t get a doctor and they couldn’t go anywhere and it was very bad.</span> <span id="s575">Now, unfortunately, when I went -- when I was back in -- in Hungary -- in Hungary, I didn’t have a chance to even look for where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Wh-What were the names of your father and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Carway, which means Charles in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s578">And my mother was Rosa.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s580">Okay.</span> <span id="s581">I think that -- that’s about it for any questions I have.</span> <span id="s582">Is there anything that we haven’t touched on that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, I -- I think I brought up everything, but even if you didn’t ask, I brought it up.</span> <span id="s584">I think it was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Okay, well then, thanks for taking the time out to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: [indecipherable] I guess you have a rehearsal soon, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No, I -- I -- not today.</span> <span id="s589">I have to go home, because I have a rehearsal in the evening here.</span> <span id="s590">Oh, Highland Park Strings, I didn’t mention.</span> <span id="s591">I am conducting the Highland Park Strings, which is basically an amateur music lovers group and this is our 20th season starting.</span> <span id="s592">I’m going to start the rehearsal today -- tonight.</span> <span id="s593">20 seasons we have been playing string music and we have been going to -- we were -- we were once in Italy for a few concerts and we are supposed to be going to Israel this December.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: And that group again, is called?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: That group is called the Highland Park Strings and it’s a nice group of people and I’m having all kinds of soloists with -- with them and we have always -- mostly -- five concerts a -- a season.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Okay, well thanks again for taking the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Good.</span> <span id="s598">I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: This
