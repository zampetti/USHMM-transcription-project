as we say in Jewish, Poinyavich.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Poinyavich.</span> <span id="s37">So how come you were born in Kovno?</span> <span id="s38">Cause it’s pretty far.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, it’s about a few hours by train, but I think they had a better hospital in Kovno and the story goes that my father wanted to be sure that nothing goes wrong, so he took his wife, my

business, or did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, it was his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: It was his -- but was it in the family before, or had -- did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I think he -- my father started that business.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So did you grow up with these animals, the geese and the ducks?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh yes, we had many geese and ducks and I remember when he shipped them to Germany and there will be a parade of ducks and geese through the streets of Poinyavich from the assembly point to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Tied up all the traffic.</span> <span id="s62">Wasn’t much traffic, but whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did your mother work in this business also?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And what did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: My mother was very much involved with my father, she would take care of paying the mercha -- the merchants or whatever.</span> <span id="s67">And she was also involved in managing my grandfather’s wholesale grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And that was her father?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: That was her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s71">And did your grandpa and grandma live in that little si -- town?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, it wasn't such a little town --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I -- wasn’t so little --</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: -- it was about 23,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, and there were about 7,000 Jews in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: And there were a number of [indecipherable] in the town, and there was a Hebrew high school in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So -- so one -- it was not so little.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: It was not so little.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did your father’s gram -- mother and father also live in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: My mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: No, your father’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: -- father and mother.</span> <span id="s86">So, was this a very close family?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We’re a very close family.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Were you well off?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: My father was relatively well off, you know?</span> <span id="s90">It’s -- it’s by comparison.</span> <span id="s91">He -- as a matter of fact, he -- he was a director of the Lithuanian National Ba-Bank.</span> <span id="s92">He was very involved with the Lithuanian government in exporting all the flax and flax seed and so forth.</span> <span id="s93">And he spent a lot of time in Kovno where the government --</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: -- functioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Were you close with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I was close to my father obviously.</span> <span id="s98">I can’t even think of not being close to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So tell me what that was like.</span> <span id="s100">Did you do a lot of things together, did you eat dinner together and have long conversations, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, first the -- my father’s business was such that the end of the day, the people would come to the ha -- to our home to get paid for the merchandise that they delivered.</span> <span id="s102">And so I was involved in meeting all these people and listening to all these stories, and I was also familiar with the various telegrams that my father would get from over -- from Latvia, from England or Belgium, where offers were being made for ma -- for flax or whatever, and I would be involved with converting it from their currencies, to our currency, which was the lit, l-i-t.</span> <span id="s103">And I was involved with my father in analyzing the flax seed, because flax seed is sold based upon the percentage of good seeds, less any defective ones or less any other things which got into the -- the seeds.</span> <span id="s104">So that you would have to analyze it and determine what percentage is flax seed.</span> <span id="s105">And you would have to weigh them, and you would have to pick out all the defective ones.</span> <span id="s106">So I have enjoyed it, and I have been involved with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So at what age did you start working with him and being involved in the business with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, the business, as I said, was always conducted from the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: So, from my childhood days, seven, eight, whatever, I had the opportunity to observe him in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What was he like?</span> <span id="s112">What kind of a guy was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: How do you remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I remember him as a very respected citizen of the city.</span> <span id="s116">He was a Orthodox, but not that Orthodox that he wouldn’t occasionally break the laws.</span> <span id="s117">He traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s118">He was very good in business, and he was very respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did he play with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s123">Occasionally, maybe once or twice, he would accompany me to a soccer game, but it was not that kind of a relationship in Lithuania at the time between parents and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s125">And what about your mother, what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: My mother was a very warm and a very caring person, and she helped my father in the business.</span> <span id="s127">And she also made sure that my father’s family, for instance, would have sufficient money to make a Shabbat and she would go out and buy for them and bring it to their homes.</span> <span id="s128">She was a -- you know, a very wonderful person.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did she play with you, or was this not a relationship parents had with kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: It was not that kind of relationship where parents played with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did you ea --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: You played primarily with your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: You did not play with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Did your mother cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Oh yes, my mother cooked, but we had servants in the house that did the heavy work.</span> <span id="s137">And -- but my mother cooked and my mother baked.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: And is -- was -- did you have a favorite food?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Did I have a fav -- yeah, oh sure, a lot of the food.</span> <span id="s140">I remember the tzimmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: -- on a Friday night.</span> <span id="s143">And I me -- I remember the cholent on Saturday, and you had to go to the baker and bring it, about 12 o’clock.</span> <span id="s144">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: We have a phone, so we’re going to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s146">Are we ready?</span> <span id="s147">Are we back?</span> <span id="s148">Okay.</span> <span id="s149">So was your family religious?</span> <span id="s150">When you -- you said that there was in some sense we -- you were religious, tell us --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Well yes, my family was religious, my mother kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s152">I recall going to shul with my father every Friday night, and every Saturday morning, and obviously every holiday.</span> <span id="s153">We celebrated all the holidays and my grandfather was very religious and he spent most of his time studying in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And this was your father’s father, or your mother’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: My mother’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I don’t remember -- I’m -- ma -- whether my father’s father was also studying, but I remember he had a long beard, and I would have assumed that he would have observed the kashrut laws and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Now you said your father did not obey all the laws, that he wasn’t -- what did you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, there were occasions in his business, which would require him to travel maybe on a Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s161">And he would do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: And he would do that because he had no choice --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: -- a -- in order to get home on whatever, that he would sort of overlook that particular commandment.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s166">What -- what kind of a house or apartment -- I don’t know what you had, did you have a -- a house that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We had an apartment and it was a two story building and we lived on the second floor and we were one of the few apartments that had running water, it had a toilet inside the apartment and it had a shower and a bathtub inside the apartment.</span> <span id="s168">And as a result, many of the relatives would come to the apartment to take a bath or a shower, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And what sort of a neighborhood?</span> <span id="s170">Was it primarily a Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, it was primarily a Jewish neighborhood out of the -- as a -- I don’t know whether I mentioned it, the pa -- total population of that city was approximately 20,000 or 22,000, there were approximately 7,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s172">So the Jews were primarily the merchants in town as well as the craftsmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s174">When you went to school, did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, you really had -- didn’t have much of a choice whether you liked it or not.</span> <span id="s176">You just went to school, I’m -- I attended a Hebrew gymnasium where all the subjects were taught in modern Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s179">So that for instance, if I had to translate Latin, I would translate Latin into Hebrew and vice versa.</span> <span id="s180">And math, sciences and whatever, physics, chemistry were all taught in modern Hebrew, like they do teach them today in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Was that unusual in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, there were several schools like that.</span> <span id="s183">There was one school in our town and there was another school in Kovno, and there was another school I know in Shaul -- Shaulenay --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: -- which is another city.</span> <span id="s186">And -- and then there were [indecipherable] where many of the religious young Jewish boys attended.</span> <span id="s187">They even built a school for the girls called Gavna, where the girls could attend a modern Hebrew high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did -- did you learn modern Hebrew before you went to school, or you learned it when you started school?</span> <span id="s189">This -- you started at --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I presume -- I presume -- I’m trying to think back.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: I guess I learned it in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And you started in the school as -- in kindergarten, is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: In kindergarten --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And school had -- you would spend t -- in order to graduate, I guess you would spend 12 years in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s198">So I know that you had to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: But did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Certain subjects I loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: So what did you love?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I loved math, I loved science.</span> <span id="s204">I -- I loved history.</span> <span id="s205">The subjects that I didn’t like were languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: You didn’t like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So that school had to be tough on you because you had to translate everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s210">Right, and I had to study Latin and I had to study Lithuanian and German, and fortunately for me, I failed Lithuanian and Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You failed?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Now why was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: It was a failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And I failed Lithuanian and Latin because basically Latin, you have to spend a lot of time studying and memorizing.</span> <span id="s217">And I used to play a lot of soccer with my friends and studying languages was not exactly my forte.</span> <span id="s218">So as a result, I failed Lithuanian and Latin.</span> <span id="s219">And people would ask me, well how could you fail Lithuanian when you lived in Lithuania?</span> <span id="s220">I said, it’s very simple.</span> <span id="s221">To me Lithuanian was like a foreign language because at home we spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: In school we spoke Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: The only time I would have occasion to speak Lithuanian, if I went to some kind of government office, whether it’s a bank, or a post office.</span> <span id="s226">But otherwise I really didn’t have much occasion to speak Lithuanian, so Lithuanian was like another foreign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So you didn’t have fr-friends outside of the Jewish community then, so the kids you were with spoke -- did you speak Yiddish with the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: All the kids that I associated with attended the Hebrew gymnasium, which I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So what did you speak together, Hebrew, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Either Hebrew or Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So you were good at soccer?</span> <span id="s232">You liked it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Oh, soccer I liked a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s235">Did you play every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s238">Were you on a team?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes, I was on the Maccabee team.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: And as a matter of fact I remember traveling to Kovno and some other cities, where we played soccer against they -- their teams.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And you would play against the other Hebrew school teams, I gather, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So, the World Cup is a big deal to you, I suppose [indecipherable] right?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: A very big deal, I been watching it.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I enjoyed it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I sometimes feel when I’m watching it like I’m ready to push or pull or run.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s251">Tell me, you said it was lucky that you failed Lithuanian and --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: -- Latin.</span> <span id="s254">Why was that lucky?</span> <span id="s255">Didn’t they do something to you if you failed?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s257">As a result of my failure of Lithuanian and Latin, I was left back in grade for a whole year.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Which grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: It was -- I was then probably 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: So it must have been like sixth grade, and as a result I went to school with kids that were a year younger than I was.</span> <span id="s262">Well, the disgrace, the humiliation of going to school with kids who are a year younger than you are, was so devastating that I wanted to run away from home.</span> <span id="s263">But when you’re 16 years old, where you going to run?</span> <span id="s264">So I remembered that a couple years prior to that, my mother’s brother, my uncle, visited his family, and he came from New York, and he stayed in my mother’s apartment.</span> <span id="s265">And when he saw the housekeeper bring to my bed in the morning and in the evening, warm milk and cookies, he said to my mother, you are ruining that boy, he’ll never amount to anything.</span> <span id="s266">You better send him with me to u -- to the United States.</span> <span id="s267">So now that I wanted to run away from home because of the humiliation of being left back in school, what do I do?</span> <span id="s268">I write my uncle.</span> <span id="s269">Now, I didn’t think at the time that I would be able to get a visa as quickly as I did, but my uncle got busy and prepared the necessary affidavits, and he send them through HIAS to Kovno, and one day I got a call from HIAS Kovno that they received the affidavits and the papers, and that the American counsel would like to see me.</span> <span id="s270">Well, I went to Kovno to meet the American counsel.</span> <span id="s271">And as you recall there was a depression in the United States in 1936 and the American counsel had like 17 visas to grant for the whole country.</span> <span id="s272">But when he saw my application, he figured I am not going to be a burden on the state because I have an uncle who is going to take care of me, I’m not going to take anybody else’s job.</span> <span id="s273">So he grants me the visa immediately.</span> <span id="s274">Now frankly, I wasn’t ready to go that soon.</span> <span id="s275">But having put my uncle to all the trouble of preparing all the necessary affidavits and -- and all my friends knew that I had wa -- a visa to the United State.</span> <span id="s276">It is -- it wasn't feasible for me to back out at that particular point in time.</span> <span id="s277">So I came to the United States and fortunately, I survived.</span> <span id="s278">If I had not failed Lithuanian and Latin, and if I didn’t run away from Lithuania, I might have been one of the six million.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: And that’s why I said to you I was very lucky that I failed Lithuanian and Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: What did -- did you tell your mother and father that you were writing to your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: And did they say why are you doing this, were they upset?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Well, my mother was supportive.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Because it was her brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: My father wasn’t exactly enamored with the idea, but my father was a businessman who traveled a lot, and he -- his attitude was, you go, you don’t like it, you come back.</span> <span id="s289">We’ll come to visit you, whatever.</span> <span id="s290">So it was not like a [indecipherable] thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: It was like, you go to take advantage of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s294">But let me go back before we leave Lithuania.</span> <span id="s295">You have a brother, Chaim.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: And how much younger is he than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: He is six years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Six?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So that’s a big --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: -- difference.</span> <span id="s304">So he’s born in 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Were you close with him, or was the difference so big that --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: We to -- the difference was so big, and I had my own friends and he had his own friends.</span> <span id="s308">So that we were together, but -- and we would go away on vacations together, but because of the difference in age, I gravitated to my age group and he did --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: To his.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: -- to his age group.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s312">Hm.</span> <span id="s313">Where did you go on vacations, before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Well, I must admit that I went on my vacations to a place called Palangin, which is on the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s315">It’s a beautiful resort, and we would stay in what they used to call in those days, a pensionne, which means you would get a room and you would get three meals a day.</span> <span id="s316">And so my pa -- in some years my parents rented a house in Palangin, and so we stayed in the house and brought a housekeeper and so forth and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And you liked it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I loved it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, it -- it was going to the beach every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: It was in the -- it had magnificent trees adjoining the beach, pine trees, which is very unusual.</span> <span id="s323">And the path was lined with pine needles.</span> <span id="s324">And in the afternoon at four o’clock there would be an orchestra playing in the park.</span> <span id="s325">It was a very nice life.</span> <span id="s326">As a matter of fact there were, just before I came to the United States, I spent my last summer in Palangin.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: With your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: With my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s330">I think we’ll stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: I understand that you had another language, you spoke Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: How did that hap -- how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Well, because my nurse was Russian, and so probably the first language that I have learned was Russian and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s337">Russian from the nurse and Yiddish from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Do you still speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I still speak Russian.</span> <span id="s340">I can understand Russian and can my -- can make myself understood in Russian.</span> <span id="s341">I-I don’t speak a perfect Russian, but I manage to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: So did you speak Russian all through your childhood, as well as Yiddish and Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s344">I mean, you ha -- because we might have had a Russian housekeeper, so I would have occasion to speak Russian to her.</span> <span id="s345">I would have occasion maybe to hear Russian spoken in the house while my mother may be speaking to somebody Russian.</span> <span id="s346">How my mother used to love to read books, and wa -- a lot of the books were in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Now, how come your mother spoke Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Because my mother was born in the former Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: And so she spoke Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Did your father understand Russian as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s353">Ye -- most of -- most of the people in Europe speak a number of languages.</span> <span id="s354">As a matter of fact, besides Russian, I even spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s355">But it’s not unusual for the Europeans to speak a number of languages.</span> <span id="s356">I recall when I came to the United States at -- at the age 16, well, I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Hebrew, I spoke Russian, German, Lithuanian, studied Latin and failed.</span> <span id="s357">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You studied Lithuanian and failed also.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: But you still could speak it some?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s362">Actually, the reason I failed Lithuanian is because I didn't memorize a poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: And the funniest part is, during the oral examination, they ask me to recite that poem, well I didn't remember.</span> <span id="s365">But now, what is it, 70 years later, I remember the poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s368">As a matter of fact, I can recite part of it.</span> <span id="s369">[recites poem in Lithuanian].</span> <span id="s370">So that was one of the poems which I failed when I was tested orally.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: So how come you remember it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Because it left such an impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What is the poem about?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: This is the king of Lithuania calling his army together.</span> <span id="s375">And he tells them about the sounds of fire, and [indecipherable] and th -- and they should [indecipherable] themselves for battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: How many poems did you have to learn, that you failed?</span> <span id="s377">I hate to mention --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Well, thi -- this is the one I failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And a -- but I don’t remember how many others you had to memorize.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: You mean only one poem and you failed?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: One full poem, I must have failed in my written test as well, I -- I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I don’t remember that any more.</span> <span id="s385">Whatever it is, it was a lucky --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: -- event in my life that I failed --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: -- Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: I understand you -- you must have had a number of friends because you played soccer and you were playing around.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Did you have one special friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Well, as a matter of fact, one of my close friends, we went to school together in Lithuania, came to the United States in 1939.</span> <span id="s394">And we have remained good friends since, always, and he lives in Boston, and he has a place in Palm Beach, so during the winter we always have an opportunity to get together and reminisce about the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s396">And what’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: His name is Sam Sheldon, S-h-e-l-d-o-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: But that wasn’t his name then.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No, it was Shmukla.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Shmukla.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were living in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s404">There were always fights between some of the Lithuanian boys and the Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s405">However, since we associated mostly with our own, we have not experienced that much anti-Semitism, so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s407">When -- when you are 13, Hitler takes over in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Do you discuss this, do you hear people talking about what it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Oh yes, we discussed it, we ma -- heard -- we listened to the radio, we listened to his pronouncements.</span> <span id="s411">And we were concerned about it, but not really concerned enough so that you would want to run away.</span> <span id="s412">Nobody really imagined that the Holocaust would take place.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: And besides, my father was very -- he had a successful -- in business, and was dealing with the Lithuanian government and he thought, probably at the time that nothing terrible is going to happen to him because they need him.</span> <span id="s415">The -- the country wouldn’t function without him.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well, I don’t have to tell you that after the war broke out, the Russians came in to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s418">They confiscated my bu -- my father’s business, his accounts, his warehouses, and in addition they told him that he owes them taxes for prior years.</span> <span id="s419">And I recall receiving a letter from my parents that they need some money to pay for taxes, otherwise I presume they would go to jail or whatever.</span> <span id="s420">And so they requested that I pay, I think it’s -- probably was like 2000 dollars to an individual in the United States, and he would arrange with his connections [indecipherable] family whatever, to pay them in rubles or whatever, so that it would settle with the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And you had this money?</span> <span id="s422">Or was this from your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I borrowed the money from my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: From your uncle.</span> <span id="s425">Let -- let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s426">You leave Lithuania in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And how do you leave?</span> <span id="s429">Where -- where do you leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I leave from Poinyavich.</span> <span id="s431">From Poinyavich we went to Kovno by train.</span> <span id="s432">And in Kovno we left by a direct express train tha -- to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: To Paris.</span> <span id="s434">Now when you say we, who is we?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s436">There was a distant relative, my aunt’s husband’s brother, who was visiting his parents, and he was going back to America, and so they -- my parents arranged that we would travel together.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: So we went, the two of us, to Paris, and the reason we went to Paris is because my mother’s sister lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s439">And so we stayed in Paris for about a week, or thereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Was that the first time you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">The first time I was in Paris, that was in 1936, and then we went to Le Havre where we took a ship called the Paris, to the United States.</span> <span id="s443">And it may sound unreal, but I traveled first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s446">And now you wonder, how did I travel first class?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Okay, how did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, there was a depression, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: And so there weren’t too many people that could afford to go first class.</span> <span id="s451">So the first class cabins were sort of empty, and the ship decided to put a number of us in a first class cabin, maybe like six or eight of us.</span> <span id="s452">And so I came to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: First class.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: -- first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: The Statue of Liberty, yes, I remember s-seeing the Statue of Liberty because we landed in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: So we bypassed the Statue of Liberty and we landed, I guess it was either in the 40’s or the 50’s on the West Side.</span> <span id="s461">And there was my two uncles in the pier, meeting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Wait a minute, two uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You had -- two brothers of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I had -- two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: -- of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: The uncle that brought me over --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: -- and his younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: And so I came and I stayed for the first week or two with my uncle, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: His name was Aleck Leitman, A-l-e-c-k, and his last name was Leitman, L-e-i-t-m-a-n.</span> <span id="s476">And he was rather successful.</span> <span id="s477">He had a wholesale army and navy store and he was buying surplus equipment from the government and refurbishing it and selling it in his store in New York.</span> <span id="s478">And so I stayed with my uncle, who had a very nice apartment on 82nd Street and Riverside Drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And my -- he had a -- he had a very American wife, who made sure that you mind your manners at the dining room table.</span> <span id="s481">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were you not used to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well, not the way she expected to.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Was she -- she was tough?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: She was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I mean, you’d pick up the fork the right way, you transferred the -- the knife the right way, it -- you know, by the time you got finished you didn’t enjoy the dinner so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So you had to eat the way an American would, not the way the Europeans would, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Right, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: -- so you had to switch --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Exactly, switch the hi -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: -- the knife and the fork, yes?</span> <span id="s493">Tell me something, was it very difficult for you to leave?</span> <span id="s494">Even though you said it was not going to necessarily be forever, how difficult was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: It -- all I can tell you is, when I got on the train in Kovno, I cried all my way --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: -- to Paris, practically.</span> <span id="s498">I remember how scared I was when we crossed the German border and we had to get off the train and they showed them our passports, and our money and whatever, and how they screamed at us, and how they treated us, and I couldn’t wait to get back on the train.</span> <span id="s499">We then stopped -- the train stopped in Berlin I remember, and we had breakfast at the railroad station in Berlin.</span> <span id="s500">And again, I couldn’t wait to get back on the train and to continue our journey to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: And what do you think you were afraid of then?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Well, because we were ce-certainly aware of the Gestapo in those days.</span> <span id="s503">We were aware of the -- the German solution.</span> <span id="s504">Nobody believed it, but we knew what it proclaimed.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Do you think your unc -- did you talk about this with your uncle?</span> <span id="s506">Was he as afraid as y -- as you were, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, my uncle was in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I was in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: So I really had no occasion to talk to my uncle about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: You didn’t have a common language between the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Well, my uncle and I spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: So we could converse.</span> <span id="s516">As a matter of fact, I was very close to my uncle and my uncle was very, very good to me.</span> <span id="s517">And because my uncle was spending so much time with me that his wife resented it.</span> <span id="s518">And one day she told me that her sister from Baltimore is coming and that she needs the room, and that I will have to find another place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: You were 16 - 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: 16 years old.</span> <span id="s521">And so I had to find another place to live, so the first thing we did is I went to the 92nd Street Y. And they didn’t have any rooms available at the time, so they suggested that there is a family that’s looking for a border, and they have a room, and we went to see them, and we arranged to -- that I would stay with them in their -- in that room, and three meals a day, and my uncle was paying 40 dollars a month for that room and board.</span> <span id="s522">And in addition he gave me an allowance of three and a half dollars a week, which I had to use for subway fare, lunches, personal things and whatever.</span> <span id="s523">But you know what?</span> <span id="s524">We managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s526">But that must have been very tough on you because you hadn’t been here that long.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: It was very tough, as a matter of fact, I -- I would -- when I went into the subway I was overwhelmed because of all the trains, express, local, uptown, downtown, and I would go from my ru -- from my place where I lived, to school.</span> <span id="s528">I was enrolled in a high school in New York, at the Seward Park High School, which was on the east side.</span> <span id="s529">And the reason I was enrolled in that school is because my uncle’s bookkeeper had a sister that was teaching in that school, so my uncle said to his bookkeeper, you got to enroll him in school so she enrolled me in the school where her sister was teaching.</span> <span id="s530">So that was Seward Park High School.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: But did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Did I speak English?</span> <span id="s533">No, I did not spe -- I -- I ne -- knew a few words --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: But I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s536">So it was very difficult and very scary, but you go through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Were you lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I was very lonely.</span> <span id="s539">As a matter of fact, I must tell you, there was a time that I was considering going back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s540">But I didn't go back because I would have been admitting that I’m a failure again.</span> <span id="s541">Here I am in the United States where the streets are lined with gold, and I am the felda that had to come back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s542">So, is -- no matter how difficult it was, you -- you have to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: So when did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I graduated at the age of 18.</span> <span id="s545">When I went to school they gave me credit for a number of the courses which I took in Lithuania, and which I didn’t have to repeat here, like math and sciences, which I excelled in.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: And so I had to concentrate primarily on English and American history and so forth.</span> <span id="s548">So the first term, for instance, I would take English one and two, the second term I took English three and four.</span> <span id="s549">The second year I took English five and six, and the final year -- final term, I took English seven, I skipped eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s552">And I got an 85, I think on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: On the regents?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: On the regents.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: No Lithuanian, right?</span> <span id="s556">No Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: No Lithuanian, I didn’t have to study Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s559">Did they draft you when you turned 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did the American government draft you?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, I went into service in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: 1942.</span> <span id="s564">So what did you do between ’38 --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait -- not 1942, it was actually 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay, so for a good part of the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: -- your parents and your brother and all your relatives, or most of them were in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: You’re writing to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Soon as the war broke out --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: They -- there’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: -- the mail stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So this i -- are you talking about 1941, or you talking about -- between 1939 and --</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I’m -- be -- be -- between ’41 --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Right, and ’44, there’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: -- and ’44, no communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s579">But between 1939 and 1941, you are able to write, when they’re under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s581">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So this must have been very scary for you.</span> <span id="s583">I mean, you don’t even have contact now.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: That is true, but neither did anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Yeah, but that doesn’t necessarily help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No, it doesn’t help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: But you had to face the times.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s590">Now are you seeing your uncle?</span> <span id="s591">Does your aunt relent a little bit so you get to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Oh, I ca -- I was in business with my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Oh, so explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, I -- as a matter of fact, I continued to work for my uncle, and -- in his business, and as a matter of fact, I think in 1940 he made me a partner in that -- in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s597">He gave me a 25 percent interest in the business, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: And you’re 20 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: 20 years old.</span> <span id="s600">At that time I lived already at the 92nd Street Y, because by that time I was able to get a room at the 92nd -- second Street Y. And I was relatively happy because I had an opportunity to associate with a lot of young men my age, and we were exposed at the Y to the arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We had -- were able to attend concerts, performances by famous violinists and pianists and whatever.</span> <span id="s603">And it was a fairly nice life.</span> <span id="s604">As a matter of fact, in 1941, I bought my first car.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: What’d you buy?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I bought a Chrysler fluid drive., a bu -- brand new Chrysler fluid drive.</span> <span id="s609">Why did I buy a Chrysler fluid drive?</span> <span id="s610">Because I never drove a car with a shift.</span> <span id="s611">And the -- and the Chrysler fluid drive didn’t require shifting, you just put it in gear once and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Had you driven before?</span> <span id="s613">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Actually, when I bought the car, I didn’t have a driver’s license.</span> <span id="s615">Never -- but I had somebody who was working for my uncle drive with me and I took some driving lessons and I -- I must admit another failure.</span> <span id="s616">I failed the driving test the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I had to take it a second time, which I passed.</span> <span id="s619">It was really funny, you get -- you have a car and you don’t have a driver’s license.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Where did you keep the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: In a garage next to the 92nd Street Y.</span> <span id="s624">As a matter of fact, you know Mr. Haberman who writes a column in the New York Times?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: He interviewed me at the time, and he said, well how much rent did you pay at the Y?</span> <span id="s627">I said five dollars a week.</span> <span id="s628">And where did you garage the car?</span> <span id="s629">I said down the street.</span> <span id="s630">And how much did you pay for the garage?</span> <span id="s631">And I said 25 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s632">He says, you paid five dollars a week for a room, 25 dollars a month for garaging your car?</span> <span id="s633">But, as a matter of fact, I then moved to a residential hotel on the west side, I think it was on 84th Street, between Amsterdam -- no, near the Riverside Drive.</span> <span id="s634">And that was -- I had beautiful accommodations, yeah.</span> <span id="s635">It was a studio with a kitchenette which was closed in with doors.</span> <span id="s636">Beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s637">Had a restaurant in the buil -- in the building, and had an indoor swimming pool.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: So by that time I was already rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s641">What were you doing as a partner?</span> <span id="s642">What was your role?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, at that time we were engaged in manufacturing for the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: For the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: For the United States government.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: And it was my job to, when we got requests from the government to bid on certain items, to break down the drawings and specifications and prepare a bill of materials, estimate the labor and then submit a bid to the government.</span> <span id="s648">So that was primarily my job, and because I was pretty good in math and sciences, and [indecipherable] material and so forth, I was able to calculate and to price it out.</span> <span id="s649">And we were at a -- very successful in that business.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And what were you actually doing for the government once you --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Well, we were making various items for the government.</span> <span id="s652">One of the first contracts -- I remember getting a big contract, was for helmet lines.</span> <span id="s653">It was an aluminum frame covered with calfskin leather which would fit into the helmet.</span> <span id="s654">I remember making sleeping bags.</span> <span id="s655">That’s a funny story, Phyllis always tells me about it -- reminds me about it.</span> <span id="s656">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Well, you know something, let’s -- let’s go to the next tape, cause I have the feeling it’s going to go on for a bit longer, so let’s stop this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s661">We’ll -- we’ll talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, one of the f-first contracts that we got was to manufacture sleeping bags for the air force.</span> <span id="s663">Now that sleeping bag was filled with down.</span> <span id="s664">I didn’t even know what the word down was.</span> <span id="s665">And so I had to prepare a bid and calculate the cost of the materials, and I start calling around to find out about the price of down, and where do you get that?</span> <span id="s666">Well, basically you had the Yellow Pages, and you open up the Yellow Page, and you look f -- f -- under down for manufacturers on down, and we had to utilize a hundred percent down.</span> <span id="s667">When I called the suppliers and I ask them for hundred percent down, they said there is no such thing as hundred percent down.</span> <span id="s668">Hundred percent down contains probably 10 percent little feathers.</span> <span id="s669">Well, I said my specification calls for a hundred percent down, I can’t use little feathers.</span> <span id="s670">Well, they said, you’re not going to find anybody that makes hundred percent down, per se.</span> <span id="s671">And so anyhow, I was able to get a price on -- be so-called hundred percent down and we submitted a bid to the government and we got the contract.</span> <span id="s672">And it was one of the first contracts where I got myself familiarized with the term down.</span> <span id="s673">But there were many other contracts which we received at the time.</span> <span id="s674">We made bandoliers, where the soldiers kept their shells or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Is that like a belt?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s677">We made firemen’s clothing from an aluminized asbestos cloth which would enable the firemen to go in and rescue say, a pilot under 2,000 degree temperature.</span> <span id="s678">We made the helmet, we made the gloves, we made the -- a jacket and trousers.</span> <span id="s679">We made parachute drop equipment.</span> <span id="s680">We made targets, tow targets.</span> <span id="s681">So the tow targets were made, some were wound tow targets which were made from cloth, and other tow targets were made from sort of a mesh material.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What’s a tow target, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Tow targets, well, in order for the pilots to practice --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: -- gunnery in a plane, they need a target --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: -- to fire.</span> <span id="s688">So there is one plane that has attached to it, a target --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: -- which they towed behind the plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Oh, a tow tar -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: A tow target.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: And so that the other pilots or whatever, fighters, would aim their bullets into that particular target.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: And that when they fired the bullet in that target, it would leave a mark --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- in the tow target, so they would know which pilot, or whatever, registered on the target --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: -- and so forth.</span> <span id="s701">So we made tow targets.</span> <span id="s702">We made many things which the government needed at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: So were you a kind of middle person and contracted out, or did he have a factory that did all --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: We had a factory that made it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: We made it ourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: We were our own contractors.</span> <span id="s709">So we started with the raw material, and we sold the finished item, and we had, you know, government inspectors at -- on the premises --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: -- at all times to make sure that we meet the government specifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: And that was another challenge because when you deal with the government, there is no right way, there is no wrong way, it’s only the army way.</span> <span id="s714">And when they tell you you -- you s -- sew it with 10 stitches per inch, it better be 10 stitches per inch.</span> <span id="s715">Nine will not do, 11 will not do, it better be 10.</span> <span id="s716">And so that you had to follow explicitly the government specifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: And that was a challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s720">Now let me ask you something, cause it strikes me that you -- I don’t know if you feel somewhat schizophrenic in the United States when you’re 20 and 21, but when the war happens, and your family is over there, and you’re here relatively safe, that must be really hard for you.</span> <span id="s721">You’re reading newspapers, you’re hearing the news on the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Well, you know, you hear the news and you never heard really of the atrocities which were committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: At least that is my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So during --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: We knew there was a problems, we knew it was difficult, but we never imagined that there were concentration camps, we never imagined that there were gas chambers and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: And we -- I didn’t know, for instance, that my mother was killed practically the day that the Germans marched into Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: With the Einsatzgrup, I guess, you -- you think she was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Oh, not only do I think, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: You know she was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: What happened is that -- and it -- actually I’m -- I’m ashamed to say it, it was the Lithuanians that gathered the entire population of this Jews of the city Poinyavich, marched them to the suburbs, made them dig trenches and machine gunned the entire 7,000, men, women, children, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s733">And what is so i-interesting is that the Germans kept meticulous records of the destruction of the Jewish people, and that episode of the killing of the Jews in Lithuania, appears among the papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: -- of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: And where is your father, and now your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: My brother -- my mother the -- realized the situation in Poinyavich was rather hazardous, so she sent my brother to Kovno to tell my father not to come back.</span> <span id="s738">So my brother went to Kovno to tell my father what the situation is, and that my mother said don’t come back.</span> <span id="s739">And what happened is that my brother, and my father, who were in Kovno, were placed in the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s740">And they stayed in the Kovno ghetto I think about a year and a half or two years.</span> <span id="s741">They were then transferred to Dachau, and it was in Dachau that my father died, really from starvation, because whatever meager rations he received, he gave to my brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: -- so that he should survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: And when do you find all this out, if during the war you don’t know anything?</span> <span id="s745">Is it long after the war, right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Well, right after the war I remember seeing a list of survivors which was published by the American Red Cross, and my father’s name appeared there as being killed in Dachau, and it also appeared that my brother survived.</span> <span id="s747">And then I heard from other people, relatives and whatnot, that my brother survived, and he is in Europe.</span> <span id="s748">It seems that my brother tried to get in touch with me, but he didn’t have the right address because since that -- since he had the address when I left home, we moved and so forth.</span> <span id="s749">And I never received any mail from him.</span> <span id="s750">And he was in -- I guess in a camp, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You mean when he was in the DP camp afterwards, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: In -- yes, right.</span> <span id="s753">S-So my brother wasn’t exactly sure what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s754">So he went back to Poinyavich to look for my mother.</span> <span id="s755">And, you know, at that time the former Soviet Union was in charge of Lithuania, the Iron Curtain came down, so you were able to get into Lithuania, but you couldn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So he’s stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Stuck.</span> <span id="s758">By the time I was able to establish contact with my brother, he was married, he had a child, a wife, in-laws, and it was not feasible to smuggle him out from Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: So what year is this when you -- when you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: That was -- well, the end of the war was 1945, and he got married at the end of ’45.</span> <span id="s763">I think the child was born in ’46, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it seems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went through a third party.</span> <span id="s764">He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the United States, a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very good job in Poinyavich right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a capitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and his father was a capitalist.</span> <span id="s765">So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the United States.</span> <span id="s766">However, in subsequent years, I sent him packages.</span> <span id="s767">Again, not directly to him, but through a third party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or sell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise.</span> <span id="s768">So with the help of the packages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man, spoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which I couldn’t do, he was able to do very well.</span> <span id="s769">And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and it’s surrounding.</span> <span id="s770">Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could trade and help people in many ways.</span> <span id="s771">The story goes, supposedly, I don’t know whether it’s true or not, but when the president of Lithuania, the prime minister had a birthday party and he needed vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these supplies.</span> <span id="s772">So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their hotels which -- which were built to cater to foreign dignitaries.</span> <span id="s773">So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian -- to Czechoslovakia, to some of the other Russian countries, whatever, and learn how to run a -- an outs -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries.</span> <span id="s774">And he had a fairly good life.</span> <span id="s775">The first time I actually met -- saw my brother since I left home in 1936 was in 1988.</span> <span id="s776">That’s 52 years later.</span> <span id="s777">And I met my brother in Israel.</span> <span id="s778">It seems that a Maccabee team from Lithuania came to Israel to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in Lithuania, and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to Israel for the soccer games.</span> <span id="s779">And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: It was very difficult to say the leas -- the least, but you know, he -- he is a very outgoing person, very -- very able, and he -- if I say so myself, he adored me, because I am his source of survival.</span> <span id="s782">And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to Israel, because he had such a good job in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s783">He had a car, he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything.</span> <span id="s784">And here he has to give it all up and move to Israel where his children don’t speak the language, where -- well, he spoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school, but it’s starting a whole new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: So I had to promise him that I will get him a condominium for him, a condominium for his daughter, for his son.</span> <span id="s787">I will get them cars, and I will make sure that they will be able to live in relative comfort in Israel.</span> <span id="s788">And it was only after these promises that he has agreed to move to Israel.</span> <span id="s789">So in 1989, I think, he moved to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Did you want him to move to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Really, I don’t think he would have been as happy in the United States as he was in Israel.</span> <span id="s792">First of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to Israel.</span> <span id="s793">So a lot of his friends came --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s796">It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to acclimate to a life in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And they were allowed to leave in ’89?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: They were allowed to leave Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: To leave Lithuania, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: That was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Well, what is this like?</span> <span id="s804">You left, you were 16, he was 10, and when you see him, he’s in his 60’s, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: And it -- it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: -- y-you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: It’s a huge --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: It -- it -- it’s a huge -- you know, I sometimes wonder, really what do we have in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: And what we have in common is basically our parents and our Jewish tradition, and my responsibility since my father was killed, that I had to take over and provide for the family.</span> <span id="s812">But we didn’t have this close relationship that normally brothers have.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: We lived in different worlds.</span> <span id="s815">I lived in the United States, and he lived in Russia.</span> <span id="s816">We were both very comfortable, he in Russia and I in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s818">But he also was in the ghetto, which had to have been a very difficult experience with -- with your father.</span> <span id="s819">Did he talk about that with you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the ghetto, or his life in Dachau.</span> <span id="s821">He did tell me about Dachau that when the Americans were nearing Dachau that the Germans decided to vacate the camp, and they decided to march them east.</span> <span id="s822">And he tells me the story that while they were marching in the -- through the woods, and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was exhausted, and he tells me that he couldn’t take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to fall to the ground, and whatever it is, it is.</span> <span id="s823">And he tells me the story about this German soldier that came across him and said to his friend, don’t waste a bullet on him, he is dead.</span> <span id="s824">And so they passed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever.</span> <span id="s825">And they came across a farm and when they knocked on the door, the Germans were frightened obviously and they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever.</span> <span id="s826">And the Germans said, we don’t have any food, but the American army is across on that river, and if you cross that bridge, y-you’ll find the American army and they will be able to help you.</span> <span id="s827">And you better hurry up because the bridge is going to be blown up.</span> <span id="s828">So with whatever strength he and his friend had, they ran across the river and no sooner did they get to the other side of the river, the bridge blew up.</span> <span id="s829">But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food, shelter and so forth from the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: But that’s all he was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: That’s all he -- but he wouldn’t have -- he wouldn’t tell me about the -- his experiences in Dachau, about the killings in Dachau.</span> <span id="s832">You know, he didn’t a -- and he didn’t discuss -- he doesn’t discuss much about his life in the ghetto, either.</span> <span id="s833">Although, I understand from some cousins of mine that when he was in the ghetto, my father arranged for him to get married in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s834">And he must have been then -- what wa -- 16 - 17, and that his wife was taken away, and -- from the ghetto or whatever, and he never saw her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And -- but he didn’t tell you this.</span> <span id="s836">It was other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: He didn't -- he didn’t tell me that, because I don’t think his current wife knows about it, that he was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s839">And is -- was his current wife a Lithuanian Gentile, or was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: No, she a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: She’s a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: It’s when he went back to Lithuania, to Poinyavich to look for my mother, he came across that Jewish family, they took him in.</span> <span id="s843">They had a daughter, they got married and before you knew there was a baby.</span> <span id="s844">And the other -- the only other thing he tells me is that he was able to reclaim my father’s home.</span> <span id="s845">And he then sold the house, which belonged to my father, and no sooner did he sell the house that that money became devalued.</span> <span id="s846">That he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s848">Tell me something.</span> <span id="s849">What -- if you can answer this question, what sort of effect does this history have on you, the fact that your mother was murdered and your father got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Well, it had -- it -- obviously it’s a very central part of my life.</span> <span id="s851">This is why I am so committed to Israel.</span> <span id="s852">This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of Israel, because it’s my view that if we had an Israel at the time, we had a place that would have admitted Jews, maybe my parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my grandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941.</span> <span id="s853">So I have done a number of things to memorialize it.</span> <span id="s854">One of the things which I always hoped, that I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle that they gave me when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s855">And obviously that was not to be.</span> <span id="s856">So I got involved in building a geriatric center.</span> <span id="s857">And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will be able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a home where they could -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in dignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this geriatric center, which is called the Gurwin Jewish geriatric center.</span> <span id="s858">It’s in Commack, Long Island, and it is an -- if I say so myself, an outstanding geriatric center.</span> <span id="s859">It has 460 beds, it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has apartments with assisted living for 200 units.</span> <span id="s860">And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and energy to build this geriatric center, and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: We’re gonna -- I’m going to have to break now for the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s865">You were continuing to talk about the -- the ways in which you have been affected by the Holocaust and what you’ve done because of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Well, because of that, I have been a leader in the UJA Federation of New York.</span> <span id="s867">I was chairman of the board for three, four years, and -- think it was between 1987 and 1990.</span> <span id="s868">I am very supportive of all Jewish causes.</span> <span id="s869">I have sent up two satellites called Gurwin one and two.</span> <span id="s870">They were built in Israel, they were designed by Technion, built by Israel aircraft industry and they were launched on a Russian missile from Kazakhstan.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s873">The first satellite went kaput.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: You mean it just blew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Oke --</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: -- the Russian missile did not ignite the fourth stage, so it never got into orbit.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: And -- and so I said it was not the fault of Technion, it was the fault of the Russian missile, so we’re going to build a second one.</span> <span id="s880">So we have a second satellite, that’s why it’s called Gurwin two, and it is still circling --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: -- the world to this day.</span> <span id="s883">It was originally designed that it would last probably a year or two at the most.</span> <span id="s884">It’s now six or seven years and it’s still in orbit.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: So that was one of the things which I did.</span> <span id="s887">I am on the board of Technion and I’m also on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science.</span> <span id="s888">And I am very supportive of both institutions.</span> <span id="s889">I have received a doctorate from Technion and I’m getting a PhD.</span> <span id="s890">from the Weizmann Institute in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: So -- and I have been involved in every -- whether I was a guest of honor of ADL in Palm Beach, I was guest of honor of the American Jewish Committee in Palm Beach.</span> <span id="s893">I have been involved with the Magen [indecipherable] where we contributed, Phyllis and I, to ambulances which bear our name.</span> <span id="s894">I’m very much involved with the Long Island Jewish hospital which I am on board, and we have built there an educational resource center.</span> <span id="s895">So, we have done whatever we could in our own way to -- to make this a better world to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s897">Did you ever want to read very much about the Holocaust, or s --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Read about it, or see the movies, or da -- is it too hard for you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: It is too hard for me --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: -- to do it.</span> <span id="s903">I remember going to see Schimberg’s List.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: “Schindler’s List”, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: And I remember seeing -- there’s, I think an Italian movie about this couple that lived in Italy, in luxury and so forth, and it brought back memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: -- that were very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Did you -- were you at exhibitions at the Holocaust museum in Washington, and in Yad Vashem, and here in New York, or you don’t even do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: No, I been in -- in the Holocaust museum several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I have been at Yad Vashem several times.</span> <span id="s914">As a matter of fact, I have been at the -- the latest Yad Vashem only last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: The new --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: It was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: -- the new exhibition there, yes.</span> <span id="s918">The new exhibition at Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: So you can go through the exhibitions?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: I can go -- go through the exhibition.</span> <span id="s922">I remember they had the children’s memorial in Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I remember going through with -- with it with my late wife, she couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s926">And was she in Europe at the time, or she wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: -- she’s an American, lived in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Uh-huh, but she couldn’t -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: So is it a kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: -- back-drop for you, as if it’s a screen in back, so that it’s always a part of who you are, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s936">I will never forget it, it is part of my life, and as long as I’m alive, I will wa -- remember it, and do whatever I can to make sure that this does not happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: And so it just so happens that this is August the first and this terrible battle that’s taking place in Israel today, and I am very, very upset about it.</span> <span id="s939">I -- I am just very concerned for the future of Israel, and for the future of the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s941">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</span> <span id="s942">Anything I haven’t asked you that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s944">I think we covered most of it.</span> <span id="s945">I just hope that my children will continue to support the philanthropic activities in which I am involved with.</span> <span id="s946">I am going to leave them a foundation which will enable them to do whatever they would like to do, but hopefully they will support the causes which I have supported.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And you have two sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I have a son and I have a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I have a son who is an ophthalmologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And he has his wife and he has three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: These are -- these are the people who are going to Kilimanjaro?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: They are c-climbing Kilimanjaro.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: And then there i -- I have a daughter, and she has one daughter -- I have one granddaughter, and she’s just graduated a year ago from MIT.</span> <span id="s957">And my daughter is now retired, she was working for 25 years at Mount Sinai hospital in New York.</span> <span id="s958">She has a degree in hospital administration.</span> <span id="s959">And she hopefully will have the time to devote to my causes, and we’ll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s961">Well, I want to thank you very much for taking the time.</span> <span id="s962">I know this is not an easy tale for you to talk about so I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Well, it’s always difficult, but realizing what we are up against, and the denials that they place every day about the Holocaust, it is my opportunity to stand witness for what happened to my parents and the rest of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: We’re very grateful to you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
