And I also, that period, I was corresponding with my sister who was still in Vilna through a friend of mine who was in Switzerland. My closest girlfriend came to visit me in Paris after the Treaty of Munich in ’38 and she became very ill in Paris. To such an extent that she was bedridden three months in my apartment and I was almost ready to take her back home. She had no parents, she had just an uncle who was a lawyer in Vilna.

The, the only time I started feeling it when I, we got American visa and we applied for the visa of exit. And my husband visa of exit was turned down three times. They refused it. And then I think, pregnant with Daynya (ph), I went to Vishee (ph) France to plead my case because there was no reason for them to refuse my husband’s visa of exit. He was a war veteran. He served ten months on the Marjinoline (ph) and it was just through anti-Semitism and persecution. So I was extremely lucky. It was like a miracle that I succeeded in getting the visa of exit.
Q: How did you do that? Who did you talk to?

And who was a prominent citizen of Paris, who was my husband’s relative. And he was trying to get us to come to, to America but he said he can, he can bring us only to Santa Domingo.

I was hysterical. I started screaming, somebody told, told, oh, she’s on another train.

Q: Ghetto. She went to camps and then went to Cuba.
A: That’s right. And then came to America. From America she couldn’t remain because she arrived in America with a girlfriend who helped her a great deal in camp. The other, the other friend. My sister was as I said, a linguist and the other one, a graduate of a very good trade school. She was a very good seamstress. That’s what kept her alive and helped her to help my sister. That’s how they survived. They were very devoted to each other. So when they came to America, they, my sister could have somebody marry her fictitiously so she could remain. But the other one couldn’t get it and they went to Cuba and they suffered __________ Cuba, for three years they suffered from the climate, atrocious. And finally, they came back.
