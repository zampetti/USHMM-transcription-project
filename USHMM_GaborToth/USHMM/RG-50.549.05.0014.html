[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s35">So, it’s pronounced a little different, but basically it’s the same name, but Hungarian style.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And your last name was Schlisser?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, I was born Schlisser.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Is that, was your family German originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I don’t know, but at one time Hungary and Austria were one under the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s40">So it could have been that my family originally lived in Austria or somewhere.</span> <span id="s41">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s42">But the name is German, yes.</span> <span id="s43">But I do not know what the original, what the source of it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Do you know anything about your family’s history in the area?</span> <span id="s45">How long they had been in Almozd?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s47">I know that we had an extended family.</span> <span id="s48">Almozd, my mother’s family lived there.</span> <span id="s49">My grandparents lived there in the village and a couple of her, my uncles, a couple of her brothers lived there.</span> <span id="s50">And in the region around there we had a whole lot of, she had about eleven brothers and sisters and they were all basically somewhere in the region.</span> <span id="s51">So, a big family there.</span> <span id="s52">My father’s parents, they lived, in his family they were in a different village, near the Tisza River, in a place called Butszentmihal, but we were born in Almozd.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Spitz.</span> <span id="s55">Her first name was Rose, Spitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My father’s name was Schlisser.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: First name?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh, Morris, Morris.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What about your parents’ profession?</span> <span id="s61">What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My father was a merchant in leather.</span> <span id="s63">In other words he used to buy skin, cattle skin or skin of pigs and then process them.</span> <span id="s64">He was like a middle man.</span> <span id="s65">He bought them, plus down and that kind of stuff and he sold it on to people who used them to actually make shoes and you know, leather products.</span> <span id="s66">That was his, and my mother was a seamstress.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did she have a, just, how did she do her business?</span> <span id="s68">Did she have people come and…</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s70">[Laughter.]</span> <span id="s71">I just know because my sisters told me that she was a seamstress, but I couldn’t tell you how.</span> <span id="s72">I assume that she was working from the, from our house, so I assume that the people would bring, you know, stuff for her to, either to measure them or making dresses and stuff.</span> <span id="s73">In those days there wasn’t too many ready-made off-the-shelf dresses.</span> <span id="s74">Most of it you had to make.</span> <span id="s75">So, I assume that’s the way it worked, but I really, out of my own knowledge I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s76">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We were four, two sisters and two brothers and I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Do you want to go ahead and state your brother’s and your sisters’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: My oldest brother’s name was Mickey or Mike in English.</span> <span id="s81">He passed away.</span> <span id="s82">And my second one was Ilona, she’s in Sweden.</span> <span id="s83">She has two daughters and six, eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s84">My other sister, her name is Miriam, Maria was her Hungarian name, Mani (ph), and she is in Israel.</span> <span id="s85">And she had four children, three daughters and one son and she got thirteen grandchildren.</span> <span id="s86">And me, and my wife’s name is Helen and we have one son, Anthony.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did all of your brothers and sisters survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: My two sisters did and my brother did, but he got killed in Israel during one of the altercations over there between the Arabs and them.</span> <span id="s89">He fought during the Independence war, my oldest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So he was in Israel relatively early.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yeah, he went to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s92">He was in the prison camp by the British in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s93">And from there went to Israel in ‘48 when they declared independence.</span> <span id="s94">He fought there with the Palmach (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: My grandparents were very religious.</span> <span id="s97">They were very, very religious.</span> <span id="s98">My parents, my father, he was religious, but not to the extreme.</span> <span id="s99">In other words, he went on, on the Sabbath he went to the Temple and on holidays he went to the Temple.</span> <span id="s100">But he didn’t, you know, during the week, every day prayer and all that stuff like my grandparents, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s101">But we kept all the, you know, the holidays and everything, Friday night and Saturday, went to the Temple and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Do you have any other memories about your early childhood?</span> <span id="s103">Do you remember friendships?</span> <span id="s104">Did you have Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: A lot of friends, but I remember basically one, his name was Peter, Christian boy.</span> <span id="s106">In Debrecen.</span> <span id="s107">We moved, we didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s108">I was born in Almozd, but we didn’t live in Almozd.</span> <span id="s109">We moved from there to Debrecen, which is about the third largest city in Hungary.</span> <span id="s110">That was the center for the Protestant section of Hungary, because basically Hungary is a Catholic country.</span> <span id="s111">Only the northern part of Hungary was basically Protestant, and their center was in Debrecen and that’s where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Why did your family move?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: When?</span> <span id="s114">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Or why?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I guess it was better for business for my father, was more central, as far as selling or transferring goods.</span> <span id="s117">I’m just guessing.</span> <span id="s118">I have no idea why.</span> <span id="s119">I guess it was just better for the family, you know, more centrally located.</span> <span id="s120">I would assume that because the village where we were born, didn’t even have a train come through there.</span> <span id="s121">You had to go with a horse and buggy from that town to the train station, which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles away.</span> <span id="s122">So there was absolutely nothing there.</span> <span id="s123">It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my grandparents had some land there and all that.</span> <span id="s124">But I would assume that’s the main reason.</span> <span id="s125">He still traveled down to all the villages and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his warehouse and all that was in the city, and, you know, where they process the stuff.</span> <span id="s126">That’s as far as I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did you go to public school in Debrecen?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Ah, I don’t know what the problem… I only went to one grade, okay, before the war started.</span> <span id="s129">And so it was, I would assume it was considered a public school, but it was a Jewish, ran by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s130">And basically all the children in the school were Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s131">But whether it was, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I… but it wasn’t religious.</span> <span id="s132">It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know, geography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal school.</span> <span id="s133">That’s what we learned, but it was basically, all Jewish children went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So was that sanctioned by the state at that point?</span> <span id="s135">That the Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: That’s what I’m saying, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s137">I assume that it was, but there’s no way for me to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: So, that was around what year, that you moved from Almozd to Debrecen?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I don’t know, I could not tell you, from the time that I remember we were already in Debrecen.</span> <span id="s140">I was about five or something like that.</span> <span id="s141">We were already living in Debrecen, so I could not tell you when we actually moved there.</span> <span id="s142">I just know that I was born in ‘35 and I know we were in Almozd then, that’s where I was born.</span> <span id="s143">So, somewhere between ‘35 and, you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: ‘44.</span> <span id="s146">Oh no, long before then.</span> <span id="s147">I was five, so that would be ‘40, 1940, so somewhere between ‘35 and ‘40 is when the family moved from Almozd to Debrecen.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What language did your family speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you speak Yiddish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: My grandparents spoke and I guess my father knew Yiddish, but we, you know the children, with my mother and father we only spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s152">And when we went to the Temple, we prayed in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s153">Because it was basically memorized rote, you know.</span> <span id="s154">I went to school, separate religious school to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible.</span> <span id="s155">But at home we only spoke Hungarian, no other language.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: But you mentioned you had a friend who was a Christian boy.</span> <span id="s157">Was he a neighbor or how did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: He was a neighbor.</span> <span id="s159">We used to play soccer together and all that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: When did you start to notice, well the Germans didn’t occupy until 1944, did you notice any anti…</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Oh yes, it started, it started in actually about ‘43.</span> <span id="s162">What they called, the Hungarian Nazis, which were called the Nilosh, which is the Arrow, Arrow…</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: …Something like that.</span> <span id="s165">Nilosh is basically somebody who shoots arrows.</span> <span id="s166">And you started wearing then already yellow stars and all that.</span> <span id="s167">At the time you just had to wear, you didn’t have to, it wasn’t until the Germans came in that they moved us into ghettos.</span> <span id="s168">But by then you already had to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s169">And the Christian friends all of a sudden disappeared [laughing].</span> <span id="s170">They didn’t know you anymore.</span> <span id="s171">Even if they wanted to probably their parents told them, you know, “Stay away from them, don’t play with them,” and such and such.</span> <span id="s172">So, yeah.</span> <span id="s173">It started actually in ‘43, but it really didn’t get serious until ‘44, then when the Germans… and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover.</span> <span id="s174">We went down to my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s175">We were going to spend Passover with them.</span> <span id="s176">And so we all traveled down there.</span> <span id="s177">I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I’m not sure which, but the policeman from the village came in from Almozd.</span> <span id="s178">He came in and said that all Jews must go back to where they lived.</span> <span id="s179">“So, your daughter,” he told my grandfather, “your daughter and her children must return immediately to Debrecen.”</span> <span id="s180">And so in the middle of the night we had to get a buggy and horses and go back to the train station and catch a train back to Debrecen.</span> <span id="s181">From there they told us that we have to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s182">And so they set aside a square, I don’t know, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden gates up on each end of the street, blocked it off.</span> <span id="s183">And then windows that were looking outside from the ghetto, they bricked them in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many houses.</span> <span id="s184">A couple of streets, basically is what it amounted to.</span> <span id="s185">And they herded everybody in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Do you remember being herded in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well basically they told us you have so much time to, you know, to gather whatever you could carry, belongings, whatever you could carry and, you know, and move in there.</span> <span id="s188">So, we moved in.</span> <span id="s189">And they allocated, you know, for each family a room or whatever.</span> <span id="s190">I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s191">Space.</span> <span id="s192">And stayed there and from there they took the men to work.</span> <span id="s193">I don’t know whatever kind of work they were doing.</span> <span id="s194">And they would come and take them off in the morning with shovels and stuff and then come back at night.</span> <span id="s195">My dad wasn’t there, because he was already taken to labor camp where, they called it… for the Army, basically they were in the service, but they were labor battalions for the Hungarian Army which was already fighting the Russians.</span> <span id="s196">And I guess they were digging trenches for them and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s197">So he was already taken.</span> <span id="s198">Back in ‘43 he was already gone.</span> <span id="s199">He wasn’t at home.</span> <span id="s200">So, he wasn’t there when we were moved into the ghetto, just my mother and us four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did your older brother, was he old enough to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: He was there.</span> <span id="s203">Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">He was already fourteen or fifteen at the time.</span> <span id="s205">He was apprentice in a shop, they were making bristles.</span> <span id="s206">All kind of… have to think about how to say it… brooms and for…</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Brushes?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Brushes, yeah, that’s it.</span> <span id="s209">All kinds of brushes they were making in that place.</span> <span id="s210">He worked there as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s211">And my mother kept on sewing.</span> <span id="s212">That’s basically what we were supported on.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did you stay home with your mother during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: During the time that… no, I went to the first grade, but after when we moved into the ghetto, nobody, I mean there was no work in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s215">Basically the Jewish Community was divvying up food, whatever… I really don’t know where the food was coming from.</span> <span id="s216">How the allocation went and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s217">But we had food to eat, I mean, during that time anyway, we didn’t, I don’t remember being hungry or anything like that.</span> <span id="s218">So I guess there was sufficient amount of food available, you know, when in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Do you remember anything you ate?</span> <span id="s220">Any of the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No.</span> <span id="s222">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s223">I guess just normal food, you know, what my mother always would fix.</span> <span id="s224">I know used to give me, come in from playing, because you’re, I’m what?</span> <span id="s225">I was seven and a half years old, eight years old?</span> <span id="s226">I’m paying not much attention to that.</span> <span id="s227">She used to give me a piece of bread with butter on it, sprinkled with a little sugar.</span> <span id="s228">That was my snack.</span> <span id="s229">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s230">Tasted good to me.</span> <span id="s231">So as far as I know, normal food that she would normally prepare, you know, that’s what we had.</span> <span id="s232">I don’t remember… now thinking back at it, I really don’t remember what we ate.</span> <span id="s233">What kind of food.</span> <span id="s234">But we weren’t there that long, because once they got everybody together, they started cleaning out that place.</span> <span id="s235">Load people up and they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s236">The only reason I’m sitting here talking to you right now is because the fact that my father was American.</span> <span id="s237">He was born in New York City and he never accepted citizenship, Hungarian citizenship.</span> <span id="s238">So consequently we were protected by the Swiss Embassy.</span> <span id="s239">So they put us in a separate house from the rest of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s240">There were some other families there, who were foreign nationals or considered foreign nationals.</span> <span id="s241">And they were protected by the Hungarian police and not by the Germans.</span> <span id="s242">And so once the whole ghetto got emptied, because we didn’t know where they were taking them.</span> <span id="s243">We were taken on train, we were taken to Budapest.</span> <span id="s244">And they put us there in a, what they called a protective house.</span> <span id="s245">Basically it was a prison, but, and part of the wing there, they even had American flyers there.</span> <span id="s246">They were shot down.</span> <span id="s247">Because we seen them exercise.</span> <span id="s248">We had no direct contact with them.</span> <span id="s249">But they were shot down, you know, they were bombing Budapest and the planes were shot down and they got captured.</span> <span id="s250">That’s where they kept them, too.</span> <span id="s251">So, that’s were they kept us till December 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you remember being… do you remember what you were feeling during that time?</span> <span id="s253">Being this young boy, being afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s255">I wasn’t afraid at all.</span> <span id="s256">No, no.</span> <span id="s257">I remember they were bombing, because the house that we were in was close to the central train station.</span> <span id="s258">And they got bombed a lot.</span> <span id="s259">And so we always had to go down to the shelter.</span> <span id="s260">I don’t remember being afraid, to be perfectly honest with you.</span> <span id="s261">Sounds crazy, but if I was, I do not remember it as such, as being afraid.</span> <span id="s262">I guess at that age, you really… do not comprehend, you know, what was going on.</span> <span id="s263">Was no reason, really, in my mind there was no reason to be afraid.</span> <span id="s264">But no, I do not remember being afraid.</span> <span id="s265">Now, my sister might have been, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s266">But I personally do not remember being afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Were you close with your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s269">We always did everything together, together we used to go, Sundays we used to have matinee, back in Debrecen, we used to have matinee operettas, you know.</span> <span id="s270">And we used to love operettas.</span> <span id="s271">I was just a tiny little thing.</span> <span id="s272">But we used to, always save our money and go, on Sundays we used to go to the operetta, the matinee.</span> <span id="s273">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s274">There was a place they called Nagy Erdö which is basically a little forest area and they had a big pond there and row boats.</span> <span id="s275">And I remember my brother taking me there, you know, for going on the pond with a row boat ride.</span> <span id="s276">That kind of stuff I remember.</span> <span id="s277">We did things together, I mean we were close family.</span> <span id="s278">Even today, every year we try to see each other.</span> <span id="s279">Once a year we get together somewhere, if it’s at all possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: So one sister, you said, lives in Sweden and the other in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: In Israel, right.</span> <span id="s282">That’s where they live.</span> <span id="s283">Matter of fact, I just came back.</span> <span id="s284">I visited my sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s285">My sister from Sweden was sick, so she couldn’t join us.</span> <span id="s286">But that’s the first year that we didn’t, all three of us weren’t together.</span> <span id="s287">So, next year we are going to Sweden, so whether she is sick or not, we’ll be there.</span> <span id="s288">We’ll visit her.</span> <span id="s289">Each year we try to get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: When your, when the ghetto began to be liquidated did your father come back from the labor force?</span> <span id="s291">Or what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No.</span> <span id="s293">He joined us back in Budapest.</span> <span id="s294">They brought him back from whatever work Battalion he was in.</span> <span id="s295">I guess the Swiss Embassy intervened.</span> <span id="s296">Anyway they brought him back and he joined us at the protective house.</span> <span id="s297">That’s where he rejoined us.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Do you remember anything else about your time in the protected house?</span> <span id="s299">You just had to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well basically there was a lot of families there.</span> <span id="s301">I remember one guy taught me how to play chess.</span> <span id="s302">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s303">They had French and Italian, all different nationalities, bunch of… well, no, wasn’t Italian, because they were, anyway, whoever were at war with the Nazis, with Germany and their allies.</span> <span id="s304">There was a whole bunch of different nationalities, I know that.</span> <span id="s305">I think there was some French, too, Jewish, Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Were all of them Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s308">Well, I better not say yes because I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s309">But I think that all of them were Jews.</span> <span id="s310">And it was just normal, I mean they would… again I don’t know where the food was coming, whether the Hungarian government provided the food or the Swiss or Red Cross, I’m really not sure.</span> <span id="s311">I remember that one time the Red Cross came to inspect the house.</span> <span id="s312">And I was _____________, because I guess we were considered prisoners.</span> <span id="s313">I remember one, and they brought some packages and stuff.</span> <span id="s314">I really don’t remember a whole lot, detail-wise.</span> <span id="s315">I know there were a lot of little kids and we played.</span> <span id="s316">The quarters were very tight, we only had, I think, for the whole family, that’s four of us and my father and mother, I think we only had one big room for all of us.</span> <span id="s317">So there was, space-wise there wasn’t a whole lot.</span> <span id="s318">And we had a window that opened up on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s319">But it was all in four with the one gate you could come in or out.</span> <span id="s320">It was like enclosed.</span> <span id="s321">The hallways, the Hungarian police sitting in each hallway, armed.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Were they, did they treat you decently or were they cruel?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes, the Hungarian police treated, you know, as far as I know they treated us decently.</span> <span id="s324">Okay?</span> <span id="s325">The rough time was with the Nilosh (ph), with the Hungarian Nazis during the ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">And there they hit you with the butt of the rifle, whatever, if they didn’t like your looks or whatever turned them on, you know.</span> <span id="s327">But at the Protective house, they did treat us decently.</span> <span id="s328">There was no rough stuff or that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s329">They were pretty decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Did you ever get hit while in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah a couple of times, but that was later on.</span> <span id="s332">That was around when I got to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s333">At the house itself there was… as far as I can, for me anyway, for my memories, I didn’t see any mean beat-ups or that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s334">I did not see anyone when I was around.</span> <span id="s335">December of ‘44, I guess the Russian were getting too close, and then they just moved everybody out in the street.</span> <span id="s336">Said, “Everybody out, pick up whatever you can carry.”</span> <span id="s337">And this was in December, cold, snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s338">And they lined us up in the street and my brother, when he heard that they started hollering “Everybody out” and all that, he ran down underneath to the basement and opened the door for the bomb shelter to the street and he got out there.</span> <span id="s339">I followed him.</span> <span id="s340">And he told me to go back.</span> <span id="s341">I would have been with him, but he didn’t go to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s342">He took off.</span> <span id="s343">But he was already fifteen, obviously he couldn’t worry about me.</span> <span id="s344">He told me to go back to mom and dad, so I went back and he took off.</span> <span id="s345">So he managed to escape.</span> <span id="s346">So he did not come with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Tape one, side B. Where did your brother go?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: From what he told me later on, first of all he hid around there in Budapest till he managed to get out of Budapest.</span> <span id="s350">He went back to Almozd, to where he was born.</span> <span id="s351">He knew the people there, and they hid him till after the war.</span> <span id="s352">He worked for the farmers and all that.</span> <span id="s353">But they took care of him, protected him and hid him.</span> <span id="s354">That’s where he went back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What else do you remember about that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, that day is when all Hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s357">There was no trains from there, from Budapest, so they marched us.</span> <span id="s358">We walked about four days, I guess, close to a couple hundred miles, I mean kilometers, which is about… a hundred kilometers is sixty miles, so probably about a hundred miles, maybe a hundred and twenty miles we walked to a rail head.</span> <span id="s359">And we were cold, snow and young children.</span> <span id="s360">And they called it a death march, because whoever couldn’t keep up they just shot him.</span> <span id="s361">Dropped him whenever he couldn’t go no more and killed him.</span> <span id="s362">Either you went or you died, as simple as that.</span> <span id="s363">So, they marched us in the snow and ice for about, I guess it was four days by the time we got to the rail head.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Did you have any of your belongings with you, were you having to carry…?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well whatever, initially we had belongings with us, but as we walked we threw, basically got rid of most of the stuff we couldn’t carry.</span> <span id="s366">Just the most important necessities is what you kept.</span> <span id="s367">Everything else got thrown to the side of the road.</span> <span id="s368">And, you know, just kept on trucking.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Did you have any food with you?</span> <span id="s370">Or were you given any?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Well each day, evening they usually had some big barns and stuff, I guess they took over from some farms or whatever, they herded us in there because it wasn’t that many people to begin with.</span> <span id="s372">I don’t know how many, but I wouldn’t think it was more than a few hundreds, maybe four or five hundred people the whole, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s373">So, they herded us in there.</span> <span id="s374">And usually they fed us some kind of a hot soup and some black bread, you know, rye.</span> <span id="s375">And that was basically all the food we got.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Were all of the prisoners foreign nationals in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah, that’s all from that protective house.</span> <span id="s378">They were considered foreign nationals, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So there were a few hundred people just in that one house?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes, yes, in that whole complex.</span> <span id="s381">It was four or five stories high, I mean the building.</span> <span id="s382">But anyway, yeah, whatever was in, they emptied out, the house, the prison, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s383">They took everybody from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Was it the Germans who were evacuating and leading the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yes, there was Germans and some Hungarian Nazis were working with them, but basically the Germans SS was in charge.</span> <span id="s386">They’re the ones who controlled the whole thing, the movement and all that.</span> <span id="s387">So once we got to the rail head, there they separated the women and the children and the men and they loaded us on separate cattle cars.</span> <span id="s388">And they packed us full in these cars.</span> <span id="s389">We barely could breathe, and one little bucket in a corner for everybody to use as a toilet.</span> <span id="s390">And closed the doors and off we went.</span> <span id="s391">We went… and my father was taken separately to, well all the men were taken to different camps.</span> <span id="s392">And so they took us to Ravensbrück, that’s where our first concentration camp was.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Do you remember starting to feel afraid during that time about what was going to happen to you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I never, ever can remember that I was afraid.</span> <span id="s395">I’m not saying I wasn’t, but in my mind I do not remember being afraid.</span> <span id="s396">I was more… I don’t even know what I was feeling.</span> <span id="s397">I really didn’t know what was going… I guess I was just trying to survive.</span> <span id="s398">My main motive was, in the cattle car if you don’t watch it you will be trampled to death there.</span> <span id="s399">There were people who died in the camp, I mean in the car going there.</span> <span id="s400">And I don’t know how long we traveled in the car.</span> <span id="s401">But honestly, I really can’t tell you that I actually felt scared, no afraid.</span> <span id="s402">Now, I’m not saying that I wasn’t, but I do not remember that kind of feeling.</span> <span id="s403">Because maybe that was because of my age, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s404">It just didn’t dawn on me that I’m supposed to be afraid.</span> <span id="s405">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s406">Matter of fact, my sister tells me and I could not verify it for you, because I don’t know.</span> <span id="s407">Because I’m not remembering.</span> <span id="s408">But once we were in Ravensbrück, it was like they had appell, basically like reveille in the morning in the Army.</span> <span id="s409">Everybody had to fall out of the barracks and line up and had roll call, you know, account for everybody.</span> <span id="s410">And whoever was sick had to go, that whole camp was nothing but women and children.</span> <span id="s411">Basically women, there were a few children, but not too many.</span> <span id="s412">My mother had a real terrible headache and she asked for some medication or something and the German whipped her with… he had one of those riding, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Riding crop?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah, he slapped her across and I went and kicked him in the shin.</span> <span id="s415">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s416">And my sister said everybody, they got deathly still.</span> <span id="s417">They were afraid that he was going to kill me or something.</span> <span id="s418">But he just turned around and he slapped me and I went flying, but that’s about, he didn’t do nothing else to me, but, you know.</span> <span id="s419">That tells you I wasn’t afraid for my own personal.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t remember doing it, to be honest with you.</span> <span id="s421">But that’s what my sister told me that I did.</span> <span id="s422">I personally cannot remember that I personally was afraid.</span> <span id="s423">From when we arrived at the camp everybody got taking all the clothes and everything away from them.</span> <span id="s424">And my mother had sewed gold coins and stuff into each one of our, because we didn’t know, you know, so she divvied up what we had and sewed into our overcoats just in case, you know, we could use it.</span> <span id="s425">Maybe the whole family could have been saved.</span> <span id="s426">My dad got hold of the farmer one of the nights when we stopped overnight and talked to the farmer.</span> <span id="s427">And he had sewed in his overcoat, a big diamond ring and he told the farmer he was going to give him the diamond ring if he hides us, the four of us, the four kids and him and my mom.</span> <span id="s428">And he agreed, so it must have been a pretty good diamond ring, you know pretty big diamond.</span> <span id="s429">But my mom wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s430">She said that he might kill us himself for the rest of the stuff.</span> <span id="s431">She didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It was on the way to the rail head from Budapest.</span> <span id="s434">Anyway, they took all the clothes away and they gave us those striped, pajama type stuff.</span> <span id="s435">And they cut everybody’s hair, women, children, everything.</span> <span id="s436">And they gave us a shower, but it was water.</span> <span id="s437">It wasn’t gas.</span> <span id="s438">And they assigned us to barracks.</span> <span id="s439">When we went out, after the reveille in the morning, they took us out to the field to pick beets, cattle beets.</span> <span id="s440">And we ate cattle beets to keep us from starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did they give you anything else to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Basically once a day they gave you a slice of black bread and soup made from cattle beets.</span> <span id="s443">Hot liquid, but it was wintertime, was cold.</span> <span id="s444">That’s basically what you got and while you worked out there if you could sneak away some beets, then you chewed on that while you worked.</span> <span id="s445">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did you have to work long hours?</span> <span id="s447">Do you have any sense of how long the days were?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, they marched us from the camp out to the field.</span> <span id="s449">I don’t know how long it took to get us out there.</span> <span id="s450">It wasn’t too far from the fields.</span> <span id="s451">I don’t remember how far.</span> <span id="s452">Mainly I think the difficulty was walking in the snow and ice and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s453">But we went out to the fields and you pulled them beets, you know?</span> <span id="s454">They had a cart that you threw it on.</span> <span id="s455">Afternoon they walk you back to the camp.</span> <span id="s456">I don’t know if that’s all.</span> <span id="s457">There might have been other stuff, other people picked, maybe because the younger one, the weak and all, the weaker people they took to the easier, where the beets weren’t that heavy.</span> <span id="s458">They weren’t that big.</span> <span id="s459">Just depends, probably had other kind of work details, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Did you work with your mother and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s462">I didn’t every day go out with them.</span> <span id="s463">But most of the time they just took everybody out.</span> <span id="s464">Just brought them down and took them out.</span> <span id="s465">So I don’t know, we stayed there for a couple of months and then one day they hollered everybody out from the barracks and they lined us up again.</span> <span id="s466">And at the time my sister, Miriam, she was very sick and they had her in the dispensary over there.</span> <span id="s467">So started marching us toward the rail head and I remember Mama hollering, “Miriam, Miriam!”</span> <span id="s468">She didn’t want to leave her.</span> <span id="s469">[Weeping.]</span> <span id="s470">Anyway, they loaded us back up again and my sister stayed behind.</span> <span id="s471">From there they took us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s472">We arrived at Bergen-Belsen and they took us in where the crematorium was and maybe because I was just a little child, but there was a mountain, nothing but dead corpses piled on top of each other.</span> <span id="s473">And the smell and everything else, and stayed over there overnight.</span> <span id="s474">The next day they took us and put us in the barracks.</span> <span id="s475">There was no beds or anything.</span> <span id="s476">They had some straw.</span> <span id="s477">And give you a sack to fill up with straw.</span> <span id="s478">That was your bed.</span> <span id="s479">So, basically you laid on concrete in the winter.</span> <span id="s480">No food.</span> <span id="s481">My mother died there.</span> <span id="s482">Then in May, ’45, we got liberated.</span> <span id="s483">The British and Canadian troops actually liberated Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s484">And then the Red Cross took us from where they found us, took us to hospital.</span> <span id="s485">We stayed there and the Swedish Red Cross took us from there to Sweden.</span> <span id="s486">I stayed about a year in hospital.</span> <span id="s487">They nursed me back to health.</span> <span id="s488">Then once I got out of the hospital, I joined my sister in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So you, I’m sorry, did your mother die of typhus?</span> <span id="s490">Was she ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I don’t know what she died from.</span> <span id="s492">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s493">But a lot of people during that period of time died from typhus.</span> <span id="s494">They… I think she probably more died from starvation than anything else, because what little food we could get hold, she would feed the kids, me and my sister.</span> <span id="s495">I don’t know if she ate any or what, and so her condition… and we were susceptible to any disease that was rampaging around in the place there.</span> <span id="s496">There was no cleaning, you didn’t wash you.</span> <span id="s497">Any kind of hygiene, so who knows what would have caused it.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So it was you and your sister, Ilona, who were…</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Ilona…</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: …liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: …and my mother went to Bergen-Belsen, yeah.</span> <span id="s502">Me and Ilona was liberated from Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you remember any details about the day of your liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: The only thing I remember, somebody said that they were hanging, they’d seen some white flags on the guard towers.</span> <span id="s505">What is the white flags?</span> <span id="s506">Germans put white flags on the towers.</span> <span id="s507">Didn’t mean nothing to me.</span> <span id="s508">I don’t know what the symbol, surrender, but how was… and then somebody I heard said, holler something about, “the Germans are leaving.”</span> <span id="s509">I guess they try to hide.</span> <span id="s510">You know?</span> <span id="s511">The camp guards all were booking.</span> <span id="s512">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s513">So, anyway.</span> <span id="s514">And then the next thing you know the troops, the military was coming through the camps and all that.</span> <span id="s515">I guess picking up whoever was still living.</span> <span id="s516">Matter of fact they took us to the German hospital.</span> <span id="s517">I guess they cleaned it out whoever was in there.</span> <span id="s518">Anyway they took it over and that’s where they were taking us.</span> <span id="s519">Then they put up big, old hospital tents.</span> <span id="s520">That’s where the children, they brought the children to, we were in a hospital, a big hospital tent.</span> <span id="s521">I remember that.</span> <span id="s522">And I guess they started feeding us slowly, slowly because we had hardly any stomach left.</span> <span id="s523">That’s what killed a lot of people, I understand, is they gave them too much food too soon.</span> <span id="s524">Got diarrhea and all that, they couldn’t handle it on their bodies.</span> <span id="s525">So anyway, wasn’t much left of me by that time.</span> <span id="s526">But anyway from there the Swedish Red Cross came and picked up all the children without any family and everything and took us to Sweden.</span> <span id="s527">They put us on one of those Red Cross trains and we arrived in Malmö.</span> <span id="s528">Had those white buses with red crosses on them.</span> <span id="s529">From there they took us to the hospital, Swedish hospital in Stockholm, I mean Malmö.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: How old was, let’s see, you were ten years old at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Nine and a half.</span> <span id="s532">I would be ten in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And your sister, Ilona?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: My sister, she was three years older, at least three, three, three and a half years older than I was.</span> <span id="s535">So, she was about twelve and a half, between twelve and thirteen.</span> <span id="s536">But she was born in December, so she wasn’t quite thirteen, past twelve, but not thirteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: How did the Swedish people treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Oh, they treated us very well.</span> <span id="s539">I mean, they were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s540">They cared for us.</span> <span id="s541">As far as I can remember, in the hospital anyway, they were very kind and all that.</span> <span id="s542">When we went to the orphanage, I think it wasn’t Swedish.</span> <span id="s543">I think it was run by a Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s544">I think it wasn’t a Swedish government function.</span> <span id="s545">It was kind of tough.</span> <span id="s546">Started putting us back to school.</span> <span id="s547">But, had one teacher who was teaching me in German.</span> <span id="s548">One teacher was teaching me in Polish.</span> <span id="s549">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Did you speak any Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I picked some up there.</span> <span id="s552">There were a lot of children who were Polish.</span> <span id="s553">So, it was pretty hard to learn anything, because of all the language.</span> <span id="s554">Nobody was teaching me anything in Hungarian, which was the only language I really knew.</span> <span id="s555">But I learned there.</span> <span id="s556">I was able to speak pretty good Polish by the time I was done there, and German, too.</span> <span id="s557">And anyway, that was the education that we got.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: There was a school within the orphanage itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: That’s what I’m saying, they had some teachers, I guess, who were, before the war who were teachers.</span> <span id="s560">But one was a German, the other one was a Polish, that taught the subject, but in their language, because that’s the only one that they knew how to use, so.</span> <span id="s561">But if you weren’t a Polish child, it didn’t mean nothing to you.</span> <span id="s562">What do I need to learn Polish?</span> <span id="s563">How to spell or whatever Polish.</span> <span id="s564">The German guy, he, I think he taught math, so that was okay, one and one is two, you know, doesn’t make no difference.</span> <span id="s565">As long as you understood what he was trying to say on the blackboard, so you could follow him fairly reasonable.</span> <span id="s566">Anyway they disbanded the orphanage.</span> <span id="s567">And by that time my sister was fifteen and she had to go out and work.</span> <span id="s568">They told her she has to find a job and go to work.</span> <span id="s569">And they took me to a DP camp.</span> <span id="s570">I mean it wasn’t a camp, it was a house in a place called Tabo (ph), in Sweden.</span> <span id="s571">And basically I was on my own.</span> <span id="s572">There was a woman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me.</span> <span id="s573">Look over me.</span> <span id="s574">And they enrolled me in a Swedish school, so now I had to learn Swedish.</span> <span id="s575">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s576">You know.</span> <span id="s577">And went to school in Sweden.</span> <span id="s578">Now I went to one grade in Hungary and what little schooling I got there at the orphanage.</span> <span id="s579">And from there they started me off… I think in sixth, according to my age, which was sixth grade or something like that.</span> <span id="s580">Sixth, seventh grade.</span> <span id="s581">And obviously it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s582">But the children there was nice.</span> <span id="s583">They were fairly friendly for a stranger, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s584">A couple of friends I had there.</span> <span id="s585">One was a little, wanted to be a jockey.</span> <span id="s586">There was a horse farm not far from there.</span> <span id="s587">He and me used to go to the horse farm and try to get, let him ride the horses and stuff.</span> <span id="s588">So, anyway I was there for a while.</span> <span id="s589">And a Jewish family came and they introduced me to them, and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s590">They basically took me home with them, in other words, they were going to be my guardians.</span> <span id="s591">They lived in Stockholm, so we moved to Stockholm.</span> <span id="s592">And they enrolled me in school over there.</span> <span id="s593">They treated me nice, as a matter of fact they wanted to adopt me, but by that time I found my brother and my other sister, Miriam, in Israel.</span> <span id="s594">So I said, “No I don’t want to be adopted.</span> <span id="s595">I’m going to Israel.”</span> <span id="s596">So, that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: How did you find your brother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Through the Red Cross and through the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s599">We looked for Father, too.</span> <span id="s600">And I found my father also.</span> <span id="s601">He went back to Hungary looking for us.</span> <span id="s602">He wrote and said, “Do not come back to Hungary.”</span> <span id="s603">He said, “I’m going back to the United States.</span> <span id="s604">When I get there I want you to join me there.</span> <span id="s605">In the meantime stay where you are.”</span> <span id="s606">But I didn’t want to stay there, so I signed up to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s607">And my sister, I guess by that time she had a boyfriend, whatever, anyway she decided she wanted to stay in Sweden.</span> <span id="s608">She stayed there, and I went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: What made you decide you wanted to go to Israel rather than staying in Sweden as you father had suggested?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Well, because I… I been always close to my older brother, and my older brother and sister was in Israel, so I said, “Well I’ll just go there and wait for them until Father gets to the United States, instead of here.”</span> <span id="s611">So anyway, that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s612">That was in ‘49, in May ‘49, I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s613">The Swedish family, they wanted me to stay and they were going to adopt me and everything.</span> <span id="s614">I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s615">And later on, I’m glad I didn’t, because that guy, my sister told me that the guy and his wife got divorced.</span> <span id="s616">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s617">So, you know, anyway, that’s neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s618">They were nice people, they treated me fine.</span> <span id="s619">As a matter of fact, my thirteen birthday, my Bar Mitzvah, they did that at the big Temple in Stockholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: That was your guardians, who…</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yeah they are the ones who…</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: …arranged that?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s624">But religion is not my thing.</span> <span id="s625">After what I’ve seen, nobody can convince me that faith is worth anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Did they pressure you to do the Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s628">I willingly did that.</span> <span id="s629">I’m just saying I have no religious… I’m not religious of any kind.</span> <span id="s630">I don’t believe in all that stuff.</span> <span id="s631">That’s what the war did to me.</span> <span id="s632">What I’ve seen and everything.</span> <span id="s633">I said, there’s nobody up there watching anything if this can happen here.</span> <span id="s634">That’s me, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: This tape number two, side A of an interview with Paul Schlisser.</span> <span id="s637">So, you were just talking about leaving from Sweden and moving to…</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: … to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: …Israel.</span> <span id="s640">What year did you say that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: That was in ‘49, May of 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">D: Who paid for your travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I think the… as far as I know it was the Jewish Agency or whatever.</span> <span id="s644">You know, Aliyah Tano’ar (ph)which is basically the Jewish Agency gathering up the children, the No’ar (ph), which means the young.</span> <span id="s645">I guess they’re the ones who paid for it.</span> <span id="s646">As far as I know.</span> <span id="s647">I didn’t have the money to pay for it, so they gave me the ticket and I went.</span> <span id="s648">I think, basically what they did, I flew from Sweden to France, and in France the Agency picked me up and took me to a DP camp, I guess.</span> <span id="s649">And from there they loaded us up on a boat.</span> <span id="s650">By that time it wasn’t illegal anymore.</span> <span id="s651">The British were gone.</span> <span id="s652">And they took us with a boat to Haifa.</span> <span id="s653">And we arrived and my brother was waiting on me.</span> <span id="s654">We arrived like today and that evening he was already there, my older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Do you remember that reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah I remember it.</span> <span id="s657">We were glad to see each other and hugged and all that good stuff.</span> <span id="s658">I want to know how the trip was and how he was, how I was, how Illy was and all that.</span> <span id="s659">He said that he’s going to take me to the village where he lives.</span> <span id="s660">The name of it was Kfar Warburg, it was a moshav.</span> <span id="s661">Moshav means that everybody got, owns his own land, got his own farm.</span> <span id="s662">And they just have joint, the milk processing and the equipment, the major equipment and stuff is jointly owned, but each one got his own land and his own farm that he works, that’s a Moshav.</span> <span id="s663">So anyway, that’s where he took me.</span> <span id="s664">The family’s name was Lillieh (ph), they were German Jews, who escaped before, during the Kristallnacht back in ‘39.</span> <span id="s665">They got out of Germany and came to Israel.</span> <span id="s666">So, they are the ones who, he was with them before, when he first came to Israel.</span> <span id="s667">And so anyway that’s the family, and I worked half a day and went to school half a day.</span> <span id="s668">So again I had to learn a new language to go to school.</span> <span id="s669">And basically we went to school in the morning and worked in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: On the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: On the farm, on his farm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: What were you growing?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Well, he had milk cows.</span> <span id="s674">He had about fourteen milking cows, so you had to grow feed for them.</span> <span id="s675">And you had, he grew vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s676">Eggplants.</span> <span id="s677">Cauliflowers, corn, you know, just basically, it wasn’t, the land over there, you don’t have no huge acreage anyway.</span> <span id="s678">You’re talking about… dunam (ph), I guess, I don’t know how to compare it with acres.</span> <span id="s679">But I would say he had no more than maybe fifteen acres of land.</span> <span id="s680">And so he had to raise alfalfa to feed the cows.</span> <span id="s681">One thing he didn’t have to worry about, is that like here you have to cut hay and put it away and all that, so that you would have food for the winter.</span> <span id="s682">Over there it grows year-round, semi-tropic, so you don’t have to worry about not having feed for them.</span> <span id="s683">You just have to make sure that… but we grew hay, you know, alfalfa for… and cut hay to feed the cows, and all that.</span> <span id="s684">Basically I worked out on the farm, plowed, picked tomatoes, picked this and picked that and weeded.</span> <span id="s685">All the things you do on a farm.</span> <span id="s686">Milked cows and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I had a couple of questions from earlier that I didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s688">I wondered if when you were with the family, the Jewish family in Sweden, if they…</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: In Stockholm you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: …in Stockholm, if they asked you, did you talk to them, did they ask you anything about what your experiences had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s694">They never did.</span> <span id="s695">And I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s696">As a matter of fact, you’re probably only about the second or third person I ever talked about, talked about it at all.</span> <span id="s697">First time I ever, well beside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there and they did most of the talking.</span> <span id="s698">And last year, the Jewish Community Center here in Louisville asked me to join them on Yom Ha… Remembrance, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell my story.</span> <span id="s699">So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember.</span> <span id="s700">And so I did.</span> <span id="s701">I went up there and said my piece.</span> <span id="s702">And that was, beside this here, that’s about the only time.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s704">And matter of fact, Professor Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the high schools and speak to the children about my experience and I declined.</span> <span id="s705">I said I just can’t handle it.</span> <span id="s706">I’m not going to constantly dig it out, dig it up.</span> <span id="s707">I just can’t live like that.</span> <span id="s708">I’m just not willing to constantly put myself through that.</span> <span id="s709">So, I don’t, normally don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s710">I want to put it behind me, not in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: What made you agree to talk to me and to talk to the Jewish Community Center?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s713">I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, it’s somebody’s fantasies.</span> <span id="s714">And I’m here to tell you that it did happen.</span> <span id="s715">And I guess that’s probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history.</span> <span id="s716">And if you don’t learn nothing, you don’t learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again.</span> <span id="s717">That was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russians weren’t that much better than the Nazis were.</span> <span id="s718">They had the gulags, they had the camps.</span> <span id="s719">May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings.</span> <span id="s720">That’s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world during this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s721">And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service.</span> <span id="s722">I served in the Israeli Army.</span> <span id="s723">I fought in the Sinai Desert in ‘56.</span> <span id="s724">And so I’ve been through the wringer.</span> <span id="s725">But that wouldn’t affect Israel, doesn’t affect the world.</span> <span id="s726">And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s727">So, that was my main motivation of joining the Service.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in Sweden, did you, I’m trying to think of how to form the question.</span> <span id="s729">But I’m wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution.</span> <span id="s730">Did you have any understanding of what…?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that’s the only thing that… you know.</span> <span id="s732">And then as I got older and I read.</span> <span id="s733">I’m not educated very well.</span> <span id="s734">I finished high school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours.</span> <span id="s735">But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically… I don’t blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in churches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do.</span> <span id="s736">They always kept them outside of the mainstream society.</span> <span id="s737">And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things.</span> <span id="s738">So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them.</span> <span id="s739">And then the church teaching basically demonized them.</span> <span id="s740">So, I don’t think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn’t, didn’t care.</span> <span id="s741">Because it’s supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they’re teaching.</span> <span id="s742">But I guess that wasn’t what, what actually happened.</span> <span id="s743">I’ve seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the wall.</span> <span id="s744">Kill him.</span> <span id="s745">And what human being would do something like that?</span> <span id="s746">And then they go to church to pray?</span> <span id="s747">I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion.</span> <span id="s748">Take a look right now.</span> <span id="s749">Sudan, got a Muslim against the Christians.</span> <span id="s750">Northern Ireland, Catholics against the Protestants.</span> <span id="s751">You go to India, you got the… Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it’s religion.</span> <span id="s752">Iraq, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims.</span> <span id="s753">So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion.</span> <span id="s754">That’s my view.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How does that, how does that translate to your feelings about Israel and protecting Israel?</span> <span id="s756">You fought and risked your life fighting for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, that’s something different, because if there was an Israel before the Second World War, before… this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened.</span> <span id="s758">Because I’m not looking at it as religion, okay?</span> <span id="s759">I look at it as a homeland for a people.</span> <span id="s760">Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people.</span> <span id="s761">And I’m Jewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every people need a homeland.</span> <span id="s762">And that’s what motivated me.</span> <span id="s763">But I always consider myself American, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was American, so I considered myself American.</span> <span id="s764">And he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1906.</span> <span id="s765">And he always told me that he is American and one of these days we’re going to go back to the United States.</span> <span id="s766">So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the United States himself and everything, that in ‘59 I came and joined him in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Had his parents been American or Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: From what I understand and I’m really not positive, but it seems to me, what happened was that his parents or his grandfather, it was him and his father, immigrated to the United States back in the 1800s or somewhere, you know, late 1800s.</span> <span id="s769">And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an aunt, who was born here and never left here.</span> <span id="s770">She’s passed away now in Houston.</span> <span id="s771">But her whole life, she was born in the United States, lived in the United States and passed away in the United States.</span> <span id="s772">So, they lived here, I guess in New York and either during the Depression, or early, they decided that they would be better off and went back.</span> <span id="s773">That’s my understanding as to what happened.</span> <span id="s774">And then my father was still, wasn’t… his sister was old enough that she said no, she’s not going back with them, she’s staying.</span> <span id="s775">My father probably wasn’t old enough, you know, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to Hungary.</span> <span id="s776">That’s my understanding, you know, is what happened.</span> <span id="s777">But I’m not exactly sure as to what year, you know, they came and what year they went back and all that.</span> <span id="s778">But that basically what happened.</span> <span id="s779">Like I say, probably if not for that, that he was born here, I probably wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you, because I would have wound up in Auschwitz in the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: About your early years in Israel, did you feel at all… I don’t know whether this is, well…</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Ask away.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: [Laughing.]</span> <span id="s783">I had read and heard from a couple people that Holocaust survivors in some cases, were discriminated against in Israel or looked down upon by people who had come before the war started.</span> <span id="s784">Did you experience anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, I personally didn’t.</span> <span id="s786">Of course, I was basically with the youth, the youth movement.</span> <span id="s787">It might have happened in some places.</span> <span id="s788">I’m not saying it didn’t.</span> <span id="s789">It might have.</span> <span id="s790">But in my personal experience, like in the village where I was at, there was no, you know, down look.</span> <span id="s791">You pulled your share.</span> <span id="s792">I’ve never been a whiner anyway.</span> <span id="s793">You know, I always pull my share, whatever needs to be done, I’ll go take care of it.</span> <span id="s794">I worked and I went to school.</span> <span id="s795">Pulled guard duty at night with everybody else.</span> <span id="s796">Went with the youth and learned how to use a weapon and at night when the Arabs came and stole cows and stuff, we chased after them.</span> <span id="s797">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s798">And all that stuff.</span> <span id="s799">I was, I personally did not feel that I was in any way looked down at or discriminated.</span> <span id="s800">But could have been better treatment?</span> <span id="s801">Sure, it could have been better treatment for everybody involved.</span> <span id="s802">But, you know, you’re talking about a country just been formed, poor, wasn’t a whole lot of anything there.</span> <span id="s803">And everybody did the best they could with what they had.</span> <span id="s804">Sure I would have liked to have gone to school full time and learned something, had a degree in something, at least had a trade of some kind.</span> <span id="s805">But I didn’t expect that, it was just the way things worked out.</span> <span id="s806">I got no complaints personally.</span> <span id="s807">If there’s some people that say they were discriminated against, might have been.</span> <span id="s808">I have not, my personal, maybe because my brother was already there, you know.</span> <span id="s809">He served in the Palmach, which was their elite troops in those days in Israel.</span> <span id="s810">So, I was, I guess under his protective wings or whatever.</span> <span id="s811">But I personally did not feel any, and my sister was in a kibbutz by then, Miriam.</span> <span id="s812">So, I did not feel that I was discriminated against.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What was the name of the town or the village where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Kfar Warburg.</span> <span id="s815">That was the name of it.</span> <span id="s816">It was in southern Israel, south side of Tel Aviv, quite a way down there.</span> <span id="s817">The whole country in four hours you can traverse it one end to the other on a decent road.</span> <span id="s818">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s819">It wasn’t that, you know, that big a country.</span> <span id="s820">But it was to the south of Tel Aviv, not far from Ashqelon.</span> <span id="s821">So, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: When did you start serving in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: I joined the Israeli Army in ’50… I was seventeen, so let’s see, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty-two, so ‘52 is when I, or the beginning of ‘53 is when I… ‘52.</span> <span id="s824">Because my brother had to sign because I wasn’t old enough and I volunteered, so he had to sign my paper so I could join the service.</span> <span id="s825">So it was ’52, was when I… I know the Korean War was still going on when I joined.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What made you decide to join?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: You mean the Service?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I just wanted to serve.</span> <span id="s830">I don’t know, wasn’t nothing particular.</span> <span id="s831">I just wanted to do my couple of years in, you know, the Service.</span> <span id="s832">Before that I already worked on tractors, worked down with the Bedouins in the Negev.</span> <span id="s833">I plowed their fields for them.</span> <span id="s834">I was the only Jew.</span> <span id="s835">I was about fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s836">Had a .45 on my hip, tractor and my two Bedouins who guarded me.</span> <span id="s837">And I was plowing Sheikh Suleiman, who was their Sheikh, the head of their tribe.</span> <span id="s838">I was plowing his fields for him.</span> <span id="s839">I was the only Jew there.</span> <span id="s840">I wasn’t afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, the individual I worked for, who owned the tractor, he was my boss basically.</span> <span id="s843">I worked for him.</span> <span id="s844">I guess he got the contract with, he got hired by Sheikh Suleiman to plow his fields.</span> <span id="s845">So, we took the tractor down there.</span> <span id="s846">He left me down there to do the work, so I did the work.</span> <span id="s847">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s848">Stayed there for about ten days, I guess.</span> <span id="s849">One night they woke me up and said, “Shhh, there are fedayins (ph) in the area,” which means there are Palestinian Arabs in the area.</span> <span id="s850">So, they woke me up, and they said “We need to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s851">But they protected me.</span> <span id="s852">I mean I got no complaints.</span> <span id="s853">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s854">And sure enough, not long after my boss came with a pick-up truck to pick me up and get me out of there.</span> <span id="s855">They had some problems, infiltrators.</span> <span id="s856">So, anyway.</span> <span id="s857">I had my adventures.</span> <span id="s858">I helped build the phosphate pools down in the Dead Sea.</span> <span id="s859">We built big pools filled up with water and then the sun would evaporate the water and leave the salt.</span> <span id="s860">You made a lot of different product out of that.</span> <span id="s861">The salt is, they got potassium and they got iodine and they got all kind of stuff in it.</span> <span id="s862">They make all kinds of chemicals from that.</span> <span id="s863">So I helped build the pools down there for that.</span> <span id="s864">I helped build the first highway to Elath.</span> <span id="s865">And also helped started bringing the oil pipelines back up from Elath, from the Red Sea up toward Ashqelon.</span> <span id="s866">That was before I left for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: So this was all done while you were in the Service?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No, that was during the Service and after the Service.</span> <span id="s869">I was in the, in the Israeli Army I was in the Engineers.</span> <span id="s870">And the Army engineers built the first road down to Elath, first main road, paved road, regular road.</span> <span id="s871">So, I worked on that for the Army engineers, during ____________.</span> <span id="s872">And the pipeline was after I was already out of the Army and I worked for a company, a construction company, who were building the pipeline.</span> <span id="s873">So, I helped that and also the, I don’t know exactly how you call it, the ponds, basically.</span> <span id="s874">They fill it up with water and let it evaporate.</span> <span id="s875">Helped build them for the company down there, also through the construction company.</span> <span id="s876">I done all kinds of stuff in my life, as far as work.</span> <span id="s877">I dug ditches.</span> <span id="s878">I built walls from Jerusalem stone.</span> <span id="s879">You know, I been supporting myself since I was fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s880">What needed to be done, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: So, the whole time you were in Israel were you planning on coming to the United States eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s883">Like I told you, my dad said to stay in Sweden and I hadn’t seen him since the war time.</span> <span id="s884">Well, I didn’t want to wait in Sweden, so I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s885">And then during ‘56, during the Sinai Campaign, the US Embassy came looking for me, they were going to evacuate me.</span> <span id="s886">But I was already down in the Sinai, fighting, so, you know.</span> <span id="s887">And then they thought that I got killed, so they notified my father that I got killed.</span> <span id="s888">I come home and I check back with the Embassy to find out what the status… because I was waiting for a visa.</span> <span id="s889">The reason it took me until ‘59 to get to the United States, was because there was no visas.</span> <span id="s890">You had to wait.</span> <span id="s891">Right now, all this illegal aliens and all this stuff, and everybody says, “Well, poor guys…” Well, that’s not so, because every time you got illegal alien coming in here that means that somebody who is waiting legally, wants to come in, you know, he can’t come in.</span> <span id="s892">He’s waiting.</span> <span id="s893">So that ain’t right.</span> <span id="s894">But anyway, I was waiting for my legal visa to join my father.</span> <span id="s895">The only reason by ‘59 I finally got one is because in ‘56, the Hungarian Revolt – Remember that?</span> <span id="s896">Against the Russians, and a lot of Hungarians got out of Hungary?</span> <span id="s897">So, they increased the number of visas and all that stuff for the Hungarian refugees, and so that’s the reason why about ‘59 I got, managed to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s898">It wasn’t that I didn’t want to come earlier.</span> <span id="s899">It was a question that I couldn’t legally come to the United States.</span> <span id="s900">So anyway, so… End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Later on I found out I didn’t need all that stuff, that I have… I really didn’t need a visa till if I came back to the United States before I was twenty-four years old, I was automatically a U.S. citizen, because I was considered an American due to my father’s birth.</span> <span id="s902">So anyway, so ‘59 is when I got to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Do you, what else do you remember about, what else happened during the ‘56 war?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: What do you mean what else happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: You haven’t talked in detail about what that experience was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: It’s war.</span> <span id="s907">People get killed.</span> <span id="s908">You get shot at, and basically I was with the Combat Engineers there.</span> <span id="s909">To breach the roads we had to blow up roadblocks and stuff in Rafah.</span> <span id="s910">I was up in the northern section: Rafah, El’Arîsh, Qantara, all the way out to the Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s911">And so anyway, so basically we breached the road and opened it for the armor to get through and we went through.</span> <span id="s912">And basically, the Egyptians didn’t want to fight.</span> <span id="s913">We found tanks, they were still operational, the engine running, just left them.</span> <span id="s914">They just jumped out and ran out barefoot into the desert.</span> <span id="s915">Just left their equipment there.</span> <span id="s916">So… they’re poor ______________, their officers were partying somewhere and they left them there in the trenches.</span> <span id="s917">So anyway, the Egyptian Army in those days anyway, weren’t very strong.</span> <span id="s918">And anyway.</span> <span id="s919">We lost some people, sure we did.</span> <span id="s920">Took a hundred hours for the whole, it took the whole Sinai Desert one hundred hours, that’s all, so.</span> <span id="s921">I did my job, whatever I was supposed to have done.</span> <span id="s922">I did mine and everybody else.</span> <span id="s923">And to understand the Israeli Army you have to realize that they didn’t even have transportation.</span> <span id="s924">And guys who missed their units, they hitchhiked to get to their units, to join them.</span> <span id="s925">You know, in those days anyway, I don’t know about now, but in those days, people knew their duty and you didn’t have to tell them.</span> <span id="s926">They knew what they had to do and it got done.</span> <span id="s927">So, it wasn’t like an experience, sure it wasn’t no pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s928">I came back, I had a beard [Laughing.]</span> <span id="s929">.</span> <span id="s930">And when everybody else came back, because Eisenhower forced, you know, the Israelis to withdraw from the Sinai.</span> <span id="s931">And since I was in the Engineers, I stayed behind.</span> <span id="s932">And what we did, we plowed up all the roads coming back from Sinai, this a-way, and we plowed up all the roads, destroyed all the tracks, train tracks.</span> <span id="s933">We took the train tracks, blew them up and all the bridges, anything to slow them down.</span> <span id="s934">To slow the Egyptian Army from coming back in.</span> <span id="s935">And so we were the last ones out of Sinai.</span> <span id="s936">I guess that’s the reason maybe they thought that I was dead, you know.</span> <span id="s937">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s938">I didn’t come home.</span> <span id="s939">Most everybody was coming home.</span> <span id="s940">I was still down there.</span> <span id="s941">We were the last ones out.</span> <span id="s942">So anyway, that’s the experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Had you been keeping in touch with your father during those years, writing letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yeah, we were exchanging letters, yeah.</span> <span id="s945">And he worked in Newark.</span> <span id="s946">He worked in a store as a salesman and he got remarried, so my stepmother, she worked in a bakery as a saleslady.</span> <span id="s947">She had a son.</span> <span id="s948">She lost one son, too, in the war.</span> <span id="s949">She had one son, he was with them.</span> <span id="s950">And he went to school in New York.</span> <span id="s951">And that’s basically it.</span> <span id="s952">I kept in touch.</span> <span id="s953">And then checked, I went to get a visa and I was working with the U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv and finally got the visa.</span> <span id="s954">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s955">That was in ‘59.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: How did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I flew, one of the Super Constellation, four-engine prop jobs.</span> <span id="s958">Flew from Tel Aviv to France.</span> <span id="s959">And something happened to the plane, and we stayed overnight in France.</span> <span id="s960">But the French Air, they paid for my hotel stay in Paris for the night and all that till the next day.</span> <span id="s961">Then we flew on to Idlewild, now it’s Kennedy.</span> <span id="s962">In those days it was almost new.</span> <span id="s963">And my parents, my dad waited for me there.</span> <span id="s964">And they took us, they lived in Newark in an apartment.</span> <span id="s965">So we got there, my aunt, the one who never left the States, she lived in New York in those days.</span> <span id="s966">No, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s967">No, she didn’t.</span> <span id="s968">She already lived down in Miami.</span> <span id="s969">His son, her son, his name was Milton.</span> <span id="s970">He served in the Second World War as a flight engineer on one of them Dakota airplanes.</span> <span id="s971">He flew mission over the hump in Burma.</span> <span id="s972">So, he was a Second World War veteran.</span> <span id="s973">He’s passed away now.</span> <span id="s974">And my uncle, he served in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s975">My aunt’s husband.</span> <span id="s976">He was with the CB’s, construction battalion.</span> <span id="s977">I arrived in May of ‘59.</span> <span id="s978">My dad said, “We’re going to move down to Florida.”</span> <span id="s979">He had a ‘56 Ford, and so we drove down to Florida.</span> <span id="s980">We towed a U-Haul thing behind us.</span> <span id="s981">And went to work there in… well when I was up in New York I worked for, within a week, I had job, I had work.</span> <span id="s982">Work no problem.</span> <span id="s983">I have never had problem finding work.</span> <span id="s984">I worked for a chemical company, Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company.</span> <span id="s985">We were making erasers in a factory.</span> <span id="s986">Worked for them and then father said we’re going to move down to Florida.</span> <span id="s987">I said, okay.</span> <span id="s988">We moved down to Florida, that was toward the end of ‘59, the winter season.</span> <span id="s989">He worked as a waiter and I worked as a busboy in a hotel down on the beach.</span> <span id="s990">Name of the hotel was Sterling Hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: What was the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: It was Miami Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Miami Beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yeah, and I was down there.</span> <span id="s995">In 1960 I got a letter saying, “Greetings from your neighbors, you just have been drafted.”</span> <span id="s996">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s997">So, I was just barely a year in the United States and I got drafted in the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: So, you were already a citizen before you came?</span> <span id="s999">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1001">I came late.</span> <span id="s1002">I waited for my visa.</span> <span id="s1003">I thought I had to have visa and all that, everybody else said the same thing.</span> <span id="s1004">I just found out, long time later that I could have just come as a visitor.</span> <span id="s1005">As soon as I stepped my foot in the, if I was less than twenty-four years old when I arrived, this way, too, I was less than twenty-four, but if I would have got to the United States before I was twenty-four, I was automatically considered just like a native-born American.</span> <span id="s1006">I didn’t even need a visa.</span> <span id="s1007">Nobody told me and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1008">The only reason I know now is because the Justice Department represented me against the Germans in… what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Restitutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Damages, restitutions, yeah, under the Prince litigation.</span> <span id="s1011">They would only represent people who were, that were considered to be U.S. citizens during the war, okay, and on.</span> <span id="s1012">And I was, by the Justice Department’s own… so the Immigration Service don’t know their own laws, basically.</span> <span id="s1013">But anyway I had to wait till ‘59 till I got visa to get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: How did you feel about being drafted to the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Well, I really didn’t have no bad feeling about it.</span> <span id="s1016">I felt that if I wanted to become a citizen of the United States it’s my obligation to serve, you know, I felt, my country.</span> <span id="s1017">I had no problems with that.</span> <span id="s1018">So the only problem I really had was, you know, to me, basic training and all that was no big deal.</span> <span id="s1019">I been through all that.</span> <span id="s1020">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1021">So, that was no big deal for me.</span> <span id="s1022">But anyway, language, I wasn’t speaking that well English during those days yet.</span> <span id="s1023">I had a good friend, went to basic training together, his name was James B. Smith, J.B.</span> <span id="s1024">He was from North Carolina.</span> <span id="s1025">And he basically took me under his wings and he was teaching me English.</span> <span id="s1026">Anytime I was saying something that wasn’t right, he would usually correct me and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1027">He was like, Mutt and Jeff?</span> <span id="s1028">He was tall, skinny guy, you know, and I was short, stocky.</span> <span id="s1029">And you didn’t have to look far, if you seen one of us there the other one wasn’t too far away, was somewhere nearby.</span> <span id="s1030">So we became really close friends.</span> <span id="s1031">I’m a godfather to one of his daughters.</span> <span id="s1032">Even today we still keep in touch.</span> <span id="s1033">So we really been good friends.</span> <span id="s1034">That was when I first, you know, got in.</span> <span id="s1035">The only thing I didn’t like about it, after basic training and advanced individual training.</span> <span id="s1036">We both were straight leg Infantry and they sent us to Germany.</span> <span id="s1037">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1038">Sent me right back to Germany, so that’s the only part, that was kind of rough on me, you know.</span> <span id="s1039">I got over it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Did you consider, do you think they that would have considered your case if you had objected and asked to be posted somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: They might have, I never tried.</span> <span id="s1042">I’ve never been the kind that wanted special treatment or, you know, special consideration or what have you.</span> <span id="s1043">I’ve never, ever used my, all the twenty-some years in the Service, I’ve never used my personal experience to try to get something different or special consideration or anything else.</span> <span id="s1044">I never asked.</span> <span id="s1045">I never even thought about asking for special consideration because of that.</span> <span id="s1046">They sent me, I went and that’s basically it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Did you have to mingle at all with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Well, I didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s1049">Basically the U.S. got its own bases.</span> <span id="s1050">There’s some Germans who work there on post, but you know, you don’t have to mingle with the German population.</span> <span id="s1051">You got PX, you got snack bar, you got movies, you got a club.</span> <span id="s1052">You got everything on post that you would need.</span> <span id="s1053">So for a long time I didn’t go downtown.</span> <span id="s1054">After a while I said, well, you know, go downtown and look around, whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1055">You can’t lock yourself away.</span> <span id="s1056">Don’t have to be friends with anybody, but you can’t… and after a while you can’t blame a whole nation for what happened, it just doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1057">So I mean I don’t love them.</span> <span id="s1058">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1059">God knows I don’t love them.</span> <span id="s1060">But I have no particular hate for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1061">You can’t hate a whole… if you had a specific individual that you knew was… you could hate them.</span> <span id="s1062">But to me, don’t make no sense to hate a whole nation.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean it just doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1064">But anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Did your other buddies in the Army wonder why you weren’t going to town or did they mostly stay there at the post as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I don’t know if they wondered or not.</span> <span id="s1067">They never asked me personally, you know, about it.</span> <span id="s1068">A lot of them, there was a lot of American guys that didn’t go downtown.</span> <span id="s1069">You know, so I don’t think that was particularly strange.</span> <span id="s1070">If you knew what we went through, then you wouldn’t, you didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s1071">I mean Monday morning, you put your gear on and you marched out to the training area and you trained all week out in the training area.</span> <span id="s1072">And then you came back Thursday night, sometimes late at night and then you cleaned your weapons and stuff after midnight before you even got to bed.</span> <span id="s1073">And the next morning you had PT, you had classes, you had this and that and then you had, Saturday morning you had a full field inspection.</span> <span id="s1074">So you had Saturday afternoon and Sunday, that’s all you had.</span> <span id="s1075">Then Monday you went back to the field.</span> <span id="s1076">So, day and a half, I mean you had to ask who wants to go running around?</span> <span id="s1077">There were a whole lot of other guys who didn’t go a whole lot.</span> <span id="s1078">Some ran around out to the night, the guesthouses and stuff, looking for German girls and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1079">But you know, it wasn’t unusual for guys not to go out.</span> <span id="s1080">You only had about a day and a half to rest and relax.</span> <span id="s1081">So, I don’t think it was anything particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did people in the Army with you know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">I went to, matter of fact, I used to get Saturdays off, Saturday mornings off, while they stood full field inspection.</span> <span id="s1085">I had to lay my stuff out, but I didn’t stand by my bed while the inspection was going on.</span> <span id="s1086">I went to the Saturday morning prayers in the chapel, Jewish Chaplain.</span> <span id="s1087">I went to, Friday night and Saturday morning I went to Chapel for services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: So, you did have some faith at that point, some sense of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Well, I never denied that I was Jewish, my Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s1090">Everybody that knows me, knows that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1091">I’m not hiding anything.</span> <span id="s1092">I’m just… what I’m saying is that I have just… and I believe in God, don’t get me wrong, even to this day.</span> <span id="s1093">But I just do not believe that God really gives a hoot about any particular individual, you know.</span> <span id="s1094">Something created this world.</span> <span id="s1095">But I do not believe that he cares about any particular individual, any… you know, which a lot of faith says that, your personal, whatever, savior or He cares for you, whatever.</span> <span id="s1096">In my view He don’t care for anybody.</span> <span id="s1097">He created and it’s up to you to, you know, to do the best you can.</span> <span id="s1098">He couldn’t care less about anything at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: But would you actually pray when you went to services on Saturday morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1101">I would listen to the sermon and all that stuff, but.</span> <span id="s1102">No, I don’t think I really prayed.</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t think I ever prayed since before the war.</span> <span id="s1104">Well, I did when my father died.</span> <span id="s1105">And when I go out to the… me and my step-brother, we usually meet once a year.</span> <span id="s1106">We go down to Florida because both my father and his mother is buried in cemetery there.</span> <span id="s1107">And so, yes I say prayer for the dead at his grave.</span> <span id="s1108">That I do, not because I believe, but because, to honor him, you know, but it’s not the same.</span> <span id="s1109">So anyway.</span> <span id="s1110">That is just me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all in the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes, well there were always some, who hated everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s1113">I really, didn’t bother me any.</span> <span id="s1114">I mean they didn’t bother me personally, but I heard them talking, you know.</span> <span id="s1115">I guess some didn’t know I was Jewish initially.</span> <span id="s1116">Jewish jokes and this and that.</span> <span id="s1117">But that, it didn’t bother me any, and once they knew who I was, they won’t do it in front of me.</span> <span id="s1118">Once they knew I was Jewish they did not tell jokes in front of me or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1119">I don’t know whether out of respect for me or they knew if they did then me and him going to go to Fist City.</span> <span id="s1120">I don’t know which.</span> <span id="s1121">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1122">Anyway they did not.</span> <span id="s1123">So, I personally I really can’t tell, say that… I wasn’t prosecuted or anything.</span> <span id="s1124">I wasn’t threatened or anything in that sense.</span> <span id="s1125">Insensitivity?</span> <span id="s1126">Sure, but, you know, that’s everyday life.</span> <span id="s1127">Doesn’t bother me any.</span> <span id="s1128">Once they knew I was Jewish, then I don’t ever, never remember a guy twice telling jokes in front of me.</span> <span id="s1129">And if he was a buddy of mine, then fine.</span> <span id="s1130">I got a Jewish joke for you.</span> <span id="s1131">I says, “That’s okay, let’s hear it.”</span> <span id="s1132">But that was friendly banter not out of malicious, you know, hurtful type of thing.</span> <span id="s1133">So that’s quite different.</span> <span id="s1134">No, I can’t, honestly can’t say that I was in any way discriminated or treated unfairly or differently because I’m Jewish while I was in the Service.</span> <span id="s1135">I really, honestly can’t say that.</span> <span id="s1136">I don’t know maybe I was just fortunate, you know, the units that I was with.</span> <span id="s1137">Or you know, what I can answer… matter of fact, once I had a Jewish 1st Sergeant.</span> <span id="s1138">I had a Jewish guy working for me later on when I got up in the grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Did you, well you kind of, you entered the Army at time when…</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Cold War.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Cold War and I’m just wondering how you saw that and then also I know there were so many issues going on about civil rights for African-Americans.</span> <span id="s1142">And I know the Army was one of the first really to integrate…</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No, that was before me.</span> <span id="s1144">I mean integration started before I got into the Service.</span> <span id="s1145">The integration started with Truman during the Korean War.</span> <span id="s1146">Prior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to integrate its units.</span> <span id="s1147">Because before you had separate black, separate… but we had a lot of racial problems even when I first got into the Service in the sixties.</span> <span id="s1148">As a matter of fact, we had a race riot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1149">Because, you know, for me, since I did not, wasn’t raised with black, first time I ever seen blacks was when I got to the United States.</span> <span id="s1150">I had no prejudice.</span> <span id="s1151">I wasn’t raised with any kind of prejudice against anybody.</span> <span id="s1152">So, I basically, as I always, I would take an individual for himself.</span> <span id="s1153">You know, I rate an individual for the individual.</span> <span id="s1154">If he deserve respect, he got respect.</span> <span id="s1155">If I didn’t care for him, whether it’s white, black, whatever, then I didn’t care for him.</span> <span id="s1156">It wasn’t because of his race.</span> <span id="s1157">It’s because I didn’t care for his character or his behavior or, you now.</span> <span id="s1158">That’s the way, you know, it was for me.</span> <span id="s1159">But when I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army.</span> <span id="s1160">I don’t know if you understand what a Brown Boot Army was.</span> <span id="s1161">But Brown Boot Army, you had… basically, we had, like, our Company, we had a room that was empty.</span> <span id="s1162">There wasn’t a stitch of furniture, anything, it was an empty room.</span> <span id="s1163">If you had any problem with anybody, you and him just went into the room and settled your business with your fists.</span> <span id="s1164">That’s the way things were done.</span> <span id="s1165">We had a Platoon Sergeant, his name was Cooper.</span> <span id="s1166">He was half Indian and half Irish.</span> <span id="s1167">And he was about 6’4” and weighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere around there.</span> <span id="s1168">And you messed up and he’d take you into the room there and put you through the woodshed.</span> <span id="s1169">So he had a very well behaved Platoon.</span> <span id="s1170">Everybody worked together.</span> <span id="s1171">You can’t legislate away prejudice.</span> <span id="s1172">That’s something that you learn at home from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever, church, whatever.</span> <span id="s1173">What you can do with the Army is, you force civility.</span> <span id="s1174">Regardless of whether you like him or not, while you are in the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the way you expect to be treated.</span> <span id="s1175">And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that was my guiding principle.</span> <span id="s1176">I didn’t care whether… I say, “I don’t care if you like him or not.</span> <span id="s1177">That’s neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s1178">You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other.</span> <span id="s1179">Once you get to know each other maybe you like him.”</span> <span id="s1180">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1181">That’s all you can expect.</span> <span id="s1182">You can’t legislate love or you can’t legislate racial prejudice away.</span> <span id="s1183">That’s silly to even think about it.</span> <span id="s1184">Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1185">I don’t hate gays.</span> <span id="s1186">Bible says that’s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was gay that I had to fight with.</span> <span id="s1187">I might have to, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</span> <span id="s1188">Or I had to go to the shower with him, if I know he is gay I would be uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1189">Not a question that I hate him.</span> <span id="s1190">That question doesn’t make no sense, because in the Service you live so close together, you know?</span> <span id="s1191">There is no little shower stall where you go in in your privacy.</span> <span id="s1192">They got one big room with a bunch of shower heads where everybody takes showers.</span> <span id="s1193">And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay.</span> <span id="s1194">And that’s the problem, not that anybody has anything against gays.</span> <span id="s1195">In my view anyway.</span> <span id="s1196">And you got AIDS, you don’t want to have to deal with somebody out in the battlefield if you get shot if you know he is gay.</span> <span id="s1197">You’re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do.</span> <span id="s1198">And then catch AIDS from him, you know.</span> <span id="s1199">Those are the issues that people don’t think about when they condemn the Armed Forces, well they’re prejudice or whatever.</span> <span id="s1200">There’s a lot more to it than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Were you surprised at all by some of the racism that you found in this country that is founded on principles of equality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yeah, I was surprised.</span> <span id="s1203">You know, because… I really didn’t realize it till I got to this country due to the fact that I never encountered any black people.</span> <span id="s1204">So when I worked for Fiber, for Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company, they had blacks there and all that.</span> <span id="s1205">I was friends with, I treated them, like everybody with respect just like I treat everybody else.</span> <span id="s1206">I got to be friend with one of them.</span> <span id="s1207">But I noticed that every time like when you sit down to eat or this and that or lunch, or whatever, you would see all the whites congregating.</span> <span id="s1208">All the blacks would go sit over there.</span> <span id="s1209">There was no interaction between the races.</span> <span id="s1210">That kind of struck me funny.</span> <span id="s1211">So, I sit down and I sit down with… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Paul Schlisser.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: So anyway, the Fiber… I worked with a fellow worker who was black, and when everybody went to lunch I noticed all the whites were sitting on one side and all the blacks were sitting somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1214">And the guy I worked with, he sat down to eat lunch.</span> <span id="s1215">I just got my lunch and sat down beside him.</span> <span id="s1216">He kind of looked at me a little funny.</span> <span id="s1217">I didn’t realize there was anything wrong with it, because, you know, I had no idea it was not supposed to be that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Did you keep on sitting with him after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Sure, yeah, every morning, every day lunch we usually, he and me, we’d sit down and have lunch and talk.</span> <span id="s1220">He was asking me about Israel and I was telling him about Israel.</span> <span id="s1221">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1222">And you know, he would tell me about what they were doing in Newark, his neighborhood and all that.</span> <span id="s1223">Yeah, I mean, you know, we became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Where were you posted in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: My first tour I was Bamberg.</span> <span id="s1226">I was with the 1st Battle Group, 15th Infantry.</span> <span id="s1227">And that’s the same outfit that Eddie Murphy was in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s1228">The most decorated individual in the Second, Third Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s1229">And Eisenhower was in the same outfit, at one time Company Commander a long, long time ago.</span> <span id="s1230">So, it’s a famous unit and I served it two years in the Straight Leg Infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: And you were on another tour in Germany later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: At the time I got out… I was draftee, so when I finished my two years I got out and went home, back to Miami and looked around and decided I was going to go into heating and air conditioning.</span> <span id="s1233">And so I went to school and then I had to work.</span> <span id="s1234">And I said, “Well this ain’t going to get it.”</span> <span id="s1235">No time for myself or anything else.</span> <span id="s1236">Went to school, from school you went to work and next morning got up, went to school, went to work.</span> <span id="s1237">You had no time for yourself, nothing.</span> <span id="s1238">So I said, “Well I’m going to go back into the Army, this time voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1239">I’ll make the Army a career.”</span> <span id="s1240">Because I liked the Service, its purpose.</span> <span id="s1241">And during that time we went up to a place called L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway.</span> <span id="s1242">But it was up on the Czechoslovakian border and there was a bridge there that was mined.</span> <span id="s1243">And you went up there, pulled your duty for a month at a time.</span> <span id="s1244">And if the balloon ever would go up, or the East Germans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the bridge.</span> <span id="s1245">It was all mined and all that.</span> <span id="s1246">So then I realized, I seen the border and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the Russians were back to where the Nazis were.</span> <span id="s1247">Plus I read, I don’t know then or a little later, Solzhenitsyn’s book about the gulags and all that.</span> <span id="s1248">And I said, heck, they’re no better than the Germans were.</span> <span id="s1249">So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service.</span> <span id="s1250">So, I re-enlisted and lo and behold they went and sent me back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1251">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1252">That was my second tour in Germany.</span> <span id="s1253">We were sent to Kaiserslautern and spent three years there.</span> <span id="s1254">It was an Army Depot.</span> <span id="s1255">I went into the maintenance field there.</span> <span id="s1256">Then I came back, went to the 18th Airborne Corps in Bragg, North Carolina.</span> <span id="s1257">And from Bragg, North Carolina there was a little altercation in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s1258">There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82nd Airborne and I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Company and we were in there for support.</span> <span id="s1259">My platoon went in to support the 82nd in their operation in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s1260">That was ‘65.</span> <span id="s1261">Came back from there, our unit was declared D-1, which means that we were alerted that we were going to get shipped to ‘Nam.</span> <span id="s1262">So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1263">That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment, inoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at Fort Bragg got so big that they told us to unpack our stuff and go back to work.</span> <span id="s1264">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1265">So, we went back to work and then they started taking individuals.</span> <span id="s1266">Like me, they took me, not me, but from the unit just individuals and shipped them to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1267">So 1966, I was sent to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1268">I was there in the Central Highlands for a year.</span> <span id="s1269">And say well I’m just going to go back to the States and get shipped back here again, so I might as well extend.</span> <span id="s1270">So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division, support of the Korean Tiger Division, along Highway 1, between Bomber 2 and Elza English (ph).</span> <span id="s1271">Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in support of them.</span> <span id="s1272">In ‘68 I came back to, from ‘66 through ‘68, I was in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1273">I came back from Vietnam in, I think it was November ‘68 and was assigned to Fort Knox.</span> <span id="s1274">I reported in, in December ‘68 to Fort Knox and I became an instructor in the Armor School.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: About Vietnam, you had, you had by then already fought in a war and then been through a war as a victim and the war you fought in you obviously had, in Israel you felt passionate about the cause.</span> <span id="s1276">And how did you feel about the cause in Vietnam?</span> <span id="s1277">By that point were you, were you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: No, I was all for the war.</span> <span id="s1279">I believe we did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1280">And I still believe we did the right thing, actually.</span> <span id="s1281">Except you can’t fight a war when the people are not with you.</span> <span id="s1282">To me that was the thing, because we were justified in what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1283">I mean the North Koreans were attacking the South and it proved, I mean, it shamefully, the reporters and everything, they all twisted everything to suit their views.</span> <span id="s1284">But in fact, we were right.</span> <span id="s1285">The North Koreans basically, if not for us, they probably would have gobbled up all of Southeast Asia, the Communists.</span> <span id="s1286">They wound up, years later, they took over Cambodia.</span> <span id="s1287">Laos, they already controlled.</span> <span id="s1288">So basically the dominant theory was right, even though the reporters disputed it.</span> <span id="s1289">So, we stood up against the Communists.</span> <span id="s1290">And that’s eventually after Reagan, finally they collapsed.</span> <span id="s1291">But we basically contained them and that was Truman’s policy, containing the Communists from spreading.</span> <span id="s1292">If we wouldn’t have opposed them, heck probably over two-thirds of the world today would have been all in the communist top.</span> <span id="s1293">You know, so, in my view we did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1294">I know a lot of people opposed it.</span> <span id="s1295">And I got called a baby killer when I came back on leave from ‘Nam.</span> <span id="s1296">After my first year there I extended, so they gave me thirty days’ leave.</span> <span id="s1297">So I came in, in Fort Lewis, Washington and everybody said, “Change clothes.</span> <span id="s1298">Get in civilian clothes, don’t go out in the airport in the clothes.”</span> <span id="s1299">I said, “I fought for this country in these clothes, it was my uniform.</span> <span id="s1300">I’ll be doggone if I’m going to change clothes.</span> <span id="s1301">I’m going home in uniform.”</span> <span id="s1302">“Oh, you’re crazy, you’re crazy.”</span> <span id="s1303">“That’s okay.”</span> <span id="s1304">Anyway I went and I went to Seattle to the airport and there were Hare Krishna and all them other ones.</span> <span id="s1305">And, “Baby killer!”</span> <span id="s1306">I went and punched him in the mouth and knocked him down.</span> <span id="s1307">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1308">A cop was standing there looking, he didn’t, he just smiled, he didn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s1309">And I just kept walking.</span> <span id="s1310">Don’t call me no baby killer.</span> <span id="s1311">I never killed no baby.</span> <span id="s1312">I came home in my uniform, and I hauled back to ‘Nam after a month leave, but on my uniform and went back.</span> <span id="s1313">I believe firmly in, you know, I’m not hiding.</span> <span id="s1314">I think we did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1315">I know a lot of people disagree.</span> <span id="s1316">But it’s not true.</span> <span id="s1317">We didn’t lose a single battle in ‘Nam.</span> <span id="s1318">Not a single, they can’t point to one single engagement that the United States Army or the Marine Corps, the United States Forces lost.</span> <span id="s1319">Not a single one.</span> <span id="s1320">Every battle that we fought against the North Vietnamese we won.</span> <span id="s1321">But they made it out that we lost, and we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1322">The people who lost is the comm… the politicians here in Washington.</span> <span id="s1323">Because they first of all tied one hand behind your back and said you can only fight with one hand.</span> <span id="s1324">And you don’t go to war that way.</span> <span id="s1325">It’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1326">So anyway, so yeah, I thought it was justified.</span> <span id="s1327">I was for the Vietnam War and I still say it was justified.</span> <span id="s1328">Everything we found out up to now it just reinforces my view that we were justified in doing it.</span> <span id="s1329">Not the way we did it.</span> <span id="s1330">Now, I agree we should never have fought the way we did.</span> <span id="s1331">We should have gone in with the purpose of winning and we should have won.</span> <span id="s1332">The way you did that is you gone into North Vietnam and kicked their butt and got it over with.</span> <span id="s1333">Instead of just, you know, “Well, you can’t get into Cambodia, you can’t bomb this, you can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s1334">You can’t fight no war that a-way and win.</span> <span id="s1335">Crazy.</span> <span id="s1336">Just like, you know, I was interviewed by WAVE 3 TV.</span> <span id="s1337">They wanted to know about Kosovo, what my views were.</span> <span id="s1338">I told them, I said, “Well I’m not talking for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1339">You want my view, I’ll talk for myself.</span> <span id="s1340">My view.”</span> <span id="s1341">And I said, “First of all, anybody said that is a genocide is a liar.</span> <span id="s1342">There was no genocide in Kosovo.”</span> <span id="s1343">And now it’s proved out, it’s true.</span> <span id="s1344">There wasn’t any.</span> <span id="s1345">Sure, I’m not saying there wasn’t atrocities.</span> <span id="s1346">But there’s a big difference between atrocities and genocide.</span> <span id="s1347">I told them, “I wish they would have taken my family and put them on a passenger train and take them to the border and put us off.</span> <span id="s1348">All of us would have been together.”</span> <span id="s1349">You know.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t call that genocide.</span> <span id="s1351">Sure they killed some here, killed there, but that’s atrocities they did to scare the population so they would run.</span> <span id="s1352">That’s a long ways from genocide.</span> <span id="s1353">Now Cambodia, that was genocide.</span> <span id="s1354">Did anybody open their mouth and say anything or do anything, where it really counted?</span> <span id="s1355">No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1356">You know.</span> <span id="s1357">To me, we have no business in Kosovo, that stuff been going on now for hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s1358">And even while we sitting there, you know, they killing each other.</span> <span id="s1359">The minute we move out of there, we be there a hundred years from now, we be still sitting there to keep them apart.</span> <span id="s1360">They need to settle themselves.</span> <span id="s1361">And same thing in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s1362">Bosnia, I don’t care what anybody says.</span> <span id="s1363">The minute European forces get out of there, United States and NATO get out of Bosnia, they’ll be right at each other’s throat.</span> <span id="s1364">And they say Kosovo, you know, ethnic cleansing.</span> <span id="s1365">Well, where were we when Croatia forced out over half a million Serbs?</span> <span id="s1366">We didn’t say a word, so what is the difference here?</span> <span id="s1367">The Croats I hate.</span> <span id="s1368">They were with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1369">I mean they were allies to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1370">We caused, the United States caused most of the stuff that’s going on in Balkan now.</span> <span id="s1371">It’s our fault.</span> <span id="s1372">Okay?</span> <span id="s1373">When Croatia, when Tito died and Croatia was the first one to declare that they are, their independence.</span> <span id="s1374">Without asking any questions, anything, right away we jumped in and recognized them as independent country.</span> <span id="s1375">Okay?</span> <span id="s1376">Well, they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War, including, plus Jews.</span> <span id="s1377">The Croats.</span> <span id="s1378">Okay?</span> <span id="s1379">You think that the last of the Serbs are going, who live there, are going to agree to come again under the rule of the Croats?</span> <span id="s1380">You got to be crazy.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, you got to know the history of the world before you meddle.</span> <span id="s1382">And if you don’t understand what the history is, they got no business meddling in there where you don’t know what the hell you’re doing.</span> <span id="s1383">That’s my view anyway.</span> <span id="s1384">I’m very upset about it, because I don’t think that, you know, we had any business in there at all.</span> <span id="s1385">But anyway, when they asked me I told them, I said there was no, you know, genocide there.</span> <span id="s1386">There might have been atrocities, but there’s no genocide from what I consider, you know.</span> <span id="s1387">They were comparing it to the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Is that why they were asking you, because they knew about your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1390">They had, they taped the thing when I was talking at the Jewish Community Center on the Remembrance.</span> <span id="s1391">So they knew my background.</span> <span id="s1392">So they came.</span> <span id="s1393">I told them I’m not talking for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1394">You know, matter of fact, I’ve had very little contact with the Jewish community, but if you want to know my opinion, personal opinion, I’ll gladly tell you what I think.</span> <span id="s1395">And that’s exactly what I told them.</span> <span id="s1396">So, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Did you, how long did it, it’s pretty clear that you had to really believe in this country and in its founding principles in order to do the kinds of service that you’ve done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Did you have that right away?</span> <span id="s1400">Is that something that you came to this country with or is it something that developed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: No, I came with it to this country.</span> <span id="s1402">I’ve always believed that the United States represents the freedom of the Free World.</span> <span id="s1403">In other words, even as a, when I was, right after the war in Sweden, you know.</span> <span id="s1404">And some of the children in the orphanage, whatever, they were for the Russians, the communists, Left inclination.</span> <span id="s1405">We always had big argument, even as a little boy then, and I was always defending the United States, because I felt, you know with my dad being from, born here and everything, I felt, you know, as an American, [Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1406">even though I had never been here.</span> <span id="s1407">Anyway, I felt a kinship and I always believed that the United States basically represents the human freedom.</span> <span id="s1408">And I still do, you know.</span> <span id="s1409">And it’s fine with me.</span> <span id="s1410">I have no problem with somebody like Joan Baez and all the other ones who opposed the war.</span> <span id="s1411">That’s why we fought.</span> <span id="s1412">I mean, they have the right to speak their view.</span> <span id="s1413">They’re Americans and I respect their views.</span> <span id="s1414">I might not agree with it, but I respect it.</span> <span id="s1415">I cannot expect, accept somebody like Jane Fonda, who went to North Vietnam, you know, with North Vietnamese troops and there was prisoners of war in the Hanoi Hilton and stuff.</span> <span id="s1416">And they went in to look at them.</span> <span id="s1417">Any show that she is in, that is not on my TV.</span> <span id="s1418">I will not.</span> <span id="s1419">I’ll turn the station.</span> <span id="s1420">I will not have anything that Jane Fonda has played in, movie, whatever.</span> <span id="s1421">It may be the greatest movie in the world.</span> <span id="s1422">It’s not going to play on my TV.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: You think the people who were protesting the war just didn’t understand the nature of war itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1425">They were misled in my view by the reporting that was going on here.</span> <span id="s1426">Obviously none of them wanted to go to fight.</span> <span id="s1427">And so if you don’t want to go to fight, what do you do?</span> <span id="s1428">You oppose and you riot and you do everything else you can to get out of it.</span> <span id="s1429">I don’t know what the motive… I’m not setting any alterior motives.</span> <span id="s1430">It might have been very noble motives for them to oppose it.</span> <span id="s1431">I’m not condemning anybody.</span> <span id="s1432">I respect Muhammad Ali.</span> <span id="s1433">He opposed the Vietnam War, but he had the courage of his convictions.</span> <span id="s1434">He stayed in this country.</span> <span id="s1435">He said I won’t fight because I’m not, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s1436">And was willing to go to jail if he had to for what he believed in.</span> <span id="s1437">I respect that.</span> <span id="s1438">I cannot respect someone like Clinton, you know, who did everything he could to stay out and then he lies about it.</span> <span id="s1439">You know, what kind of principle is that?</span> <span id="s1440">He’s not a principled person to begin with.</span> <span id="s1441">That’s my view.</span> <span id="s1442">I always voted.</span> <span id="s1443">Every election I always vote.</span> <span id="s1444">I believe in participating.</span> <span id="s1445">As a matter of fact, I’m just reading a book about the history of Democracy in the United States, from back before the colonies, how the Democracy developed.</span> <span id="s1446">Just reading the book right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: When and how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1449">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1450">I was stationed here in Fort Knox in ‘69, the beginning of ‘69.</span> <span id="s1451">And I had a friend, Larry, and he was from Bristol, Tennessee.</span> <span id="s1452">And he would always ask me to go home with him.</span> <span id="s1453">And I said, “Nah, I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1454">What do I go over there for?</span> <span id="s1455">I didn’t lose anything there.”</span> <span id="s1456">So months later his car broke down and he had no way… he was married and his wife was back in Bristol.</span> <span id="s1457">And he had no way to get home.</span> <span id="s1458">So, I said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1459">All these months you’ve been asking me to go with you home and all that, so I’ll take you home this weekend.”</span> <span id="s1460">And we come back… I worked with him on his car, trying to get it fixed.</span> <span id="s1461">We couldn’t get it fixed in time.</span> <span id="s1462">So, I said, “Well, I’ll take you home.”</span> <span id="s1463">That’s the way it went.</span> <span id="s1464">So he stopped on the way home, telling his wife that he’s bringing me, says, “Why don’t you get him a date while he’s there?”</span> <span id="s1465">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1466">Okay.</span> <span id="s1467">That sort of guy.</span> <span id="s1468">That’s the exact way it happened.</span> <span id="s1469">So we got there and then Helen was, that evening, we got there late in the evening, late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1470">That evening went out to the VFW Club to dance and drink.</span> <span id="s1471">Anyway, she was there.</span> <span id="s1472">And then, that was April, and I think a week or ten days later or two weeks later was the Kentucky Derby.</span> <span id="s1473">So, Ray’s wife was going to come up here, so Helen said, “Well, I’ll come with you.”</span> <span id="s1474">You know, so, “Okay,” so, one thing led to another.</span> <span id="s1475">So that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s1476">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1477">It’s one of those freaky, unintentional, you know, something that you never…</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: In July of ‘69, so I think about three months after we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: What kind of ceremony did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Just a civil.</span> <span id="s1482">She wanted a church wedding.</span> <span id="s1483">Her pastor wouldn’t marry us because I was Jewish and she was Presbyterian, whatever.</span> <span id="s1484">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1485">So we had just a civil service, civil ceremony, which was fine with me.</span> <span id="s1486">I didn’t want no church wedding anyway or any kind of religious ceremony, anyway.</span> <span id="s1487">So we just had a civil marriage, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: You said a little earlier how you really, haven’t talked much about your history during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Did you talk with your wife at all about it during those early days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: No.</span> <span id="s1492">I told her I was in concentration and stuff, but I never mentioned anything about it, no.</span> <span id="s1493">I think the first time she ever heard it, is was when Dr. Dickstein, Professor Dickstein was here from the Shoah Foundation for the interview.</span> <span id="s1494">I think that was the first time she ever heard anything about it.</span> <span id="s1495">I don’t talk, not just to her, I just don’t talk about it, period.</span> <span id="s1496">I want it behind me, not in front of me.</span> <span id="s1497">I don’t want to live… my sister been twice in the nuthouse, the one in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1498">She lives in the past all the time, that’s what she lives in.</span> <span id="s1499">She can’t get over it.</span> <span id="s1500">I don’t want to be like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: You feel like in a way like looking back too much would make you less healthy mentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: I get nightmares, my dear.</span> <span id="s1503">When I talk about the stuff, for a week after that I got nightmares every night.</span> <span id="s1504">I didn’t tell you all kind of stuff that I could have told you, but I don’t want to, because I don’t want to dig it up.</span> <span id="s1505">I seen old man get shot right in front of me, old guy with a beard, looked like my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1506">On the march to Budapest he couldn’t walk, just shot him like nothing.</span> <span id="s1507">I just, you know, doesn’t do nothing good.</span> <span id="s1508">And I can’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s1509">I can’t live like that with the nightmare constantly on my mind.</span> <span id="s1510">I just put it behind me.</span> <span id="s1511">I closed it down as tight as I can close it down and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1512">I’m willing to step forward when she asked me to, you know.</span> <span id="s1513">And like I said, the main reason I did that because I feel that at least I got to go on record that it did happen.</span> <span id="s1514">That it’s not somebody’s fantasy and it’s not, you know, somebody made it up.</span> <span id="s1515">People say that it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1516">That it did happen.</span> <span id="s1517">So I felt that was my obligation do, but that’s all.</span> <span id="s1518">I mean I’m not going to be living in that.</span> <span id="s1519">I refuse to do that.</span> <span id="s1520">I’m just not…</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: I respect that.</span> <span id="s1522">I don’t want to make you feel like I am pushing for something that you don’t want to talk about.</span> <span id="s1523">Of course, you know what you’re willing to talk about and what you’re not.</span> <span id="s1524">But I also was, I’m interested, you had mentioned a little earlier that you’re not very, you’re not very connected with the Jewish community here in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s1526">I think I know a total of two, three people, beside Professor Dickstein and her husband.</span> <span id="s1527">I know Doctor Freiger, he’s a psychiatrist at the UL, University of Louisville, Mr. Grossmann and a couple of workers at the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1528">And that’s basically all the Jewish people that I know here in Louisville.</span> <span id="s1529">Because most of my friends are from the Army and none of them are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1530">And I probably wouldn’t fit in very well with my views and my way of thinking.</span> <span id="s1531">I wouldn’t fit very well in with the Jewish community to be perfectly honest with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: I was interested because I think in some places where you have a large, I mean for example, when I’ve spoken with Holocaust survivors who live in New York City, where there are many other Holocaust survivors, they tend to really…</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Get together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: …band together more.</span> <span id="s1535">Whereas I think a lot of the people I’ve talked to here are more, you know, just leading their own lives and it’s not as important to them to have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: No, to me, I don’t search out other Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1537">As a matter of fact, I met a lady at the meeting with, what’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Martin Goldfarb… Goldberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Yeah, that she was from the same town as me, Debrecen.</span> <span id="s1540">And she was also a survivor.</span> <span id="s1541">And she didn’t know my family, because I was too small to remember.</span> <span id="s1542">She was, must have been, probably my sister’s age, maybe a year or two older than her during that time.</span> <span id="s1543">We talked.</span> <span id="s1544">But she was also liberated in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1545">But no, I don’t have any, first of all, it’s too far away for me to drive all the way out there just for programs and stuff.</span> <span id="s1546">There is no connection between me and my view of things and… most of the Jewish Community Center, they’re mostly Americans, who were born here and raised here.</span> <span id="s1547">Who have never been through anything like we have.</span> <span id="s1548">There’s absolutely no connection between us that, you know, that we can… see my life experience is different than most of theirs.</span> <span id="s1549">So, we have really nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1550">I’m not a businessman.</span> <span id="s1551">I’ve never been in business, never plan on being in business.</span> <span id="s1552">I couldn’t sell you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst.</span> <span id="s1553">I’d give you a glass of water, but I wouldn’t sell it to you.</span> <span id="s1554">I’m just a different type of person.</span> <span id="s1555">So I just, wouldn’t fit in there.</span> <span id="s1556">I go off to my own little drum.</span> <span id="s1557">I’m involved with the veterans of this state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Tape three, side B.</span> <span id="s1560">You work with the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: I work with the veterans of this state.</span> <span id="s1562">I volunteer for Kentucky Center for Veteran’s Affairs as a counselor, veteran claim, help file claims and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1563">I’m also Vice-State Legislative Representative for Non-Commissioned Officers Association.</span> <span id="s1564">So, that keeps me busy.</span> <span id="s1565">I’m an official briefer for my association out at Fort Knox.</span> <span id="s1566">I go out to the units and give them classes on VA benefits and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1567">I do volunteer work under the Retirement Service Office on Post at Fort Knox.</span> <span id="s1568">And every time I have a Second World War veteran, I can help them it makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s1569">Even though I wasn’t liberated by American troops, but you know, I know that he had a hand in liberating me, you know.</span> <span id="s1570">So I’m glad when I can help one of them.</span> <span id="s1571">So, that’s what I do.</span> <span id="s1572">I try to help veterans as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1573">That’s my thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: When did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: I retired medically in ‘83.</span> <span id="s1576">I had two heart attacks and I had my colon removed.</span> <span id="s1577">The VA rated me at two hundred percent, not a hundred.</span> <span id="s1578">They can only get a hundred, but if you add all my stuff together, you get two hundred percent.</span> <span id="s1579">I was exposed to Agent Orange.</span> <span id="s1580">They sprayed that stuff down on me.</span> <span id="s1581">We’re watching this thing fly over us and spray.</span> <span id="s1582">We were underneath it.</span> <span id="s1583">So, yeah, I’m basically a hundred percent disabled rated since ‘84, June, July of ‘83.</span> <span id="s1584">That’s when they removed my colon.</span> <span id="s1585">I’ve got a plastic bag.</span> <span id="s1586">That didn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s1587">I just keep on trucking.</span> <span id="s1588">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1589">I’m a tough dude.</span> <span id="s1590">I’ve got diabetes.</span> <span id="s1591">Nobody in my family has diabetes, never had.</span> <span id="s1592">Again now it comes out, there’s a study going on that shows that guys exposed to Agent Orange have twice or three times as high a chance of getting diabetes as the normal population.</span> <span id="s1593">So, I don’t know if that’s what caused it or something else, but anyway.</span> <span id="s1594">So, I got heart disease.</span> <span id="s1595">I got colon gone.</span> <span id="s1596">I got diabetes.</span> <span id="s1597">Taking about twenty-some pills a day.</span> <span id="s1598">But I ain’t quit.</span> <span id="s1599">I’m still going.</span> <span id="s1600">I’m sixty-five, will be in November and until God lets me stay around I will do the best I can and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: You have one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: One son, he’s adopted.</span> <span id="s1603">He’s not mine.</span> <span id="s1604">I adopted him.</span> <span id="s1605">He was my wife’s child.</span> <span id="s1606">He was just a young boy, and his name is Anthony Keith Schlisser.</span> <span id="s1607">I don’t have any children of my own.</span> <span id="s1608">Anyway, not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Did your son ever ask you about your past?</span> <span id="s1610">Do you ever talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1612">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s1613">With him I talked about it, not in particular details, just in general terms, so that he’ll understand where I’m coming from.</span> <span id="s1614">And what my views are and why I got my views the way I got them and all that.</span> <span id="s1615">Yeah, we are pretty close, him and me.</span> <span id="s1616">We understand each other.</span> <span id="s1617">We are good friends.</span> <span id="s1618">We are close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Do you have anything else that you would like to say that I haven’t asked you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1621">I like Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1622">I made my home here, and I feel like I’m a Kentuckian.</span> <span id="s1623">‘68, I’ve been living here off and on just about.</span> <span id="s1624">Since ‘83 when I retired, I’ve been living here continuously since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: What do you like about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: The open space.</span> <span id="s1627">I hate cities, people on top of each other.</span> <span id="s1628">I like feeling the open space.</span> <span id="s1629">I like the country.</span> <span id="s1630">And I like the hunting and fishing, used to, I’m not much able anymore.</span> <span id="s1631">I used to like to go out fishing and hunting.</span> <span id="s1632">I like country music.</span> <span id="s1633">I like Bluegrass.</span> <span id="s1634">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1635">Weird for a Jew, right?</span> <span id="s1636">But anyway… I used to square dance.</span> <span id="s1637">I’m just me.</span> <span id="s1638">I’m not anybody else.</span> <span id="s1639">That’s the things I like.</span> <span id="s1640">I also like classic.</span> <span id="s1641">I like operas.</span> <span id="s1642">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Did your family understand and respect your decision to marry…</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Marry my wife Helen?</span> <span id="s1645">I never asked anybody.</span> <span id="s1646">I never told them I’m marrying.</span> <span id="s1647">I never ask permission.</span> <span id="s1648">I married.</span> <span id="s1649">Yeah, they accepted her.</span> <span id="s1650">You can probably ask her about that, but I think they did.</span> <span id="s1651">My dad loved her.</span> <span id="s1652">My dad once he got to know her, he loved her and so did my step-mother, she also loved her.</span> <span id="s1653">But I really didn’t, you know, I really didn’t care because it’s my choice.</span> <span id="s1654">It’s my life and I have to live it, not them.</span> <span id="s1655">If they didn’t like it, tough.</span> <span id="s1656">That’s the way I felt about it.</span> <span id="s1657">You know, I know a lot of people want to be loved and all that good stuff, but me, I just go with what I think is right.</span> <span id="s1658">That’s what I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: I don’t think we mentioned on the tape, but your wife is Presbyterian?</span> <span id="s1660">Is that what you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: I think she is.</span> <span id="s1662">I dare not say that for sure.</span> <span id="s1663">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1664">I think, I’m pretty sure that’s what she is.</span> <span id="s1665">She’s a Christian, anyway.</span> <span id="s1666">But I think she is… not Lutheran.</span> <span id="s1667">I’m pretty sure she’s a Presbyterian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: And she practices?</span> <span id="s1669">Goes to church and keeps up with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: She used to.</span> <span id="s1671">She used to.</span> <span id="s1672">When we go down to home, her home church, she goes to church on Sundays with her brother, who is a deacon in the church and all that.</span> <span id="s1673">I don’t go with them, but she goes.</span> <span id="s1674">And even when we first got married, she insisted I go with her.</span> <span id="s1675">She won’t go, she by herself and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1676">So for a couple times I went with her, just out of respect for her and her family.</span> <span id="s1677">I didn’t feel comfortable though.</span> <span id="s1678">And I told her, I said, “Look, that’s your faith, not mine.</span> <span id="s1679">Not that I… you want to go, you go.</span> <span id="s1680">I have no problems, you know.</span> <span id="s1681">I’ll gladly take you there and I’ll gladly come and pick you up.”</span> <span id="s1682">I tried to talk her into going here to church if she wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1683">I’ll gladly take her and there and bring her home gladly.</span> <span id="s1684">Have no problem.</span> <span id="s1685">Just don’t ask me to go.</span> <span id="s1686">And so from now, she goes with her brother and stuff and it’s fine.</span> <span id="s1687">Yeah, she believes, she’s got faith, which is fine with me.</span> <span id="s1688">I have no quarrel with anybody who has faith.</span> <span id="s1689">It’s just me and my views.</span> <span id="s1690">I don’t push my views on anybody else.</span> <span id="s1691">I respect everybody else’s faith as long as he practices and don’t expect somebody else to do it.</span> <span id="s1692">You understand what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1693">Don’t force, don’t try to push it on me.</span> <span id="s1694">Your faith is your faith and I respect you, you and your faith.</span> <span id="s1695">But that’s your faith and don’t try to convert me or push me or get me to… you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Was there ever a point where you felt it would be important to you to marry a Jewish woman?</span> <span id="s1697">Where your Jewish identity was important enough to you that you felt like you had to do whatever you could to carry on the tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: That’s a tough one.</span> <span id="s1699">I guess at one time, at one time, yes.</span> <span id="s1700">I guess at one time that occurred to me, okay.</span> <span id="s1701">But… I shouldn’t say this, but anyway.</span> <span id="s1702">While I was in the military in Israel, okay, we were on duty in the Jerusalem sector.</span> <span id="s1703">It wasn’t a war, it was after.</span> <span id="s1704">The Jordanians still had the old city.</span> <span id="s1705">And to go to our post we had to go through a section of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim, which means “a hundred gates,” which was the ultra, ultra, Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1706">And every time we had to go through there to switch reliefs, you know, we had to go through their section, their neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1707">And on Sabbath we used to go through there with a vehicle.</span> <span id="s1708">They used to stone us.</span> <span id="s1709">Okay?</span> <span id="s1710">So I looked at this and I said to myself, what’s the difference between the fanatics, the Jewish fanatics and the Ayatollah fanatics and all the other fanatics?</span> <span id="s1711">There’s not one iota difference between them.</span> <span id="s1712">They’re all zealots for whatever their faith is.</span> <span id="s1713">So, I reverted back to what I told you initially.</span> <span id="s1714">I believe in Israel, beneath the country, for no other reason is the Jewish people as a nation have a homeland.</span> <span id="s1715">But for me, not for religious purposes.</span> <span id="s1716">There’s, like I was there visiting my sister in, you know for Passover this year.</span> <span id="s1717">And there’s such a conflict between the real religious and the non-religious there, you know.</span> <span id="s1718">It’s crazy.</span> <span id="s1719">You believe in your faith, practice it.</span> <span id="s1720">Leave the other people alone.</span> <span id="s1721">If they believe in… my sister is like me.</span> <span id="s1722">She doesn’t bang her head against the wall.</span> <span id="s1723">She believes in God and she holds basically all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s1724">She has to because it’s national holidays.</span> <span id="s1725">But she’s not religious, goes to Temple all the time and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1726">Everybody has a right to live their own life the way they see it’s fit.</span> <span id="s1727">And that’s what I believe in.</span> <span id="s1728">I believe in everybody should do, if I respect you… my neighbor here is a very religious Baptist guy.</span> <span id="s1729">A wonderful guy, wonderful friend.</span> <span id="s1730">He’s been friend with me now for thirty years, since we’ve been here.</span> <span id="s1731">We’ve been real close friends.</span> <span id="s1732">We help each other.</span> <span id="s1733">Anything I got he’s welcome to it and the same with him.</span> <span id="s1734">Anything I need, if I needed help, he’d be there.</span> <span id="s1735">I know he would.</span> <span id="s1736">That’s how good of friends we are.</span> <span id="s1737">And I respect him.</span> <span id="s1738">He goes to church on Wednesdays.</span> <span id="s1739">He goes to church on Sundays.</span> <span id="s1740">He’s a church elder.</span> <span id="s1741">I respect, I respect my brother-in-law, you know.</span> <span id="s1742">It’s their faith, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s1743">He never try to force, you know, push his stuff on me.</span> <span id="s1744">That’s all I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1745">Everybody should… and I believe if you have a faith, you should live it.</span> <span id="s1746">Not go to church on Sunday and then cheat people on Monday.</span> <span id="s1747">That’s my principle, that’s me.</span> <span id="s1748">What you hear, what I say is what I mean.</span> <span id="s1749">That’s always been my, I don’t say something that I don’t mean.</span> <span id="s1750">If I tell you I was going to do something, you can put in the bank that I was going to do it.</span> <span id="s1751">Except if I’m dead or laying there paralyzed where I can’t move.</span> <span id="s1752">That’s what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s1753">If I promised to do something, I will do it.</span> <span id="s1754">My word is my bond, basically.</span> <span id="s1755">With me, you can shake hands with me, that’s just like a contract.</span> <span id="s1756">If I say something I was going to do, I’m going to do it.</span> <span id="s1757">And that’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: I imagine that’s been very helpful to you in your career in the Army, because that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Yes, yes, yes, it has.</span> <span id="s1760">And I think I’ve been doing okay.</span> <span id="s1761">I mean I have no problems.</span> <span id="s1762">With my education background and with everything else, I guess the biggest asset I had is my dedication.</span> <span id="s1763">I never been a good speller.</span> <span id="s1764">I mean I’m not stupid, you know.</span> <span id="s1765">Don’t think I am stupid.</span> <span id="s1766">I’m not.</span> <span id="s1767">You know, I might not have book learning to the max or get a certificate.</span> <span id="s1768">But I made up for that by reading a lot and getting my education in the school of hard knocks, is what taught me.</span> <span id="s1769">They knew wherever the job needed to get done, as long as… turn me loose, tell me what you want done, give me the resources to do it with and I will get it done.</span> <span id="s1770">That was me.</span> <span id="s1771">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: I’m going to ask you a question which I don’t know if it’s possible to answer, but I’ll ask it anyway and see what you think.</span> <span id="s1773">You went through, I mean by the time you were a young child you had been through more atrocities than most people have even imagined and a terrible, terrible war and you went on to fight in two more wars and you didn’t have to do that.</span> <span id="s1774">What do you think it was that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Drove me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1777">Because I think so many people would have said, okay, I’ve done…</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: Done my part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: …I’ve had my share in the wars of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: I really couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1781">Something inner, something inside of me drove me and what it was I really couldn’t put it into words.</span> <span id="s1782">If I would say any particular thing… I mean, you got to take each one on its own merit.</span> <span id="s1783">You can’t just lump them all together.</span> <span id="s1784">The war in Israel was a question of survival for the country.</span> <span id="s1785">Because they closed the Suez Canal down.</span> <span id="s1786">The lifeline for Israel, because the oil must come in.</span> <span id="s1787">At the time there was no pipeline from the Red Sea, so all the oil was coming through the Suez Canal and it was delivered to Haifa to the refineries there, okay?</span> <span id="s1788">So I didn’t make the decision to go to war.</span> <span id="s1789">I was just a guy who was in the Reserves.</span> <span id="s1790">I was already out of the Service in Israel.</span> <span id="s1791">And we had a password and when you heard your password, you packed your bags and you reported to your unit.</span> <span id="s1792">You had a specific location where you met.</span> <span id="s1793">It was a civilian mobilization of the Army and you went and did what you were supposed to have done.</span> <span id="s1794">I guess duty, if anything that drove me I guess was duty, responsibility, duty to what I believe was right.</span> <span id="s1795">If there was anything to define.</span> <span id="s1796">Now as far as ‘Nam, again, I didn’t… it was the United States Government decision to have, to go to the aid of the South Vietnamese.</span> <span id="s1797">It wasn’t mine.</span> <span id="s1798">I just, again it was duty.</span> <span id="s1799">I was in the Service, I was a career soldier.</span> <span id="s1800">Why would you be a career soldier?</span> <span id="s1801">What, you’re going to run when the fighting starts?</span> <span id="s1802">That’s what you train for all the time.</span> <span id="s1803">To when the nation calls you, then you be there to do your… you know, and do your duty.</span> <span id="s1804">And I hope anyway, that I was instrumental in saving some guy’s life, because with my experience, you know, I helped guide a lot of other guys to maybe, if I wasn’t there maybe somebody who had less experience would have got him killed.</span> <span id="s1805">I’m not saying that would have been the case, but basically the professional guys in the Service, the non-commissioned officers, who had experience from the Korean War and then served in ‘Nam, they’re basically who trained the new guys, you know, and got them understand what a war is all about.</span> <span id="s1806">How to survive.</span> <span id="s1807">If anything I guess, duty is the main, main theme here, I think, from what you’re asking.</span> <span id="s1808">Why I joined the Service, why I volunteered and stayed in the Service, that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s1809">That had a lot to do with economy and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1810">Plus I had an opportunity to use my talent, my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my own career was in the military instead of the civilian life.</span> <span id="s1811">But as far as when the war started, I think the main thing was duty.</span> <span id="s1812">I mean duty to do your job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Were you in a combat unit while you were in ‘Nam?</span> <span id="s1814">Or what were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: I was actually in the Signal outfit.</span> <span id="s1816">The first time I was there I was in a place called Binh Dinh Mountain, which was a seven thousand foot mountain.</span> <span id="s1817">And it was about, I guess twenty miles from Dalat.</span> <span id="s1818">There was no road in or out.</span> <span id="s1819">All our supplies had to come by air.</span> <span id="s1820">We got re-supplied.</span> <span id="s1821">And up there we had a relay, communication relay station to the North side, North Vietnam and part of South Vietnam, the north part and the south part.</span> <span id="s1822">Plus we had Air Force up there, who were relaying instructions to the B-52 Bombers.</span> <span id="s1823">So we’re sitting on a seven thousand foot mountain, and jungle all the way around us.</span> <span id="s1824">Charlie was down there.</span> <span id="s1825">We lived in bunkers.</span> <span id="s1826">We got attacked by mortars, you know, and that kind of that stuff.</span> <span id="s1827">We didn’t have no direct confrontation.</span> <span id="s1828">Then from there I moved to a place called Phu Ti Valley which is not far from Nha Trang and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division.</span> <span id="s1829">That is an Infantry Division, who were actually doing the combat.</span> <span id="s1830">We were supporting them and going out to, when they went out for a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communication.</span> <span id="s1831">So, we got shot at, but we weren’t involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job.</span> <span id="s1832">The Koreans did that.</span> <span id="s1833">So, but I was running Highway One between Ban Me Thuot, and every morning before you even got on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the mines out of there.</span> <span id="s1834">So you never knew from one minute to the next when you’re going to get on a mine.</span> <span id="s1835">And then the Vietnamese had this nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, motorcycle-type taxi cabs.</span> <span id="s1836">And you would come around with your truck and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down, like in a curve.</span> <span id="s1837">And you had to stop down to not run over them.</span> <span id="s1838">And when you slowed down, they would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side.</span> <span id="s1839">So what you define “combat”?</span> <span id="s1840">In Vietnam there wasn’t any really… no, I wasn’t in the infantry unit.</span> <span id="s1841">But in our base camp, we got attacked.</span> <span id="s1842">We killed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph)charged us.</span> <span id="s1843">One of them was our base barber that we killed.</span> <span id="s1844">He was a Viet Cong.</span> <span id="s1845">So you never knew who your, I mean who was your friend, who was your enemy.</span> <span id="s1846">It was a weird kind of a war.</span> <span id="s1847">There was no front line, like in Korea or Second World War.</span> <span id="s1848">You didn’t know who was your friend or who was your foe, besides your own buddies in your own unit.</span> <span id="s1849">Because all Vietnamese could have been Viet Cong.</span> <span id="s1850">We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our trucks.</span> <span id="s1851">What they would do if you didn’t have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a rubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your gas tank.</span> <span id="s1852">Then the gas would eat away the rubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereens.</span> <span id="s1853">So, you had to actually lock down with a lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn’t stick nothing in there.</span> <span id="s1854">Children were, they would hawk on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s1855">They would try to sell you coke.</span> <span id="s1856">Well if you’re stupid enough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it.</span> <span id="s1857">If you drank that stuff it tore your guts up inside with shreds, slivers of glass.</span> <span id="s1858">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1859">So it was a different kind of war.</span> <span id="s1860">It wasn’t the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1861">But no, I wasn’t… you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans.</span> <span id="s1862">I took convoys from the seven thousand-foot mountain down to the air field about twenty miles away to pick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1863">We got ambushed periodically on the road and all that.</span> <span id="s1864">Well, you call that combat?</span> <span id="s1865">I would call that combat, but I wasn’t one of those guys that were crawling down those tunnels, tunnel rats or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1866">I wasn’t in the Infantry outfit fighting.</span> <span id="s1867">I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was Special Forces.</span> <span id="s1868">He was on long range patrol.</span> <span id="s1869">They went out to search Charlie.</span> <span id="s1870">Now I would say he was in the trenches more than I was.</span> <span id="s1871">I just reacted when Charlie attacked me.</span> <span id="s1872">He went out looking for him, that’s different.</span> <span id="s1873">But I did whatever was assigned me.</span> <span id="s1874">I came to ‘Nam.</span> <span id="s1875">I was supposed to go to a direct support unit.</span> <span id="s1876">Not even get close to where the combat was.</span> <span id="s1877">I was supposed to work on repairing vehicles and stuff.</span> <span id="s1878">I got to Cam Ranh Bay and they said, “Eh, you are now, guess what.</span> <span id="s1879">You are now a 6-3 Charlie.</span> <span id="s1880">You are a motor sergeant.</span> <span id="s1881">You are going up in the Central Highlands.”</span> <span id="s1882">Instead of staying right there in Nha Trang.</span> <span id="s1883">Believe me, two years in ‘Nam and I never seen Saigon.</span> <span id="s1884">I don’t know what Saigon looks like.</span> <span id="s1885">I never been there.</span> <span id="s1886">All my time was up in the Central Highlands.</span> <span id="s1887">I took two R&amp;R tours, one I went to Australia and one I went to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1888">Get away from it to relax.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: What was your rank when you retired from the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: I was E-8, Master Sergeant.</span> <span id="s1891">I graduated from Sergeant Major Academy.</span> <span id="s1892">I was going to make E-9, but I got sick and I got medically retired before I actually got promoted.</span> <span id="s1893">But I actually retired as an E-8, graduated from Sergeant Major Academy.</span> <span id="s1894">See it, my certificate.</span> <span id="s1895">I mean the plaque?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Conclusion of Interview Now known as Tiszavaswarda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Schlisser was with E-Co 43rd Sig BN, in the Binh Dinh
