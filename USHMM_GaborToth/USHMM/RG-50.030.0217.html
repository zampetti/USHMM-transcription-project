speak now.</span> <span id="s12">We are recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s14">My name is Stanislaw Soszynski.</span> <span id="s15">I was born on February 24, 1931, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s16">I lived in Old Town through my whole childhood.</span> <span id="s17">This is the oldest part of Warsaw, mostly inhabited by the poor, craftsmen, merchants.</span> <span id="s18">A very diverse population, forming the northern part of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s19">The neighborhood was inhabited by many, even very many, Jewish families.</span> <span id="s20">In our building, at 11 Fret Street, there lived five Jewish families, out of twenty‑odd total in the building.</span> <span id="s21">Our relations were those of neighbors, that is apartments were not locked, theft was unknown.</span> <span id="s22">Nowadays the full symbiosis that existed in those crowded, packed buildings is forgotten.</span> <span id="s23">There were of course disturbances in this symbiosis.</span> <span id="s24">There had to be.</span> <span id="s25">Whenever people are crowded into a mall space, the conflicts of their interests lead to occasional strife.</span> <span id="s26">That peaceful life, that life of storekeepers, tradesmen, craftsmen, minor civil servants, was interrupted by the war.</span> <span id="s27">There was an immense market hall near the street that I lived on.</span> <span id="s28">It was on Swietojerska Street.</span> <span id="s29">It was split in half, and fish were sold on one side, while vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were sold on the other.</span> <span id="s30">That market hall will be very important to the lives of many people during the war.</span> <span id="s31">Firstly, food will be sent through it, for it stood on the line that was designated by the Germans as the border of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s32">Later, in the years of the defense of Old Town, that hall will be transformed into a huge hospital.</span> <span id="s33">Although it is impossible to change a fish market or a produce market into a hospital, that was how it was, regardless.</span> <span id="s34">The siege of Warsaw in 1939 was a great drama.</span> <span id="s35">The Germans, having broken the resistance of the Polish army west of the Vistula, surrounded Warsaw.</span> <span id="s36">The city was full of historic architectural artifacts and monuments.</span> <span id="s37">Almost 700 antique buildings were so ravaged by the war that they had to be built practically all over again.</span> <span id="s38">Besides, the 1.5 million enclosed people of the city defended itself desperately, led by President Stefan Starzynski.</span> <span id="s39">The defenders consisted partly of members of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s40">President Starzynski, the defender of Warsaw in 1939, appointed Czerniakow as his co‑worker representing the Jewish population, the Jewish society.</span> <span id="s41">When the Germans entered Warsaw, a demolished Warsaw covered in snow, in which the walls smelled scorched.</span> <span id="s42">I lived through one of the most difficult times in my life.</span> <span id="s43">We were going on Wierzbowa Street to Marshall Jozef Pilsudski Square to visit my aunt, passing the burned buildings of Theater Square, when on the other side of the street I saw a man who appeared to be drunk.</span> <span id="s44">I was with my father and my siblings.</span> <span id="s45">He was stumbling from the sides of the houses to the curb and weaving across the width of the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s46">At last he fell down.</span> <span id="s47">Father said that we should keep going down the side of the street that we were on, but he crossed the street and approached the man.</span> <span id="s48">He picked him up, and now others came up.</span> <span id="s49">Together they sat him on a wall.</span> <span id="s50">I saw that my father lifted up the man's trouser leg and bound the man's leg with his handkerchief.</span> <span id="s51">He kept going down the street, parallel to us.</span> <span id="s52">When we came out onto the square, I noticed that Z‑shaped anti‑aircraft ditches had been dug into the grass of the square.</span> <span id="s53">There were some people filling them in while a German sentry watched over them.</span> <span id="s54">The soldier wore a helmet and carried a carbine with an affixed bayonet.</span> <span id="s55">Father went up to him and looked at him.</span> <span id="s56">He came back and said "That thug ran his bayonet through that man's leg."</span> <span id="s57">I could not understand how someone could simply bayonet someone's leg like that, on the street in broad daylight, simply because he was not filling a ditch fast enough, or, as it later turned out, because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s58">It was an inexplicable situation, but I realized then that a time had come when law went against common sense... these are complex matters, I cannot explain, but I realized that invaders, Germans, bad people had come.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q:You were eight years old then.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A:I was then eight years old, yes.</span> <span id="s61">A common life of poverty commenced.</span> <span id="s62">The city was destroyed, there was no running water, no light, no food.</span> <span id="s63">Water was carried from the river.</span> <span id="s64">Because women did the laundry in their homes, every home had a big kettle for doing the wash.</span> <span id="s65">The men stood in a row and together took all of the pots.</span> <span id="s66">They went in long strings to the Vistula, taking streets that sloped down to the river.</span> <span id="s67">They nailed together boards and put them over the water they collected so that it would not splash out.</span> <span id="s68">These problems cemented people all the more; nothing unites like misfortune.</span> <span id="s69">Joy may split, while misery draws people together.</span> <span id="s70">This is the second scene that I remember, and it also is as if from a ghastly dream.</span> <span id="s71">German patrols began appearing in our neighborhood dressed in what were known before the war as anti_____ [102] suits.</span> <span id="s72">They were made out of a watertight, prepared fabric.</span> <span id="s73">On their backs they carried tanks and in their hands they had nozzles such as are today used to apply lacquer under pressure.</span> <span id="s74">There was some kind of poison in those tanks, phenol or carbolic acid or some other liquid that destroyed everything that it came into contact with.</span> <span id="s75">It turned out that these patrols demanded money from owners of Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s76">If the extortion money was not paid, the Germans would hose down the inside of the store with the carbolic acid.</span> <span id="s77">There was a jeweler in the next building to us.</span> <span id="s78">He had a tiny store, so small that the door simultaneously served as the display.</span> <span id="s79">There was a counter inside, while the precious things he put on display were hung on an ingenious little shelf in the door.</span> <span id="s80">I stood before the door when the Germans came up and demanded paymenthe did not have it.</span> <span id="s81">Within a few minutes, the store had been soaked with that stinking carbolic acid.</span> <span id="s82">To this day, I get a feeling of grimness whenever I enter a newly disinfected room, because I see a man with that destructive nozzle in his hand.</span> <span id="s83">There was no talk of a ghetto at the beginning.</span> <span id="s84">At first it was even said that the Jews would be in a better situation than the Poles under the occupation because they would be able to understand what the Germans were saying.</span> <span id="s85">The lion's share of the Jewish people understood German.</span> <span id="s86">This turned out to be an illusion.</span> <span id="s87">The winter of 1939‑1940 was bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s88">The frost was so strong that it split open trees.</span> <span id="s89">On New Town Square, there stood a dozen trees at the base of which was a temporary cemetery.</span> <span id="s90">In the middle stood a statue of the patron of Warsaw, and the trees broke up so that limbs were falling down on the graves.</span> <span id="s91">During that winter I wore my scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat.</span> <span id="s92">I was standing in the gate when one of my friends ran out bare‑headed.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q:One of your Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A:Yes, one of my Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s95">I motioned to him with my chin, to ask "Hey, have you gone crazy?</span> <span id="s96">You should put something on your head."</span> <span id="s97">He motioned with his head at a German patrol standing at a narrowing in the street to which all the passing Jews had to bow.</span> <span id="s98">He did not have a cap so that he would not have to bow, in that horrible cold.</span> <span id="s99">I looked at him, he was three or four years older than me, and I felt the strangeness of the situation.</span> <span id="s100">Then talk began that there would be a ghetto, that all the nationalities in Warsaw would be put into their own zones.</span> <span id="s101">No one said that there would be a Jewish section, an extermination section.</span> <span id="s102">I think that the precision with which that society was destroyed was the result of great thoughtpsychological thought, organizational thought.</span> <span id="s103">I think that it must have been done by people who knew mob psychology.</span> <span id="s104">It is not so simple to collect three or four hundred thousand people in one place without telling them about one's goal, one's purpose.</span> <span id="s105">The first step was simply lying: that is, it was said that Warsaw would be split into sections.</span> <span id="s106">There would be an assigned Aryan section, a German section, a Jewish section.</span> <span id="s107">The Jewish section was relatively speaking huge, very large in this first phase.</span> <span id="s108">These sections were to be inhabited exclusively by those assigned to them.</span> <span id="s109">The psychological groundwork for this division was laid by posting on streetcar posts and street lanterns signs that said "Jews Are Forbidden To Walk On This Side Of The Street."</span> <span id="s110">Suddenly, a part of the street was off‑limits, like stores, like parks, and similar places in the city.</span> <span id="s111">Another form of preparation was that the Germans placed signs on the roads that instructed drivers to drive past very quickly because the area was infected with typhus.</span> <span id="s112">Finally, small walls sprang up.</span> <span id="s113">The people of Warsaw, especially the people of Old Town, the oldest neighborhood, were hot‑headed, and if walls were put up against their will, then they took them down.</span> <span id="s114">At first those walls were taken part.</span> <span id="s115">Someone needed some bricks, and so on.</span> <span id="s116">It turned out that this was another ploy: it was said that the walls would form checkpoints where the police could check passer‑by's identification, but in reality it was announced that the neighborhood was closed, and that people who were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David had to go there.</span> <span id="s117">Tens of thousands of people living in that zone had to be moved, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q:Your house was not in the zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A:Our house was on the border of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q:So it was still on the Aryan side?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A:The back of the house was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s122">But our part, the front of the house, where our apartment was, was on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s123">This later led to an unexpected result: the great smuggling operation that began when the ghetto was closed.</span> <span id="s124">For example, people would pour milk down the drain‑pipes to the ghetto part.</span> <span id="s125">But now I am speaking about the point when tens of thousands of people were leaving the ghetto and tens of thousands were moving in.</span> <span id="s126">Because time was very short, the people who had property there had to quickly sell everything in an effort to save something.</span> <span id="s127">Those people were pauperized.</span> <span id="s128">So a great ghetto was created, containing 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s129">Today, when one looks at a map and knows the outcome of it all, one can see that the line of the ghetto was very carefully drawn so as to leave all large parks outside.</span> <span id="s130">No large area of greenery, no square that could give some respite to the children there, not to mention the adults.</span> <span id="s131">One of the surprising, shocking facts that I have learned is the story of the teacher in the ghetto who asked the children to draw summer.</span> <span id="s132">It turned out that the children did not know what it looks like.</span> <span id="s133">Four and five year‑old children who had grown up behind the walls could not; draw a horse, cows, sheep they did not even know what those things were.</span> <span id="s134">Families left our house in tears.</span> <span id="s135">Superintendent Bomoski [ph220], a simple man, helped them load what they hadthey were not rich people.</span> <span id="s136">In any case, we said that sooner or later the war would end, that we would surely see each other again.</span> <span id="s137">Unfortunately this was not to be.</span> <span id="s138">Those walls were the battle‑ground of a contest between the leadership of the ghetto, the people of the ghetto, and the Germans.</span> <span id="s139">Because by means of those walls, attention was turned away from the basic facts.</span> <span id="s140">If one day it was announced that Zlota, Hoza, or Sienna, or a part of a building was no longer in the ghetto or else was now included in the ghetto, it seemed as if directing energies toward "defense" was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s141">In reality, this was not the case.</span> <span id="s142">Hunger began there.</span> <span id="s143">Rations were purposely reduced so that hunger began.</span> <span id="s144">Small boys who could get through the holes knocked in the walls of the ghetto went through.</span> <span id="s145">Among others, two boys from our building came.</span> <span id="s146">They sat on a stump.</span> <span id="s147">All of the houses in that old part of town, since the only heat was from coal stoves, had large stumps in the courtyard for chopping wood.</span> <span id="s148">They sat on that stump, we all ran up.</span> <span id="s149">They sad that it was hard, that some of their parents were in poor health, that they came because they had nowhere to go and they knew they had friends here, and so on.</span> <span id="s150">The adults gave them, I had nothing of course, what they had, some pieces of bacon, bags of flour.</span> <span id="s151">I made an appointment to see them.</span> <span id="s152">Because the streetcar went through the streets of the ghetto to Powzazki, there was no other way for the streetcar to go, one could board on the Aryan side and ride through.</span> <span id="s153">Although a policeman guarded the car, it was possible to jump out, at first, when the streetcar still operated as it did before the war.</span> <span id="s154">I suddenly found myself in a city that is hard to imagine.</span> <span id="s155">Thousands of people walked back and forth, apparently with no purpose.</span> <span id="s156">Peddlers ran around with their carts.</span> <span id="s157">Someone was selling bread, which he kept in a basket made of barbed wire, so that no one could take it without paying.</span> <span id="s158">All of this was so unbelievable that even now that I am an adult, an old man, an artist, whenever I try to represent it graphically I look at my work and think that it is complete]y surrealistic.</span> <span id="s159">Bread bundled in barbed wire is inedible.</span> <span id="s160">One cannot even begin to share those peoples experience.</span> <span id="s161">I found the boys: it turned out that they lived with ten other people in one room.</span> <span id="s162">Sanitary problems began immediately.</span> <span id="s163">Today, in a world in which everything works without disruption, we do not understand what it means, twelve people in one room.</span> <span id="s164">Not in one apartment, in one room.</span> <span id="s165">Now, suddenly that one small water closet intended for the use of a family of four or five must function as a street lavatory.</span> <span id="s166">An unbelievable thing started to happen.</span> <span id="s167">I cannot talk about people dying.</span> <span id="s168">I know it now, but I did not see it then.</span> <span id="s169">But there were dead bodies laying on the sidewalks.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q:In the street or on the side?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A:Everywhere!</span> <span id="s172">Today it is known that; on Krochmalna Street there was a building in which, out of four hundred inhabitants, four hundred died!</span> <span id="s173">A whole apartment building died, a huge apartment building with four hundred people.</span> <span id="s174">After some time, the ghetto was sealed off completely.</span> <span id="s175">One could not go in without a special pass, and even with a pass... the story went around Warsaw that a Polish doctor, on the so‑called Aryan side, whom a Jewish doctor called because he had a serious case, went into the ghetto with a pass.</span> <span id="s176">The Gestapo followed him and killed everyone, the patient and both of the doctors.</span> <span id="s177">That information went around the whole city.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A:Was it true?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A:Yes!</span> <span id="s180">Of course.</span> <span id="s181">Today, after the war, the names of those people have been established, and it is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of extermination carries with it.</span> <span id="s182">Because the walls of the ghetto moved as those people were crowded even more, and we lived close by, I had an experience that I already told you about that is I sold milk.</span> <span id="s183">This was necessary because my father fell ill and could no longer support the household.</span> <span id="s184">There were three of us then, my mother.</span> <span id="s185">I was twelve years old then.</span> <span id="s186">I took a milk can and went outside of town to a farmer who would sell me twelve liters.</span> <span id="s187">I was scared while transporting it, because the so‑called "sentries" stood guard at all of the train stations.</span> <span id="s188">This was often quite dramatic: a German gendarme called "Pretty Boy, " because he had a very pretty appearance, an ideally smooth face, clean‑shaven, a pretty boy, came into the compartment and started looking for contraband.</span> <span id="s189">Meat, butter, whatever made him happy.</span> <span id="s190">I was sitting on my milk can between the seats next to the window.</span> <span id="s191">There was another milk can up on the luggage rack, which its owner, another man, had opened so that it would not go sour.</span> <span id="s192">The German seized the can by the handle, not knowing that it was open.</span> <span id="s193">The milk poured all over him.</span> <span id="s194">Everyone began to laugh, he asked politely whose can it was.</span> <span id="s195">The man next to me said that it was his.</span> <span id="s196">He opened his holster and shot him, right in that train.</span> <span id="s197">Within a few seconds, the man was dead.</span> <span id="s198">I brought the milk home.</span> <span id="s199">That day I also brought; a bottle of honey home, for us.</span> <span id="s200">I was supposed to go visit a friend who lived next to the ghetto wall.</span> <span id="s201">I poured some honey on a piece of very bad bread, which reportedly was made of sawdust mixed with flour, bread which was rationed to us.</span> <span id="s202">I took my bread and honey and went down the street eating it.</span> <span id="s203">I got too the street where the ghetto wall was, when a "szaulis, " a soldier working for the Germans, standing by the wall in an ash‑grey uniform with black cuffs and a long cartridge belt motioned to me.</span> <span id="s204">I was convinced that I had died because I immediately thought that I was just as scruffy and disheveled as those boys who sneaked out of the ghetto in search of food, and that he had taken me for one of those boys.</span> <span id="s205">That was the longest walk of my life.</span> <span id="s206">I went up to him and waited for him to turn his gun on me and shoot.</span> <span id="s207">It turned out that he needed my piece of bread with honey.</span> <span id="s208">He twisted my arm, took it and put it in his mouth.</span> <span id="s209">Then he waved me off, "Weg."</span> <span id="s210">Coming back, I knew that I was alive, but at the same time I realized... maybe for a few minutes I was a Jewish boythat there was no law there, that this was a horrible lawlessness.</span> <span id="s211">At one point a rumor went around Warsaw that Jews were being deported.</span> <span id="s212">No one knew how, but the word "Umschlagplatz " entered the vocabularies of the people of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s213">Of course the terror inflicted on the people of Warsaw was so strong, people were shot on the street, stopped, rounded up and sent to camps, whole neighborhoods were surrounded where thousands of men would be asked for identification and put in cars known as "boxes, " that all of these terrible rumors fell on different ears then we have today, as I speak.</span> <span id="s214">When one sees dead people on the street, one reacts differently than to a man killed in a car accident.</span> <span id="s215">But all the same these were horrible matters, exceeding the imagination.</span> <span id="s216">I had another experience that was unique.</span> <span id="s217">It turned out that there was no hope for my father.</span> <span id="s218">He is very sick, so sick that he must die.</span> <span id="s219">We were all aware of this, but a person wants to... a person clings to his hopes.</span> <span id="s220">Father was put in a hospital which had been a specialist hospital before the war.</span> <span id="s221">The hospital was located in a T‑shaped area that was cut out of the ghetto, but inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s222">To go in, one had to pass a guard, go along a few buildings which belonged to the ghetto, and there was the hospital building that was separate.</span> <span id="s223">This was a hospital by name onlythere was no proper food there, no beds, nothing.</span> <span id="s224">There were beds, but again in name onlynormal, iron beds, not hospital beds.</span> <span id="s225">As a result I carried part of the food we were able to obtain to the hospital every day.</span> <span id="s226">I carried a can with a spoon and by the Arsenal, because the wall went along Przejazd Street, it was completely empty.</span> <span id="s227">Evidently there had just been a round‑up or some shooting or... anyway, I saw the Wacht mann in the ghetto gate from a long way away.</span> <span id="s228">He mixed up the soup to make sure there were no weapons or ammunition in it and let me pass.</span> <span id="s229">As I walked by those walls, people appeared who were fixated by the sight of my can.</span> <span id="s230">I saw this, I felt it.</span> <span id="s231">They could not cross the wall, but at the same time it was a horrible feeling of an indescribable hunger.</span> <span id="s232">That was how I took it.</span> <span id="s233">A few months later, the Ghetto Uprising began.</span> <span id="s234">From what I remember, it was not the fight that it is described as today, a band of desperate people shooting and so on.</span> <span id="s235">Because we lived nearby, I saw it.</span> <span id="s236">It was a militarily well‑organized defense of parts of buildings.</span> <span id="s237">I do not know how the battle looked in the rest of the area, but along Swietojerska, Bonifraterska, and Franciszkanska Streets, within our sight, was fought in an exemplary way.</span> <span id="s238">So well that snipers, placed in high points in those buildings, for a few days did not even allow the German soldiers and divisions to enter that way.</span> <span id="s239">It was not until heavy artillery, with multiple barrels, was brought in, and houses were subjected to direct firethey would fire at a spot several times, the wall would collapse revealing an apartment, and they would move on to the next house, they were methodically destroying house after housethat the defenders retreated.</span> <span id="s240">Another shocking method, one that the Germans would use massively during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, were fires.</span> <span id="s241">The Germans would set fire to whole blocks of houses.</span> <span id="s242">So that northern part of the city had an enormous column of smoke over it.</span> <span id="s243">Because they would not let the fire department in and there was no access to that section of the city, those houses burned until they burned out.</span> <span id="s244">They then began to demolish those houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q:After the Uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A:After the Ghetto Uprising.</span> <span id="s247">No one was allowed in.</span> <span id="s248">The Germans put up signs saying that they would shoot without warning at anyone found in that area.</span> <span id="s249">It turned out that this was all part of their plans; in 1939, the architect Pabst had drawn up a plan for the destruction of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s250">That northern part of the city was to be leveled with the ground.</span> <span id="s251">No one knew that then except for people like Professor Zachwatowicz, who was able to get to the documents dealing with Pabst in the town hall.</span> <span id="s252">Now, filled with horror and surprise, we watched as a great city of a million and a half people and covering several square kilometers was turned to desert, completely leveled.</span> <span id="s253">Everything of any value was taken out: pipes, balconies, roofing, upholstery, and so on, and then the buildings were blown up.</span> <span id="s254">The houses were mined and blown up.</span> <span id="s255">In 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising broke out, the northern part of the city that the Germans had designated to be the ghetto was a flat plain.</span> <span id="s256">The partisans who went to attack the German divisions in the cemeteries discovered that there was no possibility of cover, because on an open field like that, heavy machine guns can stop anything.</span> <span id="s257">This is very hard to describe in just a few words, those years, 39 to 45.</span> <span id="s258">If one goes to that part of Warsaw today, one can still see how it was.</span> <span id="s259">Every time a cable is laid, everytime a shovel touches the earth there, reminders of that city, that life, come up.</span> <span id="s260">I wanted to understand why it happened, why those people were destroyed, why that city was destroyed.</span> <span id="s261">I looked for some sort of memory of those people.</span> <span id="s262">I dug up the strangest things there.</span> <span id="s263">Some of them I could not pick up, or, feeling their gravity, I decided that I had no place worthy to hold them.</span> <span id="s264">For example, once a bulldozer pushed aside a huge block of bricks, under which lay several hundred trouser and vest buckles, which evidently had been in a bag or a box that had decayed.</span> <span id="s265">Oxidized buckles.</span> <span id="s266">Because they had been there, crushed, for a long time, they had formed a cluster, a sculpture.</span> <span id="s267">I looked at it and thought that this was a kind of summation of what had happened there.</span> <span id="s268">There must have been a sickly tailor there who was suddenly told that he had to leave everything.</span> <span id="s269">Of course, the buckles were the most important thing to him, because that was his shop.</span> <span id="s270">He hid them down there in the basement.</span> <span id="s271">They took his live away, and the buckles lay there.</span> <span id="s272">An object, a tiny object, can say more about a drama like this than a hundred words.</span> <span id="s273">That flat plain was petrifying to the city.</span> <span id="s274">It made it clear that life is stronger than that... that... demonic destruction.</span> <span id="s275">That was not human destruction, it was somehow devilish.</span> <span id="s276">The knowledge that someday this would all be grown over, trees would sprout, neighborhoods, children who did not even know what had happened would be playing, it would be another city for them.</span> <span id="s277">I tried to remember and cement in my memory what had happened from this angle and I collected fragments of that city and of that life.</span> <span id="s278">Sometimes the images I saw wandering in the ruins were surrealistic.</span> <span id="s279">I think that I have told about this already.</span> <span id="s280">I once saw that bricks were flying into the air on that flat plain.</span> <span id="s281">They would jump up.</span> <span id="s282">A brick would leap into the air and fall down again.</span> <span id="s283">There were whole fields of jumping bricks.</span> <span id="s284">I could not understand, I thought that I was starting to see things, for how do bricks jump?</span> <span id="s285">But I put aside my concern and went closer to where the bricks were flying.</span> <span id="s286">I now saw with great surprise that that Teutonic fury had destroyed everything on the surface, but that down below the fundament remained, and they contained good, healthy brick.</span> <span id="s287">So the local carters earned money by clinging holes down to the fundament, throwing the bricks up to the surface, and selling them to people who were building.</span> <span id="s288">It was very simple and logical, there was nothing extraordinary about it.</span> <span id="s289">All the same, that was how life began to creep back into that area.</span> <span id="s290">Spontaneously, in the general rebuilding of Warsaw, it began by taking out the bricks, restoring order.</span> <span id="s291">The bricks were put in piles, the area was cleaned, the Muranow residential district was built, partly on land that had been part of the Jewish section.</span> <span id="s292">The city began to expand as far as the cemeteries that are still there today.</span> <span id="s293">It turned out that this was a kind of holy place.</span> <span id="s294">Today it is very difficult to build something in Warsaw without disturbing the peace of the murdered.</span> <span id="s295">A bulldozer scooping up earth to build a fundament brings up human bones, mass graves are found in completely unexpected places.</span> <span id="s296">Every time a new urban building site is being chosen, history must be examined to ensure that the place is not one of martyrdom.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q:And later the whole city was destroyed thus, all of Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A:The Uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q:You did not tell us your experiences during the Uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A:That is because I did not know that: it was a subject of our conversation.</span> <span id="s301">A year after the events in the Ghetto, Warsaw rose to do battle.</span> <span id="s302">As it turned out, that what they had done in one district, they now expanded onto a scale of the whole city.</span> <span id="s303">My beloved Old Town, in which I grew up, and which was the place on earth to which I belonged, as everyone should have such a place, was leveled just as the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s304">It is very hard to understand the words "Your house has burned down."</span> <span id="s305">They are only five words, but it is very difficult.</span> <span id="s306">When we went out, it was also very surrealistic.</span> <span id="s307">I kept fish.</span> <span id="s308">I always liked animals, birds, plants.</span> <span id="s309">I made myself an aquarium and kept fish.</span> <span id="s310">I had already had one sad experience: windows had to be completely blacked‑out, so that no light at all got out, and it was winter.</span> <span id="s311">Upon opening the curtain one morning, I saw that the aquarium had frozen.</span> <span id="s312">It was so cold in the apartment that those poor fish were frozen still in the ice.</span> <span id="s313">It is now September 2, 1944, the end of the defense of Old Town.</span> <span id="s314">We are to come out with our hands up.</span> <span id="s315">I run into the apartment and there is the aquarium.</span> <span id="s316">I know that soon there will be a great fire here, and that the aquarium will shatter, and that that little bit of water has no chance of putting the fire out.</span> <span id="s317">The apartment is a place to which one comes back, to which one comes with the feeling that it is a place of respiteI will not mention the English saying, my castle, the place in which I ruleand now it does not exist.</span> <span id="s318">The walls of the houses have been jarred apart, and from the gap between them I can see the ruins of the neighboring apartment.</span> <span id="s319">These are all surrealistic images.</span> <span id="s320">During those 32 days of fighting, Old Town was demolished down to the ground.</span> <span id="s321">When we came back in January 1945, Warsaw was dead.</span> <span id="s322">It was kilometers of, tens of, hundreds of streets where no one lived and burned out houses stood.</span> <span id="s323">Not only that, but it turned out that the whole infrastructure, telephone links, gas, light, water, it all had been destroyed underground with special instruments.</span> <span id="s324">I now know, as an architect and as a person who is interested in his city, that German scientists prepared a device called a "Typhoon" which blew up sewers.</span> <span id="s325">It was made and used.</span> <span id="s326">Unfortunately for them, it was well thought‑out scientificallyassuming that all of the sewer entrances were closed.</span> <span id="s327">In that case, the sewer would be destroyed.</span> <span id="s328">Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Warsaw Uprising soldiers used the sewers to travel under the city, some of the entrances were open.</span> <span id="s329">Even on the territory of the ghetto, a board with some debris would be placed over the entrance, and this made blowing the sewer up impossible.</span> <span id="s330">Which saved Warsaw in 1945, because it was said that the hundreds of kilometers of sewers could not be built in another place, but here there at least is the existing network.</span> <span id="s331">The destruction of Warsaw was planned .</span> <span id="s332">I mentioned Pabst's plan.</span> <span id="s333">But in 1944, Warsaw was turned into a fortress, Festung‑Warschau, on Hitler's orders.</span> <span id="s334">This fortress was supposed to hold the Red Army at the Vistula, and to prepare the city for the fighting, special detachments went around dynamiting city blocks.</span> <span id="s335">As if this were not enough, places of cultural value were consciously targeted for exploding, and an average soldier could not do this on his own.</span> <span id="s336">In Leszno, near Poznan, in 1945, the files of the certified architect Menzenbach [ph42 ].</span> <span id="s337">He was a methodical man .</span> <span id="s338">Every card in the file was labeled as belonging to him, and each had a photograph of a place he had registered, with a note next to it saying when, where, and what was to blown up.</span> <span id="s339">Looking through the cards, one is horrified.</span> <span id="s340">A qualified architect, a man whose purpose is to raise buildings from the earth to serve man, to make something beautiful, using all of his knowledge against the works of his colleagues; he walked and classified: this is to be blown up, because it has value.</span> <span id="s341">This is not to be blown up, because it is not valuable from a cultural standpoint.</span> <span id="s342">An example of this is the Bril [ph'53] Palace.</span> <span id="s343">The palace is not distinguished by its architecture compared to a Secessionist ____ [ 55 ] standing next to it that had no cultural importance.</span> <span id="s344">But the Bril [?]</span> <span id="s345">Palace was blown up, while the ___________remained.</span> <span id="s346">Specialists walked around and said "Blow this one up, and leave this one alone," or else burn it down.</span> <span id="s347">Another apparatus, whose German name I do not know, was designed to destroy completely sites that were found to have cultural significance, that is a translation from the German.</span> <span id="s348">Those buildings that were cultural pillars.</span> <span id="s349">One of them was the Royal Palace, and when one looks at photographs of the destruction, one sees that that was not regular mining work done there I have established that a special sort of coal dust was pumped into the basements of such a building, which was then detonated.</span> <span id="s350">That dust tore buildings apart into pieces the size of this cup.</span> <span id="s351">Nothing remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q:Are there any other matters ?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A:That is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q:That is the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A:I finished well.</span> <span id="s356">"Nothing remained.”</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Conclusion of
