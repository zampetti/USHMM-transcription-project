ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT Q This is an interview with Henry Abramowicz for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project, by Lynn Rosen, Minneapolis, June 14, 1982.</span> <span id="s4">Maybe you could just tell me a little about your family.</span> <span id="s5">When you were born, and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I was born in Lodz, Poland, in 1929.</span> <span id="s7">We lived in Lodz all our lives.</span> <span id="s8">I guess my father was born there, too.</span> <span id="s9">And my father had seven brothers and three sisters and they all lived in town.</span> <span id="s10">And my mother, she was born in Lodz, too, and she had three sisters and two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: What was his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: We had a shoe store.</span> <span id="s13">My brother had the business and it was a private concern.</span> <span id="s14">My whole family worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: You worked there, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was only nine years old when the war broke out, so I didn’t work, I went to school.</span> <span id="s17">I’m the youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s18">I had three older sisters.</span> <span id="s19">One was eight years older, that was the oldest, then six years older and four years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Were they involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: No, they were still too young.</span> <span id="s22">They also attended school.</span> <span id="s23">And my father was very active in different social work, too.</span> <span id="s24">He was the vice president of the small companies - it’s like the Small Business Administration, but it took care of only the Jewish businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What did they call it?</span> <span id="s26">Was there a Yiddish name for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: They used to call it the Freinhendler Frein.</span> <span id="s28">And he was also very active in projects like for poor children, they collected money, and did this sort of work - social - you know, volunteer work.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Was it a large Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: There were about 300,000 Jewish people living in town.</span> <span id="s31">This was the second largest city in Poland.</span> <span id="s32">Warsaw was the biggest, although Warsaw didn’t have any more Jewish people than Lodz, Lodz had 300,000 people, and I think Warsaw had around 300,000, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: That’s big.</span> <span id="s34">So there were many synagogues and...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: There were a lot of synagogues in Lodz.</span> <span id="s36">We could look out through our windows and see our synagogue, one of the nicest and grand synagogues in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: How was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: It was quite an unusual structure.</span> <span id="s39">The Germans burned the synagogue.</span> <span id="s40">And I was still there when they did it.</span> <span id="s41">A lot of people used to visit Lodz simply because of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Was it one of these wooden ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: No.</span> <span id="s44">No, it wasn’t a wooden one.</span> <span id="s45">In fact, I am almost certain, it was the nicest synagogue in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did it have b-i-g windows, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: It was an unusual structure.</span> <span id="s48">It had beautiful windows.</span> <span id="s49">In fact, I remember my father used to tell me stories about it.</span> <span id="s50">They used to import special painters from Italy to do certain paintings in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s51">And that was kind of an unusual thing.</span> <span id="s52">But the synagogue was burned.</span> <span id="s53">They burned it - they bombed it!</span> <span id="s54">And during the night.</span> <span id="s55">It wasn’t too far away from our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you were there at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yeah, I was there.</span> <span id="s58">I could see through the window what they did.</span> <span id="s59">Firebombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">They probably must have dynamited it.</span> <span id="s61">I don’t know how they did it, but we heard a big, loud noise, must have been about 12 o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: It must have shook the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: It shook the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s64">And we could see that the synagogue was burning.</span> <span id="s65">It must have been in November of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What events led up to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, it’s just one of those things.</span> <span id="s68">You mentioned the synagogue.</span> <span id="s69">I guess the Germans had in mind to destroy all Jewish things, and synagogues were the first thing to destroy.</span> <span id="s70">At that time, nobody knew “why,” or anything.</span> <span id="s71">The synagogue was closed.</span> <span id="s72">Nobody used to go anymore.</span> <span id="s73">They wouldn’t allow anybody to go into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s74">Rumors were that they...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So it must have been when you were quite young that they burned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah, I was about nine years old at the time.</span> <span id="s77">The Germans entered our city around the 10th of September.</span> <span id="s78">I guess the war started the 2nd.</span> <span id="s79">The 2nd of September, 11939, and they entered one week later and it must have been perhaps the month after that that they burned the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So they had taken over everything, but, lll</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Oh, yeah!</span> <span id="s82">Poland was gone.</span> <span id="s83">Poland surrendered, what there was left of Poland.</span> <span id="s84">But nobody knew “why” they do these things.</span> <span id="s85">They did a lot of other things, too, but nobody could foresee or think that this was the first stage of destroying all the Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did your family say anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well, my father wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s88">My father was in the army, a soldier.</span> <span id="s89">In 1939, he was 39 years old at that time, and they mobilized him, and he was in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s90">The Russians captured him.</span> <span id="s91">He was a prisoner of war in Russia.</span> <span id="s92">When they burned the synagogue, my father wasn’t back yet, but he came back later, at the end of November, or the first week in December.</span> <span id="s93">But then he stayed only a few weeks, and he left again.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: So, was your mother alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: My mother and my sisters were home in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: And you had a close community, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: We lived in a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s98">Everybody was Jewish in the neighborhood, you know.</span> <span id="s99">When you talk about 300,000 Jewish people, and the whole town, the city, had perhaps 400,000 - 500,000 population, more than half of the population was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How would you describe your family, as far as religious observance, their style of Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: My relatives were very religious.</span> <span id="s102">My great-grandfather was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s103">He was also a Rebbe.</span> <span id="s104">In fact, a lot of people still remember him.</span> <span id="s105">So my mother came from a very Orthodox family, and my father’s family was also Orthodox, but my father and my mother, we were more or less Conservative.</span> <span id="s106">We still had kosher food, and this sort of thing; we used to go to synagogue, but my father would travel on Saturday, for instance, and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s107">We used to go to the synagogue every Saturday, and we had kosher, but we were not completely Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Was that pretty common, that sort of mixed Conservative...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I would say the majority of people were Conservative.</span> <span id="s110">Maybe not Conservative as you would say conservative here.</span> <span id="s111">I would imagine that anyone Conservative in Poland would have been an Orthodox person here.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you speak Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes, we spoke only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s114">First language.</span> <span id="s115">We all talked Yiddish.</span> <span id="s116">Yiddish is still my mother language.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: I wish I could conduct the interview in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s118">(Laughter) I’m learning a little bit.</span> <span id="s119">Did you have some contact with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Ah (sigh), very little.</span> <span id="s121">The only non-Jew was a janitor.</span> <span id="s122">I guess the janitor was a special job - it was a privileged job.</span> <span id="s123">A Jew couldn’t have been a janitor even if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s124">We lived in a house, there were maybe 25 families.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: It must have been a big house.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, it wasn’t really big.</span> <span id="s127">25 families.</span> <span id="s128">We didn’t have big apartments, you know.</span> <span id="s129">Family of six, lived maybe in one room.</span> <span id="s130">We had two rooms, so we were considered rich (laughter).</span> <span id="s131">So the janitor, it was a special privilege to be a janitor.</span> <span id="s132">He was the only gentile, and he could sell his janitorial trade.</span> <span id="s133">In other words, he wanted to move away, someone would have to buy it, but it had to be a gentile.</span> <span id="s134">A Jew couldn’t have been a janitor.</span> <span id="s135">I suppose the reason for it was, because he had some sort of a book that he would write every name in the book, and you had to be registered in this book, and I guess the Poles maybe didn’t trust the Jew to do this type of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: He was the only gentile that I knew.</span> <span id="s138">He ha a few children and we played occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: He lived in the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: There was a separate building.</span> <span id="s141">He didn’t live in the main building, but next to it.</span> <span id="s142">I went to a Yiddish, Jewish, public school, a Polish school, but only for Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s143">We didn’t live together with gentile children.</span> <span id="s144">A Jewish school for boys, only.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe 60% or 70% of the teachers were gentile.</span> <span id="s146">The principal was a gentile, too, even though it was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s147">But other than that, I really didn’t have too much contact.</span> <span id="s148">My Dad did, because we used to have a few gentile people working for us, but this was the extent of gentile people.</span> <span id="s149">But gentile boys would beat us up every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: After school?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: After school!</span> <span id="s152">Every day almost, so this was the contact with gentiles.</span> <span id="s153">When I went to school, we walked.</span> <span id="s154">It was about three, four miles away from home, and there were a lot of churches on the way - Polish churches.</span> <span id="s155">And each time we would walk by a church a lot of gentile children, they would each time yell.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: They knew you.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s158">The Polish people would see a Jew, they would know a Jew was a Jew.</span> <span id="s159">Somehow they could recognize, and we could, too.</span> <span id="s160">I could tell who’s a gentile and who’s a Jew, just by looking at the person, and they could, too.</span> <span id="s161">So when the school let out, and we were going home, they would beat us up or throw stones.</span> <span id="s162">This was an everyday situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So you would just be ready for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah, we were prepared to run - or fight.</span> <span id="s165">I never did fight.</span> <span id="s166">I had a cousin who was really good in fighting, and he went to the same school, and he would fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you didn’t have friends who were gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, we never had gentile friends.</span> <span id="s169">That’s right.</span> <span id="s170">I never thought about it his way, but we never had gentile friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: So in the school, there was no kind of Jewish learning?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No.</span> <span id="s173">That was a public school.</span> <span id="s174">We had all just regular classes, and our curriculum was the regular curriculum, except we had “religion” - which they called “religion” - this was the Jewish religion, which they would teach us.</span> <span id="s175">This was a Jewish teacher who would teach us religion, in the Polish language.</span> <span id="s176">They didn’t teach us in Yiddish, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s177">The school was only Polish, in the Polish language, but the subject which maybe pertained to us as far as Jewish was concerned was “religion.”</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So that was your family’s choice to send you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, this was perhaps not our choice, but we couldn’t afford to go to private school, because we were well-to-do people, but we were not this rich.</span> <span id="s180">In order to send children to a private school, one had to be really extremely wealthy people.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: A private school would be a Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: You could have private schools where you could be taught by Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s183">They could still teach Polish and everything, but they would teach you Hebrew.</span> <span id="s184">And there were Hebrew schools, too.</span> <span id="s185">I used to go to a Heder after school, and they would teach us how to dovin and pray in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s186">But it wasn’t Hebrew as a language, it was Hebrew just to be able to read from the siddur.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So you went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I started when I was about five or six years old, learning to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: And it would be every day after school?</span> <span id="s190">Everyone would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s192">Almost everyone.</span> <span id="s193">Some people would have a Rabbi coming home to teach, to tutor.</span> <span id="s194">I would say the majority of kids would go to heder, like 90%.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you like it or not like it, one way or another?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, it was different, because they were all Jewish kids, the school was also Jewish, there was a Jewish rabbi with a beard, (laughter) and I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Were there other instances of names being called, being beat up as a common thing?</span> <span id="s198">How about for your family or the rest of your family in their dealings?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: It was the same thing.</span> <span id="s200">Except girls were a little better off.</span> <span id="s201">Boys didn’t dare to beat girls.</span> <span id="s202">They would say, “Oh, she’s a Jew,” but I remember one time my sister was walking and one Pole went by and said, “She’s a Jewess, but she is not rotten.”</span> <span id="s203">that was a Polish expression.</span> <span id="s204">If she was a good looking girl, that’s what he said.</span> <span id="s205">If she would be ugly, he would add some degrading word.</span> <span id="s206">But there was something, always something.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And the Polish girls - would they say things?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well, I don’t know, because girls wouldn’t beat me up.</span> <span id="s209">But I remember this one time my sister told me this story, where she worked, and these people yelled at her.</span> <span id="s210">But I think the girls didn’t have so much of a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And for your parents in the business world?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, in the business world.</span> <span id="s213">They tried to tell the Polish people not to buy from the Jewish merchants, to boycott the Jewish people, if they could.</span> <span id="s214">But it was difficult to boycott simply because the Jewish people offered their merchandise cheaper than the Polish people did.</span> <span id="s215">And you know, that’s the reason they still could stay in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You’re talking about all the time pre-war, pre-1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Pre-1939.</span> <span id="s218">But it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s219">The only thing that they could compete is simply because they were more efficient, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: The Jewish businessmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">They could sell for less.</span> <span id="s223">We had a lot of Polish people buying from us.</span> <span id="s224">They themselves wouldn’t sell to Jews, but they would come to us at night, sometimes, and buy merchandise.</span> <span id="s225">They had signs on the stores saying, “Here is a Pole who doesn’t buy from Jews.”</span> <span id="s226">(Quotes the Polish saying.)</span> <span id="s227">But he would come to buy from us, and he would have his own store.</span> <span id="s228">He wouldn’t come during the day.</span> <span id="s229">Afraid somebody could see him perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So in that sense we don’t know how long that was going on, maybe all the time, since you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I would imagine this must have been going on all along, because my father would tell me stories.</span> <span id="s232">All the years.</span> <span id="s233">But we lived in a Jewish neighborhood, so we didn’t have to do too much with gentiles.</span> <span id="s234">It wasn’t a ghetto, it was a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s235">There were Polish neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s236">I think the center of the city, or most of the center of the city, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">And on the periphery, that’s where the gentile neighborhoods were.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So, when the war came, you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: When the war started, I was in Lodz.</span> <span id="s240">My father, as I told you already, was in the army.</span> <span id="s241">He was mobilized about a month before the war started.</span> <span id="s242">He was stationed about 30 or 40 miles in a little town near Lodz.</span> <span id="s243">My mother and I visited him, about a month before the war started, but then after the war started, we didn’t hear from him again until he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So, what do you remember about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, I remember, before the war, everybody thought Poland’s going to win.</span> <span id="s246">We were convinced that we’re gonna win the war.</span> <span id="s247">And I say “we,” the Jewish people, even though they were in Poland, very much what you would call, second-class citizens.</span> <span id="s248">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s249">In the army you got to be a soldier, maybe to be a sergeant but you couldn’t be, let’s say, general or a colonel.</span> <span id="s250">They were not allowed.</span> <span id="s251">We couldn’t do a lot of things in Poland, but nevertheless, we felt pretty patriotic about Poland.</span> <span id="s252">I myself, I really felt patriotic.</span> <span id="s253">I would fight, if I were drafted, for Poland, and the feeling was there.</span> <span id="s254">The radio came every day that we were going to win the war, and England and France came to help.</span> <span id="s255">I remember the comments that England “helped” and France “started.”</span> <span id="s256">I guess they declared war on the Germans.</span> <span id="s257">And we were sure that we were going to win the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Everyone was optimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Everybody was optimistic.</span> <span id="s260">And we were digging trenches.</span> <span id="s261">In fact, the Jewish people were digging trenches very diligently.</span> <span id="s262">I was digging trenches, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did other activities stop then?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, the only activity to stop with me, is that I didn’t go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s265">We were supposed to start school in September and I did go to school, but there was nobody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: You walked to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I walked to school.</span> <span id="s268">There was nobody there.</span> <span id="s269">I met a few other people, and they didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s270">There was no principal.</span> <span id="s271">The principal was in the army.</span> <span id="s272">he was a major.</span> <span id="s273">So, I came home and I said, “There’s nobody in school.”</span> <span id="s274">This was the last time I went to school.</span> <span id="s275">I never went back, I guess.</span> <span id="s276">And we didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s277">But one week later, the Germans occupied our town.</span> <span id="s278">I think around the 10th.</span> <span id="s279">It didn’t take more than a week.</span> <span id="s280">It was on a Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So it was only one week that you were optimistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s283">It was on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s284">I remember that.</span> <span id="s285">On Shabbos morning we looked out the windows and I saw columns of tanks and artillery moving along the streets.</span> <span id="s286">The Polish army ran.</span> <span id="s287">About two or three days later they escaped.</span> <span id="s288">We could see that they’d been escaping.</span> <span id="s289">They were very poorly prepared.</span> <span id="s290">They ran, on horses.</span> <span id="s291">The Germans came on trucks - half tracks, motorized.</span> <span id="s292">There was no contest.</span> <span id="s293">But the Polish population was very optimistic.</span> <span id="s294">In fact, what I heard, the general, the head of the Polish army, he said that we were going to win the war, and everybody believed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: They wanted the people to be optimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s297">The first week when the Germans came in, I didn’t think in terms of anything to worry about.</span> <span id="s298">I never thought that it was going to be any different than it was.</span> <span id="s299">But I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s300">Our business wasn’t completely shot, we still did some business.</span> <span id="s301">People would come in and buy shoes from us, stores were still open.</span> <span id="s302">The currency, as I remember, was still good - Polish currency.</span> <span id="s303">But there was something different.</span> <span id="s304">For some reason there was no more stability in town.</span> <span id="s305">Nobody knew what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s306">Of course, I remember, I stood in front of the door, and a lot of the Germans walked by, and they looked at us, and they saw we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s307">The Germans couldn’t tell who was a Jew, who was a Pole, and I remember that this German drove by and he said, “You are Jews?”</span> <span id="s308">And we said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s309">And he said, “A bad time is coming to you.”</span> <span id="s310">He knew, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: You were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: We were kids.</span> <span id="s313">And we had a few Germans who told us we should escape.</span> <span id="s314">We had a lot of German people who did do with us business.</span> <span id="s315">Five or ten percent, I think, people living there were Germans.</span> <span id="s316">And we had a few people that would come to us, and said we should escape.</span> <span id="s317">My father wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s318">The second time my father came - from Russia - she and my father, then, together went back to Russia, and we stayed home, my three sisters and I. And this guy came and he said that we should escape if we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And who was this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: He was a German, but he lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s321">He could speak Polish.</span> <span id="s322">Probably he knew more than anybody else - than we knew, anyway - and he said, “If I would be you, I would.”</span> <span id="s323">He didn’t tell us what’s going to happen or anything like this, but he says we should escape if we can.</span> <span id="s324">And we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: You decided it was time.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, it wasn’t because so much what he said, but it was because my father went to Russia.</span> <span id="s327">But it wasn’t really Russia!</span> <span id="s328">Poland was divided, maybe you know about it.</span> <span id="s329">After the war, the Russians took half of it and the Germans took half of it.</span> <span id="s330">So, the Russian half, which is where my father was, he left.</span> <span id="s331">After the war, the Russian people had told the Jewish soldiers, “Go.”</span> <span id="s332">They kept the Poles, but they let the Jewish people go, so he came back, by foot.</span> <span id="s333">They wouldn’t allow Jews to travel on trains; the only thing you could do was walk.</span> <span id="s334">So he walked all the way from Bialystok, about 250 miles, a long distance.</span> <span id="s335">Well, at that time, we didn’t know that the Germans are out to destroy the Jewish people, but the rumors were that all the leaders are being taken first.</span> <span id="s336">Anybody who did anything they removed.</span> <span id="s337">Anybody who was anybody, the Germans took right away.</span> <span id="s338">So when my father came, my mother told him, “You’ve gotta leave right away.”</span> <span id="s339">And he did!</span> <span id="s340">He stayed about a day or two, and he left, went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Because he had been a leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: He was involved in many Jewish things in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: They would know his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: And they would know his name.</span> <span id="s345">And so he left.</span> <span id="s346">And then my mother went after that.</span> <span id="s347">My sisters and I stayed in Lodz, and we had money.</span> <span id="s348">Anybody who didn’t have any money couldn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: This was in ‘39?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: This was in ‘39, in about November.</span> <span id="s351">I think it must have been December that - it wasn’t a decision of mine, I was just too young to do anything - but my two oldest sisters hired somebody who had a horse and buggy and it took us about two, three days to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s352">Between Lodz and Warsaw, there was a border.</span> <span id="s353">Lodz, our town, was considered the German Reich, and beyond that was considered still Poland.</span> <span id="s354">So, we escaped by horse and buggy to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Why did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, (sigh) a lot of people escaped this way.</span> <span id="s357">There were hundreds and hundreds of people leaving at that time.</span> <span id="s358">It still was possible to do.</span> <span id="s359">This was right before Christmas, the second week of December, or maybe the third week in December.</span> <span id="s360">So my sisters and I, we came to Warsaw, and in Warsaw we had friends.</span> <span id="s361">My father did business in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s362">We knew all these people.</span> <span id="s363">And we stayed there for about a week.</span> <span id="s364">There was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s365">You could walk free, but nobody dared, really, to go any place, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: It wasn’t occupied yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s368">it was occupied.</span> <span id="s369">The Germans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So what did you say was the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: It was a border, but you could cross it, and nobody did anything to us.</span> <span id="s372">Now this was just a very temporary time, because, as I heard, about a week or two weeks later, after we crossed, they closed this border, and they didn’t allow anybody to escape any more.</span> <span id="s373">So we were just lucky to cross at that time.</span> <span id="s374">So once we came to Warsaw, we stayed.</span> <span id="s375">Then my father sent some people from the Russian side to bring us over.</span> <span id="s376">We had to cross, then, Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So you were in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: We were not in touch.</span> <span id="s379">He knew where we were going to be, and he sent somebody, and we had to pay them, we had to paper every hand to smuggle us through.</span> <span id="s380">So my oldest sister and I stayed in Warsaw and my two middle sisters went first.</span> <span id="s381">And then about a week later my oldest sister and I crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Also by horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span> <span id="s384">We walked a little bit farther after Warsaw, across the Vistula, and we stayed in Praga, another town, a suburb, I guess, of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s385">From there we took a train.</span> <span id="s386">They would allow us to take a train.</span> <span id="s387">And this was all arranged.</span> <span id="s388">We went on train to Radom, a little town, and from there we went by horse and buggy again, and we walked, until we crossed the Donets river.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Were the four of you together then?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No.</span> <span id="s391">Just my sister and I. And we had to cross the river, I guess by boat.</span> <span id="s392">I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s393">We crossed this river, and then the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And you were alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: We were going in a group of about 20 people.</span> <span id="s396">See, there were smugglers - this was a business - they would, let’s say, charge you 300 zlotys, which is like dollars, perhaps, for a head.</span> <span id="s397">They would smuggle like 20 people, 30 people.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t know how they did it.</span> <span id="s399">Maybe they paid Germans or whatever, but they were able to get groups like us across the border.</span> <span id="s400">This was just a little time, eleven months.</span> <span id="s401">When we came to cross the border, I remember that another fellow, a friend of ours, still lived in Bialystok, which is on the Russian side, and he was one of those guys who would smuggle people through.</span> <span id="s402">He tried to make another trip and they caught him, and he could never escape again.</span> <span id="s403">In 1940, after we crossed, they closed the borders.</span> <span id="s404">After that you couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: So it was in December of ‘39?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I say December, because I remember that it was Christmas.</span> <span id="s407">I remember a lot of Polish people that put up Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s408">We visited Polish farmers along the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: They were fairly friendly at that time to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: They knew what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: They knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s413">They would give us milk and food.</span> <span id="s414">We would stay about a night in a place and go.</span> <span id="s415">Warsaw was the first step.</span> <span id="s416">Then from Warsaw we went to several different towns until we went to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s417">Before the war it was Poland, but during the war and after the war, the Russian side took it.</span> <span id="s418">And then there was freedom again.</span> <span id="s419">You know, in the beginning, the Germans came out with that you had to wear a kind of yellow band.</span> <span id="s420">This was the first thing they did, like about a month after the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s421">Then you had to wear a Star of David on the front of your apparel.</span> <span id="s422">When I came to Russia, I still had it.</span> <span id="s423">The Russian soldiers looked at it and said, “What is that?”</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: They didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No.</span> <span id="s426">They didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So, was it maybe freer than it had even been for you before the war, living in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s429">I must say “yes.”</span> <span id="s430">When I came to Bialystok I felt I had more freedom than I had even before in Poland.</span> <span id="s431">Yes, I did feel that way, ‘cause I didn’t know what we were getting into.</span> <span id="s432">But to start out with, there was no fear or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And there were other people from...</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: There were a lot of people from the other side of the border.</span> <span id="s435">They were called “bieznik,” which means we were displaced people, or runners.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: People from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: From my town, or from the other side - from the German side.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So, how as it set up there, as far as your living?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, when we came, everybody had to make a living any way he could, and my dad, I don’t what he did, but I think he was doing all kind of business.</span> <span id="s440">He was selling, and buying and selling.</span> <span id="s441">What else can a Jew do here today?</span> <span id="s442">And he could just support us.</span> <span id="s443">there was a Russian school, and I went to school for a little while, and then - my father was a Polish citizen, and the Russians wanted my dad to become a Russian citizen, and he didn’t want to, I don’t know why , so this was the reason they sent us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s444">It’s north.</span> <span id="s445">So this is when we were saved, really.</span> <span id="s446">This was the only reason that we were saved.</span> <span id="s447">This was in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Could you say what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: This was in the summer.</span> <span id="s450">It must have been perhaps in June.</span> <span id="s451">And about 4 o’clock in the morning, some KGB people came in and told us we had about a half hour, and they put us in cattle trains, and it took us seven days until we got to the destination.</span> <span id="s452">And this is really what saved our lives, because, when the Germans started the war with Russia in 1941, it took them about one or two days and they were there, and nobody could escape at that time.</span> <span id="s453">but we were so far in Russia that they didn’t get to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: How was it that you were sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: As I told you, the reason the Russians sent us is because my dad didn’t want to become a Russian citizen.</span> <span id="s456">And there were a lot of people like this.</span> <span id="s457">A lot of people became Russian citizens, and you could stay there.</span> <span id="s458">But the people who didn’t want to be Russian citizens, - they were considered, I guess, an undesirable element - and they were sent to - it was called a Handersoblast.</span> <span id="s459">It’s up north.</span> <span id="s460">And we lived there for about 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And those were the ones who were saved in the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Those were the ones - if they could survive in Siberia.</span> <span id="s463">A lot of people died.</span> <span id="s464">No, I shouldn’t say a lot.</span> <span id="s465">I remember a few people dying, young people.</span> <span id="s466">But still, nothing compares to the people in the ghettos, in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did you hear of what happened to other people in the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s469">I had an uncle who lived in a little town north of Lodz, and he came to our town, but we were gone already when he came, and he moved in our house and he lived in our apartment, and they killed him, he and his wife.</span> <span id="s470">They had two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Your cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: My cousins.</span> <span id="s473">And only one girl survived out of these, and she still lives in Poland, now, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s474">She’s married to a professor.</span> <span id="s475">he teaches at the University of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s476">We got a letter from them once in Russia, and the letter said that we don’t know how lucky we are that we could escape.</span> <span id="s477">And he asked that we should send him something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Others of your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: My father had six brothers, I told you in the beginning, six brothers.</span> <span id="s480">They all died.</span> <span id="s481">None of them survived.</span> <span id="s482">And my aunts all died, too.</span> <span id="s483">And the same thing goes for my mother’s relatives.</span> <span id="s484">They all lived in Lodz.</span> <span id="s485">We were the only family who escaped.</span> <span id="s486">So, our family stayed intact - my father, my mother, and the four children.</span> <span id="s487">But some cousins did survive.</span> <span id="s488">We had a very big family, because you know, everybody had four or five children.</span> <span id="s489">So I had one cousin who was in the Lodz ghetto, he survived.</span> <span id="s490">he now lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s491">And I have another cousin who was in the ghetto and he lives now in New York.</span> <span id="s492">And his sister survived, too, so they had two.</span> <span id="s493">Then I have two other cousins living in Chicago.</span> <span id="s494">These are all the survivors.</span> <span id="s495">And from my mother’s side, there was one cousin - my mother’s sister’s son - he survived.</span> <span id="s496">He had two brothers, they all died.</span> <span id="s497">he was the only one who survived, and he lives in New York, too.</span> <span id="s498">And then I have another cousin who lives in Israel - he survived, too - so there are two in Israel and four in New York - in the United States - from the whole relation.</span> <span id="s499">We had a family of, I would say, about 150 cousins and aunts, uncles, and second cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Did you talk to them about escaping at the time when you left Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s502">Let me share some stories.</span> <span id="s503">This fellow who lives in New York, his brother went with my father to Warsaw, and then he came back.</span> <span id="s504">He didn’t want to go any farther.</span> <span id="s505">And he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s506">And I had an uncle, he was really a bright man, an inventor.</span> <span id="s507">He was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s508">My father begged him to go, and he said, “No.</span> <span id="s509">I don’t care.</span> <span id="s510">I don’t have to worry.”</span> <span id="s511">He didn’t think he had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: People didn’t want to leave their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s514">In fact, he made fun of people.</span> <span id="s515">“Where are you gonna go?”</span> <span id="s516">he used to make jokes, anybody who’s going is crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Was it thought that whatever would happen to them would eventually happen to the ones who escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Nobody could see this.</span> <span id="s519">There is a Polish joke, they used to call it Bialyspeek, and Bialyspeek means a person who has something stupid in his mind.</span> <span id="s520">So they would tell us that if you go, you escape, you’re crazy.</span> <span id="s521">What did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: But your family had enough encouragement, or enough...</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Well, my mother thought we should stay.</span> <span id="s524">We heard that my father’s dead, or something about his leg.</span> <span id="s525">There were all kinds of rumors, and there was no mail or anything.</span> <span id="s526">And finally he came home, and whew!</span> <span id="s527">She immediately changed, and said, “You better leave right away.”</span> <span id="s528">The following day or two days later he left.</span> <span id="s529">And I think this is the only reason we all left.</span> <span id="s530">We couldn’t foresee anything terrible is going to happen, but, because of his position, he had to go, and so we all went.</span> <span id="s531">After the war, I met a few people from our town.</span> <span id="s532">In fact, a friend of mine, he was my neighbor - he was a little older than I, and that’s why he survived, I guess - and he told me about a lot of things, about my uncle.</span> <span id="s533">And he saw a few of our friends being shot right in front of town.</span> <span id="s534">But we didn’t know anything of this sort.</span> <span id="s535">We couldn’t believe it happened.</span> <span id="s536">After the war, I thought, when I get home I have to tell him a lot of stories about Russia.</span> <span id="s537">How bad it was, and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s538">It was what I was going to tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I never went back to Lodz.</span> <span id="s541">My dad did.</span> <span id="s542">When we came back from Russia, my father went back, and that’s where he met my cousin - the one who did survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: What was it like in Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, you know, being a youngster, I guess, nothing is bad, really.</span> <span id="s545">I didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s546">I went to school.</span> <span id="s547">But my father and my sisters had to work.</span> <span id="s548">And life wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s549">We lived in a place just as cold as Minnesota.</span> <span id="s550">We had no heating.</span> <span id="s551">In fact, the water would freeze in the house.</span> <span id="s552">The only reason we survived is because we had some nice feather beds from the old country, so at least we could sleep.</span> <span id="s553">And we didn’t have enough winter clothes or food.</span> <span id="s554">But in comparison to the camps - to the ghettos - it was still good.</span> <span id="s555">I went to school, I used to go every day.</span> <span id="s556">We didn’t have good food, but still we could survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: What was the work?</span> <span id="s558">What did they make you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: You had to cut wood, cut hay - this sort of work.</span> <span id="s560">Menial work.</span> <span id="s561">Where we were, that was a camp for criminals, in a way.</span> <span id="s562">Political criminals.</span> <span id="s563">If you are a Russian, and if you say you don’t want to be a citizen, you could be considered a criminal.</span> <span id="s564">They never had children at these places - only older people, without children - but this was an exception.</span> <span id="s565">I guess they didn’t know where to put us, so they sent us there.</span> <span id="s566">It wasn’t the worst thing.</span> <span id="s567">We could survive, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: So your family was together?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yeah, we were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: How were you housed?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: We had one room - about the size of this room, maybe - where we lived, all of us, six people.</span> <span id="s572">And we had a little stove - wood - would warm it up.</span> <span id="s573">There was no insulation.</span> <span id="s574">It was cold!</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: You wore a lot of clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: We didn’t have good clothes.</span> <span id="s577">Life wasn’t easy there for anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So you were getting to be a young man.</span> <span id="s579">And you would go to school and the others would work and you could get food.</span> <span id="s580">You could shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No.</span> <span id="s582">In Russia you couldn’t buy things.</span> <span id="s583">They give it to you - for money - and you get so much per person, bread, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s584">There was no variety or anything of this sort.</span> <span id="s585">It was whatever they give you.</span> <span id="s586">So some days you had bread, some other times you had butter.</span> <span id="s587">I guess butter was almost never available, like milk was never available.</span> <span id="s588">We never had milk.</span> <span id="s589">Children never had milk.</span> <span id="s590">I wasn’t a child anymore, but I remember there were younger children than I, and they never had milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: You say there weren’t many children, but there were some?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Oh, yeah, there were a lot of children there.</span> <span id="s593">Younger children, I’d say, about three year olds, four year olds.</span> <span id="s594">I wonder how they did it.</span> <span id="s595">I guess even a thirteen year old child needs milk, too, but it’s not as crucial as it is for younger children.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And did they have any meat or such?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Occasionally we had meat - on holidays or this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s598">As a rule, there was no meat.</span> <span id="s599">But once in a while we’d have some meat.</span> <span id="s600">It wasn’t a balanced diet, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s601">But people could help themselves.</span> <span id="s602">There were rivers, and we went fishing, and we could catch birds, we had ducks.</span> <span id="s603">I would catch a lot of fish, and I used to catch ducks, too.</span> <span id="s604">We could even have a little garden.</span> <span id="s605">We had enough.</span> <span id="s606">We lived there for about fourteen months, and the summers are very short, but we were able to put up a garden, and we had potatoes and this sort of thing in the summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: How many people would you say were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, our camp, it wasn’t the only camp.</span> <span id="s609">I would say the whole area had about 4,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And it was both - criminals - well, they used to be called criminals - Russians and...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Well, before we came, the criminals lived there, but I guess they put them someplace else.</span> <span id="s612">Then they put us in there.</span> <span id="s613">Actually, when we came, they put us in barns.</span> <span id="s614">The first day was in a barn.</span> <span id="s615">Everyone had a stall just like we were a horse!</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Was it just Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: These were only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s618">The Polish people, they’d separate.</span> <span id="s619">they wouldn’t put Polish and Jewish together - even though we’re all Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s620">I don’t know in different camps, but in our camp, there were only Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Did people come and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: You couldn’t come and go.</span> <span id="s623">It was restriction - all you could do would be to be in the camp.</span> <span id="s624">You were not supposed to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s625">If you did leave the camp, you had to have a special permit, but they would never allow anybody to leave anyway.</span> <span id="s626">There was an uprising at one time.</span> <span id="s627">Some people - they didn’t realize what Russia is - and I remember that there was a fellow by the name of Yacha Morish - at one time I heard he was a Communist - he organized a group.</span> <span id="s628">They were going to escape f rom Siberia, and they took about three horses and they went to look for a road.</span> <span id="s629">To escape from Siberia was like to escape from the moon!</span> <span id="s630">Finally, he came back, and fell from the horse, and then the NKVD people came, and they beat everybody up.</span> <span id="s631">They didn’t do anything to us, we were just inside, the children.</span> <span id="s632">And they put him in jail, this guy - he got about ten years in jail - and most of these leaders that did the uprising.</span> <span id="s633">The uprising wasn’t set up against the Soviet Union, just trying to escape.</span> <span id="s634">There’s no such a thing as to escape from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Was he a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: He was a Jew, yeah.</span> <span id="s637">I heard he died in jail.</span> <span id="s638">In 1941, the Russian government allowed us to leave Siberia.</span> <span id="s639">All of us left.</span> <span id="s640">The Polish government intervened.</span> <span id="s641">There was a Polish government in Russia, started there when Germany declared war on Russia.</span> <span id="s642">Then to be a Polish citizen wasn’t so bad any more.</span> <span id="s643">So they let us go.</span> <span id="s644">We could go anyplace that we wanted to, in Russia.</span> <span id="s645">So we went to Ulyannas.</span> <span id="s646">It’s on the Volga.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Did you talk with friends?</span> <span id="s648">Did you have some peers - other than boys your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s650">I had probably a dozen friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: What did you think when you were there - how long you would be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s653">We didn’t believe that this would be forever.</span> <span id="s654">Nobody did believe that.</span> <span id="s655">We thought it was just a temporary thing.</span> <span id="s656">In fact, after the war broke out, we were glad we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: But you didn’t really know what was happening...</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: We didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s659">A lot of Russian people said people who come here always stay here, don’t leave anymore.</span> <span id="s660">They would tell us this.</span> <span id="s661">I guess they needed the Polish people - their friends - to make friendship with the Polish government.</span> <span id="s662">They had a Polish army, too.</span> <span id="s663">I guess this is why everybody who was a Polish citizen became more or less, what you would say, vindicated.</span> <span id="s664">So we were able to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: When you went, did everyone leave at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: From there, everybody.</span> <span id="s667">100%.</span> <span id="s668">Nobody would stay there.</span> <span id="s669">But people went to different places, to different places in Russia.</span> <span id="s670">We stayed in Vyanaska oblast - it’s a little place next to the Volga - for five, six years, until ‘45.</span> <span id="s671">I went to school, and my father was in the Russian army, mobilized.</span> <span id="s672">Then, after the war, they let us go back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Your school, was it a Russian school?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: A small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: It was a little village, a little country town.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And you learned Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: You speak many languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Well, not by choice.</span> <span id="s681">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So, were there other Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s684">We were perhaps 20 Jewish families where we lived.</span> <span id="s685">Then when we could leave for Poland, everybody left.</span> <span id="s686">We all left together.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: How would you travel then?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Then we traveled by train.</span> <span id="s689">This was the nicest trip - home.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: So this was also the longest place that you had stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: This was the longest place we stayed.</span> <span id="s692">That’s right.</span> <span id="s693">We stayed about five years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: So, then they said that people could come back, but you said you didn’t go to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No.</span> <span id="s696">The war was over, and they allowed us to leave for home.</span> <span id="s697">Home was Poland.</span> <span id="s698">Being a Polish citizen, we didn’t have to stay.</span> <span id="s699">My father had a first cousin who did become a Russian citizen, and did survive, too.</span> <span id="s700">He had to stay in Russia.</span> <span id="s701">They wouldn’t allow him to leave.</span> <span id="s702">I remember we met him on the way, and my father said to him, why don’t you come, and we’ll smuggle you through.</span> <span id="s703">He didn’t dare to do that, and he stayed in Russia.</span> <span id="s704">But they allowed us to go, so we went back home.</span> <span id="s705">Then we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Where did you go back to?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: We went to a little town called Klatsko.</span> <span id="s708">It used to be Germany before the war, but after the war it was annexed to Poland.</span> <span id="s709">We stayed there about six months.</span> <span id="s710">Then we went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Was there a place to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, they would give us, yes.</span> <span id="s713">They would treat us good.</span> <span id="s714">A lot of Germans escaped when the Russian army occupied all this area, so there were a lot of apartments.</span> <span id="s715">They would give us an apartment where Germans lived before, and we lived there the best we had in many, many years.</span> <span id="s716">We stayed about six months, and then they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s717">It was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s718">I was 15, so I was as tall as I am now - so for Poland, I was considered a tall fellow.</span> <span id="s719">I was six feet tall.</span> <span id="s720">And I didn’t have a passport.</span> <span id="s721">You had to have a passport if you worked there, some sort of document, if you’re 18.</span> <span id="s722">I looked maybe like 18, and I was working at that time with a friend of mine, and he was older, he was 18.</span> <span id="s723">He had a document.</span> <span id="s724">The Polish police would check documents, and I didn’t have any, so they put me in jail, with criminals.</span> <span id="s725">He went home to tell my dad that they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s726">So my father came to get me out, tell them I was only 16.</span> <span id="s727">So after this, I told my dad, “I’m not going to stay any longer.</span> <span id="s728">And we decided right then and there to leave.</span> <span id="s729">And then we left.</span> <span id="s730">A lot of people left at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Were you still together with your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No.</span> <span id="s733">All my sisters were married.</span> <span id="s734">Two sisters were married in Russia, and one of my sisters married in Platisviel, a little town in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: When you came back then, and you saw things that had happened, it was a surprise to everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: It was a surprise to everybody.</span> <span id="s737">It’s a shock.</span> <span id="s738">First of all, the whole family was gone.</span> <span id="s739">We knew that if we wouldn’t have escaped, this would have happened to us, too.</span> <span id="s740">And we could have been killed twice.</span> <span id="s741">First, if we wouldn’t have escaped, and second, even if we would have escaped, if my dad would have become a Russian citizen, they would have caught us at that time.</span> <span id="s742">So it was twice that my chance we were able to survive.</span> <span id="s743">In this respect, it is almost fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So, you feel like a lucky one.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well...not lucky.</span> <span id="s746">I wouldn’t say lucky.</span> <span id="s747">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So then how did you spend your time afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: You had to do something, so I decided to go to school.</span> <span id="s750">I studied at the University.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: For a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: For five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Where in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Giessen.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Was it a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Giessen is about 40,000 population.</span> <span id="s757">I stayed there for five year and graduated there as a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s758">I applied also to study medicine, and I was accepted, and I studied medicine for three years in Munich.</span> <span id="s759">They had a quota in order to come to American from Poland and I didn’t know how long it would take me to get there.</span> <span id="s760">My father and my mother went to live in this country, they went to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: When did they come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: They came here in 1952, I think.</span> <span id="s763">And so I studied medicine, and then my quota came.</span> <span id="s764">I had my choice to go or stay, and I thought, I’m going to go.</span> <span id="s765">So I came here in 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Could you go other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I could go anyplace, I guess.</span> <span id="s768">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: To Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s771">I coulda gone.</span> <span id="s772">My father and my mother lived in New York, and my sisters lived in New York.</span> <span id="s773">I had one sister in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Have you been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: So when you came over then, did you live with...</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I lived with my folks - my father, and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And they were working in...</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: My father worked.</span> <span id="s780">It wasn’t the greatest.</span> <span id="s781">My father came from being a big businessman to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s782">But he didn’t complain.</span> <span id="s783">He liked it.</span> <span id="s784">But then my mother died and my father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: My father died in 1960.</span> <span id="s787">My mother in ‘56.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I was there when my mother died, but I wasn’t there when my father died.</span> <span id="s790">I came to Minnesota about the end of 1969.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: And by then you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Well, I was about 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Were there many people coming here?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: To Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: No.</span> <span id="s797">The only reason I came is to get a job with the government.</span> <span id="s798">I work for the federal government.</span> <span id="s799">that’s why I came here.</span> <span id="s800">Otherwise I wouldn’t be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And you met your wife here?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: I met my wife here and got married, and we have five children.</span> <span id="s803">One of my daughters is studying at Columbia University.</span> <span id="s804">She wants to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s805">It’s her second year now.</span> <span id="s806">And my son is going to St. Thomas school.</span> <span id="s807">He wants to be a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s808">He’s a first year.</span> <span id="s809">And I have another son and two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Great.</span> <span id="s811">How is your contact here with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Well, we belong to Temple of Aaron.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Are there many people from your past that you’re still in contact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: You mean from Poland?</span> <span id="s815">Yes.</span> <span id="s816">I have a friend, he’s a physician in Minneapolis, and he went through the same thing I did.</span> <span id="s817">Very much the same - stayed in Russia.</span> <span id="s818">Very similar situation.</span> <span id="s819">And there are a few other people I know from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Are there any things that you keep from that time?</span> <span id="s821">Any photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Well, when we escaped from Poland during the war, we left everything!</span> <span id="s823">We had a big store, and hundreds of shoes.</span> <span id="s824">It was worth a lot of money, and I looked at my father and I said, “How came you leave all this stuff?”</span> <span id="s825">We left everything.</span> <span id="s826">We had nothing except for one picture.</span> <span id="s827">We had one picture, which was my sister’s, I guess.</span> <span id="s828">For some reason she had it and we made a big picture out of it, and I still have it.</span> <span id="s829">That was the only picture from the old country that we had.</span> <span id="s830">Would you like to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: I’d love to.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: She made a big picture, and it’s very old.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: An inch by an inch!</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: It was a very tiny picture.</span> <span id="s835">And this was my father, and that’s my uncle, that’s my aunt, that’s my three sisters, and that’s myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: And when was this picture taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: This was in Poland.</span> <span id="s838">I guess it must have been in 1930.</span> <span id="s839">This was the only thing - it was all scratched up - like when you carry a picture in your wallet for 15 years.</span> <span id="s840">We were fortunate to make this picture.</span> <span id="s841">This was in the country - about three, four miles from Lodz.</span> <span id="s842">We used to go there every summer, like a summer home.</span> <span id="s843">We didn’t own a summer home, but we would rent.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: It’s nice.</span> <span id="s845">it’s good, good to have.</span> <span id="s846">Was there anything else you want to say - just your own feelings or thoughts - how it is for you now - say, with your family?</span> <span id="s847">Your daughters?</span> <span id="s848">Do you talk about the past at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well, no, I don’t really.</span> <span id="s850">I don’t talk too much about the past, with them.</span> <span id="s851">They don’t now anything about that.</span> <span id="s852">To them, you know, this really doesn’t mean much.</span> <span id="s853">They wouldn’t understand anything.</span> <span id="s854">There’s no point of talking, trying to explain - there’s no sense for comprehension.</span> <span id="s855">An American cannot understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Do you feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Well, I think so.</span> <span id="s858">I think the only person who can understand that is one who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So you wouldn’t try to tell it - when they were older?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Well, I try to tell my kids other things which they would learn, is not to be cowards.</span> <span id="s861">Like my son, for instance, he is going to be a black belt.</span> <span id="s862">Like on television - always able to defend yourself - he’s a brown belt now.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: In karate.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: In karate.</span> <span id="s865">And he’s eighteen.</span> <span id="s866">And he’s not scared of anybody.</span> <span id="s867">he wouldn’t let anybody beat him up.</span> <span id="s868">And my little fellow, h e’s seven.</span> <span id="s869">He’s a brown belt.</span> <span id="s870">Also, they’re very proud of Israel.</span> <span id="s871">They were in Israel - almost everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Individually?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Individually.</span> <span id="s874">Yes.</span> <span id="s875">And in a way, they sympathize with the people who went through all this stuff.</span> <span id="s876">And I guess, they hear sometimes - they hear stories - but I don’t really tell ‘em too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: I did tell her about these things, but you know, she was born here.</span> <span id="s879">And I somehow don’t think that people really like to hear these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: It’s hard.</span> <span id="s881">I think it would be hard in the family, you know, and people make their own decisions about what’s best to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s883">People should remember.</span> <span id="s884">People should never forget.</span> <span id="s885">It’s good that we have books and movies and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s886">I really think everybody should remember - including people who were never there.</span> <span id="s887">I think we all learned a good lesson from this.</span> <span id="s888">I think people probably hope for the best and then prepare for the worst.</span> <span id="s889">I think anything would happen in Germany at that time is a thing can only happen once.</span> <span id="s890">I really don’t believe it could happen again.</span> <span id="s891">It can happen again, but people are not going to let it happen!</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: It feels safer now.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Sure it is.</span> <span id="s894">They can still kill people and still do things, but it won’t be easy.</span> <span id="s895">I think it will be harder to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: I think so.</span> <span id="s897">I think a lot of people know now.</span> <span id="s898">Partly, I think that’s a reason people want to know.</span> <span id="s899">(Sigh) This completes the interview with Henry Abramowicz by Lynn Rosen on June 14, 1982.</span></p></body></html>
