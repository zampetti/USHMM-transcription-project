<html><body><p><span id="s1">Abstract This is the story of famed harpsichordist, Zuzana Ruzickova.</span> <span id="s2">She tells of her childhood growing up in Plzeň in an assimilated, well-to-do Czech family.</span> <span id="s3">As a child, she was not aware of any anti-Semitism until the Nazi occupation and the Nuremburg Laws; she had always thought of herself as Czech with a Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s4">Looking for a place to belong, it was around this time that she became a Zionist.</span> <span id="s5">Her parents considered sending her to England on a Kindertransport, but she did not want to leave them.</span> <span id="s6">Although the family had affidavits to leave the country and go to the United States, Zuzana’s father had an intense patriotism for Czechoslovakia and couldn’t leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">She tells of being moved from her home into combined flats.</span> <span id="s8">When the transports from Plzeň began, the Jewish children were forced to deliver the notices to those scheduled for transport.</span> <span id="s9">She and her family were sent to the Terezin ghetto in January 1942.</span> <span id="s10">It was here that she met Freddy Hirsch who took care of the children and elderly.</span> <span id="s11">Zuzana worked with him in caring for the children.</span> <span id="s12">At first Zuzana and her mother were together, but she was later sent to live in the Children’s Home.</span> <span id="s13">On Sundays she was allowed to visit with her parents; and also visited her grandparents.</span> <span id="s14">Her father and grandparents died in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s15">In 1943 she went outside the ghetto to work in the fields; she describes this as a somewhat happy time.</span> <span id="s16">In late spring 1943 the Swiss Red Cross visited the ghetto; conditions were made to look good for their visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">In December 1943 Zuzana and her mother were sent to Auschwitz; it was here that she was tattooed and made to sign a document stating that she had been arrested for anti-German activity.</span> <span id="s18">Freddy Hirsch had already been sent there in September; when she saw him at Auschwitz, he told her to say that she was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s19">Again she worked with Freddy, helping with the children.</span> <span id="s20">Zuzana tells of the horrible conditions at Auschwitz and the smell and fires from the gas chambers; and how people were thrown into pits, doused with gasoline, and burned alive if there was no gas.</span> <span id="s21">She recounts that the date of her gassing was supposed to be June 6, 1944, but the Germans needed men to fight, so she was chosen for slave labor instead.</span> <span id="s22">From Auschwitz she and her mother were sent to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s23">In February 1945 they were transported to Bergen-Belsen which she describes as not being organized; a place where they were meant to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">At the end of the war the Germans abandoned the camp leaving no food and disconnecting the water; many had bubonic plague.</span> <span id="s25">A Hungarian detail of the Nazi army came through, shooting into the blocks.</span> <span id="s26">They were finally liberated by the English.</span> <span id="s27">After her recovery she worked in the British General Hospital as a translator helping doctors and patients communicate with each other.</span> <span id="s28">Zuzana’s mother was also very ill, and she thought going back to Plzeň would help.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">The post-war period in Plzeň was difficult.</span> <span id="s30">She tells of survivor’s guilt, how she tried to commit suicide, how she met her husband Viktor, and how she again took up her music.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Transcripts of taped interviews with Zuzana Ruzickova March 27 - Apri1, 1991 Note: These interviews were mainly conducted in English, and transcribed here verbatim [with minor corrections] Occasional Czech words are retained here in Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">We begin by looking through old photograph albums and piles of loose photographs of the family before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s33">"My father was a great photographer," Zuzana begins, and goes through the photographs with me.</span> <span id="s34">We spend the entire first session, and part of the second looking through the photographs.</span> <span id="s35">I am afraid to get to the real story, and perhaps she is also.</span> <span id="s36">Below are her and my comments, upon looking at the pictures: [Revealed are pictures of a privileged life--servants, nannies, elegant houses, fine furniture, lovely clothes.</span> <span id="s37">In most of the pictures there is Zuzana, a much beloved, perhaps even neurotically over-cosseted only child.</span> <span id="s38">Many pictures of a little girl in dress-up clothes - dressed as a maid, as a fairy] Zuzana: I loved to dress up.</span> <span id="s39">Here is a picture of me as a služka [a maid, domestic]; a family outing to Dobříš (Doberschisch, Dobrisch) — mother, father, Zuzana.</span> <span id="s40">Then pictures of Zuzana and Dagmar, her cousin, with whom she was brought up, almost as a twin.</span> <span id="s41">They were often dressed in identical outfits.</span> <span id="s42">In this picture they are wearing little checked dresses with white aprons.</span> <span id="s43">Each child has a governess standing solicitously behind her.</span> <span id="s44">Apparently the governesses were in competition with each other over which little girl was finer, neater, brighter.</span> <span id="s45">Here is a picture of Zuzana with Karla, her nursemaid; another picture of Zuzana and Dagmar, in identical cloth coats and plaid scarves; a picture of Zuzana and her mother in mother-daughter outfits.</span> <span id="s46">A stylized photo of the school play; one child playing Mother Earth; Zuzana and other children dressed as spring flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NARRATIVE BEGINS: I was a forget-me-not here, and Dagmar was a daisy — we were properly educated.</span> <span id="s48">We went to a Cvičná Škola — where teachers were trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">At one time when I was 9 years old, I had bad pneumonia.</span> <span id="s50">My parents were really worried — I had a high fever.</span> <span id="s51">My mother said if you get well you may have any wish you want.</span> <span id="s52">So then when I got well I said I want to take piano lessons.</span> <span id="s53">That’s how it all began.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">She tells of her first piano teacher, Marie Provazniková.</span> <span id="s55">We always called her Milostpani, Madame.</span> <span id="s56">She was titled Milostpani by my mother and father; she smoked.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">She really loved me.</span> <span id="s58">She came on Sundays and we played and played.</span> <span id="s59">She never insisted on my practicing a lot.</span> <span id="s60">When she saw some piece of music which isn’t going so well, she just changed it.</span> <span id="s61">My mother used to worry about this, and Milostpani would tell her, the important thing is that she not get tired of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">We went through the whole repertory.</span> <span id="s63">I still have a little notebook where I recorded what we played, and it still amazes me; we sight-read through everything!</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Then she discovered very early that I was especially in love with Bach.</span> <span id="s65">She thought at first that I should play the organ.</span> <span id="s66">But then I had lung troubles, and the doctor said that it was too cold in churches.</span> <span id="s67">So she said all right, you’11 learn the harpsichord.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">One Christmas she gave me the Goldberg Variations and said, with reverence, one day you’ll be able to play these.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">She was my teacher from the time I was 9 to 13.</span> <span id="s70">After that, the Germans came.</span> <span id="s71">She allowed me to keep coming, though I had to hide my star; and it was dangerous for her as well.</span> <span id="s72">She taught me until the last moment; until we went to the camp.</span> <span id="s73">She was a very courageous and beautiful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">[NOTE: I don’t pick up all the words "until we went to the camp”.</span> <span id="s75">I am still afraid to go on.</span> <span id="s76">I want to stay at the ‘before’ phase for as long as possible; to keep dwelling on this happy, prosperous family, her piano lessons etc.]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Question: What year did you begin piano lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">In 1936, when I was not quite 9; to 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">In 1936 everything was still perfectly O.K., and I spent all my time at the piano from then on; I was in love with music and devouring it.</span> <span id="s80">My teacher was also happy with me; she said that I would fulfill all that she had dreamed for herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Phone rings.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">So, 1936 was still all right.</span> <span id="s83">I was spending all my free time with music.</span> <span id="s84">In the end, the decision was made in favor of Madame Provazniková.</span> <span id="s85">I was allowed to take lessons in harmony and counterpoint with a composer who lived in Plzeň (Pilsen), Bartovsky.</span> <span id="s86">And Milostpani didn’t waste any time and already wrote to Paris, to Wanda Landowska, whether she would be willing to accept such a child.</span> <span id="s87">I would have been 14.</span> <span id="s88">So, I had the prospect that when I finished my obligatory studies that year, I would be allowed to go to Paris and study at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Laie) with Wanda Landowska.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">I went to the classical gymnasium; that's where my way parted with Dagma.</span> <span id="s90">She decided to go into natural sciences; she wanted to become a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s91">She loved animals and everything to do with animals; and I wanted to have a classical education.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Started Gymnasium in 1938; I liked going to school.</span> <span id="s93">I had been so sickly as a child and had missed so much school that going to school was something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">My only problem, when I came to school, I was extremely sensitive to noise.</span> <span id="s95">I was not used to being with many children, and the noise bothered me very much.</span> <span id="s96">Maybe that's why I chose the harpsichord, a silent instrument.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">I remember when my father first bought a radio; I used to run away and scream because it was too loud for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">I remember when my mother consulted our pediatrician about the problem with my sensitivity to noise.</span> <span id="s99">The doctor told her: You should quarrel more; your home is too silent.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">I remember in Plzeň there was a spring festival of opera; we had a family box.</span> <span id="s101">I used to get so excited that I would almost always get ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">I would say I was an overly sensitive child, even a neurotic child; always having terrible anxieties about my parents — whether they will come home, whether something terrible would happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">My mother certainly was over-protective of me; my father was not.</span> <span id="s104">He was himself a little handicapped by his wound, [CHECK] but he was very devoted to sports and gymnastics.</span> <span id="s105">He always said: I want you to be a sporting girl; which I was very bad at.</span> <span id="s106">But I had to ski, and to skate, and very early, I had to swim; which I loved above all sports.</span> <span id="s107">I played ping-pong; I wasn't allowed to play tennis.</span> <span id="s108">My father loved tennis, but I wasn't allowed to play tennis when I started the piano because of my hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">My father didn't want me to be educated as an intellectual child.</span> <span id="s110">Sometimes my mother would worry; she'll get too tired, she'll catch a cold.</span> <span id="s111">But in the end my father always prevailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">In the end it saved my life, that my mother was overanxious.</span> <span id="s113">The whole family was always saying, oh, why don't you leave her alone, a healthy child.</span> <span id="s114">But it saved my life, insofar as when I went to the camp, I was a healthy child because of all her care.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">The tragedy was that just at the moment when I became a normal child — because when I was a little child, I never wanted to eat anything — and suddenly I became very hungry; at that moment it happened.</span> <span id="s116">It was around puberty that I became healthy and wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s117">I also started menstruating.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WHEN DID THINGS FIRST START GOING WRONG?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">I've been thinking about it a lot now, seeing those children with the gas masks [Gulf crisis - children in Israel wear masks; TV full of this].</span> <span id="s120">My first terrible trauma was when we were given gas masks in school.</span> <span id="s121">I came home and cried bitterly, ‘There will be war, there will be war.’</span> <span id="s122">The moment I was given this mask it was, for me, the end of my childhood.</span> <span id="s123">I realized there could be war; that my father could be going into this war and could be killed.</span> <span id="s124">Until then war was something historical.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">I had some inkling, from the conferences behind closed doors, with my cousins and my uncles.</span> <span id="s126">I knew something was going on; that was Moravec from Vienna.</span> <span id="s127">My parents tried very hard to keep all of it from me.</span> <span id="s128">I thought maybe there were some worries about the shop; sometimes they had conferences when something went wrong, about taxes or something.</span> <span id="s129">But gas masks proved that there will be a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">There were only five or six Jewish children in my school.</span> <span id="s131">As a matter of fact, I didn't really realize that was the good and the bad thing.</span> <span id="s132">I didn't realize that we were something special.</span> <span id="s133">Of course I went to a different religion class, but Catholics went to a different class, and Protestants, and Jews went to a different class.</span> <span id="s134">There were special times when people took religious classes, and we went each to ours.</span> <span id="s135">We had a special class for all the Jewish children of all the schools at the synagogue, a big lovely synagogue in Plzeň.</span> <span id="s136">Once a week, we went, for religious instruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">I really wasn't aware of any anti-Semitism at all.</span> <span id="s138">Maybe that was special because other Jewish children have told me they had classmates who made jokes about it, but I never did.</span> <span id="s139">So I felt it as a natural thing that I'm a Czech with a Jewish religion, and that's that.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">It didn't start until Hitler came, until the occupation.</span> <span id="s141">Then, suddenly, some of my classmates turned very nasty.</span> <span id="s142">They didn't talk to me, separated themselves from me.</span> <span id="s143">And in our building there was a German family.</span> <span id="s144">The boy had always been very friendly; I have some photographs of me with him.</span> <span id="s145">Suddenly he started wearing a Nazi uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">When the Nazis came, the Nuremberg laws were enforced, and that was that.</span> <span id="s147">I was perfectly shocked, and asked questions, of course, and wanted immediately to be informed.</span> <span id="s148">If I don't belong here, where do I belong, was the childish question.</span> <span id="s149">How come that they didn't tell me that I don't belong here, that we are a different nation, different race.</span> <span id="s150">So immediately I started reading any book on the Jewish religion, Jewish history; and I became an ardent Zionist immediately.</span> <span id="s151">At that time, the natural conclusion was, if I don't belong here, I belong somewhere else.</span> <span id="s152">Where do I belong to?</span> <span id="s153">To Palestine — I'll go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">My mother was terribly worried that this would hurt my father's feelings as a Czech Jew, so she told me not to bring those books home.</span> <span id="s155">Then my father found out about it, and he talked with me like an adult.</span> <span id="s156">And he told me to get informed about it.</span> <span id="s157">He didn't feel hurt at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">There were discussions about leaving.</span> <span id="s159">My father started to learn Spanish, because he thought Latin America would be a possible place.</span> <span id="s160">We also had English conversation classes with an Englishman.</span> <span id="s161">And my mother started to learn sewing ties, because she thought that maybe it would be a good idea to earn her living like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Then there were transports of children [Kindertransport] going to England.</span> <span id="s163">My parents considered that, but I was terribly opposed.</span> <span id="s164">I'd say, ‘I would die if I would leave you, and I'm not going.’</span> <span id="s165">I was treated as an adult.</span> <span id="s166">I was always asked my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">About the Zionist thing, my father was always very understanding.</span> <span id="s168">Even afterwards, in Theresienstadt, when I joined a Communist group; not as a believer, but I wanted to get informed and started to go to classes in Marxist-Leninism.</span> <span id="s169">My father always told me to get informed.</span> <span id="s170">I went there and didn't like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">He could have been ridiculed for it.</span> <span id="s172">People might have said: Now you see this assimilated family, and the daughter is a Zionist!</span> <span id="s173">But I used to have big discussions with friends of my father.</span> <span id="s174">I'd say: Now you see that assimilation doesn't work.</span> <span id="s175">I don't think my father ever changed his mind.</span> <span id="s176">He always was devoted to this county, but I think he could see my way of reasoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">I'd say: Look, this doesn't work.</span> <span id="s178">Looking back in history, there were always pogroms, Jews were always persecuted.</span> <span id="s179">The only way to get out of this, I'd say, is to form your own state.</span> <span id="s180">I tried to find out what was the source of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s181">I really didn't know about the existence of anti-Semitism until the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Even in Dobříš where there was a large Jewish community, my grandmother was almost like part of the gentry.</span> <span id="s183">When a child was ill, she sent a doctor, sent baskets to the poor.</span> <span id="s184">The children from Dobříš who joined our little group — I don’t even know which of them was Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">It was fun for me to go to the synagogue; it was fun to go to the Catholic procession.</span> <span id="s186">The anti-Semites come from Moravia or Slovakia.</span> <span id="s187">In Bohemia, under Masaryk, it was very enlightened; not a single anti-Semitic incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">I only remember one thing; my father was always very, very cross with Jews who were talking German.</span> <span id="s189">Then I heard about anti-Semitism for the first time, because I heard my father say, then it would be no wonder if people were anti-Semites because this is Czechoslovakia, and people shouldn't talk German.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">After the occupation, what happened?</span> <span id="s191">We had to leave school, immediately.</span> <span id="s192">The Germans came in April; June was the end of school year.</span> <span id="s193">In September, no more school.</span> <span id="s194">There was a Jewish Gymnasium [High School] in Brno.</span> <span id="s195">So there were Jewish students from higher classes who came to teach us children; and even non-Jewish students volunteered to teach us.</span> <span id="s196">And then the Germans even stopped that; so no more school.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">{END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.01.12} {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.02.12} MORE BACKGROUND: [looking at photos again:] My parents were an ill-suited couple, though the marriage was very good.</span> <span id="s198">My grandmother was the musical one.</span> <span id="s199">She loved life, music, theater, concerts, traveling.</span> <span id="s200">My grandfather was a nature lover; spent most of his free time in woods, garden, natural history museum.</span> <span id="s201">Grandfather's great passion was identifying flowers.</span> <span id="s202">We all got this love of nature from him.</span> <span id="s203">This passion runs in the family; all Ružičkas have this trait, which is not very typically Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">There is this legend about the Ružička family not being originally Jewish, being Czech Brethren, a Protestant group who were persecuted by Catholics; so quite a lot of them converted to Judaism.</span> <span id="s205">This legend runs in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">They had five children, Jindrich and Paula.</span> <span id="s207">Here is the whole family; here is my father, Jaroslav; his brother Karel; these are the daughters, Vlasta, Jiřina and Zdena.</span> <span id="s208">You will note that most of the names are Czech names; that was because the whole family was intensely patriotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">My grandfather was evicted from Vienna for founding the first Czech patriotic committee that then turned into Sokol.</span> <span id="s210">There was a hate of Vienna and of the Austrian Empire.</span> <span id="s211">The whole family was involved in Sokol.</span> <span id="s212">My grandfather was even the chairman of the local Sokol group.</span> <span id="s213">[Sokol was also persecuted by the Nazis].</span> <span id="s214">It was quite unusual for a Jewish family to be so involved in Czech affairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">They were not observant.</span> <span id="s216">My grandfather used to go to synagogue for the holidays.</span> <span id="s217">My father did not; he was a declared atheist.</span> <span id="s218">Nobody kept kosher, nobody spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s219">The family was quite assimilated much earlier than anybody else.</span> <span id="s220">So - that's the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">[LOOKING AT MORE PHOTOS] Here is my father's brother, Karel.</span> <span id="s222">He was a legionnaire in the First World War; deserted from the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s223">My father was wounded in the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Here is the whole family when my grandfather was 75; that was a big assembly.</span> <span id="s225">Here is Vlasta; she was the only one in the family who had aspirations to become an active musician.</span> <span id="s226">She had a wonderful voice.</span> <span id="s227">She married and didn't go on; but she always regretted it.</span> <span id="s228">Here's Jiřina and Zdena; both divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Here is my mother; she came from a very different family.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Here I am!</span> <span id="s231">Here, with Zdena's daughter and Jiřina's daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">And this is Dagmar, the daughter of Karel and Kamila.</span> <span id="s233">I will talk about her later because she was very much involved in my life.</span> <span id="s234">She was exactly my age; she was a month younger.</span> <span id="s235">Because my father and Karel looked alike and were very close, we lived next door to each other; and we were like sisters.</span> <span id="s236">Mostly we wore the same clothes, went to the same school and were inseparable.</span> <span id="s237">Because I didn't have any other brother or sister, so we were like twins.</span> <span id="s238">Dagmar later got a baby brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">This is Eva, who is still alive, in Israel; Zdena's daughter.</span> <span id="s240">She also took up a musical career, a soubrette in Operetta Theater in Prague.</span> <span id="s241">Her daughter, Jana, is a famous film star now here in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">We were very much influenced by our grandmother who took us to concerts and theaters.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Jindrich, when he came from Vienna, started selling old iron.</span> <span id="s244">He came back to Plzeň and sold scrap metal.</span> <span id="s245">Actually, he was a junk dealer.</span> <span id="s246">This then developed into a toy shop, which went very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">So when I was born, it was quite a big shop.</span> <span id="s248">Both sons, daughters, and Paula worked in this shop.</span> <span id="s249">Then the wives started another shop, Filialka [the Affiliated Shop], and that went very well.</span> <span id="s250">My father went to Chicago for four years; went through this experience in the Ginsburg department store.</span> <span id="s251">When he came back, he started a sort of a department store next to the shop; sold jewelry, lingerie.</span> <span id="s252">So when people came to Plzeň to shop for toys, they could buy all these other things.</span> <span id="s253">The shop was called Ružička, Hracky [toys] Ružička.</span> <span id="s254">So that's the family; a thriving business and a thriving family.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">My mother had a lot of business experience; she came from Dobříš.</span> <span id="s256">Her father had started as an assistant in a grocery store; met my grandmother on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s257">She, like Goethe's Lotte, took care of her small siblings; she was an orphan.</span> <span id="s258">When my grandfather saw how she took care of her sisters and brothers, he said, I will wait for you; she was 14 then.</span> <span id="s259">He did, and he married her.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Women in Dobříš began to specialize in sewing gloves, imported leathers, founded littler companies.</span> <span id="s261">Soon this became a big business.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">My mother at that time wanted to be a medical doctor, and she would have been extremely gifted.</span> <span id="s263">But at the time it was impossible for a daughter from a good family to go and take up a profession.</span> <span id="s264">At the time there were also other difficulties.</span> <span id="s265">She had two sisters and a brother; the brother was the youngest.</span> <span id="s266">Then he came from the war, he was drafted [World War 1]; and it must have been a very traumatic experience for him.</span> <span id="s267">He studied at the chemical faculty, and he came back and somehow didn’t adjust again.</span> <span id="s268">He couldn’t recover, and in the end he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s269">After that, my mother decided that she couldn’t leave her parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">My mother's parents came from a very religious background; and my grandfather has never been told that his son committed suicide because that would have been a terrible blow to him.</span> <span id="s271">They were the Lederers; my mother's mother was a Fleishman.</span> <span id="s272">Paula was Zuzana’s paternal grandmother; Paula’s family was Steinschuss.</span> <span id="s273">Leopolda Lederer was Zuzana Ruzickova’s mother after her grandfather, Leopold Lederer; Zuzana’s maternal grandmother was Zdenka Fleishman.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">My mother stayed in Dobříš and started her own porcelain shop.</span> <span id="s275">Then she wanted to go to Prague, so she became an accountant for a lacquer company.</span> <span id="s276">So she had a lot of business experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">To complete the family tree, there were three daughters and one son.</span> <span id="s278">Of the three daughters, one ended up in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s279">One is still alive, Elsa; she is 102 years old.</span> <span id="s280">She emigrated before the war.</span> <span id="s281">She was Elsa Lederer and is now Elsa Moravec.</span> <span id="s282">She emigrated in 1937, because of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s283">They were living in Vienna, so they felt it more.</span> <span id="s284">They had an umbrella business; they still have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Otto, their son, kept coming and having long conferences with my parents insisting that they should emigrate as well.</span> <span id="s286">Even the Ginsburgs, your relatives from Chicago, sent affidavits to my family.</span> <span id="s287">[To be accepted into the U.S. you had to have an affidavit.]</span> <span id="s288">So we had these affidavits; we had them in our pockets.</span> <span id="s289">But because of this intense patriotism of my father, because of his being in the Sokol, our flat was always full of his ‘brothers’ from the Sokol saying, now, you cannot desert us, you will become an honorary Aryan because you are a Czech and not a Jew.</span> <span id="s290">So my father said: I can't desert my country.</span> <span id="s291">So he volunteered for the army before Munich.</span> <span id="s292">Of course after Munich the army was demobilized, and he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Even at that point he could have gone; leave his country.</span> <span id="s294">But he felt he couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">So, ask me something...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">[There is a pause.</span> <span id="s297">She goes back to looking at Photos].</span></p> <p><span id="s298">So this was my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s299">And this is me — [a lovely child].</span></p> <p><span id="s300">So, my mother's upbringing was elegant, cultured.</span> <span id="s301">There were governesses and all that.</span> <span id="s302">She spent quite a lot of time with her sister in Vienna; going to museums, theater, concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Question: Why is your mother looking so sad in this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Somehow she always looked sad.</span> <span id="s305">She was always very worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">So I was brought up very liberally.</span> <span id="s307">My mother, before she married my father, was an ardent Zionist; my father was very assimilated.</span> <span id="s308">They didn't try to influence me, but I loved my Jewish religion teacher.</span> <span id="s309">I loved any ceremony, so I went to the synagogue and also went to the Catholic churches, even processions; anything with ceremony and music.</span> <span id="s310">It was a family joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">We always went to Dobříš where the whole family assembled for Jewish holidays, Passover and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s312">There was a huge table; all the cousins, everybody.</span> <span id="s313">I loved it.</span> <span id="s314">I still can celebrate the Passover service; I know all the tunes, all the words.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">There is no more Jewish community in Dobříš.</span> <span id="s316">Dobříš had the most terrible fate.</span> <span id="s317">The castle used to belong to Colloredo-Mansfeld.</span> <span id="s318">He married a mannequin from Paris, a very cultured lady.</span> <span id="s319">So she built a French garden, a little bit like Versailles and tried to encourage the villagers to eat more vegetables.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Our family was very well connected with the castle because Palivec, a poet and close friend of Capek, was the overseer of the castle, and he was friendly with the Fleishman family.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Dobříš was like home because everywhere there were aunts, uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s322">Everybody was an uncle or cousin or friend; the Jewish community was very large and influential.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">We as children were allowed to go to the castle park [because of family connection].</span> <span id="s324">We had a special key to a back gate.</span> <span id="s325">We roamed the park; it was ours!</span> <span id="s326">It was not opened to the public.</span> <span id="s327">We went up into the ‘English’ part of it, the woods.</span> <span id="s328">So we were very privileged.</span> <span id="s329">We went there for Pesach and for part of summers.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">That was the only lucky time of my life.</span> <span id="s331">I was perfectly happy.</span> <span id="s332">This was until I was ten.</span> <span id="s333">I had all the privileges of having a Jewish family and a Czech family and a liberal education.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Of course there were always clouds on the horizon of a small child.</span> <span id="s335">I was ill most of the time; that was the greatest cloud on my youth.</span> <span id="s336">Both of my parents were in the shop most of the time, so I had a Nanny, Karla; she was a village girl, very musical.</span> <span id="s337">At one point she turned out to have tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s338">Then I was x-rayed, and I proved to have it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">I was a child they were always worrying about.</span> <span id="s340">When I was seven or eight, I went to Austria, to the Alps, to a sanatorium with my mother; to a Zauberberg.</span> <span id="s341">That was at the time Dollfuss was murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Most of my childhood I didn't go to school, because I had bronchitis and flus.</span> <span id="s343">I was a very diligent little girl; I had governesses who taught me and private tutors.</span> <span id="s344">But I was very lonely; I couldn't join any children's groups.</span> <span id="s345">So that was the cloud; that was, of course, why I started very late with my music.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">I already wanted to study music; I sang all the arias from operas, folk music.</span> <span id="s347">I spent lots of time reading.</span> <span id="s348">I had a large library; it was completely catalogued, arranged in order, a whole wall of books.</span> <span id="s349">Educational books were in blue; fiction was green.</span> <span id="s350">I did lots of reading.</span> <span id="s351">And then, of course, Dagmar was with me when she was not in school; she had a more normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">The terrible tragedy, there was a rivalry between her mother and mine; and she was a beautiful, healthy child, while I was a sickly child.</span> <span id="s353">But she had a cough too, and her mother refused to have her treated.</span> <span id="s354">And she died in the concentration camp of TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">{END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.02.12} {Start OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.03.12} The Nuremberg Laws went into effect immediately after the occupation.</span> <span id="s356">That meant we weren't allowed to visit any public events — no theater, cinema, concerts, nothing.</span> <span id="s357">Then gradually we were moved from our homes into combined flats with two or three families living in one flat.</span> <span id="s358">We had a curfew; we weren't allowed out after eight in the evening.</span> <span id="s359">We had to wear stars.</span> <span id="s360">Only certain periods we could go swim.</span> <span id="s361">There was one lake, called the Jewish lake; one area around the lake where we could play.</span> <span id="s362">Of course the shop was immediately taken over by the Treuhander.</span> <span id="s363">Very soon, my father was sought by the Gestapo, even before the Jews were being molested, because he was a Sokol.</span> <span id="s364">I remember once, when we still had a cook, she waited for us before we came back from swimming at the lake and told us that the Gestapo had been there looking for my father; and we shouldn't go home.</span> <span id="s365">He was hiding in the woods for a week.</span> <span id="s366">The Gestapo came regularly then and searched our home.</span> <span id="s367">They took anything they could find — chocolate.</span> <span id="s368">My mother talked back to them.</span> <span id="s369">She'd say: Why are you taking this?</span> <span id="s370">They would say: This is for the poor German children.</span> <span id="s371">My mother would say: My child is also poor.</span> <span id="s372">They never mistreated her.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">It was very terrifying.</span> <span id="s374">Something terrible was happening.</span> <span id="s375">I didn't disintegrate; I grew stronger.</span> <span id="s376">I felt that somehow we would get out of this; that there would be a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s377">It was the first time that I became a part of a group of youngsters my age — the Zionist group, Maccabi Hatzair.</span> <span id="s378">I joined the group, and we had common activities; learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s379">Being part of a group of young people who sustained each other helped a lot.</span> <span id="s380">The boys had to go work somewhere every day, and we went to get them at four o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">My father, first they kept him on in the shop, then he had to go work in a Kaolin factory, a sort of a white plaster; you have to mine it.</span> <span id="s382">Then one of his colleagues from Sokol took him into his factory.</span> <span id="s383">This went on from 1939 to 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">There was this Czech fascist organization called Vlajka.</span> <span id="s385">They were always on the lookout for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s386">We stayed out in the evening, of course before curfew, and they would beat us up.</span> <span id="s387">This was my first experience with violence.</span> <span id="s388">They'd ambush our group and beat us.</span> <span id="s389">We'd try to run away.</span> <span id="s390">I got really hurt just once.</span> <span id="s391">The boys were hurt more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">My father was terribly depressed.</span> <span id="s393">But there was also this terrible optimism.</span> <span id="s394">This won't take long, Hitler will lose the war; the allies will win soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Then the transports started in the autumn of ‘41, in October.</span> <span id="s396">Then the greatest shock of my childhood happened.</span> <span id="s397">The Plzeň transports went early, in Jan. '42.</span> <span id="s398">Already in December, ’41 they started sending the ‘invitation’ cards [she laughs bitterly].</span> <span id="s399">The terrible thing was they sent children to distribute the cards to people, Jewish children.</span> <span id="s400">We too were called up.</span> <span id="s401">There was a bureau at the Jewish Community, and there they were working on the administrative side of it.</span> <span id="s402">There were Gestapo overseers who directed the whole thing.</span> <span id="s403">But the work had to be done by the Jews themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">It was very, very terrible, because we children went in 'couples’, and had to bring the notices to people that they were to appear with 50 kg luggage.</span> <span id="s405">We had to hand the notice to the people.</span> <span id="s406">And the scenes were terrible.</span> <span id="s407">Some people screamed and some cried and some went mad.</span> <span id="s408">And some — we came to a home where the gas was on.</span> <span id="s409">[There is long pause - she is very affected by this memory.]</span> <span id="s410">Then I remember, they had to sign that they had received the notice.</span> <span id="s411">And we had to put in all the names and addresses.</span> <span id="s412">And I remember very vividly one scene; they had kept us there until quite late in the evening, after the curfew.</span> <span id="s413">It must have been about ten o’clock, and I remember suddenly my father, with his star, was standing there in the door and saying: What are you doing with those children?</span> <span id="s414">They mustn't be out after curfew.</span> <span id="s415">They are in danger and they must go home!</span> <span id="s416">And all the Gestapo looking at him in amazement.</span> <span id="s417">And he said: I'm taking you home!</span> <span id="s418">And he took me and Dagmar and led us away.</span> <span id="s419">And nobody said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Dagmar did not join the Maccabis.</span> <span id="s421">She stayed in the opposite camp, the assimilated camp.</span> <span id="s422">She believed simply that she was Czech; that this was happening to all the Czechs, and a little bit more to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">It was terrible, the delivery of the notices.</span> <span id="s424">We saw life at its very worst.</span> <span id="s425">It was a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">But in the meantime life went on.</span> <span id="s427">We even had dancing lessons.</span> <span id="s428">I so wanted to have dancing lessons, and in the end, one lady who had a big room arranged for us to dance to the gramophone and even to have a dancing teacher.</span> <span id="s429">And of course we had our little love affairs.</span> <span id="s430">And we celebrated all the Jewish festivities.</span> <span id="s431">Chanukah we gave little presents to each other.</span> <span id="s432">And we were a very close-knit group.</span> <span id="s433">We had a young couple leading us.</span> <span id="s434">They were lovers; I will come back to them later.</span> <span id="s435">He was Karel Schleisner, and she was Tilla Fischl.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">The idea was that we would all go to Palestine together, and form a group there, a kibbutz, and work together there.</span> <span id="s437">It was a great help.</span> <span id="s438">And then of course, there was music.</span> <span id="s439">I was still studying with Milostpani and practicing and playing for all the festivities.</span> <span id="s440">I was the musician of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Next to Milostpani, there was also the former director of our Gymnasium [he was expelled by the Germans]; he also gave us history lessons.</span> <span id="s442">We went to his house with our stars hidden.</span> <span id="s443">Oddly enough, we made terrible fun of him because he looked to us so old fashioned.</span> <span id="s444">He felt that Masaryk shouldn't have broken up the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s445">We thought what he was saying was such nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">By this time there was no chance to leave; everything was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Maybe you could illegally cross the borders, but not whole families.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">I'm afraid at this point my mother made life rather hard for my father with recriminations [that they didn't leave].</span> <span id="s449">My father was terribly depressed.</span> <span id="s450">The psychological pressure afterwards of having the responsibility of all this happening to us must have been terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Question: When did your father die?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">In 1943.</span> <span id="s453">In Theresienstadt (Terezin).</span> <span id="s454">So now we're up to January.</span> <span id="s455">Let's end now for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Question: Do you want to go on with these interviews?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Yes.</span> <span id="s458">I have to go on!</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Continuing transcription (March 30, 1991);

a very early photo.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Here is Aunt Ruzena, the one who had the big house in Dobříš with all the intellectuals coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Here's my mother as a schoolgirl, here she is;

your great grandfather.</span> <span id="s499">Her father's father, was my grandmother's brother, Roubicek.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Here's another shot of my mother and father in Dobříš; and my mother's best friend who was also my so-called Aunt, Zdena.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Again here's Dobříš, a little restaurant.</span> <span id="s502">Here's Dr. Prusik [the admirer of her mother] and his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Here's another picture of my mother with the Prusiks, before she was married; and the Schwartzes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Here is a photo of the family, the last meeting, after my grandfather died.</span> <span id="s505">It must have been before Hitler came, but already during times that were worrisome.</span> <span id="s506">I see it from the expressions on the faces and also from the age of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s507">It must have been 1938 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">This man, the brother of Leo Moravec, husband of Elsa; much older than my mother and lame.</span> <span id="s509">But when my mother stayed in Vienna with the Moraveces, he fell very much in love with her.</span> <span id="s510">And, she sort of really adored him, but didn't love him.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">He asked her to marry him; and she was on the brink of marrying him, but the family was against it because he was so much older, and he was lame.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">So that was when the family went to the shadchan to find another husband for my mother; and found my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">He [Moravec] lived in the States for a long time - a very close friend of Piatigorsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">This must have been taken shortly before my grandfather's death.</span> <span id="s515">He died when he was 81.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Here again, the whole family in Dobříš;

although by spending an hour going through the photographs we have actually been putting it off.]</span> <span id="s523">My mother got her shop back again, and was trying to make a go of it in Plzeň before the Communist takeover.</span> <span id="s524">That was between 1945 and 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">[Note: Zuzana's mother died in 1983, in December.]</span> <span id="s526">About her death; she had some brain trouble, a slight stroke, then she recovered.</span> <span id="s527">But she always fell; she had those dizzy spells.</span> <span id="s528">I was always so terribly afraid she'd fall down while I was on tour.</span> <span id="s529">I used to teach one day a week from 8 to 8.</span> <span id="s530">Then when I'd come home I'd be absolutely finished.</span> <span id="s531">I always prepared one meal for my mother, and for lunch she'd go out.</span> <span id="s532">I came home and prepared some dumplings with strawberries; that was her favorite.</span> <span id="s533">But she said: Oh, I had this for lunch; I want to eat something different.</span> <span id="s534">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s535">But since we were having fish with our dinner, I gave her my fish and ate the dumplings.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Once a year I get a terrible migraine — that was the day; so I went to sleep very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">This was her room.</span> <span id="s538">I had trained myself to wake up as soon as she turned on the light, so I saw she had gone to the kitchen to make some tea and cookies.</span> <span id="s539">And she said: I should have had the dumplings; I felt something sweet would be nice.</span> <span id="s540">And because I had this headache I didn't sit down to the table with her.</span> <span id="s541">Instead I said: You have your tea and cookies and I'm going to sleep.</span> <span id="s542">But on her way from the kitchen back into bed she fell and broke an arm.</span> <span id="s543">And then she had to stay in the hospital where they discovered she had diabetes.</span> <span id="s544">And then she refused to walk because she was afraid of falling.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Here's a photo of my mother with one of our cooks, Rezi.</span> <span id="s546">She's the one who taught me a lot of those racy songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Here is my grandmother and grandfather.</span> <span id="s548">Every year for the summer holidays I went to Krkonose.</span> <span id="s549">We went with everything;

this is mine.</span> <span id="s599">You can see how I have been crying; my eyes are puffy.</span> <span id="s600">This is January, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">The story begins: There were three transports from Plzeň.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">The transports started in October.</span> <span id="s603">The first transports were made up of volunteers who went into the ghetto Theresienstadt to prepare everything for the future transports.</span> <span id="s604">They were young men.</span> <span id="s605">These were called the AK transports, AKl and AK2.</span> <span id="s606">From then on every transport was labeled with a letter.</span> <span id="s607">Our transport was T. My number was T345.</span> <span id="s608">From then on when we were called or accosted by SS men, we were supposed never to say our name, only our number, T345.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">It was about three weeks between the time we got our numbers and the actual transport.</span> <span id="s610">And then of course it was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s611">Just imagine — we were allowed 50 kilos for everybody.</span> <span id="s612">What to leave?</span> <span id="s613">What to pack?</span> <span id="s614">What to take with you?</span> <span id="s615">Not many books of course; warm clothes of course.</span> <span id="s616">Some of the things we thought the Gestapo didn't know about we tried to hide with our friends — some Persian rugs; some gold and porcelain.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">So, in the end, sometime towards the end of January, we all had to go to a certain place, a Sokolovna [a gymnastic center] in Plzeň, where we assembled very early in the morning so that people in the town wouldn't see us going.</span> <span id="s618">I think it was five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s619">We walked with our luggage; and there we were given our numbers and registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">I remember my father when the SS man came to count us.</span> <span id="s621">My father just looked at him.</span> <span id="s622">But he looked in such a terrible way that immediately he was beaten, just because of the look in his eyes.</span> <span id="s623">It was terrible [she speaks very quickly].</span> <span id="s624">"Dostal facku" [translation: he got a smack in the face]; he never even considered being afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">We had this Treuhand [see Mendelssohn is on the Roof] in our shop.</span> <span id="s626">He was not a bad man really.</span> <span id="s627">He tried to give half the money he earned to my father, but my father would have none of it.</span> <span id="s628">He said: It's my shop and my money.</span> <span id="s629">He was proud; so he had a hard time of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Then we went by train to Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">I think it must have been 5000 people; so we were taken by train to Terezin.</span> <span id="s632">Terezin was a garrison town formed at the end of the Austro-Hungarian empire, with lots of barracks; really a fortress.</span> <span id="s633">It had walls and gates; a closed town.</span> <span id="s634">At the end of the First Republic it became a normal town and normal people lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">At that time [when they began the transports to Terezin] there must have been some [international] protests about taking Jews to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s636">So somebody must have had the idea to found a modern ghetto; to show how the Jewish problem was being solved.</span> <span id="s637">This was going to kill two birds with one stone.</span> <span id="s638">First the artists and scientists and prominent people under observation by the West would be put there.</span> <span id="s639">And then it would be a camp for the Czech Jews who would stay for a while, and then go on to the East to the other camps.</span> <span id="s640">So this was very well planned by the Germans as they always planned very well.</span> <span id="s641">It was their way of getting rid of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s642">We had the same experience with the Communists.</span> <span id="s643">That's how I survived the Communist era; because once you were internationally known, as I was after 1968, it was not possible to mistreat us.</span> <span id="s644">There were people trying to prevent Suk and myself from going outside of the Republic, but they couldn't do it because there were too many questions being asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">That's why Terezin was an extremely intellectual town, because you had all the professors and teachers and prominent artists from all the countries Hitler occupied.</span> <span id="s646">It was mainly for Czechs and the prominents from all the countries Hitler had seized.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">To prepare this model ghetto, first of all they had these AK transports.</span> <span id="s648">It was arranged that this ghetto was to have its own government.</span> <span id="s649">In fact everything was governed by the SS, but there was the Council of Elders.</span> <span id="s650">At first there was still normal life going on in the town, and the first transports were put in the barracks, huge buildings built around a courtyard.</span> <span id="s651">One barrack, Magdeburg, was for the administration.</span> <span id="s652">They prepared the others for us to go to.</span> <span id="s653">They separated the men from the women and children.</span> <span id="s654">There were Men's barracks, and Women &amp; children's barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">I will tell you my personal experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Immediately after we came, sitting there on our luggage and waiting for what would happen next [I had been terribly ill on the train].</span> <span id="s657">That was when I first met a person who was very crucial not only to me but to every child in Theresienstadt and in Auschwitz — Freddy Hirsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">He was a figure like Raul Wallenberg, a German Jew, an extraordinarily beautiful person; he was 25 at that time.</span> <span id="s659">He immediately devoted himself to the service of children and old people.</span> <span id="s660">[She gives me a pamphlet about Freddy Hirsch.]</span> <span id="s661">He came there because he saw that a new transport had come in.</span> <span id="s662">He saw that I was ill, so he immediately began to take care of me; gave me some medicine.</span> <span id="s663">He was a very crucial person for my whole life.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Then we came into the barracks.</span> <span id="s665">We were about 12 women and children in one room.</span> <span id="s666">It was a terrible atmosphere.</span> <span id="s667">There was nothing but bunk beds and one little stove over which the women were fighting incessantly, because everybody wanted to cook something.</span> <span id="s668">And the women were hysterical and depressed; it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">So Freddy came in that very first day and organized the children.</span> <span id="s670">He arranged for the older children to take care of a group of younger children.</span> <span id="s671">He took all the children at eight in the morning to a courtyard to play.</span> <span id="s672">He taught us games to play; play with the younger children.</span> <span id="s673">Then he discovered an old attic that was full of cobwebs and made us clean it up.</span> <span id="s674">And because it was winter, and we couldn't be outside all the time, so we had this attic to go to.</span> <span id="s675">He also found some teachers that had been in the transport, and he arranged for them to sing with us and paint with us; somehow to occupy our time so we didn't have to be in those little rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">He did this in all the barracks; I had a group of 12 small children.</span> <span id="s677">Freddy was a genius.</span> <span id="s678">He was studying medicine, but he was also an athlete.</span> <span id="s679">So he kept us somehow occupied, teaching little songs and little poems and making us draw; and that was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A very terrible thing was that my mother started to get terrible heart attacks.</span> <span id="s681">There was not a day that I was not called up from the children's group to come to my mother because she was dying.</span> <span id="s682">The doctor diagnosed wrongly angina pectoris.</span> <span id="s683">When we came back after the war, I discovered that it was because we were eating all the wrong food.</span> <span id="s684">So her trouble was the stomach.</span> <span id="s685">It was putting pressure on the diaphragm and this created symptoms like a heart attack, like a heavy heart attack.</span> <span id="s686">[MW: Heart burn?]</span> <span id="s687">This looked very serious, so I was terrified.</span> <span id="s688">Meanwhile, we were allowed to visit with my father every week; to go to the men's barracks.</span> <span id="s689">The atmosphere was terrible when we came there, because just before we came there, some of the AK boys had been caught trying to smuggle out letters to their families.</span> <span id="s690">For that they were publically hanged; there was to be a Jewish henchman.</span> <span id="s691">I mention this because we will meet this person again in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s692">It was a terrible thing; nobody thought that the Nazis would go to the length of killing people.</span> <span id="s693">Everybody was terribly depressed.</span> <span id="s694">This happened before we came.</span> <span id="s695">[MW: See Mendelssohn is on the Roof] And my mother, this elegant lady you saw in these photos; all the women had to work.</span> <span id="s696">And she, to get me some more food because I was terribly hungry all the time, she volunteered to go and peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s697">It was a cellar, a damp cellar, and she'd be up to her knees in potato peels.</span> <span id="s698">It was dark and damp, but then she could take some potatoes and bring them for me.</span> <span id="s699">So it was a great change for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">It went on like that.</span> <span id="s701">My father went into the so-called Ordnungsdienst, which was a sort of police.</span> <span id="s702">They took care that there was no crime or disorder and that the older people were taken of.</span> <span id="s703">It was quite a privilege, the OD.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">His brother was a fireman – Karel.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Religion was allowed.</span> <span id="s706">I continued my Zionist activities.</span> <span id="s707">Freddy, of course, was an ardent Zionist then.</span> <span id="s708">He especially took care of the Maccabi Hatzair group to which I belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Later he was accused by the Communists of collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s710">He did not collaborate.</span> <span id="s711">But being a German, and speaking German perfectly, and being an extraordinary personality, his whole mentality was so dignified that somehow he could really handle the Germans, and they respected him; somehow, in Auschwitz too.</span> <span id="s712">But in the end, he ...</span></p> <p><span id="s713">[She breaks off in mid sentence].</span></p> <p><span id="s714">In Terezin Freddy got what he wanted for the children.</span> <span id="s715">First of all, when spring came, Freddy got permission from the SS to take the children out every Sunday on the ramparts.</span> <span id="s716">There he would stand and do gymnastic exercises, and we would all do it with him.</span> <span id="s717">We got fresh air and got to move about.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">It was our first chance to get some fresh air in three months.</span> <span id="s719">There must have been hundreds of children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Dagmar [the beloved cousin who was almost like a twin] went with another transport, and she was in a different barracks.</span> <span id="s721">So we hardly saw each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">In June the whole town of Terezin was evacuated.</span> <span id="s723">All the Czechs [the former residents of the town] were forced to leave the town; and the whole town became a ghetto.</span> <span id="s724">All the buildings were taken over for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s725">By now there were transports coming in every day.</span> <span id="s726">By now people were not only living in the barracks but in the normal houses, but every room was crowded.</span> <span id="s727">In this room [Zuzana’s living room in Prague, not a large room, about 18' by 24'?]</span> <span id="s728">there would have been 10-12 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Everywhere bunks were being built and by that time Freddy reserved two buildings for Children's Homes - one for girls and one for boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Lustig writes a lot about it; these were the legendary Children's Homes L410 for the girls and Q710 for the boys.</span> <span id="s731">[Arnošt Lustig wrote many books about his camp experiences — fiction] So by then I was separated from my mother and went in to the Children's Home.</span> <span id="s732">The council of elders decided this.</span> <span id="s733">Children up to 10 years old stayed with their mothers; the older children went into the Homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">I think it was better for my mother that way.</span> <span id="s735">She became more calm.</span> <span id="s736">She didn't see me going hungry; that was a torment.</span> <span id="s737">So I think this was a wise decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Also, children over 12 had to go to work, usually in agriculture, because Theresienstadt was in a fruit-growing part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s739">The SS had a lot of gardens around Terezin.</span> <span id="s740">Their own farms were being worked by the Jews.</span> <span id="s741">So the children were sent to work on the farms and gardens.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">We, all of us, were Maccabi.</span> <span id="s743">We were supposed to form a kvutza, which was a group which prepared for a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s744">All property was in common, nothing was private; all dresses, food.</span> <span id="s745">You had nothing that belonged just to you.</span> <span id="s746">The Maccabis organized this.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">In Plzeň there had been 10 of us, five girls and five boys.</span> <span id="s748">And so part of our group, the five girls stayed together [in Terezin] and stayed with seven others.</span> <span id="s749">And when we went out on Sundays, we reunited and formed a little group called Kadima, which meant Forward; which had been our name in Plzeň.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">In each room there was an older girl, a teacher, who took care of the whole group; who organized the cleaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">[The end of the tape-- we conclude the interview for the day] {END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.04.12} [The interview continues about Terezin] {Tapes do not seem to be in the correct order; this is the beginning of RG-50.615.0001.08.12} At this point I'm 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">So on Sundays in the morning we went out to the ramparts.</span> <span id="s753">And in the afternoons we were allowed to visit with our parents.</span> <span id="s754">My father was allowed to visit with my mother or she with him, and I was allowed to see my grandfather and grandmother.</span> <span id="s755">My grandfather was 83 by then, and he organized a Sokol group and took all these old men outside every day to exercise; he was vigorous.</span> <span id="s756">They both died in Terezin.</span> <span id="s757">I still remember their funerals, their so-called funerals, because they weren't buried; their ashes were thrown into the river.</span> <span id="s758">But there was a sort of ceremony.</span> <span id="s759">My grandmother died of pneumonia; my grandfather of prostate trouble.</span> <span id="s760">I think it was in '42 or early '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Dagmar was in the same Children's Home, but not in the same room.</span> <span id="s762">But I was very much involved with my group.</span> <span id="s763">And then I got a series of pneumonias again, and I was not allowed to go to work outside.</span> <span id="s764">Freddy found me a place to work.</span> <span id="s765">In one barracks there was a little office, the youth-care office, a very dingy little room, dark.</span> <span id="s766">And there I was, sitting and sorting out some sort of administrative papers about the new transports, filing new children's names.</span> <span id="s767">I was miserable.</span> <span id="s768">I had nobody to talk to, nothing to do.</span> <span id="s769">I was pining away for my mother and my home, and I had too much time to think about everything, with not enough to do.</span> <span id="s770">I was also the official messenger.</span> <span id="s771">There were no phones of course, and so the only good moments during the day were when there was something to take to Freddy or some other barracks.</span> <span id="s772">Then I'd go and hang around and help.</span> <span id="s773">That was a bright spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Then, of course, there were the evenings.</span> <span id="s775">There was enormous activity — cultural activity.</span> <span id="s776">Almost every house had an attic where something was going on - lectures or lessons in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s777">There was a piano, a string quartet, a former first violinist of the Czech Philharmonic, wonderful pianists.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">And Freddy organized activities for the Maccabi group.</span> <span id="s779">There were lectures of all kinds, on Marxist-Leninism, for instance.</span> <span id="s780">There was always something happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">My mother got work with a dentist.</span> <span id="s782">That was a much better position; she became his secretary.</span> <span id="s783">So sometimes I could peep in on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">But the big cloud hanging over Theresienstadt at all times were the transports, the transports to the East.</span> <span id="s785">Almost every month two or three transports went, and others came.</span> <span id="s786">And you got this draft ticket, and you had to go.</span> <span id="s787">Everybody was very afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Then there were transports that went straight through Theresienstadt and went directly to the East.</span> <span id="s789">They registered only for two or three days.</span> <span id="s790">These were transports from Dobříš that never stopped in Theresienstadt, only passed through.</span> <span id="s791">We were able to see them and talk to them.</span> <span id="s792">I talked to my cousin.</span> <span id="s793">I tried to have Freddy do something to keep him in Terezin.</span> <span id="s794">That transport had my whole family in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Of course we didn't know they were going to their death.</span> <span id="s796">We were told that they were working transports, going to Poland, to another ghetto.</span> <span id="s797">But there was always a very sinister feeling about these transports; there were rumors.</span> <span id="s798">Also the Council of Elders must have suspected.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">One of the most sadistic things the Germans did was to leave the choice of who would go to the Council.</span> <span id="s800">So they tried not to send families where all the members were still alive.</span> <span id="s801">Only where somebody had already died.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">That's why my mother and I only went after my father's death.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">It was the crudest form of natural selection; this was always hanging over us.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">The first of our Maccabi group to go was Margaret Winternitz.</span> <span id="s805">What could we do?</span> <span id="s806">We helped her pack.</span> <span id="s807">There was a barracks called [Sauna?]</span> <span id="s808">where they were supposed to be prepared for the transports.</span> <span id="s809">So we saw her to the barracks and wept; and what could we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">So there was an empty place which was very soon taken over by another girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">So this is a summary up to the end of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">In 1943 I got better; I felt better.</span> <span id="s813">Also this little office of the youth care was somehow abandoned, so I had to go into agriculture work.</span> <span id="s814">This was a relatively happy period for me.</span> <span id="s815">We went out every day at five in the morning.</span> <span id="s816">But we went outside the ghetto, outside the gates and worked in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Actually it was terrible work.</span> <span id="s818">We were putting dung on the fields; it came in big cars and it was heavy.</span> <span id="s819">We smelled awful, but somehow I was happy because again it was the world.</span> <span id="s820">I saw nature for the first time after one year.</span> <span id="s821">I saw the heavens and trees and flowers; you could never see that in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s822">And somehow I felt more free.</span> <span id="s823">When we came back home, we were terribly tired, and we just slept.</span> <span id="s824">Finally I slept.</span> <span id="s825">I had never slept before, but I was so tired that I could sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Then we were transferred into the vegetable gardens, and that was even better because we could sneak a little food.</span> <span id="s827">There were beds with little seedlings covered with glass.</span> <span id="s828">And we put those frames gradually up, and at noon we took them away and watered the plants.</span> <span id="s829">Then around three, when the sun started to get lower, we put the glass windows back on.</span> <span id="s830">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s831">The frames were heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">We were supervised by a Czech gardener and a Jewish boy, not by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s833">But the work was outside.</span> <span id="s834">I loved nature; I loved to watch the seedlings grow - the potatoes, the cucumbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">That was from January '43, my best months in Terezin.</span> <span id="s836">I was seeing my mother and father, and I could sneak some food to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Then on May 10 somebody came from Theresienstadt to fetch me.</span> <span id="s838">My father was dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">[She begins to cry.]</span> <span id="s840">I was sitting there, so happy in the sunshine, then I came, and he was... suffering terribly.</span> <span id="s841">Sorry... It was ileitis.</span> <span id="s842">They couldn't operate, so it went on for three days...no painkillers.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">[She weeps] Then it all ended.</span> <span id="s844">My mother was desperate.</span> <span id="s845">She wanted to take her life too.</span> <span id="s846">I was desperate too.</span> <span id="s847">I felt deserted even by her because I thought she wanted to leave me too.</span> <span id="s848">I was too childish to understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">I went through it somehow.</span> <span id="s850">I didn't even weep.</span> <span id="s851">I never wept for my father's death — not until now.</span> <span id="s852">I somehow buried it very deep.</span> <span id="s853">Karel took care of my mother; he was my father's brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">[She is still weeping.]</span> <span id="s855">My father was born 1896; he was 49.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">[Note: something is incorrect since she has stated previously that her father died in 1943.</span> <span id="s857">If the birth year is correct, he was more likely 46 or 47.]</span> <span id="s858">Karel somehow persuaded my mother that she had to live for my sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Then I stayed on in my agriculture job, and I was given a foster father.</span> <span id="s860">Somebody had to take over as my father, to take care of the family.</span> <span id="s861">This was something the council of Elders organized.</span> <span id="s862">He was someone also in the Maccabi.</span> <span id="s863">He tried to keep us in Theresienstadt so that we wouldn't have to go on the transport.</span> <span id="s864">But we knew; we knew that we would have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Somehow life went on.</span> <span id="s866">You see, there were always rumors that the war was ending soon.</span> <span id="s867">One time, though, we were very despondent; that was when Paris fell, and it looked like Hitler would win the war.</span> <span id="s868">There was always someone with a radio who found out the news.</span> <span id="s869">Also the Czech Chetniks came and gave us the news.</span> <span id="s870">And there were also parcels in which someone smuggled in some news in the bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">So, somehow, at that time, the one good thing that happened to me — I got myself a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s872">It was a very childish thing.</span> <span id="s873">We just held hands and kissed.</span> <span id="s874">We had met at the Hebrew class; he came in with the transport from Brno.</span> <span id="s875">He was a very coveted boy.</span> <span id="s876">Everybody said: He is coming, he is coming, Hanus Austerlitz.</span> <span id="s877">It was a very advanced class; we were taught by a Professor of Oriental Studies from the University of Vienna, Professor Kestenbaum.</span> <span id="s878">Then we decided that we would also take Latin.</span> <span id="s879">That had always been my dream when I was in Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s880">I couldn't wait for my Latin and Greek lesson.</span> <span id="s881">So we gave this professor half of our bread ration every time in exchange for the lessons, and he gave us Latin lessons.</span> <span id="s882">He was a very strict scholar.</span> <span id="s883">He told us it was all wrong to say Caesar [tsezar]; it was pronounced Kaisar.</span> <span id="s884">We learned omnia Gallia divisa est in partes tres...etc.</span> <span id="s885">We learned to say be1gae, not bel-gay.</span> <span id="s886">[She laughs.]</span> <span id="s887">And we went on with our Hebrew lessons too.</span> <span id="s888">We even read some Bible.</span> <span id="s889">And we fell in love.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">At the same time Dagmar fell in love too.</span> <span id="s891">Her boyfriend survived.</span> <span id="s892">My boyfriend survived too.</span> <span id="s893">He was a correspondent in Israel.</span> <span id="s894">Dagmar's boyfriend, Arci Yigal, his Hebrew name, he wrote me after the war.</span> <span id="s895">So we had this experience together.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Then a very severe epidemic of encephalitis broke out.</span> <span id="s897">At first it was very, very severe; a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s898">Then it became less deadly.</span> <span id="s899">Quite a lot of people got it, and I got it too in a fairly mild way.</span> <span id="s900">I didn't want to go to the hospital because I had this boyfriend.</span> <span id="s901">So when I went to the neurological test, I prepared myself because I knew I was going slightly to the left.</span> <span id="s902">But I had bad luck.</span> <span id="s903">When I had my test, he dropped his pencil, and I reached the wrong way.</span> <span id="s904">So I had to go to quarantine for six weeks.</span> <span id="s905">I couldn't see my mother or my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s906">He used to come to the window and I'd look out.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">That was summer already - 1943.</span> <span id="s908">I may be mixing up my dates; you must sort this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Also, in late spring 1943 there came a big change into Theresienstadt because the Swiss Red Cross got interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">They [the Nazis] cleaned everything up.</span> <span id="s911">They had Theresienstadt money printed.</span> <span id="s912">They set up little shops where you could buy nothing — mustard, things like that.</span> <span id="s913">They had a little pavilion cleaned up in the middle of the park where Ančerl was allowed to form a chamber orchestra and give concerts.</span> <span id="s914">People were encouraged to play football, and we were given more freedom to go walking and see each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">But the terrible thing that happened in connection with this was that they also - because there were evidently some rumors about Auschwitz — they brought in a group of children from Auschwitz; brought them back to Theresienstadt, told them that they would be exchanged, taken care of by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s916">And of course here we come again to Freddy.</span> <span id="s917">Freddy was there because these were children.</span> <span id="s918">What happened was that the children were taken to the showers, and at the sight of the showers they started to scream, and they mentioned gas.</span> <span id="s919">This was a terrible thing for the Germans.</span> <span id="s920">The children were immediately sent back.</span> <span id="s921">Freddy was jailed so as not to be able to communicate this with anybody.</span> <span id="s922">But somehow it came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">At that point the idea that people were being exterminated became real; I half believed it and half didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">I remember hearing it because I was involved with Freddy, and I heard that he was in jail because of these children.</span> <span id="s925">They went back to Auschwitz and were gassed immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">So the atmosphere was already very tense.</span> <span id="s927">That must have been July- August '43.</span> <span id="s928">In September '43 another transport went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Freddy went with them, directly from jail.</span> <span id="s930">One of my aunts went, Aunt Jirina, my father's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Gradually, in '43 - I grew away from my Maccabi group.</span> <span id="s932">Knowing advanced Hebrew, I was sort of already considered a leader of the youth group.</span> <span id="s933">Everything was meant like that we were going to Israel.</span> <span id="s934">Everyone who would be useful there was being trained and treated as part of the leading group.</span> <span id="s935">But I didn't like the politics of these groups.</span> <span id="s936">There was political infighting, fights for might and political influence, and even for keeping people out of transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">As with all political groups, the mass is told something and the leadership is told more.</span> <span id="s938">I was so idealistic; I thought everything should be told to everyone.</span> <span id="s939">I was a great disputer, fighter for the right.</span> <span id="s940">I got rather disgusted, so I went into this Communist group.</span> <span id="s941">Another relative, Mirek Karni, belonged to this; an ardent Communist.</span> <span id="s942">Today he is the leader of the Terezin Initiative Group.</span> <span id="s943">I have been to several meetings of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">He took me with him, and I went to lectures on Marx-Leninism, but I liked them even less.</span> <span id="s945">So I got out of politics and started to think for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Of course I continued with my agricultural work and my Hebrew classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">In December, on the 20th, another transport went.</span> <span id="s948">I know it was around Christmas we got a draft ticket, my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s949">I was immediately offered by the Maccabi group that they would exempt me from the transport, because they tried to keep the Maccabis together.</span> <span id="s950">I refused, first of all because I wanted to stay with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">So we went.</span> <span id="s952">[Long pause] That's the end of the Terezin era.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Now you ask me questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Tell me about the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s956">Of course we had been afraid for so long, seeing people leave, seeing the packing up; in a way it was routine.</span> <span id="s957">But it was terrible because you were again leaving some part of your life that you had built up even under those terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s958">And I was leaving my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s959">And it was terrible not to know where you are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">And Hell started immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">[Pause in interview] Hell started immediately because we were packed up into cattle wagons so that we could only stand; nobody could sit.</span> <span id="s962">There was only one window, very high; you couldn't even see.</span> <span id="s963">It was cold; it was dark.</span> <span id="s964">We had one bucket there.</span> <span id="s965">The ride took three days.</span> <span id="s966">We didn't get any food.</span> <span id="s967">We didn't get anything to drink, and the thirst was terrible.</span> <span id="s968">You will read about that in those notes.</span> <span id="s969">[She has given me some handwritten notes, in German, written just after the war, about the Auschwitz experience.]</span> <span id="s970">The notes start with our arriving in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Those lights — white reflectors everywhere.</span> <span id="s972">We were thrown out of the wagons in this terrible state; everywhere hard light.</span> <span id="s973">Everyone thrown out of those wagons in a terrible state.</span> <span id="s974">Immediately there was shouting, dogs barking; it was late at night.</span> <span id="s975">We were put into a sort of a wooden barrack; there we stayed the night.</span> <span id="s976">The night was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">And there I start with what I wrote.</span> <span id="s978">The thirst was awful.</span> <span id="s979">We smashed the windows.</span> <span id="s980">Again, the men smashed the windows and tried to get some snow at least for the children.</span> <span id="s981">This was in the barracks.</span> <span id="s982">They still gave us no food or water.</span> <span id="s983">Then one of the men went out to get some snow and was immediately shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">So, in the morning — [the best thing would be to read what I wrote because it’s very detailed, and it goes up to the first night in the camp itself in Auschwitz...because on the whole...] Then we went from the barracks to another barracks where we had to... where we were stripped naked.</span> <span id="s985">We had our numbers tattooed; all our belongings were taken from us.</span> <span id="s986">We had to sign a document that we had been arrested in the ghetto Theresienstadt because of anti-German activity; and that we accept our sentence.</span> <span id="s987">Everything was done very clearly so it would seem legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">The thing that happened to me that influenced my life and my bias at least until now — that when we went from this wooden barracks to this sauna, we met a group of men prisoners.</span> <span id="s989">It was terrible; it was an absolutely empty plain of snow.</span> <span id="s990">And I recognized Freddy Hirsch, and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s991">And he said: Oh, you are here.</span> <span id="s992">I don't know — somehow he pretended to drop a glove or something — and as he picked up the glove he said to me: You are sixteen.</span> <span id="s993">So when my data were taken for the signing of this document I said I was sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Tapes do not seem to be in the correct order.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">{END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.08.12} [Pause for tape change] {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.07.12} They founded this so-called Family Camp (B2B).</span> <span id="s996">There the families were allowed to stay together, though the barracks were of course separate.</span> <span id="s997">And the children were kept alive.</span> <span id="s998">The whole idea of the family camp was a charade - for appearances.</span> <span id="s999">Three weeks before they were gassed, people had to write postcards to their families in Theresienstadt or Prague or Plzeň telling them they were well, and they had to predate them by several months.</span> <span id="s1000">Then if anyone were to accuse them of exterminating people they would say: Look, they wrote these cards weeks later.</span> <span id="s1001">That was the whole idea of the family camp.</span> <span id="s1002">Then we were given clothes, ridiculous clothes, and we went into the camp.</span> <span id="s1003">And since I described the camp here [in the notes] I don't have to dwell on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">At first we were held for a week in quarantine.</span> <span id="s1005">I don't know why; probably Dr. Mengele's idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">But when I came there — I remember it was around Christmas because my aunt, my father's sister Jirina — she was working.</span> <span id="s1007">There were women carrying the barrels of soup.</span> <span id="s1008">Each day we got a piece of bread and soup; and she was one of the soup carriers, which was quite a good post because sometimes you get some soup.</span> <span id="s1009">And so she came into our block, though it was forbidden, and brought us Christmas presents, a plate of soup and a needle and thread, which was wealth.</span> <span id="s1010">Recently I was talking with Dr. Pilka, Jirka Pilka, who is the head of the television music department, and who was in prison under the Communists, and he told me what wealth a needle and thread was in Communist prison, just the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Freddy was helpful from the first moment.</span> <span id="s1012">I asked her [my aunt?]</span> <span id="s1013">to lend me her coat with the old number.</span> <span id="s1014">We all had numbers, these numbers, [she points to the tattooed number on her forearm] not the Terezin numbers.</span> <span id="s1015">You see I was lucky, [pointing again to the tattooed numbers] it was done by Polish girls who were very fastidious.</span> <span id="s1016">Some people's numbers are very ugly.</span> <span id="s1017">So every transport had their numbers, and the transport that was already there in the camp had a five at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1018">So I asked her to lend me her coat and went in search of Freddy; and I found him.</span> <span id="s1019">And I found again that he took care of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Again, the whole camp was a former military camp.</span> <span id="s1021">The barracks were not for soldiers but for horses.</span> <span id="s1022">Again, these stalls were full of bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1023">So you went through this Lagerstrasse, and there were barracks on each side of it.</span> <span id="s1024">It started with Barrack 1 where the barrack Alteste was; I will tell you about him later.</span> <span id="s1025">He was described here [in the notes] also.</span> <span id="s1026">You went through this Lagerstrasse starting with no. 1 and there were 36 barracks.</span> <span id="s1027">When the normal barracks stopped, there were latrines and shower rooms.</span> <span id="s1028">And after that there was the so-called health and children's Barracks; on the right side the health barracks, on the left the children's barracks.</span> <span id="s1029">And that was the doing of Freddy Hirsch, that immediately he made the Germans separate the children, give them their own barracks.</span> <span id="s1030">Again, it was the German discipline.</span> <span id="s1031">The lower part of the camp up to the latrines belonged to the Lagerführer who was Mr. Schwartzhuber, to the Gestapo, the SS; and the upper part belonged to Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s1032">And there in those health barracks were those fatal twins.</span> <span id="s1033">So I asked about Freddy and went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">You know, after what we went through and what the barracks were like, dirty and cold, I suddenly came into a world quite apart.</span> <span id="s1035">This man managed to whitewash all the walls of the barracks, to paint little scenes from fairy tales, Snow White; Freddy did it.</span> <span id="s1036">He manufactured little tables; he was extremely dexterous — little tables and little chairs for the children; and all these paintings.</span> <span id="s1037">And there the children were; sitting and having lessons, and he himself.</span> <span id="s1038">In front of each barracks was the room of the groom of the horses, of the old days.</span> <span id="s1039">And there was the so-called blockalteste, the block supervisor.</span> <span id="s1040">He got the groom's room.</span> <span id="s1041">Those were the people who — this was a career post — to be a block supervisor — these were Jews too — they had better clothes, food.</span> <span id="s1042">They were responsible directly to the SS; and Freddy made this little groom’s room for him as a gingerbread house, the witch's house.</span> <span id="s1043">I will never forget this scene; it didn't happen very often.</span> <span id="s1044">I came into this room, and he said: What shall we do with you?</span> <span id="s1045">And I said: Well, couldn't you somehow make me work with you again?</span> <span id="s1046">And he said: Now you will have to go into the quarantine barracks, and after that come and see me again; you can work with the children as you did in Terezin.</span> <span id="s1047">At that moment the SS doctor came in who was working with Mengele.</span> <span id="s1048">Apparently they used to drop into the children's home because it was the only breathable atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1049">Again, Freddy got some privileges from them; packages that came for people who had already died came to the children, and they had some more coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">So at the moment I was standing there the SS came in, and I remember Freddy standing up and saying: Well, where did you plunder and murder today?</span> <span id="s1051">He said that to the SS men.</span> <span id="s1052">Well, I stood there and thought they would shoot him immediately.</span> <span id="s1053">But somehow this man had such magic that the SS man just laughed, and said: I came in to see how you are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">I remember one time a group of German doctors came in to the children's home and they started to measure the children's heads, because of that racial theory that the Jews had different head measurements.</span> <span id="s1055">And I remember Freddy came in and told them: Aren't you ashamed of yourselves to believe such nonsense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Anyway, he sent me back to my mother.</span> <span id="s1057">And after my quarantine was over, I came in, and he made me — I couldn't be a teacher — but I was a helping hand, a hilfs betrauung(?)</span> <span id="s1058">, a teacher’s aide.</span> <span id="s1059">So that again saved my life, as it did for all those children who survived in that home So our day began at five o’clock when we were woken up; and at six O’clock we had to go to the appel, where we were counted.</span> <span id="s1060">You see, that was always an ordeal; because first of all it was cold.</span> <span id="s1061">It was a bog, pure mud, in winter; we were almost up to our knees in mud.</span> <span id="s1062">Again, what Freddy did for the children was that the children didn't have to join the appel.</span> <span id="s1063">They were counted at the barracks.</span> <span id="s1064">But I was, of course, not a child; so I went to these appels every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">One thing that I tell you here [in the diary] was that immediately after we came the first day, in the evening, we were sorted out and the lagerälteste took all the pretty young girls into number one.</span> <span id="s1066">There he had a music band, and there he had all his colleagues for the evenings to amuse themselves with the girls.</span> <span id="s1067">I managed to pull my mother in with me, and I went through this first night there hiding under my bunk, not to be chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">We had this terrible band.</span> <span id="s1069">It started playing each morning for the appel; and there we have different remembrances.</span> <span id="s1070">The lagerälteste’s favorite tune was Fučik's Marinarella.</span> <span id="s1071">And Viktor in his youth used to go to a park in Jindřichův Hradec where they played this, and it was his favorite.</span> <span id="s1072">I can't hear this piece; when I hear it I immediately feel the atmosphere of this terrible fear, of despair, of waking up to another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Of course these appels were sometimes terrible.</span> <span id="s1074">Some of the men were chosen to do the so-called sport — show me how fit you are — and they were forced to do gymnastics in this bog until they died there.</span> <span id="s1075">And we had to watch it and wonder how long it would take until they died.</span> <span id="s1076">And of course we were all extremely exhausted and ill and emaciated.</span> <span id="s1077">And there was also this kind of Auschwitz illness, which were mostly men; women survived better.</span> <span id="s1078">It was a psychological thing, a certain look in their eyes; and you know they were doomed.</span> <span id="s1079">So this was an ordeal every day; and every day waking up to this Marinarella and this feeling of despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">1/10 And of course it was such a wonderful thing that after this appel, you could go through this lagerstrasse and go into this children's home.</span> <span id="s1081">And there were many other teachers, intellectuals, whom Freddy chose; not only Zionists, because at that time he was not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1082">They were preparing for the children.</span> <span id="s1083">We had plays, fairy tales.</span> <span id="s1084">And we put on Nezval's Manon Lescaut because someone smuggled it in.</span> <span id="s1085">And everybody had some favorite poem which he knew by heart.</span> <span id="s1086">So when we got a pencil and some paper, we put down these poems and recited those poems; we kept up some sort of intellectual life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Freddy himself usually came in around four o'clock, and he had a recorder, and he played the recorder for us.</span> <span id="s1088">And every day he taught the children another song — German, Czech, Hebrew; canons and things like that — with the recorder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">So we tried to keep up some sort of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Question: What kind of mental shape were the children in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">In good mental shape; they had their regular life.</span> <span id="s1092">They were fed much better than we were.</span> <span id="s1093">But of course very precocious.</span> <span id="s1094">In one way very uneducated; in another way very precocious.</span> <span id="s1095">I remember one story which I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s1096">Having a small boy in my group, he must have been around nine, and our teacher was trying to explain to them about evolution of life on earth - about dinosaurs.</span> <span id="s1097">And he said: Oh yes, I know what a dinosaur was.</span> <span id="s1098">It was a machine for making roads.</span> <span id="s1099">So we were flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s1100">And then we remembered there was this Voskovec and Werich Song, “Dinosaurus Valcoval Jim Silnice.”</span> <span id="s1101">And he knew the song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Of course, all the children did hear or had an inkling of the gas chambers because they were burning all the time.</span> <span id="s1103">And there was a terrible stench; you saw the fires.</span> <span id="s1104">Of course we never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">We did talk about it; we did talk about it.</span> <span id="s1106">We did talk about it incessantly.</span> <span id="s1107">People my age, sitting there and wondering; and there were terrible things I can't even tell you about.</span> <span id="s1108">There were days when the gas didn't arrive, and that was the most terrible thing we were afraid of, because then they burned.</span> <span id="s1109">Then there were pits and people were thrown into the pits and ... and ... There was gasoline poured over them and they were actually burned.</span> <span id="s1110">It was a perverse hope that at least the gas would arrive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">And there were these people, Jewish people, who were chosen for the so-called Sonderkommando; which meant that they had to take care of the dead bodies afterwards.</span> <span id="s1112">I will tell you everything, everything.</span> <span id="s1113">I told you about this young pair who took care of our group in Plzeň; you wrote down their names [Karel Schleisner and Tilla Fischlova].</span> <span id="s1114">And he was put in the Soderkommando, and she went completely mad.</span> <span id="s1115">For a young girl to see a transformation in somebody she loved and trusted, and she became a blockalteste in our block.</span> <span id="s1116">And she beat people almost to death with a whip and shouted at them.</span> <span id="s1117">And the only person she needed was myself because I had known him.</span> <span id="s1118">So every day in the evening I had to come to her room and read to her and recite poems.</span> <span id="s1119">And everybody else was so afraid of her.</span> <span id="s1120">And in the morning she would be a different person, full of hate; and she hated us.</span> <span id="s1121">Somehow she couldn't get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">So, I don't know how much the children knew; we tried not to talk to them about such things.</span> <span id="s1123">But they must have known many things.</span> <span id="s1124">There were things that I'll never understand again in my life.</span> <span id="s1125">For instance, there was a man who worked with Mengele who was called Dr. Klein.</span> <span id="s1126">I keep telling Viktor that if he would meet Mengele, he would certainly enjoy an evening with him.</span> <span id="s1127">He was a very good-looking German doctor; very educated and so was Dr. Klein.</span> <span id="s1128">He had a wonderful head of white hair and looked like a real German intellectual; a man who would listen to Bach and who'd discuss Goethe with you.</span> <span id="s1129">This man used to come to the children's home with chocolates; what that meant to the children!</span> <span id="s1130">They had never tasted chocolates in their life.</span> <span id="s1131">But we had to tell them that they shouldn't accept the chocolates, because the child who accepted the chocolates was doomed; was not there the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">So of course we had to tell the children, when Dr. Klein comes, don't take his chocolates.</span> <span id="s1133">And sometimes it was very hard, and some of the children did take them.</span> <span id="s1134">And so we had to tell the other children: You see, he took the chocolates, and he is now in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">So of course the children knew.</span> <span id="s1136">But on the whole, they were not in bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">[She lights another of the endless row of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1138">I ask if she wants to go on.</span> <span id="s1139">She answers, ‘Yes, yes.’]</span> <span id="s1140">Another person who was in a very weird way involved with the children, and I told you I would come back to him, was this Theresienstadt henchman, the hangman.</span> <span id="s1141">When I tell you this it all sounds very melodramatic, but that's what life was like.</span> <span id="s1142">He was a real Quasimodo; he had a misshapen back; a very primitive man, a butcher somewhere.</span> <span id="s1143">He came with Freddy's transport before we came.</span> <span id="s1144">And immediately after he came, he became the Kat.</span> <span id="s1145">There was the lagerälteste, the kapo, then the blockalteste.</span> <span id="s1146">The kapo and blockalteste were Jews; the lagerälteste was German.</span> <span id="s1147">And then there was the whole structure of the SS men above us.</span> <span id="s1148">And he used to beat people cruelly, but he loved children.</span> <span id="s1149">So he used to come and sit with the children and talk to them.</span> <span id="s1150">And we didn't like that at all, but what could we do?</span> <span id="s1151">[See Mendelssohn is on the Roof].</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Our lagerälteste, this lady mentions him, Arno Böhm (Boehm); he was a German, a pimp in Hamburg in the St. Pauli district.</span> <span id="s1153">And he murdered one of his girls and was put in Auschwitz as a murderer.</span> <span id="s1154">He was a German.</span> <span id="s1155">We had yellow stars; the murderers, who were there before as simply prisoners, had black triangles.</span> <span id="s1156">Then there were the saboteurs, who had green triangles.</span> <span id="s1157">And there were the Jehovah's witnesses; they had white triangles.</span> <span id="s1158">Adventist, gypsies had red triangles.</span> <span id="s1159">And then there were the homosexuals; they had pink triangles.</span> <span id="s1160">Freddy was a homosexual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">So you could see who was what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">The most favorite ones who were made lagerältestes were the murderers.</span> <span id="s1163">So our Arno Böhm was a murderer.</span> <span id="s1164">He had a terrible face, all scars.</span> <span id="s1165">Then there was another story to which I will come now.</span> <span id="s1166">My mother was given a terrible job; she was an entvsiri [spelling?]</span> <span id="s1167">.</span> <span id="s1168">Because the Germans were terribly afraid of lice, because of typhus or plague which then took over in Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">There was a group of women in each block who every day had to see whether there were any lice.</span> <span id="s1170">And if there were, they had to treat it with petroleum and shave the head; and that's what my mother did.</span> <span id="s1171">We saw each other every evening when I came back; we slept next to each other in the same bunk.</span> <span id="s1172">I'm afraid I gave her a terrible time because [her voice sinks to a whisper] I was so scared of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1173">I came home and had nightmares and cried; and said: I don't want to die, I want to live.</span> <span id="s1174">I can't imagine what it must have been for her.</span> <span id="s1175">She stayed strong for me.</span> <span id="s1176">She was an amazing character, always there for me to weep in her arms.</span> <span id="s1177">I did not have the intelligence to know I shouldn't have done it.</span> <span id="s1178">But I was so scared!</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">As soon as evening came and you could see those fires, I was terrified.</span> <span id="s1180">I was not at all a courageous girl.</span> <span id="s1181">So, this went on up to February.</span> <span id="s1182">In February [she clears her throat] the first transport starting with a ‘5’ were given the cards, but we didn't know then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">I had dysentery and typhus and all sorts of illnesses which I survived.</span> <span id="s1184">When I go now to a doctor, and he asks me my anamnéza [medical history?]</span> <span id="s1185">, I say I won't tell you because you won't believe me.</span> <span id="s1186">You'll think I’m crazy, starting with the encephalitis.</span> <span id="s1187">...Anyway ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Then the transport with number ‘5’ got their cards, but we didn't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s1189">They got those cards to write home.</span> <span id="s1190">We thought it was a good sign, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Then, they started talking about this transport going to another camp, Heydebreck (Heidebreck).</span> <span id="s1192">They were very, very thorough, the Germans; they even found a place called Heydebreck where the transport was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s1193">I only saw that Freddy was getting more and more worried.</span> <span id="s1194">And once he was terribly beaten by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1195">He came all bloody; it was on his birthday, we had prepared a birthday party for him.</span> <span id="s1196">Anyway, we thought it was because of this Heydebreck transport.</span> <span id="s1197">And he knew what to do with the children.</span> <span id="s1198">And the night came, from the 6th to the 7th March.</span> <span id="s1199">I wonder whether this wasn't diabolical; that somebody realized that this was a Czech camp, and the 7th of March was Masaryk's birthday.</span> <span id="s1200">Anyway, they came in the night and called for everybody with the numbers beginning with ‘5’ to go out of the barracks; that they are being taken out to Heydebreck.</span> <span id="s1201">I was somehow so exhausted that I went to sleep again.</span> <span id="s1202">And I had a very close friend; already in Theresienstadt we lived in the same room in the youth-heim.</span> <span id="s1203">And she went with this transport.</span> <span id="s1204">And her father was one of the doctors who worked on the health block.</span> <span id="s1205">And she went; and the first I knew she was shaking me on my cot and telling me she was back again.</span> <span id="s1206">And I said: How come?</span> <span id="s1207">And she said: Yes, the Germans sent all the doctors and their families back into the camp; and all the others went to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">So, you will read the whole story in the document.</span> <span id="s1209">There is a book written by a man called Rudolf Vrba, who was not a Jew, but he was in Auschwitz in the men's camp as a Communist.</span> <span id="s1210">The Communists somehow discovered that the Germans were planning to send this whole transport to the gas chamber -- so they were looking for an opportunity to let the world know what's happening.</span> <span id="s1211">So they planned an uprising.</span> <span id="s1212">They said that the people going to the gas chambers, some of them should be armed and some of them should fight; they were doomed anyway.</span> <span id="s1213">They thought that somehow having an uprising; somehow it would reach the ears of the world.</span> <span id="s1214">And funnily enough, this Vrba, though he was a Communist...</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">They were looking for a leader to head this uprising; and nobody else would do it.</span> <span id="s1216">They couldn't find anybody else but Freddy Hirsch.</span> <span id="s1217">He was revered by everybody.</span> <span id="s1218">So they tried to contact him and persuade him to lead this uprising.</span> <span id="s1219">He couldn't be persuaded; because he still had hopes.</span> <span id="s1220">First of all he had a promise from the SS men from the health block that the children would be saved; and then he still didn't quite believe that this transport would be gassed.</span> <span id="s1221">So he said: I can't do this because it would jeopardize the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">So this man Vrba says that Freddy said to him: Give me an hour to think about it.</span> <span id="s1223">They were already waiting for the SS.</span> <span id="s1224">After an hour Freddy had poisoned himself; he took a dose of luminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">He couldn't make up his mind; he was at the end of his tether.</span> <span id="s1226">Otherwise I think he would have survived.</span> <span id="s1227">The Germans would certainly have sent him back with the doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">So, that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Freddy apparently had been counting on not coming back so he appointed another man in his place to lead the children's house.</span> <span id="s1230">He came back; in ’68 he was the director of the Pragokonzert Agency.</span> <span id="s1231">He changed his name, he had been Hugo Lengster [Lengsfeid?]</span> <span id="s1232">; he changed it to Pavel Lenek.</span> <span id="s1233">In ‘68 he emigrated to Vienna; tried to get us to emigrate too — sent us a false telegram saying: Aunt Lisa has died; it is necessary for you to come.</span> <span id="s1234">He died two years later in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">So he took over, and we continued to work with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">To get back to myself and the Freddy Hirsch period, one thing that will interest you very much.</span> <span id="s1237">Freddy Hirsch was a very interesting figure in many ways.</span> <span id="s1238">First of all, one of his very great, his crucial, problems was his homosexuality; because he was, otherwise, a man with almost ridiculously rigid ethics.</span> <span id="s1239">For him the best thing to say about a person that he is anschtetlich (?)</span> <span id="s1240">, that is, that he is an orderly man, slušný (decent).</span> <span id="s1241">Once we got one more bread for dinner for our children.</span> <span id="s1242">I took the bread and went to Freddy and said: What shall I do with it?</span> <span id="s1243">And he said: You keep it, because you are so [anschtetlich (?)]</span> <span id="s1244">protoze ses tak slusna.</span> <span id="s1245">And that was the greatest praise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Of course he was not only persecuted in Germany for that; and that was why he came to Prague.</span> <span id="s1247">But he was always, and is up till now.</span> <span id="s1248">His family, who is living in London, doesn't want to hear about him; because they abandoned him completely.</span> <span id="s1249">They were a religious, very orthodox family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">But he had a steady boyfriend, who was with him until his death.</span> <span id="s1251">He always kept us.</span> <span id="s1252">Under the terrible conditions of a completely demoralized world around you, he kept a world where still ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">{Tapes don’t seem to be in correct order} {END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.07.12} {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.09.12} One of the very few books which was in B2B [Note: Family Camp] was a very tattered old Freud, Introduction to Psychoanalysis.</span> <span id="s1254">Of course I read everything, and of course I got that book.</span> <span id="s1255">I sat there one morning on the chimney; there was always a big chimney going through these barracks.</span> <span id="s1256">I was sitting on the chimney reading Freud.</span> <span id="s1257">Suddenly a hand comes from behind, says: What are you reading here?</span> <span id="s1258">This is no literature for a young girl like you.</span> <span id="s1259">That was Freddy Hirsch, and I was out of favor for a very long time.</span> <span id="s1260">But I of course got hold of Freud and devoured it, all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Somebody smuggled it in.</span> <span id="s1262">No books were there legally; no paper, no pencil.</span> <span id="s1263">Maybe some of the SS men brought it in; I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Another thing which influenced me very much for my whole life was that this ardent Zionist, he was such a speaker!</span> <span id="s1265">He could move masses.</span> <span id="s1266">Suddenly when he had talks with the teachers, he said: This is no solution; I’m moving completely away from Zionism and all sorts of politics.</span> <span id="s1267">He took us children and said: Look here.</span> <span id="s1268">Look at the people with their heads shaved and in their prison clothes.</span> <span id="s1269">Can you tell a rich man from a poor man, a Zionist from a Communist?</span> <span id="s1270">Can you tell any political views?</span> <span id="s1271">Those are all just men and women.</span> <span id="s1272">And the only philosophy which was real and true was Masaryk's humanism.</span> <span id="s1273">And when I ever come back again, I'm going to live in Prague and I’m going to study Masaryk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">This of course was a thing which one treasured somehow.</span> <span id="s1275">Also I was adult enough to wonder about this change in a man, from an ardent politician.</span> <span id="s1276">What influenced my life was that whatever happened, I never joined a political party; though when I came back I had very leftist tendencies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">But it was always in my mind; look we are just men and women.</span> <span id="s1278">You can't tell which race, which party, which class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">So this had a great influence on my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">After that we knew, of course, that we are the next ones to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">When the next transport came in May from Terezin, we knew it will not be long.</span> <span id="s1282">Then we were given the postcards; so then everything was very clear, or seemed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Funny enough, I did the same thing he did, and I don't think that I had it from Freddy.</span> <span id="s1284">I think it was my own idea, knowing he approved, that I signed a postcard to my boyfriend in Terezin.</span> <span id="s1285">And I signed myself with the Hebrew word for dead, mavet.</span> <span id="s1286">And it arrived; and that was a source of a lot of misunderstanding because a long time after I came back, my friend didn't try to find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">The message got through.</span> <span id="s1288">We were of course getting frantic.</span> <span id="s1289">The man who took over from Freddy was a Communist, a member of this group who wanted to do this uprising.</span> <span id="s1290">So he thought this would be the moment to do it.</span> <span id="s1291">So I know that some of the older teachers were armed with pistols, and they were preparing for this uprising.</span> <span id="s1292">I remember when the time came near, we once went to Hugo [Freddy's successor] and asked him to let us stay after hours in the block; we just wanted to dance once more in our lives.</span> <span id="s1293">And he was a very good man, and he said: Oh you will dance yourself to death.</span> <span id="s1294">I won't let you.</span> <span id="s1295">Anyway, the SS would take you, and you will have many more chances to dance in your life; something will happen!</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">And something really happened; because the date of our gassing should have been on the 6th of June [1944].</span> <span id="s1297">It was D-Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">So there was a great panic in the morning.</span> <span id="s1299">Some orders came to the SS; and Mengele came and the lagerälteste, and conferred together for a very long time.</span> <span id="s1300">And we were told that the next day there will be a selection.</span> <span id="s1301">And they apparently got the orders to mobilize every man possible to the front, and to get as many healthy men and women from the camps to do their work in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">So there were selected out of the 5000 people in the camp who should have been gassed.</span> <span id="s1303">And a thousand men and a thousand women were selected for going to work in Germany — slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">The selection was partly a terrible and partly a grotesque thing.</span> <span id="s1305">The whole night we were discussing with my mother what we should do, because we were told by somebody, I don’t know who, that at the selection you are asked your profession.</span> <span id="s1306">And we thought that if we gave the right profession we might be selected.</span> <span id="s1307">So in the end we decided my mother would say she was a glove-maker, and I said I would say I was a gymnastics teacher to prove that I was fit.</span> <span id="s1308">So we were waiting there before, I think it was the children's block, where the selections were being made.</span> <span id="s1309">And when we came, the lagerälteste Schwartzhuber was already surrounded by bottles of alcohol and completely drunk.</span> <span id="s1310">And everybody had to strip and to go up on the chimney.</span> <span id="s1311">It was about as high as this [she points], and as I said it was running through the whole block.</span> <span id="s1312">Built of bricks, we had to go up the chimney naked, stand there, tell our age and profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">And I went there, and I said: I’m a gymnastics teacher; I’m 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1314">And he said [in German]: So make some gymnastics.</span> <span id="s1315">So I turned a somersault.</span> <span id="s1316">Left was gas chambers, right was workers; so he said: Go to the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">And then came my mother, and she was a mess; looking terrible.</span> <span id="s1318">So she said: I'm 46, and I'm a glove sewer.</span> <span id="s1319">And he said: Left.</span> <span id="s1320">And I went frantic.</span> <span id="s1321">And I sprang over the chimney and joined my mother.</span> <span id="s1322">And he said: What are you doing?</span> <span id="s1323">You are crazy.</span> <span id="s1324">You are going to your death.</span> <span id="s1325">And I said: You killed my father.</span> <span id="s1326">You are going to kill my mother, and I don't want to live.</span> <span id="s1327">So he said: You old goat, go with her.</span> <span id="s1328">So we went to the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">But...in the afternoon there was a competence quarrel, because in the afternoon Dr. Mengele came and made an awful row and said: How come you made the selections?</span> <span id="s1330">It's my job.</span> <span id="s1331">I’m the doctor here; and called another selection.</span> <span id="s1332">So we went there again.</span> <span id="s1333">But I somehow lost my mother.</span> <span id="s1334">She had gone to another block, and I had gone to which of my friends had been selected.</span> <span id="s1335">We were given papers that were going to Germany.</span> <span id="s1336">So I stood there terribly worried, because I knew this couldn't happen a second time.</span> <span id="s1337">We were standing there, and it was a hot June day and suddenly a terrible thunderstorm started with the rain pouring.</span> <span id="s1338">And somehow everybody rushed for shelter, and we hid in the bathroom, under the showers with some friends of mine.</span> <span id="s1339">And somehow after this thunderstorm, Mengele gave it up; too much trouble.</span> <span id="s1340">I think he just wanted to make a gesture, and he said: All right, it's done.</span> <span id="s1341">And I was so happy about that.</span> <span id="s1342">The sun was shining, and I was looking for my mother.</span> <span id="s1343">And she came down the lagerstrasse, and I said: How lucky this happened.</span> <span id="s1344">And she said: But I went to the selection!</span> <span id="s1345">She went; she was very disciplined and stood in the queue...and passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Those were the things; it was just fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">So then we went through another nightmare.</span> <span id="s1348">We had to spend three days in quarantine in the women's camp, which was much worse than the family camp.</span> <span id="s1349">They didn't even have barracks.</span> <span id="s1350">We were put into cellars, where there were rats.</span> <span id="s1351">But we were already looking forward to getting out of Auschwitz and getting away from the gas-chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">And then the military took over from the SS.</span> <span id="s1353">And they came with some trains and put us onto these trains.</span> <span id="s1354">And I must tell you, Marjanka, I have never seen people so appalled as those German soldiers when they saw us.</span> <span id="s1355">I think they really had no idea [her voice falls to a whisper]; they must have had a glimpse of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">They tried to treat us very considerately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">And we had the feeling that we were in another world, even though we were still prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">And we got prisoners’ clothes, not the old clothes.</span> <span id="s1359">We got striped dresses and wooden shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">There remains one more tale that may exist elsewhere in the literature; I can only tell you my point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">I was present at part of that story because there was one SS man in our group who took care of us; a terrible man, very much hated.</span> <span id="s1362">We called him Mickey Mouse.</span> <span id="s1363">He was a Croatian; the Croatians collaborated heavily with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1364">The grapevine said the brother of Mickey Mouse is coming to camp, and a very young man, must have been 19 or 20.</span> <span id="s1365">From the very start he came to Freddy.</span> <span id="s1366">It was evident that he was appalled.</span> <span id="s1367">His brother tried to save him from going into the army.</span> <span id="s1368">So he made him join the SS and come to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">First of all, this young man fell violently in love with one of our teachers.</span> <span id="s1370">Secondly, apparently they hatched out a plan with Freddy that he would, as an SS man, he could leave the camp.</span> <span id="s1371">That he would smuggle some materials to the Vatican about what was going on in the camps.</span> <span id="s1372">They prepared this material, and when he got his leave, it happened.</span> <span id="s1373">He took the material with him, and nobody asked him any questions.</span> <span id="s1374">The terrible thing, romantic thing, it could have been another Romeo and Juliet; was that he decided to come back and rescue his love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Of course when he came back, the whole story was out, and he was hanged publicly.</span> <span id="s1376">We had to be there.</span> <span id="s1377">His name was, I think, Mestek[?]</span> <span id="s1378">.</span> <span id="s1379">So this is a story that I witnessed which is necessary for me to tell because it might be another angle from the other eyewitnesses of this; so this is necessary for me to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Another of those tragic love stories was our lagerälteste, Arno Böhm, who also fell in love with one of our girls.</span> <span id="s1381">And she was from that September transport, number ‘5’; so she was supposed to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1382">This girl was really very beautiful, and he adored her.</span> <span id="s1383">She had gold jewels and dressed beautifully.</span> <span id="s1384">And he asked his SS friends to send her back like they did the doctors; and he was promised they would do it.</span> <span id="s1385">In the morning he found they didn't keep the promise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">In the evening it was another Shakespearean scene; I only heard about it, I was not an eye-witness to it.</span> <span id="s1387">He invited all his SS friends to their normal orgy in his block with all the musicians there and the young girls.</span> <span id="s1388">And when they were at the height of the feast, he took a knife and killed, I think, three of them.</span> <span id="s1389">And then before he was taken, he killed himself, shot himself.</span> <span id="s1390">These were things like Shakespearean tragedies, which were happening around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">So then we got another lagerälteste, a sweet man; he was a sailor, a German sailor, captain of a ship.</span> <span id="s1392">He had this green triangle as a saboteur.</span> <span id="s1393">I don't know if he was really a saboteur.</span> <span id="s1394">I think he simply got drunk and neglected his ship.</span> <span id="s1395">I don't remember his name — Willi something.</span> <span id="s1396">He really tried to make our life as good as possible.</span> <span id="s1397">He gave us seedlings to plant.</span> <span id="s1398">Of course, in that soil, no flower would ever bloom.</span> <span id="s1399">And he used to sing us old sailor songs.</span> <span id="s1400">What was that song he loved so much?</span> <span id="s1401">[She sings a melody in German.]</span> <span id="s1402">A sailor must always be gay and no matter what happens, life will go on.</span> <span id="s1403">Funnily enough we met him again because he was released when his sentence was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">We went from Auschwitz to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1405">And when we worked in the Hamburg docks, in the shipping part, he was there again.</span> <span id="s1406">He had been released; and he used to bring us old clothes and a little bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">So then we had it a little better than under Böhm, because he tried to make life a little easier for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">In Hamburg, when we came to Hamburg, Hamburg was burning.</span> <span id="s1409">It was bombed regularly; you could set your watches by it.</span> <span id="s1410">At 12 o'clock the English came; at midnight the Americans.</span> <span id="s1411">There were these phosphor bombs, fire bombs; so the whole town was burning.</span> <span id="s1412">The main worry of the Germans was to save the oil line, so we had to repair the damage that was done to the pipelines.</span> <span id="s1413">It was actually repaired by experts, but we had to free the pipelines – to dig up the soil because they were buried.</span> <span id="s1414">And then after they were repaired, to bury them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">We were housed in some silos, grain storage, which are still standing on the Elbe, where the grain was shipped.</span> <span id="s1416">In the night we had to go to the cellar during the air raid.</span> <span id="s1417">And sometimes the bombs would fall into the river, and the river would get high, and we were standing in water.</span> <span id="s1418">But we were better fed; we even got some fish sometime.</span> <span id="s1419">And when we were working for a certain company, because we were hired by oil companies, it now all belongs to Shell.</span> <span id="s1420">I've put this all down now because maybe we will get some money.</span> <span id="s1421">There were all sorts of oil companies, and we were hired; the military paid for the hire of the slave workers.</span> <span id="s1422">So sometimes when we were with some better companies, we got some soup; quite nice soup, really, not this kind of water we got in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1423">I was terribly hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s1424">At that time I think I was really almost going mad with hunger and cold — when the winter came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">And then sometimes we went to help with the building of barracks for people whose houses were bombed.</span> <span id="s1426">Construction — we were always divided into little groups — always with my mother.</span> <span id="s1427">We always tried to keep together, which was our downfall.</span> <span id="s1428">By that time the SS took over again, and either we had an SS who loved young girls, or we had one who liked the o1der women.</span> <span id="s1429">So either me or her was on the wrong side of the SS.</span> <span id="s1430">Either he said: You old witch or You young ne’er do well — so that was rather bad, but we tried to keep together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Because sometimes, also, the details never came back if they were in an air-raid area.</span> <span id="s1432">So we said we'd stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Of course there were terrible things to do there.</span> <span id="s1434">There were these himmelfahrt kommandos; himmelfahrt means ascension in a religious sense.</span> <span id="s1435">There were these big gas tanks, very high, very big.</span> <span id="s1436">And when some pieces of bombs fell on these gas tanks, we had to go up those terribly narrow and short ladders and put those remains of bombs on a crane so that it could be picked up by the crane.</span> <span id="s1437">Meanwhile I have terrible nausea; I can't even get on a normal ladder.</span> <span id="s1438">So it was really like going — I don't know how I did it — but we were terribly afraid of falling off these ladders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Did anybody fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Yes.</span> <span id="s1441">[long pause] Also a terrible thing happened to me personally.</span> <span id="s1442">Because at one time, it was in summer 1944, we went to repair some broken oil pipes.</span> <span id="s1443">And we always got our tools in a tool shed, and I got a tool which was covered with benzene.</span> <span id="s1444">And I didn't realize, or I didn't care, or I don't know what; and I was perspiring terribly, and I wiped my eyes and burned my eyes terribly.</span> <span id="s1445">It wouldn't have been so terrible except the SS didn't give me any leave to go wash my eyes.</span> <span id="s1446">So I was standing there under the sun all day, and when I came home, I was covered with blisters; my eyes were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">I must say this was a terrible Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s1448">I was terribly underweight, and she said: Oh, she'll die anyway, when I came to see her to give me a free day.</span> <span id="s1449">So she sent me again into the sun, and I almost lost my sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">And then again, another disaster, because I was not seeing too well.</span> <span id="s1451">So I was standing at an appel once, in the first row, and I wasn't in line perfectly.</span> <span id="s1452">And there was a terrible man who was the Lagerführer at that time; what was his name — Spiess.</span> <span id="s1453">And he was so furious that I was not in line that he took a tool, rýč in Czech, with which you dig the earth.</span> <span id="s1454">Yes, a spade, and he hit me with it.</span> <span id="s1455">My life was saved by my glasses.</span> <span id="s1456">But my glasses went, and I was almost blind and that was awful.</span> <span id="s1457">Because everybody tried to better their lot somehow, some of the girls went begging to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1458">We weren't supposed to do that, but sometimes they left something for us — some vegetable that was not good any more or potato peels, which were wonderful things.</span> <span id="s1459">So I was no good at begging or at anything.</span> <span id="s1460">My mother sometimes was very courageous and tried to get something, but she was also not very good at it.</span> <span id="s1461">So we were really both of us deteriorating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">I remember one other terrible thing which I must say because I want to say everything for people to know.</span> <span id="s1463">There were certain POW camps next to ours in Hamburg, and there were French.</span> <span id="s1464">And some of the girls used to go with the prisoners and they would get a loaf of bread for it or something.</span> <span id="s1465">And when the girls saw that I was really almost frantic with hunger, they said: Why don't you go?</span> <span id="s1466">I will arrange a rendezvous for you.</span> <span id="s1467">It took me lots of time before I decided, but then the hunger was really too much, and I decided to go.</span> <span id="s1468">But when I saw the man, I just couldn't do it, and I ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">So there was no way of getting something else.</span> <span id="s1470">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1471">You got this little loaf of bread, 30 grams, and sometimes it was 50, sometimes 30.</span> <span id="s1472">You got it in the morning, and you were so hungry; and either you ate it whole, and there was nothing else until the next morning.</span> <span id="s1473">And so my mother and all the other girls tried to persuade me to slice the bread carefully and to have part in the morning and then another slice before lunch, and so on.</span> <span id="s1474">But then you never got anything out of it, zero, no satisfaction; so sometimes I sliced it, and sometimes I just devoured it and ate everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">We never got any packages; I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1476">Nobody sent us anything.</span> <span id="s1477">Partly, in Auschwitz, it was because of my name.</span> <span id="s1478">That was really bad luck in a funny way, because people told me that they sent us packages to Auschwitz after my mother sent them this card.</span> <span id="s1479">But Ružička is a gypsy name; it’s a very well known gypsy royal family.</span> <span id="s1480">Ružička, in Slovakia; and so automatically any package labeled Ružička went into the gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1481">They told me this, so the only way I could earn something more to eat was that I could sing.</span> <span id="s1482">And that I had a wealth of songs; and the most popular were the Voskovec and Werich songs.</span> <span id="s1483">So when the day for packages came, and people had some food, they would ask me to come and sing for them the Voskovec and Werich songs; and they would give me some of their bread because they had better things in their packages.</span> <span id="s1484">So the days the packages came I always say that was the school of my life, because I learned politics.</span> <span id="s1485">I learned something that many people don't know even now — that no matter how poor you are, if the society is wealthier, and there are some rich people, you are better off because they will do without some things they don't care about, and you will get them!</span> <span id="s1486">It’s primitive social politics, that you always have to be sure that the community is rich.</span> <span id="s1487">Because if the community is poor, no matter what Communism you've created, everybody is poor and the poorest are poorer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">I got very humble and very wise that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Voskovec and Werich songs got me into another trouble; I remember that was another part of the German perversity.</span> <span id="s1490">They would beat us, starve us, make us work like mad; but when Christmas Eve came, they would make a Christmas tree for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">We went with two SS women.</span> <span id="s1492">At the time we were very badly off because we had women, they were worse; women SS from Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1493">And we had two SS girls in charge who made a Christmas tree, and they went with us into a hut; and on our way there ... [END OF TAPE] {END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.09.12} {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.10.12} I started singing this famous song about how chains don't matter to us.</span> <span id="s1494">[Na nas neplaty---something about řetězy] [Note by MW: same song as in Mendelssohn is on the Roof?]</span> <span id="s1495">, but she turned out to be Polish.</span> <span id="s1496">And I was bloody well beaten for it; so that was my Christmas Eve; ‘43 was in Auschwitz, ‘44 was in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">[Tape RG-50.615.0001.10.12 is interrupted at this point.}</span> <span id="s1498">[That day's session ends here -- a new session begins with question about whether her father would have survived at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1499">It’s not clear at which session the following is told] [Towards the beginning of tape RG-50.615.0001.10.12; around 1:35] Certainly not, certainly not.</span> <span id="s1500">This ultimate loss of all human dignity you had to experience in coming to Auschwitz; having the number tattooed and being bereft of everything human — your clothes, your books, everything.</span> <span id="s1501">Many people went insane at this place; this happened straight away.</span> <span id="s1502">And there was this Auschwitz sickness.</span> <span id="s1503">And I’m quite sure he wouldn't have survived, not even more than a month; and he didn't have to experience this.</span> <span id="s1504">So he was saved from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">The other thing I was saying was that the men were much weaker that way.</span> <span id="s1506">It was the main principle of their life was hurt, the pride of their essence.</span> <span id="s1507">A woman is more a practical person; she survives better because she's thinking from minute to minute, hour to hour, isn't so much involved in principles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Also, the woman is a mother.</span> <span id="s1509">My mother certainly survived because of me.</span> <span id="s1510">And I survived because I still had so much biological vitality.</span> <span id="s1511">I wanted to live so badly; until, maybe, in Hamburg where I attempted suicide.</span> <span id="s1512">I couldn't bear it any longer.</span> <span id="s1513">But up till then — when you are 16, you have so much love of life; this helps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Did more women survive than men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Yes.</span> <span id="s1516">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">There is one more thing that I want to mention — that was my music.</span> <span id="s1518">Of course I couldn't actively make any music in Theresienstadt because there was only one piano and so many professional pianists.</span> <span id="s1519">At the beginning I took some harmony lessons with Gideon Klein, whom you might know the name; he was a composer and pianist.</span> <span id="s1520">But in a way I started another activity.</span> <span id="s1521">Of course I sang a lot; I had a group of children singing.</span> <span id="s1522">And then one thing that I should have mentioned with my childhood, my father used to read to us when I was a child, and what he read to us was wondrous.</span> <span id="s1523">He read us Odyssey and Iliad of Homer, and I think that is part of my makeup, this feeling of rhythm and meter.</span> <span id="s1524">And so I also started in Theresienstadt a group for recitation.</span> <span id="s1525">That was a very common thing then, these voice bands.</span> <span id="s1526">And we studied poems, and I divided the group into chorus and soloists — choral readings.</span> <span id="s1527">I was quite successful at that.</span> <span id="s1528">Of course I still had some music which I smuggled in with my 50 kgs.</span> <span id="s1529">I had Bach's French Suites, and I had Dvořák's Serenade in A Major which was the last piece I played with Mrs. Provazniková — four hands with Milostpani.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Another story about this was when we went to Auschwitz I couldn't take my music with me.</span> <span id="s1531">And the funny thing about my musical talent, or childhood, was that the one thing that my mother was so terribly worried about, funnily enough, Mrs. Provazniková never was.</span> <span id="s1532">I didn't have any memory; I couldn't memorize things at all.</span> <span id="s1533">When I played, I always played from notes.</span> <span id="s1534">And my mother said: How do you think she's going to be a concert artist when she can't memorize?</span> <span id="s1535">And she said, very quietly: Well, this will develop.</span> <span id="s1536">And now, you know, my memory is really very, very good.</span> <span id="s1537">I have all the Bach works; and I’m perhaps the only harpsichordist who plays her recitals only from memory.</span> <span id="s1538">So she was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">But then I had no memory, so I transcribed a little sarabande by Bach from the E Minor Suite which I loved onto a piece of notepaper.</span> <span id="s1540">And I always had it with me.</span> <span id="s1541">And when we arrived in Auschwitz and were put on these cars which transported us to the camp, I had this with me; and read it, because it was somehow essential to me to get this back.</span> <span id="s1542">And a wind came and took it away from me, and my mother sprang from the car, retrieved the paper, and returned again to the car.</span> <span id="s1543">We were almost separated that way, but she knew what it meant to me, this piece of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">But then, of course, there was no music, no music at all.</span> <span id="s1545">That was a blank in my memory.</span> <span id="s1546">Many of my fellow prisoners, children who now are grown up, say I have a blank.</span> <span id="s1547">I don't remember anything about the whole experience.</span> <span id="s1548">So I blacked out music.</span> <span id="s1549">I had many poems which I knew by heart and used to recite.</span> <span id="s1550">Because also one of the parts of our work, and the most terrible which very much damaged my hands, was that we were put into a row, and there came a ship with bricks, and we had to put the bricks on the ship.</span> <span id="s1551">This was in Hamburg, and the bricks were heavy and very rough, and we had no gloves.</span> <span id="s1552">I'll tell you afterwards, when I came home, my hands were in a terrible state.</span> <span id="s1553">And I always used to take a group of young people, and we would recite poems to each other; not to think about the situation, to get out of it.</span> <span id="s1554">This was necessary for me, for my health, otherwise I would have gone mad; but no music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">There was one terrible experience where we were working in a shipyard, and we were taken to a dining room where the workers got their soup.</span> <span id="s1556">And the radio was on, and somebody was playing Chopin; I fainted.</span> <span id="s1557">I couldn't bear the thought that somewhere in this world there was somebody making music; I couldn't bear it, it was too much.</span> <span id="s1558">The funny thing about it was that there was one of the SS who took me when I fainted and took me into a room.</span> <span id="s1559">My mother was with me, and he was trying to get me some water.</span> <span id="s1560">And he said: It's strange; she looks just like my daughter.</span> <span id="s1561">She even looks like a Madonna; she really is a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">You know the doctrine was such that they really didn't realize we were anything but cattle; we were something out of the human community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">My mother told me this story because I had fainted.</span> <span id="s1564">The psychology of the masses; it’s a kind of a hypnotic state where you do anything you are told by the hypnotizer.</span> <span id="s1565">Here was a normal man with a normal family, and a normal home, who goes every day to work with some cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">They used to take bets on us when one SS men came with groups to another, and we had to get the ship loaded.</span> <span id="s1567">Which group will get their ship loaded earlier?</span> <span id="s1568">And the group who won got extra soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">And I will never cease to wonder, when I play in Germany, how many of those people are sitting in the audience [long pause] and enjoying my playing; their Bach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Once I was playing in a famous Bach festival in Anspach, and one day I read the newspapers, and I read that Speer was present at the concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">That was a hard decision to make, whether to play in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1572">But in the end I decided to go; because first of all I thought I couldn't go anywhere because people like that aren't only in Germany.</span> <span id="s1573">And then I said, ‘I'm not an entertainer; I'm not going there to entertain.</span> <span id="s1574">I'm going there to bring them Bach.’</span> <span id="s1575">And maybe some of them, because of the experience, might become more human.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">I also had a revelation just now.</span> <span id="s1577">Once I was invited to play at a castle in Germany, in Franken (Franconia), Langenburg, that belongs to the family Hohenlohe.</span> <span id="s1578">They had a series of concerts.</span> <span id="s1579">I went there, and the count was very, a very pleasant person; quite a young man.</span> <span id="s1580">And the countess was a librarian; she was not of the gentry, a cultured woman.</span> <span id="s1581">I arrived earlier; I wanted to see the instrument.</span> <span id="s1582">And they took me into the family; we had jokes about what I was to call him (by noble address or what).</span> <span id="s1583">He asked: What would you call me at home?</span> <span id="s1584">And I said, Comrade.</span> <span id="s1585">And we all laughed about it.</span> <span id="s1586">He of course saw the number [tattoo] and asked about it, and didn't try to hide that he knew about it; because quite a lot of Germans are appalled and don't know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">So then, after I had played the concert, a man came to me and said to me: I have something to give to you.</span> <span id="s1588">It will bring you luck.</span> <span id="s1589">Think of it as the gift of a German who feels very ashamed of what happened.</span> <span id="s1590">There were many people around, and I was giving autographs.</span> <span id="s1591">And afterwards I looked into the package, and I found it was a heavy gold signet ring, with a noble emblem, three lions one above each other.</span> <span id="s1592">I thought it was an English sign.</span> <span id="s1593">And actually, also present at that concert was Prince Phillip's mother, who was also a Hohenlohe; a woman almost blind and deaf, she showed me Prince Phillip's doll house.</span> <span id="s1594">I tried to find the man again, because I thought, I can't accept this, a heavy gold ring.</span> <span id="s1595">But nobody could tell me who he was, where to find him.</span> <span id="s1596">It remained a mystery; I gave it to Viktor.</span> <span id="s1597">Until now there was an article about Himmler and Hitler and all those people, and in that article it said that old Count Hohenlohe was the next in line to Himmler with the final solution to the Jewish question.</span> <span id="s1598">So the young count himself must have sent me the ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">I only discovered that a week ago when I read this article.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">{End of tape RG-50.615.0001.10.12} {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.11.12} Yesterday I remembered something which I wanted to add or to make clear.</span> <span id="s1601">There was one thing I forgot in Terezin, just before we left.</span> <span id="s1602">There will now be a memorial day for this event, and I’m not sure it was ever explained what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">On the 11 of November 1943 we were notified a few days before by the authorities in Terezin that we were to be counted; that we were all to be ready in the morning to go to a vale outside of Terezin to be counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Everybody was wondering what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1605">Nobody believed it was because of counting, because they could easily count us in Terezin; or they could have done it by paperwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">So we didn't really believe it, and we went there very much afraid of what might happen.</span> <span id="s1607">What actually happened was that we stood there for a whole day, and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1608">It was a real mass of people.</span> <span id="s1609">We got there by walking.</span> <span id="s1610">It was very difficult, especially for the old people.</span> <span id="s1611">We young people from the Maccabi each had an old person to take care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">So I think — they were thinking then and now, and it hasn't been proved — that there was a plan to gas the whole mass of people; because it was in this valley where it wouldn't have done any damage.</span> <span id="s1613">And it aborted because it was a windy day, and somebody thinks there came contradictory orders from Berlin authorities; that somebody got afraid that it might leak out and what to do with the dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">But there was some plan like that mentioned.</span> <span id="s1615">And I’m curious because the Terezin initiative announced that 11 November would be commemorated this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">As far as I know there were indications [among the Nazi papers,] but no proof that this had been the plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">It was a crazy plan.</span> <span id="s1618">Anyway, we stayed there the whole day.</span> <span id="s1619">It was very cold; we were standing outside.</span> <span id="s1620">Then I took the old lady I was helping back to Theresienstadt, and then I managed to twist my ankle.</span> <span id="s1621">It was a very disagreeable experience, mainly however, because we were all afraid; we felt we were going to our death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">About Auschwitz, I wanted to add one thing.</span> <span id="s1623">One terrible experience was that every month we were led to saunas, showers, to get clean.</span> <span id="s1624">But nobody was really sure what was going to come out of the showers, water or gas.</span> <span id="s1625">Every time we were wondering.</span> <span id="s1626">And there were the attendants sitting there, and we used to ask them are we really going to have a shower.</span> <span id="s1627">And they used to make jokes, Oh you will see!</span> <span id="s1628">We were given soap and towels, and as you see, it was really a shower, but the suspense was terrible.</span> <span id="s1629">It was a block that went for a shower, but you were never quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">About Zionism, I wanted to explain one thing — that Zionism didn't necessarily mean Palestine.</span> <span id="s1631">Of course we did training for a kibbutz in Palestine, but the main thing was the establishment of a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1632">And as you know, Herzl himself was considering different parts of the world - Uganda - or different parts of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1633">Canada was considered.</span> <span id="s1634">Of course Palestine was the obvious historical choice, but the whole idea was building a Jewish state for a Jew to be a citizen of and not the Diaspora.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">So, where did we stop?</span> <span id="s1636">I think we stopped at the end of the year ’44 in Hamburg; now in January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">In Hamburg we changed the locality.</span> <span id="s1638">We were under the auspices of a concentration camp called Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s1639">But we changed localities because of our work details, so we were in different localities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">I remember the exact day when we last changed our locality which was my birthday.</span> <span id="s1641">And for your birthday you always got a double portion of bread.</span> <span id="s1642">I was 17 in ’45, so I lost my extra portion.</span> <span id="s1643">We moved to a place called Tiefstack which was a cement factory, and this was rather awful for me because I started to get a cough; and always being surrounded by the dust of the cement was bad for me.</span> <span id="s1644">So I tried to get work with groups which were detailed elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">And one day I went to this group which was detailed outside, and my mother went with me; it seemed very lucky.</span> <span id="s1646">There was an SS man who was rather kind to the older people, and he said: You should stay home.</span> <span id="s1647">It was a very rainy day.</span> <span id="s1648">Stay at home and do some cleaning, which was really very lucky.</span> <span id="s1649">My mother was very happy that she got this permission to stay at home; and when I came back, she was not there.</span> <span id="s1650">Apparently there was a camp nearby which was short of workers.</span> <span id="s1651">So a truck came and took all the women which were in the camp to the other camp.</span> <span id="s1652">And it was terrible because I thought I would never see her again.</span> <span id="s1653">I panicked.</span> <span id="s1654">I wept the whole night, and I was really desperate.</span> <span id="s1655">And the next day I again went working outside.</span> <span id="s1656">And when I came back, she was back.</span> <span id="s1657">Apparently there came another detail of women from another camp, and they were all sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">I clearly remember that moment.</span> <span id="s1659">We embraced; we wept again and were very happy.</span> <span id="s1660">When I say we survived by a series of miracles, this was one of those miracles again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">By that time, in February, not only did spring come early, but already there were very definite rumors that the allies were getting nearer and nearer.</span> <span id="s1662">February ’45 — we could sometimes hear guns.</span> <span id="s1663">Then we were detailed to dig traps for tanks.</span> <span id="s1664">You dug a big hole, and you had to take pieces of grass and soil and cover the hole; booby traps.</span> <span id="s1665">So we knew they were expecting the allies; that was some hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">I remember this wonderful day when the sun came up and suddenly it was spring in the air.</span> <span id="s1667">And we heard those guns, and we thought, maybe.</span> <span id="s1668">But this hope didn't last long, because about a week afterwards — about the third week of February — we were again transported; this time to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">So...[pause] again the whole story.</span> <span id="s1670">We went into those cattle trains.</span> <span id="s1671">The journey this time was short because Bergen-Belsen is not far from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">If ever there was Hell, this was the lowest part of hell.</span> <span id="s1673">This was an extermination camp; it was really meant for us to die in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">So there was not even any organization.</span> <span id="s1675">We were not working.</span> <span id="s1676">We went from the station to the camp.</span> <span id="s1677">We were not fed at all on the train, not given any food at all; so we were terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s1678">We went through fields, turnip fields, where there were frozen turnips.</span> <span id="s1679">So we got some of those turnips, which really saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1680">Because when we came to the camp, nobody took care of feeding us regularly, not even this soup or bread.</span> <span id="s1681">Sometimes there was soup, and who got there first got it.</span> <span id="s1682">It was absolutely not organized; it was meant for us to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">The barracks were military barracks.</span> <span id="s1684">We were crowded 700 people into one barrack.</span> <span id="s1685">It was not possible to lie down.</span> <span id="s1686">If you wanted to sleep you had to lie down like sardines; one had the head in the others lap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Otherwise we couldn't have all got there; and there were already masses of dead bodies lying around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">And the camp was infected by bubonic plague.</span> <span id="s1689">[ME: typhus?]</span> <span id="s1690">So there were people dying all around you.</span> <span id="s1691">And sometimes those people who were healthy enough to take the dead bodies and make pyres out of them to be burned got an extra soup.</span> <span id="s1692">So as long as I was able to do that, I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">And my mother, very soon, was feeling ill; still able to walk and move but having fever.</span> <span id="s1694">These turnips lasted for a certain time, but then they were gone, and we were really starving.</span> <span id="s1695">At one point I decided this couldn't go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">There was a wire fence, but the fence was not electrified like in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1697">There were only towers with watchmen watching.</span> <span id="s1698">And outside the camp were those turnip fields.</span> <span id="s1699">So I decided, at the point when we were nearly dying of hunger, that I have to get some of the turnips.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">So very early in the morning, it was still dark — maybe it was four, we went, and I started to dig a hole under the wire fence.</span> <span id="s1701">But it took me too long, and it started to be light.</span> <span id="s1702">So when I had this hole big enough, it was already light.</span> <span id="s1703">So I crept through the hole, and the guard saw me and started shooting; but I still got two turnips.</span> <span id="s1704">But unfortunately, again there was a group of gypsy women who already saw what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1705">So the moment we came out they crowded me and took one of the turnips from me, but one I rescued.</span> <span id="s1706">And from this turnip – it was quite big — we lived.</span> <span id="s1707">We had it under our mat in the block and guarded it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Then — this was already March — and we heard from both sides, guns; from Hamburg and from Hanover.</span> <span id="s1709">So we did hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">There was a little story that I keep wondering about.</span> <span id="s1711">There was a girl whom we called Klara, she was already with us in Auschwitz, and she kept carrying and smuggling with her a package of tarot cards.</span> <span id="s1712">Already in Auschwitz she tried prophesying with those tarot cards; first for fun.</span> <span id="s1713">But her prophecies always came true, so in the end she got afraid and refused to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">In the middle of March we were already very down.</span> <span id="s1715">Some of us went to Klara and said: Do you still have your tarot cards?</span> <span id="s1716">Tell us when the end will come.</span> <span id="s1717">Sof, we said the Hebrew word, the end.</span> <span id="s1718">And she needed to be persuaded, but in the end she took the cards and laid them out and said: On the 15th of April.</span> <span id="s1719">Of course we didn't quite believe it, but we did a little.</span> <span id="s1720">On the evening of the 14th of April those of us who were still able to walk were made to carry big packages, but not heavy, which had some of the military uniforms.</span> <span id="s1721">We had to carry them to the railway station which was about two miles from camp.</span> <span id="s1722">We were going in rows of five, and it was already almost night when we came back.</span> <span id="s1723">And at the time we got so used that we had to keep in line and only look at the legs of the one going in front of you.</span> <span id="s1724">As a matter of fact — I will come to that later — when we were liberated, I had for a long time difficulties walking alone and looking where I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">And I was on the outer side of the line, and there was a car passing us.</span> <span id="s1726">And as I didn't really look, it strafed my leg; I didn't quite realize it.</span> <span id="s1727">And when we came back late at night, I found my place in the block.</span> <span id="s1728">And in the morning when I awoke there was a puddle.</span> <span id="s1729">I thought something had happened to me, and I couldn't hold my urine.</span> <span id="s1730">And all the women around me were cussing me.</span> <span id="s1731">And then I saw it was blood.</span> <span id="s1732">Apparently it was quite a wound, and I couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s1733">I was afraid I couldn't get to the appel.</span> <span id="s1734">Some of the girls helped me up and half carried me to the appel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">And it took endless time.</span> <span id="s1736">The appel was at 6 o’clock; and it was 7 o'clock, and 8 o'clock, and it was 8:30.</span> <span id="s1737">And somebody said: It's the 15th of April, and would somebody go out and look what was happening.</span> <span id="s1738">So some of the girls went and came back with the news that the Germans had left the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">So we were, in a way, free; and, of course, besides ourselves with joy.</span> <span id="s1740">And some of the Buchenwald Czechs, who had a barracks to themselves and who were in very good shape because they came rather late; and Buchenwald was not one of the worst camps — they were rather well fed; so they started to take an over-all view of the situation and to organize the camp a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">But very soon the bad news came that the Germans had gone away but they left no food, and they disconnected the water.</span> <span id="s1742">So we were there without food and water.</span> <span id="s1743">There was some meal in a barrack, so they tried to make some bread or something with the rest of the water, but it was not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Of course we were hoping, because the guns were so near, that we would be taken over by the allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">What happened the next day was that there came a detail of Hungarian soldiers with white bands on their arms; and said they were the neutral army, and that they were taking over.</span> <span id="s1746">But what they actually did was that they kept going and blindly shooting into the blocks so that we knew that this was not the neutral army, but a Hungarian detail of the German army — of the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">So everybody kept avoiding them and hiding in the blocks.</span> <span id="s1748">Again the situation was desperate, because this took three days.</span> <span id="s1749">And the guns were not coming nearer, but further.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">On the end of the third day, in the evening, we heard trucks coming.</span> <span id="s1751">I remember by then my mother was very, very ill, having bubonic plague, having those ulcers.</span> <span id="s1752">I went to her and said: Now they are coming.</span> <span id="s1753">And my mother said: No it’s the Germans returning; I’m quite sure.</span> <span id="s1754">And I remember getting quite angry with her.</span> <span id="s1755">Why do you have to be such a pessimist?</span> <span id="s1756">I am sure these are either the English or the Americans.</span> <span id="s1757">And really, the English came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">It was until sometime later that I learned the whole story.</span> <span id="s1759">The story was really very interesting.</span> <span id="s1760">It must be somewhere.</span> <span id="s1761">The Germans, as it was still war, and the English army, which was nearest, was a fighting army - tried to negotiate with the headquarters of this army, saying that this is a camp infected with bubonic plague.</span> <span id="s1762">They should avoid it; go around it.</span> <span id="s1763">And they would leave it, put in a neutral army, and take care of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1764">Of course what they did I already told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">But the lucky thing was that one of the low-flying airplanes — one of those pilots — privately took pictures.</span> <span id="s1766">And when he came back and the pictures were developed, he saw those pyres of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1767">I saw the pictures.</span> <span id="s1768">I happened to meet him.</span> <span id="s1769">He immediately went to the headquarters with those pictures and said: Look, this is what the camp looks like.</span> <span id="s1770">I think we shouldn't pass this camp, but we should enter it and look after those people.</span> <span id="s1771">And the headquarters had enough sense to see that he was right.</span> <span id="s1772">That was why the guns didn't come nearer, but further; and then why they then returned to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Of course we all crowded those cars and soldiers, begging for food.</span> <span id="s1774">The terrible thing that happened, that was quite understandable, was that they gave us everything.</span> <span id="s1775">They gave us all their rations.</span> <span id="s1776">So I, for instance, got a little tin of very fat pork.</span> <span id="s1777">And many people died that way.</span> <span id="s1778">Because after having nothing, their system absolutely couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1779">I was terribly sick.</span> <span id="s1780">But the first thing that I did, and the wonderful thing for me, was that I knew English.</span> <span id="s1781">So they took me immediately into one of the cars of the headquarters and had me tell them what was happening — where were the people?</span> <span id="s1782">So I told them everything, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1783">The only thing I begged them to do was to immediately send a doctor to see my mother.</span> <span id="s1784">So the doctor came in the morning and gave me some medications and told me where the dispensary was and told me to get those medications for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">They were wonderful — the English, the organization!</span> <span id="s1786">How they handled this camp with 30,000 dead bodies and 40,000 infected prisoners was incredible.</span> <span id="s1787">They immediately took over all the military barracks, schools, everything in the nearby town of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1788">They took away all the ill people and made the buildings into British general hospital, Lazarette.</span> <span id="s1789">I will come to that later.</span> <span id="s1790">Now I want to keep my thread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">So I went in the morning to fetch those medications, but I was already ill as well.</span> <span id="s1792">I had an ulcer, and the fever, and couldn't walk properly.</span> <span id="s1793">So it was about 1/2 kilometer, but it took me the whole day.</span> <span id="s1794">I remember sitting under a birch tree.</span> <span id="s1795">It was a lovely sunny day, and the birch tree was beginning to be green; and I sat down to rest and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1796">And when I awakened, it was already late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1797">So I managed to get to the dispensary and get the medications and to get back.</span> <span id="s1798">But when I got back, my mother had already been taken away to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1799">And it was an enormous weight off my mind that I knew she was being taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">So I lost consciousness, and woke the next day myself already in a hospital bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">The way they really managed the situation I will never forget it; I will always admire it because they were a fighting army having only a certain number of doctors and nurses.</span> <span id="s1802">But everybody helped.</span> <span id="s1803">A lot of soldiers volunteered as male nurses, and there were of course professional nurses.</span> <span id="s1804">But it was taken care of so quickly and so efficiently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">This was really a problem because the army had to go on; the war was still on and they had to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">In the end they solved this problem by asking medical students from all countries - France and Belgium, medical students in their last semester -- to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1807">They were promised they wouldn't have to take their exams.</span> <span id="s1808">And they became the medics.</span> <span id="s1809">It was a very courageous thing to do because we were infected, although it wasn't so dangerous anymore because we had all been cleaned carefully.</span> <span id="s1810">And, as you know, it's lice that carry the bubonic plague.</span> <span id="s1811">There were no lice any more.</span> <span id="s1812">They probably burned the dead bodies in Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">It happened that I was already past the worst stage of this bubonic plague, and it was not so bad a case.</span> <span id="s1814">So after 10 days when I stopped having a high fever and the ulcers disappeared, and the doctors knew that I knew English and German, the worst problem was communication.</span> <span id="s1815">Because there were a lot of Russians and Czechs and Poles, patients with whom they couldn't communicate, who couldn't tell them what was wrong, where the pain was; so they asked me whether I would volunteer, get up and translate.</span> <span id="s1816">So of course I said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">This was another unforgettable evening, because they were terribly nice.</span> <span id="s1818">Those were soldiers, the male nurses, so first of all, they plundered the home of some German woman and brought me some clothes which they thought were very nice.</span> <span id="s1819">But those were evening clothes, with big décolleté, and I was, by that time, 27 kilos [less than 60 pounds]; so everything was hanging on me.</span> <span id="s1820">But of course I loved them and put them on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">They wanted me to have a good time, so they took me to the dining room and gave me a proper meal.</span> <span id="s1822">I think it was some mutton and vegetables and, of course, something to drink; which to me tasted like denatured a1cohol; and my first cigarette and my first meal since the war with proper cutlery on a proper plate — after how many years — two or three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Of course it was a crazy thing to do, because it made me terribly ill.</span> <span id="s1824">I thought I would die; but I was so happy.</span> <span id="s1825">I didn't mind at all being ill; because it was such a thing, to be able to eat properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">And then they took me to a cinema.</span> <span id="s1827">They had a tent where they had a cinema.</span> <span id="s1828">It was the first time I saw color film.</span> <span id="s1829">At first there was the anthem, “God save the King.”</span> <span id="s1830">Then, I’ll never forget it, it was a film with Edward G. Robinson, some crime story.</span> <span id="s1831">It was life for the first time.</span> <span id="s1832">And then I came back to the barracks, and I was sick!</span> <span id="s1833">All night; I thought I would die.</span> <span id="s1834">But I was so happy I thought I don't mind if I die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">By the way — excuse me for going back and forth — but that was another thing I wanted to explain about Hamburg because though we were in constant danger of dying through the air raids, I was never afraid any more.</span> <span id="s1836">And I think it was the same with many of the other girls.</span> <span id="s1837">Because somehow dying in a war as a casualty with other normal people was quite a different thing than being gassed.</span> <span id="s1838">You might say Death is death.</span> <span id="s1839">But it's not so.</span> <span id="s1840">And then of course we were welcoming the allied air raids, because they were beating the Germans.</span> <span id="s1841">There were some bad moments, when we saw those little — we called them trees, rockets that looked like a tree — first there was a green one and then a red one, and the red one pointed out the target.</span> <span id="s1842">And when we saw it nearby, that was scary.</span> <span id="s1843">But there was no real fear of death like there was at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1844">You were not selected to be executed, murdered.</span> <span id="s1845">I've often thought about that — about someone in war, compared to someone condemned to death and going to an execution.</span> <span id="s1846">It's a very big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">{END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.11.12} {START OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.12.12} So my thoughts then were, I have had a proper meal; and I have proper Clothes; and I will die as a human being.</span> <span id="s1848">And I was really very happy.</span> <span id="s1849">The next day I started working for the British General Hospital; and of course the first thing, the head of the detail was Major Spizer [sp?]</span> <span id="s1850">I kept looking for him in England; I knew he was from Newcastle.</span> <span id="s1851">But I never found him.</span> <span id="s1852">And he was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s1853">The first thing I asked was to look for my mother, because I didn't know where she was, and there were so many buildings.</span> <span id="s1854">That took some time before he found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">So I first went with the doctors and translated when they went to visit patients.</span> <span id="s1856">Then I did some office work; then I even had night watches in some wards.</span> <span id="s1857">So I really worked as a sort of assistant nurse.</span> <span id="s1858">They were mostly Russian and Polish people, possibly because most of the Czechs knew some other language, English or German, and didn't need a translator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">So I more or less had a place in the daily run.</span> <span id="s1860">That's when I started to smoke; I was offered cigarettes all the time.</span> <span id="s1861">The people were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Then the Belgians came, and I became very friendly with them, especially Dr. Andre von Low, with whom I kept contact until quite recently when he died.</span> <span id="s1863">When I played in Belgium, he came to my concerts.</span> <span id="s1864">He came with his whole family to Jindřichův Hradec to visit us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">In about a week Major Spizer found my mother.</span> <span id="s1866">He came back very sad.</span> <span id="s1867">He said there was very little hope of her recovery; that she had a very severe case of the plague and immediately said: If she dies, I shall adopt you and take you with me to England.</span> <span id="s1868">He was childless and took to me very much and was very kind to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">So I was allowed to go and see my mother.</span> <span id="s1870">They had put her in a special place for very severe cases, which was on a hill.</span> <span id="s1871">It was called the rotunda; it must have been a Roman building, I don't know really.</span> <span id="s1872">She was unconscious and really in a very bad state, having lots of ulcers and emaciated.</span> <span id="s1873">The problem was with all the patients; some of them were dying of starvation, not of the bubonic plague.</span> <span id="s1874">For the starvation they would have needed food.</span> <span id="s1875">But for the plague they were only supposed to get sugared milk, which was not enough to keep the organism going.</span> <span id="s1876">Also, there were not enough medicaments; I don't think there was even talk about penicillin at that time.</span> <span id="s1877">So, a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s1878">Josef Čapek died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Of course healthy people were free to go, and some of the girls of the Buchenwald men [?]</span> <span id="s1880">who were in good physical condition started on their journey home — on foot.</span> <span id="s1881">But this was out of the question here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">So I got my work in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1883">And they even cleaned an attic and made a room for me with planks.</span> <span id="s1884">And this was nearly fatal for me because apparently I was not really cured.</span> <span id="s1885">So one morning I woke up with a horrible fever and was not able to get up; and just lay there in a delirium, hoping that somebody would find me.</span> <span id="s1886">But downstairs they probably thought I had taken a few days leave or had stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s1887">So nobody came looking for me until the fourth day when I was already lying there in a terrible state when they found me; and of course immediately put me downstairs and put me in a ward.</span> <span id="s1888">But I was really in a desperate state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">I was extremely ill.</span> <span id="s1890">Only afterwards they told me that this Major Spizer went on leave; came to take leave of me, thinking that I was going to die.</span> <span id="s1891">But I must have had an enormous will to live because the moment I woke up, and I knew about this problem of starvation and the proper diet for a plague victim, I knew how the diets were labeled; diet one was only sugared milk, and diet two was maybe a piece of cake, and diet four was normal food.</span> <span id="s1892">So I changed the label on my bed and put on the label for diet four and devoured the normal food, and then I threw it up.</span> <span id="s1893">But something must have stayed with me, and I recovered, really quickly.</span> <span id="s1894">I don't think they ever knew whether it was the bubonic plague coming Back; but I had no ulcers, it was a bout of fever I got well quickly.</span> <span id="s1895">When my fever was down to almost normal, a terrible thing happened.</span> <span id="s1896">[long pause] One of the male nurses who knew me well - I'll tell you about him.</span> <span id="s1897">I met him again under curious circumstances some years ago in England.</span> <span id="s1898">He came and told me [another long pause - she struggles to go on], came and told me that in a ward in the same hospital there was a girl called Ruzickova [now Zuzana weeps] who kept calling my name [she speaks, while crying].</span> <span id="s1899">I got up and got there, and it was Dagmar — she was dying of tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">She was able to tell me what happened.</span> <span id="s1901">They went to Auschwitz with one of the late transports from Terezin.</span> <span id="s1902">And when they came to the ramp, because she had a little brother, her mother and the little brother went straight to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1903">She survived and went to another camp.</span> <span id="s1904">And her father survived, Karel, and went to another camp.</span> <span id="s1905">In the end she ended in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1906">There were two ways the Nazis tried to end this final solution when they saw the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1907">One of them was the death marches; you have heard about them.</span> <span id="s1908">And one of them was the extermination camps like Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1909">So she came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1910">She was, as I told you, from her childhood in danger of TB.</span> <span id="s1911">I was able to be there with her; she died in my arms.</span> <span id="s1912">I was able to tell her that we would get back, and that she would meet her father again, and we would go again to Plzeň, and go to our favorite places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">[Long, long pause] So then, life went on.</span> <span id="s1914">I'll tell you the story of what happened to her father.</span> <span id="s1915">He survived in quite a good condition.</span> <span id="s1916">Then they were transported to another extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1917">And he was in such a good condition that when they were transported through Czechoslovakia, he sprang from the train and hid and managed to reach a village called Sadská, east of Prague, not very far.</span> <span id="s1918">There the Czechs managed to hide him.</span> <span id="s1919">That was already May 1, 1945.</span> <span id="s1920">They hid him in the local prison.</span> <span id="s1921">Somehow the Germans found out and shot him; on May 2, 1945, three days before liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">I think my whole life might have been different if he had returned, because there would have been a man in the family, and he would have helped me and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Later my mother tried to find out whether there was somebody culpable [who betrayed him to the Nazis].</span> <span id="s1924">But my father, before he died in Theresienstadt, whenever my mother would say I will do this and this to the Germans, my father used to say: Don't think about revenge; that belongs to God.</span> <span id="s1925">And so my mother said: All right, I will not seek revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">So, my mother got no better in Belsen.</span> <span id="s1927">It was a great problem.</span> <span id="s1928">I went there every day.</span> <span id="s1929">The bubonic plague got more or less better.</span> <span id="s1930">but she was quite listless — didn't want to recover, or didn't have the strength to recover.</span> <span id="s1931">It looked pretty hopeless.</span> <span id="s1932">We had to stay in quarantine for three months.</span> <span id="s1933">By that time already, on the radio, quite a lot of people from Czechoslovakia were sending out messages searching for family and friends.</span> <span id="s1934">And there was a message from Milostpani searching for me; so I let her know that we were alive.</span> <span id="s1935">And when one of those male nurses went to London, I gave him the address of the Vogels in London and told him to try to find them.</span> <span id="s1936">So he found them and told them that we are alive.</span> <span id="s1937">So by that time some of the family knew that we are living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Of course there were discussions at that time of what we should do.</span> <span id="s1939">Many of the prisoners thought that they would go to the displaced persons camps and seek to get a visa for somewhere because already the Russians were saying that Eastern Europe would be Communist.</span> <span id="s1940">But to me it was quite clear that I wanted to return.</span> <span id="s1941">The whole Zionist thing, I discovered, was theoretical.</span> <span id="s1942">I wanted to go back to my country.</span> <span id="s1943">There was no place else I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s1944">So we were really waiting for the quarantine to expire.</span> <span id="s1945">It did in July; but there was no way for us to get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">My mother was no longer suffering from bubonic plague, but unable to walk; very weak, maybe unwilling to walk or communicate, lying there listlessly.</span> <span id="s1947">I think it was the thought of coming back to our home without my father; she couldn't face it.</span> <span id="s1948">She kept saying: I will never get back, I will never get better; I will stay here.</span> <span id="s1949">When I realized that, I kept frantically looking for some sort of transport because I felt very strongly that unless she gets out of this hospital and home, she will never recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">There were cars from Czechoslovakia coming for people, but they were always full.</span> <span id="s1951">I remember a rather funny story about a car that came and didn't find those people they wanted to take home, and I asked them if they would take us.</span> <span id="s1952">And he said: But you must get the petrol.</span> <span id="s1953">So I went to one of the doctors, and he said we would have to go to the headquarters; so I went.</span> <span id="s1954">By that time I had a sort of an apron and looked like a nurse.</span> <span id="s1955">And I went into this gorgeous building up on a hill where the British HQ was.</span> <span id="s1956">I remember all the officers were huge.</span> <span id="s1957">And I got into the inner sanctum, and they said they would call a general to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1958">And I had some papers with me and this huge Englishman came, and I said I want some petrol, some gasoline.</span> <span id="s1959">And he didn't even let me tell him for what, but he disappeared and came back with a flask of petrol [she laughs].</span> <span id="s1960">And I said: That’s no use to me; I’m going back to Prague.</span> <span id="s1961">And he said: That's out of the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">So I went back again.</span> <span id="s1963">They were really trying to get a train for us; and they didn't get it until the middle of August.</span> <span id="s1964">So then there was this question, because the doctors in the hospital said it was out of the question for my mother to travel; she wouldn't survive.</span> <span id="s1965">But when you are young, you have such courage, such intuition; and I had this feeling, I just have to get her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">So I conspired with my friend Dr. van Low, and had him make out a paper that she's allowed to leave the hospital.</span> <span id="s1967">And some of my friends got me a dress for her to wear.</span> <span id="s1968">And very early in the morning when there was no proper watch, because the paper was, of course, fake, I gave the paper to the night nurse; and said I have to bring my mother to my hospital to be x-rayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">I dressed her, and we went.</span> <span id="s1970">My mother said: What are you doing to me?</span> <span id="s1971">I won't survive this.</span> <span id="s1972">You know the doctors said I won't survive this.</span> <span id="s1973">And I was even very cruel because I thought that was the only way.</span> <span id="s1974">I said, ‘I want to go back to Plzeň, and I'm not going back without you.</span> <span id="s1975">And I don't want to stay here anymore.</span> <span id="s1976">You must go with me.’</span> <span id="s1977">So that was probably the very thing that made her try.</span> <span id="s1978">She felt she has to make this last sacrifice for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">On top of it, we got a place in wagon #13, and my mother was superstitious and said: You see — this is 13; this is my death bed.</span> <span id="s1980">And that journey was bad, because the rails were bad; and also other trains were going through, and we had to wait because we were not an ordinary train, not on the ordinary schedule.</span> <span id="s1981">So again, it took three days.</span> <span id="s1982">We didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s1983">They gave us some parcels, but it was not enough.</span> <span id="s1984">But it was summer, and there was fruit in the gardens so we went out when we stopped and got some fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">It's funny, this thing about being decent was still with me and handicapping me, because, of course, the other girls went pillaging into private gardens, and I could never bring myself to go even into a German private garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Most of the time my mother was lying there, quite listless, saying: This is my last journey; I'll never reach home.</span> <span id="s1987">And then we came into Bohemia.</span> <span id="s1988">The transport was going to Prague, and Plzeň is on the way.</span> <span id="s1989">And we went to some of the villages near Plzeň, and there were the people standing around; we were actually quite late.</span> <span id="s1990">We were not a sensation any more.</span> <span id="s1991">Most of the prisoners and the concentration camp people came back during May; this was already late August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Still there were some people standing around and gaping.</span> <span id="s1993">I was still only 27 kilo; I was still ill, not in good health.</span> <span id="s1994">I kept telling my mother: Look out of the window.</span> <span id="s1995">Here is this village; this is this town.</span> <span id="s1996">In the end, when we were nearing Plzeň, we were in a village where we used to go for our holidays.</span> <span id="s1997">And I said, ‘Look.</span> <span id="s1998">This is Nova Hut, won't you look out of the window.’</span> <span id="s1999">She came.</span> <span id="s2000">And there were some people standing there, and they recognized her.</span> <span id="s2001">And they said: Oh, Mrs. Ruzickova, Mrs. Ruzickova, you are here!</span> <span id="s2002">You have survived.</span> <span id="s2003">And I think that was the crucial moment when she realized she was home.</span> <span id="s2004">There were people there greeting us.</span> <span id="s2005">So she started to take interest, looking out of the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">So when we arrived in Plzeň at the station, most of the people didn't get out.</span> <span id="s2007">We were the only one going to Plzeň from the transport; so we got out.</span> <span id="s2008">It was a very nice warm day.</span> <span id="s2009">So I said to my mother, ‘You sit here on this bench.</span> <span id="s2010">I'll go to town and look to see if there is a repatriation office.’</span> <span id="s2011">We knew already from the people in the villages who said, you must go immediately to a repatriation office in Plzeň.</span> <span id="s2012">I think they even told me where it was.</span> <span id="s2013">So I said, ‘I'll go to the office and see where we should stay the night and bring back some food.’</span> <span id="s2014">And so I went.</span> <span id="s2015">It was not far from the station.</span> <span id="s2016">And they immediately got me my repatriation papers and my mother's.</span> <span id="s2017">And there was a dining room, and they gave me food.</span> <span id="s2018">And the food was svíčková and knedliky!</span> <span id="s2019">[sauerbraten and dumplings].</span> <span id="s2020">And I thought, my first dumplings!</span> <span id="s2021">Prvny knedliky!</span> <span id="s2022">So I only ate two, and I put two in a napkin for my mother; her first knedliky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Then, of course, Milostpani Provazniková lived very near.</span> <span id="s2024">And so I couldn't withstand the temptation, and I went to see her and tell her that we are home.</span> <span id="s2025">So we wept and embraced.</span> <span id="s2026">And she looked at my hands and wept and wept.</span> <span id="s2027">And I said, ‘I have to go and see about my mother; she is sitting there at the railway station.’</span> <span id="s2028">And I am going to the railway station, and who should I meet on the way but my mother, who already felt well enough that she also went to this repatriation office.</span> <span id="s2029">She also had the svíčková and also had two dumplings to take to me.</span> <span id="s2030">[Laughs] So we got these repatriation papers which entitled us to spend the night in the municipal dormitory.</span> <span id="s2031">They said next day we should come, and they would look for a flat for us.</span> <span id="s2032">It was unfortunate that we came so late because all the flats were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Our house was already taken by some Czechs, and they gave to the repatriants German flats.</span> <span id="s2034">After all it was not our house any more.</span> <span id="s2035">As I told you, before the war we were living in this combined flat with several Jewish families.</span> <span id="s2036">So we had no proper flat even before we left for the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Nobody was really thinking that we would come back any more.</span> <span id="s2038">It was too late.</span> <span id="s2039">So, we were given those papers for the public dormitory.</span> <span id="s2040">But we didn't really think we would have to go there.</span> <span id="s2041">We first went to see my cousin Sonya, and she was behaving in a rather curious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">She said: I'm terribly sorry, but I have to leave.</span> <span id="s2043">I have an appointment in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2044">Would you come back at 6 o'clock in the evening?</span> <span id="s2045">We thought, why didn't she offer us the key to her home?</span> <span id="s2046">But she didn't.</span> <span id="s2047">So we said: All right, we'll go and see Slecna Marka.</span> <span id="s2048">Slecna Marka was head of this shop, head saleswoman, and she was almost a member of the family.</span> <span id="s2049">We had given her quite a lot of our things to keep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">So we went there, and rang the bell.</span> <span id="s2051">We expected, of course, the burst of joy.</span> <span id="s2052">But she also was rather embarrassed, and said: I can't really invite you inside; my cleaning's not done; if you would care to sit in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2053">Apparently all those people were already so sure that we wouldn't come back, so maybe she sold some of the things; or maybe she just wanted to keep them.</span> <span id="s2054">But we weren't looking for our things.</span> <span id="s2055">We were looking for some food and some shelter and a kind word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">But when we saw that this was embarrassing her, so we left; and didn't dare to visit anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">By the way, another thing; we met on the street one of the servants we had had.</span> <span id="s2058">And she was wearing one of my mother's dresses.</span> <span id="s2059">And we thought that's how it is.</span> <span id="s2060">We are dead and buried.</span> <span id="s2061">We are ghosts which are not supposed to haunt people from the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">So we sat down on a bench in a park and looked at each other rather sadly.</span> <span id="s2063">And there was still at that time always a guardian in the park to look after it.</span> <span id="s2064">So this guardian saw who we were.</span> <span id="s2065">We were still wearing those terrible clothes.</span> <span id="s2066">So he started to talk to us and asked us where we came from.</span> <span id="s2067">He didn't know us; and then suddenly he went away.</span> <span id="s2068">And then his wife came with a big plate of kolache (kolace, kolach, kolacky) [pastries] and a big jug of tea; so we at least had something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Then we went back to Sonya and sat on the stairs and waited and waited and she didn't come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: She was not a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">She was from a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s2072">She survived in Plzeň.</span> <span id="s2073">The children from the mixed marriages weren't harmed.</span> <span id="s2074">We waited, and she didn't come.</span> <span id="s2075">And in the end we went to the public dormitory.</span> <span id="s2076">And I spent my first night in Plzeň crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">But the crucial thing was that moment my mother was in Plzeň.</span> <span id="s2078">Suddenly she was well and in charge of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">When we left Belsen I was the mother, and she was the child.</span> <span id="s2080">When we came to Plzeň, I was the child again.</span> <span id="s2081">She took over.</span> <span id="s2082">And we finally got the shop back; and we got a flat.</span> <span id="s2083">And I started practicing again.</span> <span id="s2084">But that's another chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">{END OF TAPE RG-50.615.0001.12.12} [This seems to be mis-numbered and is actually the last interview] January 5, 1992--(date of transcribing] {Start of tape RG-50.615.0001.05.12}</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">ME: So many years later, does it have a reality for you anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Absolutely; yesterday I was shaking all over.</span> <span id="s2088">I didn't sleep.</span> <span id="s2089">I was there, there; I'm still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">The crucial question; why it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Yes, you can't understand it.</span> <span id="s2092">That was the question I asked myself in Plzeň.</span> <span id="s2093">Anybody in Plzeň could have been an SS man; could have succumbed to fear, superstition, mass psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">ME: Even you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">No, I could not; I mean theoretically anybody.</span> <span id="s2096">That was the question I kept asking myself.</span> <span id="s2097">Could this man or that man have behaved like that?</span> <span id="s2098">Often the answer was negative.</span> <span id="s2099">There are people who are immune.</span> <span id="s2100">I can't imagine Václav Havel; but there people who in ordinary circumstances are leading a very decent life, but because of being afraid or succumbing to the hypnosis of mass psychology.</span> <span id="s2101">You see it with the Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">I learned about being decent from Freddy.</span> <span id="s2103">Requiring of someone that they be decent is almost the top that you can require.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">The conditions are crucial.</span> <span id="s2105">If some of these people, the SS men, had lived under good conditions in the states, say, they would have lived a reasonably decent life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Me: Do you believe then, that with a few exceptions like Havel, that almost everyone is potentially “this” [that is, able to become an SS man in a concentration camp]?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">She answers: Yes, almost everyone is potentially this.</span> <span id="s2108">Because I've seen so many people who yielded to the pressure, yielded to the hypnosis, the mass psychology; because they wanted to believe they were doing right.</span> <span id="s2109">I’m talking about people like Pavel Kohout, who signed the petition for Horáková to be executed.</span> <span id="s2110">And then in ’68 they saw they were wrong.</span> <span id="s2111">But how is that possible?</span> <span id="s2112">For a woman to be executed is wrong at any time!</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">It's a matter of yielding to mass psychosis.</span> <span id="s2114">It's what Freud says.</span> <span id="s2115">Every individual acts differently when he's in a crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">It’s those people in Iraq who a few months ago were ready to kill any American and stand behind Saddam and now are crossing the borders and asking the Americans to help them.</span> <span id="s2117">How can one be so blind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Talking with my friends here so many say: I didn't see what went on the fifties.</span> <span id="s2119">How could people not see it?</span> <span id="s2120">There were so many documents of what Stalin did.</span> <span id="s2121">Almost all the Czech intelligentsia — how didn't they see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Does this color your life in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">How do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">[She continues without asking for an answer]: No, I'm an eternal optimist.</span> <span id="s2125">You, look here, you can look at it from two sides.</span> <span id="s2126">You can say everybody is potentially a criminal, and you can say everybody is potentially a decent person.</span> <span id="s2127">If he or she had lived under different conditions, under less pressure, maybe he would have been a decent person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Maybe one of those guards had lived a hundred years ago in the Weimar Republic, he would have been a decent father of the family; keeping up his moral standard towards his family and society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">But of course it's scary.</span> <span id="s2130">When I’m talking to a German, I think, what did he do during the war?</span> <span id="s2131">It's the eternal question.</span> <span id="s2132">Now he is so kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">The main fault of people who weren't in the camps, they think the Nazis had horns and the Communists were devils.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">But they are not devils with horns.</span> <span id="s2135">You could spend an evening with Mengele or Dr. Klein and think, what a cultured man.</span> <span id="s2136">You would never suspect; that's the point!</span> <span id="s2137">How can this happen to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">I started reading books about the camp, and I always was disgusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">I always thought that is not what it was.</span> <span id="s2140">Until I read One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Solzhenitsyn, which is the only book about the camps that gets this aspect of the thing — that if you get through the guards without being beaten; if you maybe smuggle a piece of bread; if you get a better portion of soup, with a piece of potato — it’s the same feeling of satisfaction a normal person feels when, I don't know, he has a successful love affair, or is lucky, or wins a lottery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">The feeling of libido, to use the Freudian term, is very relative.</span> <span id="s2142">And you can't survive without getting a certain amount of satisfaction from even the most abnormal situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">So the little satisfactions make the life almost normal.</span> <span id="s2144">You fall in love; you have a boyfriend, though you know you may leave any time, or he may leave anytime in a transport.</span> <span id="s2145">You recite poems and ... you live.</span> <span id="s2146">Otherwise you fall into despair and get the Auschwitz illness; get those dead eyes.</span> <span id="s2147">That is when you cease to get any satisfaction.</span> <span id="s2148">And that's the aspect which nobody is able to grasp who was not there.</span> <span id="s2149">Solzhenitsyn was the only one able to put it on paper.</span> <span id="s2150">And no Archipelago Gulag will ever be as persuasive and as typical and as horrible as One Day … of Ivan Denisovich.</span> <span id="s2151">There it is, in essence ordinary daily life; you are alive.</span> <span id="s2152">You have maybe passed some danger.</span> <span id="s2153">You have maybe had a piece of food more than usual; and that's that.</span> <span id="s2154">It's also life.</span> <span id="s2155">As soon as you lose that, you are dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Most people couldn't understand that; because what you went through was so outrageous.</span> <span id="s2157">How could you survive and how could you live, as I tell it, a normal life?</span> <span id="s2158">Yes, it was a life!</span> <span id="s2159">I had four years of life, a terrible life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Survivor's guilt?</span> <span id="s2161">Yes.</span> <span id="s2162">The main part of my not being able to put it all on paper, and my being so excited about telling you, is this — why am I here?</span> <span id="s2163">All those other people are dead.</span> <span id="s2164">There were so many geniuses, so many scientists, artists; and that's not being an elitist.</span> <span id="s2165">There were so many decent people.</span> <span id="s2166">It was this which, after the war, made me attempt suicide.</span> <span id="s2167">That's another chapter again.</span> <span id="s2168">First of all, I felt I was ill, contaminated.</span> <span id="s2169">I was unable to think like a normal human person, to react like a normal person.</span> <span id="s2170">I also felt this terrible burden of being alive, and the others not being alive.</span> <span id="s2171">My only salvation was music, and I was so afraid I wouldn't be able to bridge over this terrible gap; four years and my hands in such bad condition.</span> <span id="s2172">And I felt nobody really understood how I felt; and I felt it was my fault, not theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">One day when I came from my lesson — I was already at the Academy — I didn't have much luck with my professor, who was an absolutely wonderful teacher; but who once I told him he was a sadist, but he was not.</span> <span id="s2174">He was a man who was very unsure of himself — very severe with himself.</span> <span id="s2175">And so he was very severe with his students and always told them what he thought.</span> <span id="s2176">And he kept telling me that it won't be possible.</span> <span id="s2177">You are a nice young woman; you should marry.</span> <span id="s2178">You are intelligent, and if you want to take up a career, you should study languages.</span> <span id="s2179">Find another career because you are too old to start; technical deficiencies are too great.</span> <span id="s2180">But he didn't tell me this way; he kept ridiculing me.</span> <span id="s2181">So when I came back from one lesson, I had to go to a dispensary to get my mother barbiturates because she had difficulties sleeping.</span> <span id="s2182">The apothecary was a friend, and I didn't need a receipt [prescription?]</span> <span id="s2183">.</span> <span id="s2184">And so I came to Plzeň with one train earlier than I was supposed to come and went into this dispensary and got those barbiturates.</span> <span id="s2185">Then, by another good chance, my mother had a terrible headache and sent somebody from the shop to get the barbiturates.</span> <span id="s2186">And they told her: but Suzi was here a half an hour ago and got those.</span> <span id="s2187">And my mother knew she hadn't told me to get them and knew I shouldn't be home at all, that I should still be in Prague.</span> <span id="s2188">So she came running home and got the doctor, and they pumped my stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">And then she sent me to a psychiatrist, and again this was very lucky; because he was a very wise man.</span> <span id="s2190">He asked me why I had attempted suicide, and I told him all those things I'm telling you — that I felt life was not worth living; that I thought I was not able to live it.</span> <span id="s2191">And his reaction was: Well, I'm not at all surprised.</span> <span id="s2192">And I think that was the only reaction that could have helped, because he didn't tell me to take any medicine.</span> <span id="s2193">He didn't even tell me to get analyzed.</span> <span id="s2194">He just told me that what I had done was a normal reaction to those circumstances.</span> <span id="s2195">So I went away from him thinking, all right, so I'm a normal person.</span> <span id="s2196">I just have to cope.</span> <span id="s2197">He was a very wise person.</span> <span id="s2198">I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s2199">I don't even remember his name.</span> <span id="s2200">He just sat there looking very sad and said: I'm not surprised.</span> <span id="s2201">It's quite normal, what you feel.</span> <span id="s2202">You are not a psychiatric case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">There was no definite point where I felt I had recovered.</span> <span id="s2204">When you talk to Viktor, he will tell you that when he married me, I was still far from recovery [1952].</span> <span id="s2205">I was still toying with the idea of suicide, although not too seriously.</span> <span id="s2206">And he's told me since, that he was quite afraid in the first years of our marriage that I will never recover.</span> <span id="s2207">Music was essential, but I think Viktor was very, very essential.</span> <span id="s2208">He kept, all the time, trying to persuade me that this was something normal which I have been through; and that life is good, and that people are good; though this is far from what he really believes [laughs].</span> <span id="s2209">And that there is no anti-Semitism and that the Jews are in no way special peop1e; that any Czech is ready to hate any Moravian; that any Slovak is ready to hate any Czech.</span> <span id="s2210">It’s just a normal way of living; that people who hate Jews are just unintelligent, stupid, backwards peop1e.</span> <span id="s2211">And then of course, I being absolutely sure that he was a super musician, him telling me that I was a super musician was also terribly important.</span> <span id="s2212">I knew that in music he cannot lie, that it was not a merciful lie, that he probably would have told me not to try so hard to make a professional career if he hadn't been quite sure that what I was doing was really good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Viktor is an extremely sane person.</span> <span id="s2214">I’ve never met a person so sane.</span> <span id="s2215">He has no [(?)]</span> <span id="s2216">complex.</span> <span id="s2217">He doesn't know what it is; and he is absolutely frank with himself and he would have been frank with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">So at that point, I was sure.</span> <span id="s2219">I knew that him telling me all's well with the world was a merciful lie.</span> <span id="s2220">But the important thing, he always told me my feelings were normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">He once broke up with his family when a cousin made an anti-Semitic comment.</span> <span id="s2222">He's even more sensitive, perhaps, about this than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">It was really living with Viktor that made me normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Also, having a person on whom I could absolutely rely; not feeling betrayed.</span> <span id="s2225">I’m talking about human betrayal — lying, infidelity, false behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">It didn't happen at a definite point.</span> <span id="s2227">It went on well into the marriage.</span> <span id="s2228">I still couldn't believe that I could be loved, that the person the other one loved was really myself.</span> <span id="s2229">I had many boys who were courting me, but I always felt they were in love with somebody else.</span> <span id="s2230">I don't think I’m bitter; yes, some feelings are still bitter [she sighs].</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">About Sonya, it’s very understandable, she must have thought why did they survive and not my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">We did get back some of our family things — albums, some jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">I don't really remember that much about it.</span> <span id="s2234">At the time I was so involved with music, fighting for my life; I didn't take any notice of politics.</span> <span id="s2235">I was closed up with my music, fighting for my life so that I would pass the examinations.</span> <span id="s2236">Nothing else was important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">I left everything to my mother; she took care of everything.</span> <span id="s2238">She got the shop back; started it again.</span> <span id="s2239">In the end, when I said I would try to play again, she said: After all, it was your father's wish.</span> <span id="s2240">She tried to make it possible for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">[Victor comes in with coffee] Zuzana tells him to come in; we've finished with the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">My mother tried to make it possible for me.</span> <span id="s2243">The whole family came and said: You're crazy.</span> <span id="s2244">She’ll never be able to earn her living.</span> <span id="s2245">Of course she was very unsure it was right.</span> <span id="s2246">The professors were not encouraging.</span> <span id="s2247">She worried about my future; she was an amazing woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">She recovered very quickly when she got the shop again.</span> <span id="s2249">Of course she never looked at another man.</span> <span id="s2250">After we came home, most of the widows remarried.</span> <span id="s2251">Numbers of people wanted to marry her; men who came back from the camp without their wives.</span> <span id="s2252">But she never looked at another man.</span> <span id="s2253">But there was the work in the shop which she was very good at — immediately got the hang of it; got money from the bank; immediately went looking for merchandise to sell.</span> <span id="s2254">She was a very elegant lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">What broke her, definitely, not only when they took her shop from her [Communists], even then she got another job as a sort of buyer; what broke her was the Plzeň story, the uprising in ’53.</span> <span id="s2256">They blamed the capitalists and all the former capitalists.</span> <span id="s2257">There were trucks coming, and again it was just like the camps.</span> <span id="s2258">They were notified that in 12 hours they must pack up their belongings; a truck is coming which will bring you to the borderlands which were absolutely deserted, evacuated in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s2259">At that time we were living in rooms, no flat of our own; very small rooms, sub-letting.</span> <span id="s2260">So we tried desperately to find a flat, and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s2261">We found these two rooms; we met a former student of Viktor’s who helped us find these two rooms.</span> <span id="s2262">We hired a truck to take all our things from Plzeň to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">The moment we were leaving a policeman came and said: What are you doing?</span> <span id="s2264">You are supposed to leave in 12 hours to the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s2265">And I said: We just got married, and we found a flat in Prague, and I’m taking my mother with me to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">It was terrible because at the same time Viktor’s parents were moved from their lovely and large flat in Jindřichův Hradec into a small place.</span> <span id="s2267">So we had all the furniture from two flats and crammed it into the two rooms.</span> <span id="s2268">We of course had to sell a lot and leave a lot.</span> <span id="s2269">And my mother didn't work anymore; she got a little pension.</span> <span id="s2270">She had to live here with us; we were newly married.</span> <span id="s2271">We had a kitchen in this next room; she had to sleep with her head next to the icebox.</span> <span id="s2272">We were in the next room, actually sleeping under the piano; this went on for nine years!</span> <span id="s2273">A mother-in-law and a young married couple, and her being used to meeting a lot of people, and being a good business woman; it must have been hell for her.</span> <span id="s2274">It was hell for us.</span> <span id="s2275">Viktor lost his place at the academy because of political reasons.</span> <span id="s2276">I was working at the academy, with a ridiculous salary, supporting all of us.</span> <span id="s2277">It was the same thing!</span> <span id="s2278">Being thrown out of Plzeň, being evacuated; it was exactly the same!</span> <span id="s2279">I hated Plzeň for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">{End of tape RG-50.615.0001.05.12} {Start of tape RG-50.615.0001.06.12} Most of this tape is a conversation with Viktor and Zuzana and is in Czech; what follows is the edited translation that was given in the original transcription.</span> <span id="s2281">It seems that quite a bit has been omitted in the translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">My mother was a very courageous woman.</span> <span id="s2283">She immediately started to remake this apartment for us.</span> <span id="s2284">Viktor and my mother did all the work.</span> <span id="s2285">She never lost her wonderful sense of humor until she was 80.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Talking with Viktor: Your role in Zuzana's recovery: That's not because of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Zuz: Yes it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Viktor: It was her own accomplishment.</span> <span id="s2289">She had a music as a motivation, and she was enormously courageous.</span> <span id="s2290">My, who life's goal was to bring her back to the normal, to give her the feeling that she is a normal human being; because the greatest misfortune of those people who suffered this fate that they somehow felt excluded from the human race.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">I'd tell her there are no devils; you're here, you survived it.</span> <span id="s2292">Now you have to devote yourself to music.</span> <span id="s2293">I really don't think there's anything else but simply love to cure people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Zuzana told me everything, everything; and I told her everything too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">The main thing is a mutual feeling of trust, mutual goals.</span> <span id="s2296">We came from similar backgrounds; we see the world in similar ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Viktor during the war: In ‘42 I received orders that I should go to a work bureau.</span> <span id="s2298">There was some SS man, and I said I wanted to go to the conservatory.</span> <span id="s2299">And he looked at me and said: Yes, that's a typical musician’s face.</span> <span id="s2300">I also have a daughter at home who also plays the piano.</span> <span id="s2301">So, well, I’ll let you stay there.</span> <span id="s2302">How long will it take?</span> <span id="s2303">I said a half a year.</span> <span id="s2304">During that half year I found a job at Mělník, and there I went to teach German.</span> <span id="s2305">I was 19; I also said I'd teach singing.</span> <span id="s2306">Two years later they kicked me out.</span> <span id="s2307">I became a riveter for aircraft.</span> <span id="s2308">That's where I almost lost my hearing; it was frightful.</span> <span id="s2309">I organized a chorus there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">During the war did you know what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">No, we truly didn't know.</span> <span id="s2312">We knew there were concentration camps but what went on there, we had no idea about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Jiri Lederer was my good friend.</span> <span id="s2314">Your mother would know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">When I first met Zuzana, I didn't even know she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2316">We met at the academy.</span> <span id="s2317">I always liked her enormously.</span> <span id="s2318">As soon as she came into a group, she brought in the soul.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Zuz: We were a group, two Jewish boys and I and Viktor.</span> <span id="s2320">We never talked about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">I was always interested in contemporary music, and I liked Viktor's pieces.</span> <span id="s2322">I went to his concerts whenever he wrote something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Then we used to go for lunch to a restaurant together.</span> <span id="s2324">Viktor always tells me that he was trying to make a date with me, to go to the movies.</span> <span id="s2325">But actually at that time I was going with a different boy for four years, so I turned him down.</span> <span id="s2326">But I liked him a lot as a musician.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Then I broke up with my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s2328">Well, Viktor used to come and take lessons from me.</span> <span id="s2329">That was a lot of fun because I got a dispensation from having conservatory.</span> <span id="s2330">Meanwhile Viktor had to finish conservatory; so I finished a year earlier than he.</span> <span id="s2331">I immediately got a job at the academy teaching piano to composers; so Viktor came into my class, but we had already known each other.</span> <span id="s2332">I knew he was an excellent pianist, so I told him don't you want to take the exam and get out of these classes.</span> <span id="s2333">And he didn't want to; he said he'd prefer to have lessons [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Well, we didn't really take the lessons too seriously.</span> <span id="s2335">It all began when we were once in a larger group somewhere.</span> <span id="s2336">It was before the first of May, and we all had to learn some sort of patriotic songs for the first of May.</span> <span id="s2337">Viktor was sitting in the seat behind me, and he was making fun of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2338">[They sing one of the songs and laugh] And then all of us went to some hospoda [pub/bar] together, and I too began making jokes about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2339">And we left the hospoda together, and Viktor said to me: Do you ever talk seriously, or do you always just make fun of everything?</span> <span id="s2340">That was like opening the floodgates; nobody had ever asked me anything like that.</span> <span id="s2341">And I said to him: You know this is all just a big clown act.</span> <span id="s2342">Of course I have my own problems.</span> <span id="s2343">And he said: What problems?</span> <span id="s2344">And we began to talk.</span> <span id="s2345">And Viktor walked me all the way to Vinohrady.</span> <span id="s2346">We just talked and talked.</span> <span id="s2347">Then he kissed me for the first time, and that's how it all began.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Viktor: I knew nothing about her experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s2349">Ruzickova, that's not even a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s2350">There are many, many Ružičkas here who are Aryans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Viktor had two loves before me, and then he was alone for a long time.</span> <span id="s2352">Then he thought he would mainly dedicate himself to music; he thought he wouldn't complicate his life with girls.</span> <span id="s2353">Then when we started going together, I was once going through Prague on my way somewhere from Plzeň, and Viktor's best friend called me said he'd wait for me at the station; that he wanted to talk to me.</span> <span id="s2354">He said to me: If you're not really serious about Viktor, then don't play around with him, because Viktor told me that if he starts going with anybody, it will only be for marriage.</span> <span id="s2355">And I never really had thought about marriage.</span> <span id="s2356">I was upset; I came home and cried to my mother — I don't want to get married, but I don't want to lose Viktor either because he's such a rare person.</span> <span id="s2357">I'll never find such a person.</span> <span id="s2358">And finally I decided; well, if it has to be, I'll marry him!</span> <span id="s2359">Then we met somewhere, but Viktor had no idea that his friend had had this conversation with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Viktor: My friend had had all these quick relationships with unbelievable stupid girls.</span> <span id="s2361">And once I walked one of them home, and then told him: Really, I don't want anything like that.</span> <span id="s2362">I’m too old for that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2363">And that's where he got the idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Well, the next time I saw Viktor, I thought he had sent this friend to talk to me!</span> <span id="s2365">So I said to him: Well when do you want to have the wedding?</span> <span id="s2366">I proposed to him, without knowing it!</span> <span id="s2367">I think he was rather frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Viktor: Yes, it did scare me a bit.</span> <span id="s2369">[They both laugh].</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">But he reacted courageously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Yesterday I was thinking about something; that I actually never regained my proper human dignity in the political sense, in the sense Havel and the others did.</span> <span id="s2372">Because somehow I was so used to indignities, so that for me being a second class citizen wasn't such a tragedy, I could bear it with equanimity.</span> <span id="s2373">I just wanted three things from life — I was alive, not hungry; I could make music; and I had Viktor and my mother.</span> <span id="s2374">And the other things were not that important for me.</span> <span id="s2375">That was maybe why I never joined the party and why all the indignities — they vexed me of course — I was angry sometimes, but they didn't seem so unbearable.</span> <span id="s2376">Maybe this was because I was well-conditioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">And also after the war, I was so involved with music that I didn't think at all about politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">I only began to suffer acutely after ’68.</span> <span id="s2379">I lived ‘68 much more euphorically than Viktor did.</span> <span id="s2380">He was skeptical from the first moment.</span> <span id="s2381">Because I thought this was a natural evolution, I really believed in socialism with a human face.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">In the ‘70s I became very interested in politics.</span> <span id="s2383">I often played in Hungary in the late ‘80's and saw the development there; while we were still in a totalitarian state.</span> <span id="s2384">And I saw what was happening in Poland, and I thought maybe we would stay the way we were, with Romania and Germany — a nexus Bucharest - Prague - Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">{End of tape RG-50.615.0001.06.12} The rest of the transcription does not seem to be on any tape.</span> <span id="s2386">I don’t know where this comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">And this is a photo taken immediately after I returned; this is August 1945.</span> <span id="s2388">[A shocking difference] Me: What were the circumstances of the taking of these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">We were in a sort of home for repatriates where we were treated for exhaustion, diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Here I am 3 years after the war, going to my first ball.</span> <span id="s2391">We had nothing to make a dress out of.</span> <span id="s2392">This was material used for black-out raids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Me: You look plump!</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">I was terribly fat; I just ate and ate.</span> <span id="s2395">Everyone did that.</span> <span id="s2396">I reached the weight of 65 kilos [143 lbs.]</span> <span id="s2397">; a weight I had never had before or after.</span> <span id="s2398">So was my mother, so was everybody.</span> <span id="s2399">Because we somehow couldn't eat enough — there were no vegetables, no meat — so we ate dumplings and lots of potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">[Me: you were quite a beautiful little fat girl.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">ZR: Yes, I was quite a beautiful little fat girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">[I comment on difference of pictures just after camp, where ZR looks so terrible, and three years later, where she looks normal — a shining young girl].</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Yes, she says.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">December 30, 1991 [Resumed this project] Now listening to tapes again.</span> <span id="s2405">Here is some more background while looking through photo albums.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">[Note: this is almost the same as the introduction before the first tape] This is Dobříš.</span> <span id="s2407">My father was a great photographer.</span> <span id="s2408">This, [her voice takes on a secretive sound] this is a former love of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">No this wasn't our dog;
