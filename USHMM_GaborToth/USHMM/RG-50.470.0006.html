good place to start would be at the point in the death march when you ended up in the barn, so if you could just take me into that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">NESSE GODIN: As I mentioned to you before, after the death march, we were round up in a place with the name of Zhinof.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">We pushed in into a barn, I do not know how many of us were left dead on the road.</span> <span id="s6">We may have been about 600 when we arrived there.</span> <span id="s7">But for the three weeks that we were there, there were more dead bodies in the hold that they dug than people in the barn.</span> <span id="s8">I tell you, it was just a terrible terrible sight.</span> <span id="s9">Uh, it came a point at that time when I really prayed to be one of the dead.</span> <span id="s10">But that real was different.</span> <span id="s11">March 10, 1945, we were liberated by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s12">Actually, the people were taking, the Russians were taking over that area, and they found us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SWB: Describe to me some of the things that happened in that barn, before they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">NESSE GODIN: Before we were liberated, or that particular</span></p> <p><span id="s15">day?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SWB: Before you were liberated leading up to that</span></p> <p><span id="s17">particular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NESSE GODIN: When we came in actually to the barn, they, the Nazis ordered 50 women out, they gave them shovels, they told them to dig two giant holes.</span> <span id="s19">We thought that we were being lined up and shot, as in previous, that's what happened.</span> <span id="s20">But the Nazis had different plans for us.</span> <span

id="s24">NESSE GODIN Page 2 hole served as a bathroom, they put some sticks on.</span> <span id="s25">And the other hole served as a grave.</span> <span id="s26">Every morning, the dead were ordered to be taken out, they were had to be under as naked, because the clothing could be recycled, but the people were dumped into the hole.</span> <span id="s27">Food was given to us very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">You see the Germans did not get at that point allocation food for us for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s29">It was up to the village to supply some food for us.</span> <span id="s30">People just died from hunger, typhoid, dysentery.</span> <span id="s31">I tell you, the mountain of bodies outside were dead, but the people inside looked dead also.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">If we were just living zombies, skeletons covered with skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">And that particular day, before the Russians found us, in the morning, when um, the men that were in charge to take out the dead, took the bodies out, came back into the barn and said to us, no guards.</span> <span id="s34">Some of the women said, let's run to the village.</span> <span id="s35">Now you know we couldn't even walk, we were so sick.</span> <span id="s36">Somebody else says, there is SS men hiding behind the barn.</span> <span id="s37">The minute we start to walk, they're going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s38">But we didn't know that we were, that there were no more guards, they ran away.</span> <span id="s39">All day long we sat in that barn not knowing that our guards are run away.</span> <span id="s40">At night we heard the sound of boots.</span> <span id="s41">Now you know for us survivors, the sound of boots we shiver.</span> <span id="s42">And then we heard the Russian language, and there was the Russian army and the soldiers were telling us that they took over the area.</span> <span id="s43">They can not stay with us, but in the next day or so, their backup units will come, the medics and they will help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Now that night, I tell you, I cried.</span> <span id="s45">I remember I cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">And you know, 50 years almost, from March 10 till now, and I still don't know why I cried.</span> <span id="s47">Did I cry because I felt sorry for me?</span> <span id="s48">Did I cry for my family that was so brutally killed?</span> <span id="s49">You know it was just something that people said, you must have been very happy when you were liberated.</span> <span

nothing for you except tell you you were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NESSE GODIN: Uh, well, uh, some soldiers gave us a bite of bread and they said to us we are afraid to give you food, if we give you too much, you may get very sick.</span> <span id="s56">So, don't run to the village, don't eat too much, we are going to come with the medics and tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s57">Now many people right after liberation died because they ate a whole slice of bread.</span> <span id="s58">Our stomachs were so shrunken.</span> <span id="s59">We couldn't digest any more, too much

wasn't mentally stable.</span> <span id="s160">But still I thought maybe it is true.</span> <span id="s161">So, I go to my lady whose ward I am, I said, he- her name was Hanna, I said Hanna, we have

was a candle burning, and there was my mother.</span> <span id="s187">She looked frail, but she looked the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">She, from the age of 45 to 46, she didn't change

gave us crumbs of bread I remember just and saying, ah we don't have ourselves, and we don't want to give you too much so you don't get sick.</span> <span id="s207">Now as I told you before, the next day, the few that were a little bit healthier had walked to the village.</span> <span id="s208">I really cannot, don't know whether it was a mile or a mile and a half.</span> <span id="s209">It was

to the concentration camp the last words that we were sent to each other, was in case we survived that hell, our meeting point should be back home in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s269">So each of us had that idea in case somebody else comes back we should go to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s270">But that's why my brother also remembered it and made sure that in case someone of the family is alive, we should try to go.</span> <span id="s271">Now in tha- if you look through history at that time, you will see it really was not too difficult to go over border, walk across the border, especially for survivors.</span> <span id="s272">We, they could tell we are survivors.</span> <span id="s273">Somehow a group of people we, uh, somebody said that the best way to get over to the American zone would be through Berlin.</span> <span id="s274">Because in Berlin, they had the Russian zone, the French zone, the English zone, the American zone.</span> <span id="s275">Now uh I remembered riding on a truck and walking by foot.</span> <span id="s276">We wound up in one of the zones, I think, I don't really remember anymore whether it was the English zone or the French zone, and we just walked over to the American zone.</span> <span id="s277">And there we registered and um, if you had family, they helped you to get reunited.</span> <span id="s278">And when we told them that we heard that my brother is in Feldafing, ah, they actually brought us there.</span> <span id="s279">So, we wound up in uh, uh, October of 1945, we arrived in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s280">Took a long time for us to get there.</span> <span id="s281">You can see from sometime in June till October.</span> <span id="s282">So it wasn't a easy thing, you know, you went from one place to another, you had to wait for documents, for papers, for.</span> <span id="s283">.</span> <span id="s284">In the time from June till October, I met my husband-to-be.</span> <span id="s285">And he joined us and before we actually

Well this is always, especially children in the school when I talk to them about my experiences, they ask me how did you meet your husband.</span> <span id="s292">And I always tell them sincerely, in those days, you needed each other.</span> <span id="s293">My husband is a survivor of the holocaust.</span> <span id="s294">He doesn't even have a distant cousin.</span> <span id="s295">Um, there was a long story behind it how I met him.</span> <span id="s296">He was a friend of a friend of my, one of my uncles by marriage on my father's side.</span> <span id="s297">And when we found these people in the city of Loge, I mean we, my mom, and I found this uncle and his friend, we became a little bit like a family unit.</span> <span id="s298">And that's who we traveled with from Loge to the American zone.</span> <span id="s299">Um, at one point, I remember in Loge, my mother saying to me, uh, Nessele, that's an endearing word for your name Nesse, Nessele, you know we are two women alone.</span> <span id="s300">I think it would be a good idea if one of us would get married.</span> <span id="s301">Now my mom was 46 years old, and I thought in my heart, why would she want to get married?</span> <span id="s302">She has me.</span> <span id="s303">I was angry.</span> <span id="s304">But the next thing out of my mother's mouth was, my child, I had a wonderful husband, I don't think I will marry again, but I think you should marry, look here is a few guys, they are all very nice.</span> <span id="s305">Choose one and get married, we'll have a man that will help us and take care of us.</span> <span id="s306">So honestly, I just looked at Jack and I thought he was cute, and I, many times I ask him, I say Jack, who proposed, how did we decide to get married.</span> <span id="s307">Um, I don't remember kissing him before we got married.</span> <span id="s308">I don't remember us being in love before we got married.</span> <span id="s309">We needed each

NESSE GODIN: Okay.</span> <span id="s320">What I remember of Feldafing.</span> <span id="s321">When I came to Feldafing I was curious, it looked a beautiful place with villas, with a golf course, with tennis courts, with some barracks down the town, and I was told at that time that this was a resort place for SS men to come and enjoy themselves and have a good time.</span> <span id="s322">It was a small little town, the town itself was maybe ten blocks long.</span> <span id="s323">A small town, small European town, very pretty, very nice, and as you went down to the area where we called the DP camp was, ah you still saw those beautiful villas, you saw the beautiful trees, the beautiful area.</span> <span id="s324">But you have to understand, I- we were not given a villa.</span> <span

villa that meant that ten families instead of one lived in that pretty house.</span> <span id="s342">Uh, for instance, my brother was there already with his wife to be, or she was his wife already actually maybe.</span> <span id="s343">And they had one room.</span> <span id="s344">Now when we came, my mom and my husband and I, we were just given two beds in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s345">And the kitchen was used by the rest of the ten families.</span> <span id="s346">So it was, yes, the place looked beautiful.</span> <span id="s347">But we were still crammed into small places.</span> <span id="s348">We still, ris- had to go down to the main kitchen to get the food, cause at the beginning they did not give you, for each family separate ration.</span> <span

went to that special place where they assigned you that you can get a coat, or if you needed a dress, or if you needed something else.</span> <span id="s352">So, yes we were free, but we were still in

changed, but at the beginning it was very organized living.</span> <span id="s365">We still were told we're not allowed to go uh out, we were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s366">And then we didn't have money to go, let's say if somebody wanted to take a ride to Munich.</span> <span id="s367">Unless they assigned you a ticket to go for a certain purpose, like if I had to go with my face to the
