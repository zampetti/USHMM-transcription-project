not, you know.</span> <span id="s21">I think it’s been documented when these people had been taken to Auschwitz from where I come from.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Let’s see, she grew up in Volosyanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: And she lived there.</span> <span id="s24">You see Jews lived there for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did she, she was married to your grandfather who you were telling me about</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Can you tell me his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: His name was Sander.</span> <span id="s29">Matter of fact my grandchild is named after him.</span> <span id="s30">They call him short Seth.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Seth?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Seth.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: S-E-T?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">SETH.</span> <span id="s36">Seth.</span> <span id="s37">But at home they used to call him Sander Moscowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: He was eight-six.</span> <span id="s40">That I know for sure.</span> <span id="s41">Because he would cry.</span> <span id="s42">Oy, what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Um, now you said your grandfather was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s44">Was your grandmother also?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Sort of.</span> <span id="s46">But women didn’t show it.</span> <span id="s47">Women didn’t worship as much as men did.</span> <span id="s48">He was terribly upset with God that he didn’t die.</span> <span id="s49">You know, he had no fear of death.</span> <span id="s50">He had no fear of death because he was so religious.</span> <span id="s51">He felt he goes to, you know.</span> <span id="s52">I remember in the ghetto when they took him to the square.</span> <span id="s53">More older people that had beards.</span> <span id="s54">He had a long beard, not just a small beard, but a long beard.</span> <span id="s55">He never got cut his beard because of religion.</span> <span id="s56">So, they got these old men on the square and they were cutting their beards with scissors and they were beating on him.</span> <span id="s57">So um, you know he was bloody and my mother was the daughter, so my mother finally got to him.</span> <span id="s58">You couldn’t go to rescue him because you would get shot.</span> <span id="s59">I mean you wouldn’t get beaten up, you would get shot.</span> <span id="s60">So she couldn’t go rescue, but when they were finished beating him up and cutting his beard, we brought him home and he was just crying terribly and we thought he was crying because he was full of pain.</span> <span id="s61">You know, his face was bloody and black and after a few days the man just couldn’t stop crying so, uh we told him we understand he must be in terrible pain from the blows he got.</span> <span id="s62">He says no, he doesn’t cry out of pain but he, it’s not him, he felt so humiliated.</span> <span id="s63">So my mother took a scarf and she put around his face and tied it on the top and put his hat on, he wore a black hat and somehow that made him feel better.</span> <span id="s64">He stopped crying.</span> <span id="s65">So, so.</span> <span id="s66">And that’s how he went to Auschwitz a few days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: That was just before.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Just before.</span> <span id="s69">I just don’t understand.</span> <span id="s70">I don’t understand why they needed to do this to him.</span> <span id="s71">They knew that he would wind up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s72">What happened was that they kept us in a ghetto until they accumulated enough Jews to put in transport.</span> <span id="s73">Because you know the trains were many and long.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Um, do you remember what your grandfather did for a living?</span> <span id="s75">What he had worked at before?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah, they had a store, they were selling flour there and sugar.</span> <span id="s77">It wasn’t a big store.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Kind of like a grocery store?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, a small grocery store.</span> <span id="s80">Yes, small.</span> <span id="s81">It wasn’t a Giant.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And both your grandmother and your grandfather worked there?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And that was in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Do you know when they got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And, um how many children did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Oh, they had ten boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s90">And the two girls, when I was growing.</span> <span id="s91">You know, I have pictures of about six boys and one was in the United States and a few of them died, but they had a lot of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I have pictures.</span> <span id="s94">My mother was the daughter and then I had an aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Um, was your mother, in that family.</span> <span id="s96">Was she one of the older ones or one of the younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well, in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Do you remember, I know it is probably difficult for you to remember, but do remember them talking about, or even your parents talking about when the Germans, the Nazis, came to power in Germany in the ‘30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you remember, were they frightened at all, were they apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Very, very.</span> <span id="s103">But I’ll tell you, as I talk in the tape.</span> <span id="s104">If you see the tape.</span> <span id="s105">We knew somehow the Jews have suffered through the last 2000 years, I’m sure you know history.</span> <span id="s106">But this has never happened before to no group of people.</span> <span id="s107">So as much as we were frightened and scared, but we didn’t fear actual death and destruction, the kind that has happened.</span> <span id="s108">You know they felt, well, they are going to take the manpower and they are going to work them, or they are going to do things like that.</span> <span id="s109">But to take small little kids and gas them.</span> <span id="s110">We did not expect that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s112">But your parents were scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: They were frightened of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Of what he was saying.</span> <span id="s116">He was actually saying what he was going to do.</span> <span id="s117">But, you know, I think human nature has a way of protecting themselves.</span> <span id="s118">They don’t want to think of the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yeah, you said something about what he was actually saying, what Hitler proclaimed and these kind of things in speeches.</span> <span id="s120">Were there radios and these kind of things in your town?</span> <span id="s121">Not many?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: When we were Czech.</span> <span id="s123">Then when the Hungarians came in, there was no radio.</span> <span id="s124">We had to hand in the radios.</span> <span id="s125">And the newspaper, the news was just not available any more.</span> <span id="s126">But there were some people who had hid a radio and they would come with some news.</span> <span id="s127">But, people wouldn’t even believe such things, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s128">If the person that had the radio, and they would come and they said they surrounded some Jews and threw them down the balcony or killed them for no reason, it was a little bit difficult to --- to.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: To believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: To believe in the beginning.</span> <span id="s131">But then again and again, and again and again they would clean out a town.</span> <span id="s132">Then they started cleaning towns.</span> <span id="s133">Then we ready understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did refugees from Germany, German Jews or Polish Jews come in to Czechoslovakia, do you remember seeing any?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s136">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s137">But you know, of course, I don’t think this has anything to do with my life.</span> <span id="s138">But when the Germans occupied Poland we lived near the Polish border, at that time that was.</span> <span id="s139">So the Polish soldiers were going through our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: They came through your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah, when they had the war within a week or 10 days they occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s142">I mean, I don’t know, maybe two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: A very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s145">So, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: When did the Hungarians come in and occupy?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Um, do you remember especially, you told me about the cutting of the beard of your grandfather and things like that.</span> <span id="s149">Do you remember any other instances of anti-Semitism directed against you or either your parents or your grandparents or anything like that before/\?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, you see it was sort of quiet while the Czechs were there.</span> <span id="s151">It was sort of, you know, we had a democracy.</span> <span id="s152">So we were allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s153">Matter of fact I have an uncle that was a Czech officer and he was a college graduate because they allowed the Jews to go to school.</span> <span id="s154">But then the Hungarians came in in ’39 and that was already, the schools were closed for Jewish kids and the synagogues were closed.</span> <span id="s155">But, you know I remember I had a teacher, there were so many children we had a teacher in the house who was teaching us.</span> <span id="s156">You know we called it a cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s158">So, did your grandparents live very far from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: No very close, that was my happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: But you didn’t live in the same house or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No, I had very good grandparents.</span> <span id="s162">We were also seven kids so I had loving parents, but you know I was the sixth child.</span> <span id="s163">So I wasn’t getting that much attention because there was no time.</span> <span id="s164">They loved me, so my grandmother would give me all the attention, she would talk to me.</span> <span id="s165">I remember she was a big comfort to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Do you remember what kinds of things you would talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: The fear.</span> <span id="s168">The fear.</span> <span id="s169">As little as I was, I remembered she feared.</span> <span id="s170">She worried, when the war will be over, what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s171">That’s what I remember the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Do you remember talking to her in the late 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah, when the Hungarians came we already felt that.</span> <span id="s174">The Jewish young guys were taken to a work camp.</span> <span id="s175">They weren’t soldiers anymore.</span> <span id="s176">The Czechs, they did take the Jews to be soldiers.</span> <span id="s177">We sort of had, the Czechs we were sort of treated like first class citizens….</span> <span id="s178">Not first class.</span> <span id="s179">I mean we didn’t feel it so bad.</span> <span id="s180">It’s the Hungarians, when the Germans came there was already murder, it was already completely disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Do you remember, can you describe for me your grandparent’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Do you remember and where was it situated in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: They had a stone house, a stone house.</span> <span id="s185">And they had lots of cows and horses and goats and you know, it was like a family in a smaller town.</span> <span id="s186">It was like a normal family, a big family.</span> <span id="s187">And on Saturday nobody worked so we would get together and we would have meals together.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: At their house?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: At their house, yes.</span> <span id="s190">And I’ll tell you, me as a child.</span> <span id="s191">I thought I was a happy child because you know, my uncles loved me and I was a child and it was, to me it looked like a happy situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Was the store that they owned separate from the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, it was sort of ----here were the living quarters and there was like a long room and they kept the ----that’s where the store was</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how things changed once the Hungarians came in?</span> <span id="s195">especially for your grandparents, how it changed their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, you see, I’ll start with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s197">That’s why it’s better when you ask me because I go in from one to another.</span> <span id="s198">Um, when the Hungarians come in the Jews could no longer have stores even.</span> <span id="s199">The Jews could no longer do things, you know, because when you had a store you needed a permit.</span> <span id="s200">And you know, they took it away from you.</span> <span id="s201">So they had to close the store.</span> <span id="s202">And, you say, how did they live, but they had some piece of grounds, and they had the cows that made milk and made the butter and potatoes, they put potatoes in the ----- you know, they had potatoes.</span> <span id="s203">It wasn’t a wonderful life and you know, they didn’t live in a house like I’m living.</span> <span id="s204">They had two rooms.</span> <span id="s205">You know, they would survive.</span> <span id="s206">To give you an example, my parents by the Czechs, they had store, it was a shoe store.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: This is your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: My parents had.</span> <span id="s209">They made a living room out of that.</span> <span id="s210">But as soon as the Hungarians come in it was taken away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: They took the store away.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">I mean, I’m just showing you an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s215">Were there restrictions.</span> <span id="s216">I know that when the Germans came in to many towns they put restrictions on what the Jews could wear, when they could be outside, where they could shop, that kind of --- did the Hungarians do the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, we didn’t have to wear a yellow star by the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: I remember in Poland, I’ve spoken to people, they say they couldn’t walk on the sidewalk, they had to walk on the street and they couldn’t do certain things, go to parks.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: When the Germans came, but you see when the Hungarians came they restricted us to certain extent that we tried not to be invisible.</span> <span id="s220">Who went to the park?</span> <span id="s221">I mean, we wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s222">We wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s223">Even when they wanted to worship, it was in secret.</span> <span id="s224">It was in somebody’s room.</span> <span id="s225">And then you watched, you shouldn’t be seen going in there too many times, you see.</span> <span id="s226">Then they didn’t worship every day anymore.</span> <span id="s227">If they could get to it on Saturday they would be glad to do it.</span> <span id="s228">I mean, you know these old religious people because they were afraid of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Did, so your grandparents then would worship, they couldn’t worship every day or they would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well, he would do it by himself but not anywhere in a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So they closed the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Do you remember anything else under the Hungarians that your grandparents may have had to do, or were they forced to give up some of their property or any of their livestock, that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Well, because it was a war.</span> <span id="s235">They were taking it from the non-Jews too actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So, they were taking it from everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: They were taking it from everybody, because the war was going on and there wasn’t enough food so, it wasn’t that people lived by laws, there was no law.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, any hooligan.</span> <span id="s239">If you beat up a Jew, he wasn’t persecuted.</span> <span id="s240">There was no place to go to complain.</span> <span id="s241">There was a place, we did have police.</span> <span id="s242">But, you couldn’t go complain somebody beat me up, because you would get more.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Right, did that happen often?</span> <span id="s244">Do you remember people getting beaten up?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s246">Children, you know, it was very funny.</span> <span id="s247">It was very funny because by the Czechs, you know, when we went to school we went with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s248">And who were our neighbors, the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s249">And I always thought, I walk to school with this non-Jewish child and I really thought, I mean, I always thought it was my friend.</span> <span id="s250">You know, as a child you play with this kid, you know, this is my friend that I play with.</span> <span id="s251">But as soon as the government has changed and gave the red light to vandalism, maybe the people were scared or something.</span> <span id="s252">You see, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s253">So I lost my, I immediately lost my friend, my play, you know, my playmate.</span> <span id="s254">You see, they didn’t want anything to do with me.</span> <span id="s255">I mean, I’m telling you from my point of view, as a child what bothered me.</span> <span id="s256">My father bothered because he didn’t have to give us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s257">But ….</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did your grandparents ever, um, did they ever tell you things like you were saying --to try to be invisible.</span> <span id="s259">Did they say things like that to you, tell you not to go out in the street at certain times or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: You know a child is now looking back on it.</span> <span id="s261">If there was a wedding, let’s say there was a non-Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s262">By the Czechs we would go and watch the wedding.</span> <span id="s263">I liked to go and watch a wedding, so I went and I watched a wedding and I came back and, you know, I was let free by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s264">But when the Hungarians came, you know, my mother wouldn’t let me go anymore.</span> <span id="s265">I’m just giving you a small example that she wouldn’t let me go because everybody in town knew I was Jewish and therefore I was ___________.</span> <span id="s266">Do let’s say there were even 10 good non-Jews, but you would always find one that would want to get me over the head.</span> <span id="s267">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Uh, huh, okay let’s see.</span> <span id="s269">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I jut gave you an example.</span> <span id="s271">Or let’s say, lots of examples.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: But, I don’t want to take too much ---- I mean this was just that a child’s, especially because I was a little girl I liked to look at a bride or something.</span> <span id="s274">But many things, at night definitely you wouldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s275">Oh, definitely you wouldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s276">Like, you know, if we needed, then if went to the store they would sell us, they would sell us if we had the money, they would.</span> <span id="s277">But, well, we’re still talking about the Hungarians now or the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: The Hungarians, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Okay, like, I wouldn’t be allowed, the children weren’t allowed no more to go like to the store.</span> <span id="s280">Sometimes my uncle would give me 25 cents and I would go and buy an ice cream.</span> <span id="s281">I no longer, they wouldn’t allow me to go by myself.</span> <span id="s282">You know, if they brought it into the house, you know.</span> <span id="s283">At that time there was no money to, you know.</span> <span id="s284">At that time if my mother could get some different things to survive, but you know, they wouldn’t let us go out.</span> <span id="s285">My brother would go and get---- then they also took him away too, uh.</span> <span id="s286">I had an older brother than this.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Older than this?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yeah, I had an older brother.</span> <span id="s289">But then they took him away to work, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: His name was Larry, my son is named after him.</span> <span id="s292">We called him Libel, but my son is named after him.</span> <span id="s293">His name is Larry.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: uh, huh.</span> <span id="s295">Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans came?</span> <span id="s296">You know, what year it was and what happened, how life changed at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, when the Germans came, they right away said that the Jews can not only, they could only go out, let’s say, a couple of hours a day.</span> <span id="s298">Not only at night, a couple of hours a day and if you found a Jew on the street, you know, wanting to buy something you could be shot for that or you could be taken away to this concentration camp which eventually wound up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s299">So the Jews had to wear the Jewish stars, even children.</span> <span id="s300">And then the non-Jews were not allowed to sell to Jews or aid them in any way.</span> <span id="s301">You see they gave, when the Germans came already, I’ll tell you, I don’t blame the non, at that time, you know I read now, I know there were some very righteous non-Jews that really, what they did, I don’t know if I would do it today when I have children and grandchildren because would they aid a Jew, they would be taken away to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s302">So the punishment was so tremendous of aiding a Jew that he himself wasn’t safe.</span> <span id="s303">I’m talking the non-Jew wasn’t safe.</span> <span id="s304">That was by the Germans, by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Do you remember when the Germans came to town?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I think it was between ’42 or ’43, but you know, I am not sure exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: I can look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah, because you have the town and I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Uh, how long, now you said, and you told me the story about your grandfather having his beard cut and everything before they were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: That was after they took us away from home into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: That wasn’t while we were home.</span> <span id="s313">But, when the Germans came, though, they worked so fast, they worked so fast.</span> <span id="s314">If I, within weeks they took us to a ghetto, within weeks and they put us into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So you were taken away to the ghetto within a few weeks of them coming into your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes, within weeks, it wasn’t months.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And they took every Jew in the town, whoever was Jewish in the town they took to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s319">Now you see, it’s true.</span> <span id="s320">You know, I’ve always had this color, now I have to put a little color because I am white.</span> <span id="s321">But I was always this color so when I talk many people ask me, you don’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s322">I say how is a Jew supposed to look?</span> <span id="s323">So, it wasn’t, what happened was, the non-Jews handed us over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s324">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: They pointed you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s327">Even we had to have a Star of David on the house too.</span> <span id="s328">But, let’s say they didn’t know that my parents had seven kids.</span> <span id="s329">But, the non-Jews, so there was no place to hide and they were afraid to hide us because if they’re gonna find us then they’ll go where we are.</span> <span id="s330">So it was a no-win situation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Can you tell me the name of the town that the ghetto was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Uhzgorod, it was a bigger town.</span> <span id="s333">It was a city, I would call that a city already.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: How far from your town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Not very far or a long way.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, it was maybe an hour ride with a train.</span> <span id="s338">It wasn’t ----</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: So they put you on trains.</span> <span id="s340">Was there a train station in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, there was a train station in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: So, did you all go together -- your family, your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: My grandparents and the stronger uncles were taken away to work.</span> <span id="s344">My brother Larry was taken away to work.</span> <span id="s345">My brother Saul was taken away to work.</span> <span id="s346">But the rest of them, the smaller children.</span> <span id="s347">That’s another thing, you know they planned that so by the time they came to take us to the gas chambers that there wasn’t enough strong manpower, they left the old people, the little kids, the women, the older, you know.</span> <span id="s348">They planned it so just in case ----</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So there wouldn’t be any resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: And another thing that they ask me many times, well how come you didn’t fight back?</span> <span id="s351">Jews were such law abiding citizens that not only that, but if somebody would have found it was against the law to have a gun in the house.</span> <span id="s352">So, you know, Jews just didn’t keep guns in the house.</span> <span id="s353">I spoke in front of officers, Navy officers, and that was their first question and I understood what they were saying, it’s just that I don’t know if I could have given them a sufficient enough answer of the situation that was there.</span> <span id="s354">When you don’t have a gun and you don’t have the manpower anymore, how can you fight?</span> <span id="s355">Then nobody really knew that you’re going to a gas chamber, it was a big secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Often times a German would tell you that you were going to work or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Relocated.</span> <span id="s358">They said they need manpower to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: But, I’ll tell you, the way they dealt, we should have known something is horribly wrong.</span> <span id="s361">The way they dealt with a human being, if they wanted to make us work, you don’t go and beat someone to death or beat someone half dead, you know.</span> <span id="s362">It was, you know, we weren’t dealt like we were human.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s364">Can you describe to me a little bit about what you remember of the ghetto in Uhzgorod?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well, also again they didn’t keep us long in the ghetto either because it was like, you know.</span> <span id="s366">I think they knew when we were there that the war, now looking back on it they didn’t keep us long in the ghetto either.</span> <span id="s367">But, the living quarters, the ghetto was a brick factory, they emptied out a brick factory, it was big.</span> <span id="s368">There were no beds or kitchens in a brick factory, so we brought some blankets with us, you know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the ghetto where we stayed, where we had our little place on the floor.</span> <span id="s369">Then they gave us rations, soup, you know, in the morning coffee, and at night soup.</span> <span id="s370">Of course the living quarters were horrible, there was no place to wash and the kids, there were no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s371">So, it was a horrible situation.</span> <span id="s372">And the worst of all, we didn’t know what would happen next.</span> <span id="s373">All we saw is that every day they brought in more Jews, more Jews.</span> <span id="s374">We just didn’t know what they were going to do with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: How long did you stay there, do you remember?</span> <span id="s376">Not very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: probably months, just maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s378">Maybe a month or two at the most.</span> <span id="s379">From what I remember, it wasn’t, you know like the Polish Jews were in ghettos for years, but this wasn’t a work ghetto.</span> <span id="s380">The Polish Jews were in a work ghetto.</span> <span id="s381">This was not a work ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: This was more like, maybe a transit point?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah, they got us together and shipped us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s384">Because at that time already they had the capacity, you see with the Polish Jews they didn’t probably.</span> <span id="s385">They didn’t have the capacity of destroying that many, so they had to kill them by bullets.</span> <span id="s386">So, you know, it was different.</span> <span id="s387">But with us, they could gas thousands of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So, let’s see, you were there for a month maybe two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Months, I would say months.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Somewhere in there.</span> <span id="s391">Now, would this be in ’43 or still in ’42 or right around ---</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Right around the middle, between ’42, ’43 maybe.</span> <span id="s393">Let’s say ’43 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And then you were deported to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: In a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes, in a cattle car train.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: And then, I’ll tell you, when I think back on that ride, you know they put so many people into that cattle car.</span> <span id="s400">We had no bathrooms, small kids, sick people, they just packed us in there.</span> <span id="s401">You know, if they would have taken us to work someplace they wouldn’t have done to us what they did.</span> <span id="s402">Just even the transport, that in itself should have said something to us.</span> <span id="s403">But we couldn’t imagine, we couldn’t imagine that we’re going to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s404">We couldn’t imagine that.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did, so your grandparents are still with you.</span> <span id="s406">Were they in the car with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Can you tell me what happened when the train came to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Well, it stopped.</span> <span id="s410">It stopped and the smell.</span> <span id="s411">You’re probably going to see, I think I do tell ---</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: In the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I tell the day in Auschwitz, one day in Auschwitz I think I tell.</span> <span id="s414">And, um, you know.</span> <span id="s415">If you want me to I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I can tell it again?</span> <span id="s418">Because I want to tell you new stuff, not repeating myself.</span> <span id="s419">When we stopped in Auschwitz they didn’t open up the door, we didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s420">We just saw a big sign that said, you know, a round sign.</span> <span id="s421">It was like this, and it says “Arbeit macht das Leben suss”, and that means in English, work makes life sweet.</span> <span id="s422">So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible and there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire.</span> <span id="s423">You could see far in from the tracks, but they didn’t open up the wagons until it got completely dark, I mean it was dark, dark.</span> <span id="s424">All of a sudden floodlights came on the train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs.</span> <span id="s425">And they opened up the doors and started screaming, “Heraus!</span> <span id="s426">Heraus!</span> <span id="s427">Heraus!”</span> <span id="s428">And, you know from that trip a lot of people died because they threw in sick people and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were going out.</span> <span id="s429">If not you were beaten up.</span> <span id="s430">So they rushed so that they shouldn’t get beaten, but a lot of them that stayed there they just carried them out and put them on the truck.</span> <span id="s431">There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not far from the platform.</span> <span id="s432">Everybody tried taking out the few things that they had for them, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think they’ll be needing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">So there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away the luggage, and people didn’t want to part with it.</span> <span id="s434">One was screaming “I don’t have the name on it!”</span> <span id="s435">They were worrying that they’ll never find their luggage because they don’t have the name on it.</span> <span id="s436">So there was sort of a commotion, so they were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few little things that they had there.</span> <span id="s437">But, with my grandfather he didn’t want it, he was getting beaten up, but he wouldn’t part with it.</span> <span id="s438">And so, you know what they did to him.</span> <span id="s439">Should I repeat, should I say it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: You can, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: The tape is on?</span> <span id="s442">So he didn’t want to part with these Ten Commandments, with this Torah.</span> <span id="s443">So they were beating on him.</span> <span id="s444">We were pleading with him “Throw it away!</span> <span id="s445">Throw it away!”</span> <span id="s446">He didn’t want to do it, so they beat him, they kicked him and then he could no longer get up.</span> <span id="s447">He was there and then they were beating on us to go to the right, to the left.</span> <span id="s448">And what I remember seeing is that they just took my grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn’t get up anymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandments were in the ditch.</span> <span id="s449">And me and my sister they put us to ride with my mother and my mother held on to my brother, she wouldn’t let go of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Now, this was your youngest brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: That was my youngest brother, he was six years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s452">She wouldn’t let go of him, so they started beating on my brother so she let go.</span> <span id="s453">But, she didn’t know that they’re going to put him to the left, that they’re going to put him on the other side and my brother screamed and cried and there were other cries from other children.</span> <span id="s454">But, she sort of, she must have recognized his cry so she looked back and, you know, he was trying to go to my mother, so they were hitting on him and so my mother ran to him from the right to the left and they wouldn’t let her go to the left.</span> <span id="s455">So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and she was crawling and pleading with the SS, “Please let me go to my kid!</span> <span id="s456">Please let me go to my kid!”</span> <span id="s457">So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him and, I don’t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left.</span> <span id="s458">You know, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left.</span> <span id="s459">She ran to my brother and she got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw my mother so beaten up.</span> <span id="s460">And they walked off, I’ll tell you the truth, you know, when I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive.</span> <span id="s461">But, right after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself maybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went to their death so frightened, so scared because they didn’t have their parents with them.</span> <span id="s462">Now, the little infants, they didn’t know, but the four, five, six year old child, it was dark, it was dark.</span> <span id="s463">In the beating, you know, they were hitting on children.</span> <span id="s464">You would think they would leave children alone.</span> <span id="s465">If the child, let’s say didn’t obey what they said, if it wanted to go here or there they were they were hitting on kids like they hit on adults.</span> <span id="s466">And why they needed to do that I don’t understand, why they needed to hit on kids.</span> <span id="s467">And, so I say to myself, maybe she was a comfort to another child there, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s468">You know, she had seven kids and, so ---- so that’s how my mother left to her death.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: So when they split you to the right people who ended up, at least at that point, surviving and the people who were on the left went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s470">?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: They went to the gas chamber right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Was your, did your grandmother also go to the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: She went to the left also?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s476">You know the parting was difficult, you know times were terrible, but we were together, you know.</span> <span id="s477">If you tried to separate families it’s just --- I can’t tell you how painful.</span> <span id="s478">The price they had to pay while they were separating them, you know, beside the physical pain, the emotional pain was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Do you remember, you said you and your sister were on the right.</span> <span id="s480">Did your father also go to the right?</span> <span id="s481">Was he on the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: The men were separated separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So it was men and then women, and then divided again between left and right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Left and right.</span> <span id="s485">So that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So that was the last time you saw your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: When they opened the trains.</span> <span id="s488">It was so chaotic, you know, they let the dogs bite, jump on you, you know, you’re scared.</span> <span id="s489">I can’t tell you, it was like hell on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Okay, why don’t I ask you some questions about your parents before the war and a couple of things about their parents and things like that.</span> <span id="s491">Could you just tell me their names, and the same thing for your grandmother, when they were born and where they were born and that kind of thing if you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Okay, my mother’s name was Rose, I mean her maiden name was Moscowitz, but then when she was married to my father it was Leibowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Do you remember when she was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No, but she was, in this picture she was in the late thirties, early forties, when we were taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And she was, your mother was born in Volosyanka?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But your father was born somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: In Nod Berezna, another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: You spelled that for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Can you give me your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Martin.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Martin Leibowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Do you remember how old he was, do you remember his birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I know that he was six years older than my mother, but I don’t know exactly the dates.</span> <span id="s507">He must have been in the late, sort of ---</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Mid-forties?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Mid-forties, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Okay, do you remember when they got married?</span> <span id="s511">You don’t remember”</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Let’s see, you said there were seven kids in all.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Seven kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Do you remember how many, there were how many girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Three brothers and four girls, including me.</span> <span id="s517">There were three sisters, but I was the fourth girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Okay, four girls and three boys.</span> <span id="s519">Can you give me their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: The four girls, including yourself.</span> <span id="s522">So we have Helen and ---</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Shall I give you from the oldest down?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Well, Larry, shall I call him what we called him?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Sure, tell me both, you can give me his real given name and then ---</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: We called him Lib, and then he, I named my son after him as Larry.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Okay, so Lib would be L-I-B.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes, B.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And he was the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: He was the oldest.</span> <span id="s532">Actually, wait a minute, I had a sister, she was the oldest, but she came to the United States so she didn’t go through the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: So she came before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Before, in ’39, would you believe it?</span> <span id="s535">Just before the whole disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Her name was here, we called her Lya (side B, tape 1), but Frances they called her in the United States.</span> <span id="s538">Frances.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So you were in contact with her after you got her?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: It’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: That’s why it’s good you ask questions because I can sit here for half an hour telling you how we got in contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: And then, I had a sister, her name, uh, my God.</span> <span id="s545">Her name was Sura.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Sura?</span> <span id="s547">S-U-R-A?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">And she had a child, and, you know, it was at night so she just walked away with the child.</span> <span id="s550">Some children were torn, you know mothers were torn away ---</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You mean when you came to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: And probably she was the lucky one.</span> <span id="s553">She just walked off with the kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: She had the kid with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: She had the kid with her.</span> <span id="s556">And then my brother, my brother, this is my brother.</span> <span id="s557">His name was Saul.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Saul?</span> <span id="s559">Did he have a nickname or did you call him just Saul?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, his name ---Shlomo actually we called him, in Jewish,.</span> <span id="s561">And then this is my sister that I live through my life during the war.</span> <span id="s562">Her name is Sylvia, we called her Zeisl.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: How would you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Spell it?</span> <span id="s565">Zeisl.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: I would say Z-E-I-S-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s568">In Jewish we would call it shorter.</span> <span id="s569">And

id="s582">A: But it wasn’t that big, you know everything was smaller there.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Were there, I didn’t ask you this before, were there like Jewish youth groups, or kind of community groups in the town, or was it just people saw each other at the synagogue and that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: The synagogue and then, you know, we had to make our own schools.</span> <span id="s585">So we saw each other in the schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Did you, your brothers and sisters, go to private Jewish schools or did you go to public schools or ---</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: by the Czechs we went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: But under the Hungarians you went to ---</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Private, because we weren’t allowed no more to go to school.</span> <span id="s590">And the schools were held at home, it wasn’t a private building.</span> <span id="s591">It wasn’t a building where the kids could go to, it was in different homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Did your, you said father was in about his mid-forties in 1940, did he, was he involved in World War I or anything?</span> <span id="s593">Was he a veteran?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, believe it or not that’s why he didn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: He didn’t understand why the Germans were treating people the way they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Well, he kept on saying he fought for the Hungarians actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: the Austrian-Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: The Austrian-Hungarians.</span> <span id="s599">That’s why he thought he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">\Q: He thought the Germans were ---</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah, that they’ll recognize that even he’s a Jew but he served his country.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: He fought on their side.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah, he served for the country he lived for, he lived there.</span> <span id="s604">Matter of fact he was wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Right here.</span> <span id="s607">You know, a bullet went through his leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So he fought against the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: In Austria, I was a little kid so I don’t really remember but I know that he was in a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Did he used to tell stories to like your brothers and sisters about the war and things like that?</span></p> <p><span

id="s614">Did he believe that the Germans were ---</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: You know, we believed maybe it would happen to one, to two, maybe a German that isn’t educated.</span> <span id="s616">We didn’t think it would be an organized situation.</span> <span id="s617">You see what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: How can, how can a country or whatever organize to eliminate a people?</span> <span id="s620">You know, we thought it would be like, one person that will vandalize us or, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Were your parents fairly well educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, they were educated in Jewish, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Did they go through school?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: You know, I’m Jewish but I’m not that religious, I have difficulties today.</span> <span id="s625">I have difficulties today.</span> <span id="s626">I’m afraid to think that there is nothing because it can be worse, but ---I don’t think I am as religious as my people.</span> <span id="s627">My parents, my grandparents, they definitely believed, they were definite believers.</span> <span id="s628">To them, a sin was maybe doubting God.</span> <span id="s629">I mean ---</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did your parents, do you remember if they went to public schools or did they go to Jewish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I don’t know, but I know they were well educated in Jewish.</span> <span id="s632">They would quote things from the Bible, maybe that was their way of educating us to be human beings.</span> <span id="s633">I’m not sure why they did that, but uh, if there was any correction in our behavior, you know kids act up sometimes, so they would quote us from the Bible what is right and what is wrong.</span> <span id="s634">The Bible says this, the Bible says that.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Now you said when the Hungarians came in they seized the shoe store, they seized the store and these things.</span> <span id="s636">Did your parents, can you tell me a little bit about your house and where you grew up and that kind of, like maybe how much land you had, where it was, was it a wooded area or ---</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: We had a house and we had also ---</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Was it also a stone house like your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s640">It was a stucco house.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Oy, if I would go back there I bet I would recognize it because I remember it so vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Have you been back?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: They wouldn’t, I went back to see my brother in Russia because he was, I was in Bergen Belsen when the English ---</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: When they liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: They liberated me.</span> <span id="s647">In Russia, when my brother was liberated he was liberated under the Russians and then he could no longer leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Does he still live in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No we brought him over here, well he was in Russia for many years, but then we brought him over here and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Not long ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: About three years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So, let’s see, you said you had a stucco house.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes, and we had cows and, you know, sheep and we had a different house for the animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Like a barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Like a barn, yeah.</span> <span id="s656">And we had some, near the house, we had some.</span> <span id="s657">You know under the Czechs, the reason why my grandparents had more cows and all kinds of animals because they had land, they had, we were allowed to own land by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s658">When the Hungarians come nothing was ours, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s659">They took it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Did you all have chores that you had to do, like to milk the cows?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Oh, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: What did you do, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Well, I used to like to play with the little calves.</span> <span id="s664">They were my favorite.</span> <span id="s665">Oh, I loved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you all have pets, like a dog or a cat?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s668">The kids loved it.</span> <span id="s669">You know we were so many children, so that was our life sort of, to uh ---</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Did you live right in the town or did you live like on the outside of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: In the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Now you said your grandparents had their store, was connected to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Was that also the same way in the shoe store?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No, the shoe store was in a different building because it was a franchise sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did many people in the town speak German, did they know German or no, just Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yiddish, Czech and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Czech and Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s682">From what I remember, because most of my life, most life in Europe I was under Czech.</span> <span id="s683">Under the Hungarians it was only three or four years so, then I was so, I didn’t see much of the outside world.</span> <span id="s684">So, to me the Czech life was more so ---</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Do you remember what your parents might have said, or do you remember anything they may have thought about the Hungarians when they came in?</span> <span id="s686">Were they frightened or were they apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: They were apprehensive, they were apprehensive that we weren’t allowed, I mean we were a second class citizen, you know.</span> <span id="s688">We were limited, we were even limited to worship, I mean that doesn’t hurt anyone.</span> <span id="s689">What can a person do with worship in God?</span> <span id="s690">I mean, we prayed for better times.</span> <span id="s691">And then, you know, we were preoccupied with how to survive, how to feed all these mouths.</span> <span id="s692">That was our preoccupation and our safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: When the Hungarians seized the store, your store, what did your parents do to try and make a living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: It was really very difficult.</span> <span id="s695">We had to live off, again like my grandparents, we had a little place near the house that we planted carrots and potatoes and you know, just barely.</span> <span id="s696">And then we had our cows, so we had our cows for milk.</span> <span id="s697">People there lived mostly on potatoes and milk and bread, oh bread was a big thing.</span> <span id="s698">And we had poultry, we had ---</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Chickens and things?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Chickens and goose, white goose I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: But they couldn’t have, your father couldn’t have a job after the Hungarians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Not in a regular job sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, he had, you know, odd jobs here and there.</span> <span id="s705">I think my father was more educated, I think he had, you know, because he --- I think my mother was less educated, but she was educated in the Torah, she was educated in Jewish.</span> <span id="s706">She went to a cheder (side B, tape 1).</span> <span id="s707">But, I think that my father did go to some school because I think he was an officer in the ---</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: In the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: In the army, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Did you all have a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: We had, but the Hungarians you had to hand them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: They took it?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: You had to hand them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: So you had to bring them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We were scared that they’ll find us, you know, where can you ---</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did your parents also read a newspaper in the town before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes, there was newspaper, but not after the Hungarians, there wasn’t no ---</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Was the newspaper from the town or from a larger town elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: It was brought in from the larger town, you know like the New York Times, you could find a New York Times in Washington.</span> <span id="s720">There was no place where they made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So your parents knew about things that were going on in Germany and Poland or that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: More or less, when Hitler, we knew when the German, uh, what was his name, uh, when Hitler became, got the power, the leader, we knew.</span> <span id="s723">We knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: In 1933, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: We knew when Hitler got to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Was there ever any, when the Hungarians come in, was there ever any discussion in your family about possibly leaving at all?</span> <span id="s727">There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: We wanted to come to the United States, but, you know, because I had my sister here.</span> <span id="s729">But, we couldn’t no longer.</span> <span id="s730">Now where could we have gone?</span> <span id="s731">We were surrounded, in Hungary the Jews were treated like we were treated, in Romania, Jews were treated like we were treated.</span> <span id="s732">If you see Czechoslovakia in the middle ---</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: No place to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No place to go.</span> <span id="s735">There was no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Okay, now let’s see, we talked about your father and your mother and how, what happened to them once they went to Auschwitz and they were with you the whole time when we talked about you going from the ghetto in Uhzgorod and then on to Auschwitz`.</span> <span id="s737">So, I basically know their story, you’ve told me that.</span> <span id="s738">And your father, you said, you were split so the last time you saw your father was when you came off the train, but you don’t know what happened to him at all, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: But my brother, my brother, told us when he came that he met up with a man that was with my older brother and my older brother ---</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Now this was Saul, your brother that you were talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s742">Now, I’m going to talk about Larry, that he actually survived all this time, but when they were taking him back as the Russian or the ---</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: After the war, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, that was almost the end of the war, he died of starvation in a train because they were taking him away.</span> <span id="s745">You see, what they were doing is that they were picking, you know you have these grenades on the floor, let’s say, you know when the Russians retreated, when the Germans, before the Germans would make any steps they would send out these Jewish boys to the mine fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: So they would pick up, you know.</span> <span id="s748">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s749">He survived that.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: He went through, he was actually in one of those, your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: No, my brother.</span> <span id="s752">But, what happened was he died of starvation because when they had to retreat, they were retreating and taking these, whoever was left, a handful.</span> <span id="s753">They weren’t giving them to eat or anything or sleep, so he just ---That’s what somebody told my ---</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Told Saul about Larry?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s756">But, you know, could he have survived maybe the starvation he would be alive because he survived ---</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: He got through the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s759">But, you know, I wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Sure, I understand.</span> <span id="s761">But the last time you heard anything about your father was when you got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Why don’t you tell me about, well, we can start with Saul since he survived.</span> <span id="s764">Do you remember, let me.</span> <span id="s765">Saul Leibowitz was his name.</span> <span id="s766">Do you remember his birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Uh, I should, I think he was born in ’23.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Uh, uh.</span> <span id="s769">So he was about five years older than you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Do you remember what month and day he was born?</span> <span id="s772">Do you remember when you used to celebrate his birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Uh, I don’t know exactly and I don’t want to tell you when I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Do you remember if it was in the fall or the spring or ---</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I can find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s777">If you have a record of it somewhere you can call me and tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: All right, all right, I’ll do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Let’s see, so basically, did your brother go to public school under the Czechs?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Under the Czechs, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Is there anything special about your brother’s childhood that was maybe different from yours, that maybe stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Well, he had more responsibilities than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: What kinds of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well, let me tell you, he helped my father with small little jobs like, let’s say, a non-Jew, it was forbidden for a non-Jew to ---by the Hungarians they were allowed, by the Hungarians the Jews couldn’t own anything.</span> <span id="s785">But the Jews were allowed to work for the non-Jews sort of.</span> <span id="s786">So he used to ---</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: And this is under the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yes, we are talking now about the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s789">So he would go and help my father to ---</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Oh, so you did, you mentioned something about after the Hungarians came your father worked to try to help support.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Little jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Odd jobs or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And so your brother helped him?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Did he also have more responsibility on the farm, did he deal with the cows or the sheep?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Well, I’ll tell you under the Czechs we had a bigger farm, but under the Hungarians we no longer had the farm, except they let us have a few cows and a few chickens.</span> <span id="s798">But, as I said, even under the Hungarians they were taking from the non-Jews too, but the non-Jews, the grounds still belonged to them.</span> <span id="s799">You see what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s800">They took the livestock.</span> <span id="s801">But the ground, they could own the ground, but we no longer owned the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Okay, had your brother completed school, had he finished the public school before the war started, or before 1939 when the Hungarians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: You know what, we can figure that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: How long did people go to school, when did they start school?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: He went to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: He did go to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: My oldest brother finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Larry did?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Larry did, I don’t know if he fully did finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you remember what age they would have finished high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well we started at six.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: At six?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: And how many grades were there, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: So it would be about the twelfth?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes, it was like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: So, let’s see, in 1939 Saul would have been about sixteen, so he would have been close.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Did he, so I guess he never had a job, like a real job before the Hungarians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Saul I’m talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: No, he just helped my father, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Was he involved in any activities in the town, like a sporting club or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: No, there wasn’t such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: There wasn’t any clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: What did he do for amusement, do you remember what he liked to do?</span> <span id="s829">Did he like to fish or did he like to ---</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: You know, it is so difficult to explain a child’s life then and a child’s life here, when I see my grandchildren, may God keep them well.</span> <span id="s831">Um, it’s just like, children were just not children, children were like old people.</span> <span id="s832">What they worried about is how to survive, how to see the sadness.</span> <span id="s833">Let me say this, by the Czechs it wasn’t so visible, but as soon as the Hungarians came in, the children were no longer children.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: They grew up fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: They grew up fast, they grew up fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Did he like to do, did he have any hobbies when he was younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Well, he liked reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: He liked to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Oh, he loved reading, he loved reading.</span> <span id="s840">Any book that you know, books were scarce.</span> <span id="s841">I know that, you know, a Torah is a holy thing, but you wouldn’t believe that a book to us was a holy thing.</span> <span id="s842">Any book that you got a hold of, I remember we had a breakfront, what do you think was in that breakfront, a book that we got a hold of.</span> <span id="s843">It was, everybody read it, and we read it.</span> <span id="s844">We used to dust the book, the dust shouldn’t fall on it.</span> <span id="s845">That’s how scarce a book was.</span> <span id="s846">So I tell you when I came here to this country and I had my children, I kept on telling them how, you know, privileged.</span> <span id="s847">My children knew when they go to school they are privileged to be able to go to school.</span> <span id="s848">They are privileged to have an access of books that they could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Could use, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: You know, it’s like, to us books were like jewels.</span> <span id="s851">Yeah, that was a good word, like jewels.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: So he like to read a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Oh, we all, in that respect, because there wasn’t that much that kids could do.</span> <span id="s854">So, what do you get?</span> <span id="s855">You know, so when you read a book your mind was preoccupied.</span> <span id="s856">Your mind was occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: You could get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: From your sadness, from your uh ---</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Before the war, before the Hungarians came, did you all like to do things, in the outdoors, did you play a lot or did you go fishing or ---</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Well, we played like kids play.</span> <span id="s861">You know, we hop scotched I remember, and I played with non-Jewish children hopscotch, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did your brother, did he have some, a lot of, non-Jewish friends, or did he have mostly Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Well, when we went to school by the Czechs we had non-Jewish, we thought they were our friends.</span> <span id="s864">You know like kids, you don’t think which synagogue, which house of worship you go.</span> <span id="s865">Kids don’t think like that, so who cares?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Okay, when you were deported to the ghetto, okay, you said something about your brother being taken away for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: That was before the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that, what he was doing, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: That was another thing, you know.</span> <span id="s870">My mother, they took them away and we didn’t get mail from them, the mail wasn’t coming.</span> <span id="s871">So, I remember, in the beginning, the mail would come, maybe, very, the beginning we would get a postcard from them.</span> <span id="s872">So, my mother, we didn’t have much, so my mother used to bake cookies and send them little packages, you know of cookies.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: And this was under the Hungarians, that you said the mail wasn’t coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Right.</span> <span id="s875">But occasionally we did get, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s876">So then the mail stopped, so I remember how she carried on.</span> <span id="s877">She felt that they are not alive anymore because we weren’t getting any mail.</span> <span id="s878">So, my mother was preoccupied with that, that they took away her sons and, you know, that they’re not alive.</span> <span id="s879">There was no way to find out where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: So both Larry and Saul were taken away to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Was your father also taken away or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: He was taken away to work in town, but he could sleep at home.</span> <span id="s884">You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s885">But the boys left and we didn’t, you know, we didn’t see them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: So they were in the work camps and when you were deported they didn’t come with you, they stayed in the camps or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Well, wherever they were, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Did you know because of the little bit of mail that came where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Golly, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s890">That was just at the beginning, you know, just as a child I remember my mother was excited baking cookies to send to them and then she was sad because she could no longer send them cookies and being that they don’t write, they’re not alive anymore, so she was mourning.</span> <span id="s891">You know, I remember her crying over that, that her boys are probably not alive anymore because we didn’t get the mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: When were they taken away to go to the work camps, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: that was after the Hungarians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: So, it would have been in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Well, maybe a little while later.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Maybe 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Something like it, yes.</span> <span id="s898">I was a little kid so I don’t remember the exact time.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: And you said that Saul survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Did he tell you where he had gone, what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes, he worked in different places, in different places under the Germans.</span> <span id="s903">Then, the Germans took over these Jewish ---</span></p> <p><span id="s904">QW: Was he in Hungary still or, I mean in Czechoslovakia still or ---</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No, he was in Poland and in Russia and all over the place, all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Was he also in any concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: He wasn’t in Auschwitz, he was only in the work camps and they got liberated by the Russians, marching,</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Do you know where they were marching, do you remember, did he tell you?</span> <span id="s909">Was it a death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Well, sort of.</span> <span id="s911">Yeah, they were marching them and then one night the Russians just showed up, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: So this was in 1944 maybe, or 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: The dates I’ve got a problem.</span> <span id="s914">Let me tell you how he survived.</span> <span id="s915">What happened was when the Germans were marching these guys, at one time they rested up someplace.</span> <span id="s916">You know, it was a place, I don’t know what, a farm.</span> <span id="s917">He called it, let’s say a farm.</span> <span id="s918">So he sneaked away and went in under the hay, you know he covered himself up with hay until the next day the Germans left with the group, but he had a problem, he had a problem when the Russians came, he had a problem to explain himself, where is he coming from, where has he been?</span> <span id="s919">So, you know, when he would tell me these stories I, myself, couldn’t believe what this guy had to go through just, even, after the war, how the Russians kept him locked up.</span> <span id="s920">But then he was telling the story how, you know, so finally they caught up with the group, so they knew that he must be telling the truth because he knew about the group and it was lucky that they caught up with them a short time later so they told him to let him go because, who knows, they could have thought he was a spy and they could have killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Right, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: So that was the lucky part, so even if he wanted to survive he could have gotten killed after, after war for different reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: So he survived and then he was kept in Russia after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Do you know where in Russia he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Well, the last place he lived was Uhzgorod.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Oh, so that was in the part of Czechoslovakia that turned into Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: To the Ukraine, and the Russians occupied it.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So he lived there and then he came to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yes, I can call you up and tell you exactly when he came because we brought him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: And did we have a time, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Was this in the seventies or the eighties?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Seventies, I think it was the seventies when we brought him over.</span> <span id="s935">I’ll tell you the exact dates because we have the papers.</span> <span id="s936">That I can give you the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Okay, that’s good.</span> <span id="s938">Why don’t you tell me the name of your sister, who was Sura, or is that Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Sylvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Sylvia’s in the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Sura never went to that accidentally, you know, you see what the Germans did in the beginning they just gassed everybody that came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s942">But, when we came at that time the German munitions factory already said don’t kill them all out, send me the manpower.</span> <span id="s943">That’s where I worked the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s944">But, so that’s how I survived.</span> <span id="s945">But, my sister, they probably would have grabbed the kid out of her hand but she was short and skinny, sort of, so you know, they weren’t paying much attention to her.</span> <span id="s946">So she got away walking to the gas chambers with her child.</span> <span id="s947">I mean, it was like, you know, a freak accident.</span> <span id="s948">Probably would have been worse for her if they would have taken the kids out because her kid was really small.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Who knows what was worse, who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Okay, do you remember when Sylvia was born, what year she was born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yea, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Do you remember her birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: February the tenth.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: February the tenth?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: She was closer in age to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Yes, I was born in ’28.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: And, let’s see.</span> <span id="s960">Did she, was she also in public school there, under the Czechs?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes, but, you know she didn’t finish.</span> <span id="s962">But you’d be surprised, we tried so hard to study even in our own little private cheders, what we called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: And that was our outlet, you were asking me whether we had ---this was our outlet, to get a pencil and paper and write or, you know, number work.</span> <span id="s965">I used to love number work, actually I loved it.</span> <span id="s966">A piece of paper was difficult, so it was difficult all around.</span> <span id="s967">My kids grew up that they were privileged, they had enough paper and pencil.</span> <span id="s968">I didn’t tell them the rest of the horror stories, but I just made them --- I really still feel that a child that is, that has the privilege of an education and doesn’t take, that doesn’t say, you know, my daughter went to college, my first daughter went to college, I said to her, you know, you are privileged to be able to go to college.</span> <span id="s969">And I really think she was there and she felt, you know, something terrific is happening to her.</span> <span id="s970">I really think she felt like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Do you remember, let’s see, you said because your brother was older that he had some more responsibility in your family.</span> <span id="s972">Did your sister also since she was a little bit older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes, we would go and wash floors for other people and clean.</span> <span id="s974">I mean, because there were a few doctors there.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Now was this under the Hungarians or was this under the ---</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Under the Hungarians, not the Czechs.</span> <span id="s977">The Hungarians, a matter of fact, should I tell you, I remember even me, I used to go and help out, you know.</span> <span id="s978">We were glad, because what happened was when I went to help out, to do these chores, you know somebody gave me a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s979">You know, I don’t know, I also felt good that they asked you to come.</span> <span id="s980">Actually, you felt good that they asked you to come in to their house to help them out with these chores.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: It was probably nice to be away from the house sometimes, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: It was, it was ---well, I can’t say it was nice because I had to wash the bathrooms, I had to wash the clothes and, you know, I was a little kid.</span> <span id="s983">I wasn’t that old, maybe 12 or 13 years old when I was doing it.</span> <span id="s984">But, it was okay, because that’s how we were surviving, you know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: And they weren’t beating on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s988">Did you, I mean you and your sister, since you were closer, did you play a lot together?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes, we fought a lot and we played a lot.</span> <span id="s990">Yes, but we were very close.</span> <span id="s991">Matter of fact, I think you’re going to hear in the tape that, probably if not for her, I probably would not have survived.</span> <span id="s992">I’ll tell you why -- because I’m not that strong willed and I, oh I know, many times I just didn’t want to, like when I was in the munitions factory, I was tired and I was hungry and I was, I was half dead.</span> <span id="s993">So, I didn’t want to get up in the morning and these people, that they didn’t get up in the morning, they were left in the barracks when we worked.</span> <span id="s994">You never saw them again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked.</span> <span id="s995">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s996">They probably just did away with them.</span> <span id="s997">So, I would want to do that and she would lift me up and she shook me in the morning.</span> <span id="s998">She dragged me out, but it was cold, you see where we were in Germany it was very cold and, here, you know, we had these wooden shoes and the one dress.</span> <span id="s999">So, she would drag me out to stay there for an hour, you know, and she would encourage me, she would give me, you know half a slice of her half slice of bread so that I should just go on, go on.</span> <span id="s1000">She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I could not work so hard, she just --- But, in the end, I remember in the end, you know, she said she’s not going to leave me here alone.</span> <span id="s1001">She would get angry at me, she would get angry at me because I say, “I’m going to die”.</span> <span id="s1002">You know, to her it was a threat.</span> <span id="s1003">To me it was real, mentally, with me In think my mental stage gave up so ---you know, I don’t care anymore, so if not for her I probably wouldn’t be sitting here and talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: On the tape, do you talk about her quite a bit and where you went, did you always stay together through the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Did she also survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1008">In the end, I don’t know if I put that on the tape.</span> <span id="s1009">When they brought us to Bergen Belsen, she was the first one to get sick because when we got to Bergen Belsen was when (tape ended) (Beginning of tape 2) Let me ask you about your smallest brother, about your youngest brother.</span> <span id="s1010">Now, let’s see you said your, that was Efram, Efram?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Do you remember when he was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Well, matter of fact, I do remember when he was born, I was a little girl myself.</span> <span id="s1014">But, it was like, we were already six, but there was sort of an excitement when he was born.</span> <span id="s1015">You know, being that he was the youngest, all the kids sort of felt that he was their little toy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Right, he was the little baby, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: So everybody was involved with him, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: So, now you said he was born six years after you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: After me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: So that would have been about 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1022">No, ’36, wait a minute, I was born in ’28.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: So six years later would have been ’34.</span> <span id="s1024">If you were born in ’28, six years would have been ’34 because ---</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Do you remember his birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: No, no,</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: no, okay.</span> <span id="s1029">Had he started school yet in 1939?</span> <span id="s1030">Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, because we were under the Hungarians, you know, he used to come into the cheder and just, sometimes, annoy, they would throw him out of the room.</span> <span id="s1032">But, you know, most of the time they would keep him there.</span> <span id="s1033">Sometimes he would be good and sometimes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Was he mischievous as a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: He was a little, yeah, he was a spoiled little kid because the kid it wasn’t so much that my mother and father had that much time for him, but, you know, he was like the kid’s toy.</span> <span id="s1036">He was a loving little kid, so everybody picked him up and hugged him and I think that’s what made him so loving because he had so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Did he have any special chores when he was younger, did he have to do things before the farm was taken away, or the livestock?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I don’t remember the specifics that they would give him something to do.</span> <span id="s1039">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Were there games he liked to play with you guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1042">Hide and seek, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s1043">He would like to hide and we would have to run after him, you know and find him.</span> <span id="s1044">You know, like a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: did he like to read too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: oh, he just had an aleph-beis book.</span> <span id="s1047">I remember it, and I’m telling you he would carry this book along and he wouldn’t show just anybody, he had to be your friend in order for him to show you that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: What kind of book was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Aleph-beis, it was like an A-B-C book, in Yiddish they called it an aleph-beis book, he called it the aleph-beis book, but it was the A-B-C book, A-B-C book, and he loved that book, he loved it, he carried it, he went to sleep with it, like who knows what.</span> <span id="s1050">But, you know to get to a book like that wasn’t so easy either in the war, so it’s ---so, it wasn’t like this book could be replaced so easily.</span> <span id="s1051">You know, for my children’s birthdays and my grandchildren’s birthdays I always, well for my children’s birthdays it was a trend, it was always a book.</span> <span id="s1052">But even for my grandchildren’s birthdays when they were little I always went and bought a few little books and send it to them for presents, I don’t know why, but this was, they knew when their birthday would come, they’ll get books from me, little books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Books are a good thing to give, they make you smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Well, I mean, you see, an American child does not understand that a European child, even a non-Jewish child was not that lucky to get this education.</span> <span id="s1055">A lot of people don’t, it was when I was raised, when I was raised, maybe now it’s different.</span> <span id="s1056">Probably it’s different, here it’s different too.</span> <span id="s1057">But, when I was raised a book was, or an education was scarce.</span> <span id="s1058">People didn’t have the money, and didn’t have the means.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Did your parents teach you, you said they were very educated in Jewish history and things like that, did they teach that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: They did, and they also used it.</span> <span id="s1061">If I think back, like let’s say I did something that they didn’t like, they would bring out a quote from the Bible, what’s wrong and what’s right.</span> <span id="s1062">Like they would tell me, you know, they would say God gave you that you can choose from right and wrong, now, do you think God would be happier with you if you choose the right or the wrong?</span> <span id="s1063">They didn’t understand that me as a child could not, many times, understand what I’m doing wrong.</span> <span id="s1064">And it’s not that I did such terrible wrong, you know, maybe I didn’t like something that they told me to do and I didn’t want to do it, you know ---so, what I’m trying to say is that they used their education sort of raising us.</span> <span id="s1065">There was never physical, I don’t ever remember, even when we were seven kids, there was never physical, you know, abuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Punishment or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No, no, there was no physical punishment but there was a lot of Bible quoting, we had to do the right thing.</span> <span id="s1068">Children don’t always know the right thing, and children sometimes they want to laugh, and sometimes they want to fight, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Well, I think I know your brother’s story with your mother, so I think that’s all the questions I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: I think we’re done, thank you very much for speaking with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Well, you’re very welcome Tony and it was really a pleasure meeting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Well thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
