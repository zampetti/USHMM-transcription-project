Kentucky.</span> <span id="s4">And my name is Arwen Donahue and we’re going to be conducting an interview today about… well, we’ll see how far we get.</span> <span id="s5">We’re going to start with the birth and move on from there.</span> <span id="s6">And I just wanted to note for those who are listening to this tape, that there was an interview done with Mrs. Szekely by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation in 1996 and we may be repeating some things that were discussed in that interview, but there may be some things that were discussed in that interview that we won’t talk about today.</span> <span id="s7">So, Mrs. Szekely, why don’t we start with you telling me your name at birth and your date of birth and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in Hungary, Budapest, in 1920, 16th of February, in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Klugman.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Klugman.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Klugman.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: K L U G M A N?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yeah, and in Russia they are writing, my cousin is Klegman, because “u” in Russia is “e”.</span> <span id="s15">So he’s writing a “u”, but he’s calling himself Klegman.</span> <span id="s16">But it is Klugman.</span> <span id="s17">Klugman, you know what this means in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: German, Klug is “smart”, man.</span> <span id="s20">[Laughing] That’s the name.</span> <span id="s21">He was a smart man.</span> <span id="s22">I showed you their pictures.</span> <span id="s23">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My parents’ pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Now was your father, you mentioned in the other interview that your father was Russian.</span> <span id="s27">Did he have… of German extraction?</span> <span id="s28">Or, what was his…</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: The name is Klugman from Russia and there are a lot of Klugmans there.</span> <span id="s30">So I don’t know how it came, where it, how, but he was born in Kiev.</span> <span id="s31">And his family was in Kiev until the First World War… Second World War.</span> <span id="s32">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s33">Then they had to run, because the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s34">Whoever was left from the family.</span> <span id="s35">He had two sisters and a brother there.</span> <span id="s36">The other brother was already on the front.</span> <span id="s37">And they had to run.</span> <span id="s38">So I never knew about it.</span> <span id="s39">A cousin who came five years ago to America, the painter, he was telling me the whole story.</span> <span id="s40">Why and how they had to run.</span> <span id="s41">And they went past Odessa and they lived in a small village in a house, he said, what didn’t have floor.</span> <span id="s42">It was nothing, just dust on the floor.</span> <span id="s43">And they managed to escape, but they had very, very hard times.</span> <span id="s44">His parents were alive that time, but the father and the mother, they all died.</span> <span id="s45">Actually they say that it was from hunger they died, but I don’t know actually what was the reason they died, because they had very, very hard times.</span> <span id="s46">And after that my cousin, who had his mother… no, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s47">The cousin, he has a sister, who is very, very sick.</span> <span id="s48">She’s here too, in Boston.</span> <span id="s49">And him and the sister and the husband, and she had a daughter the same age as George is and a son, they settled down in Odessa.</span> <span id="s50">So, when the doors were opening here that the Russians can come, he didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s51">He was just writing me, “Save my daughter,” who lived in Moscow and had two little children.</span> <span id="s52">I told you that story.</span> <span id="s53">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: She had two little, beautiful daughters and her husband was Jewish.</span> <span id="s56">And she was a half-Jew, because her mother wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s57">And the mother was a practicing Russian Orthodox, so she, I think she brainwashed her.</span> <span id="s58">But she’s supposed to come to America, too.</span> <span id="s59">She was on the quota, too.</span> <span id="s60">In fact, they are still bothering me that, “Where is she?”</span> <span id="s61">I says, “Many times, I’ve told you that she won’t come, never.</span> <span id="s62">Please cross her off because she is taking somebody’s place.”</span> <span id="s63">They lived with the husband’s mother, whose husband died, he was injured in the war.</span> <span id="s64">I don’t know, I think he lost his leg.</span> <span id="s65">He went underground with the Russians.</span> <span id="s66">I don’t know that whole story, but I know that they had an apartment in Moscow and the son lived with the mother.</span> <span id="s67">He went to school in Moscow and he is an engineer.</span> <span id="s68">She, he met my cousin in school, who went for engineering, too.</span> <span id="s69">Civil engineers.</span> <span id="s70">They met there and he knew that she’s half-Jew, but she promised him everything, everything what you want.</span> <span id="s71">If they are going to have children they are going to be brought up as Jews.</span> <span id="s72">And then she hated Communism, she just couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s73">I didn’t know why, but when I found out it was too late already.</span> <span id="s74">Because she couldn’t go to church.</span> <span id="s75">So they came to America.</span> <span id="s76">The first Hanukkah, the television came here to our house and took pictures from them, because they were here for the first Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s77">So they are here, they were here for six years.</span> <span id="s78">Now it was my husband’s, my son’s birthday, November 20th, they came six years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So they came to Lexington?</span> <span id="s80">Or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: They came to Lexington.</span> <span id="s82">I was fighting for them that they should come here, because I didn’t have… only parents should bring children.</span> <span id="s83">But the mother had a brother in Brooklyn and the brother wanted them to go to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s84">And I got his name and I spoke to him and I said, “Look, I know that you love your sister, but the children, they would be much, much better off here in Lexington to bring up children.”</span> <span id="s85">Finally he gave in and the Federation did it for me.</span> <span id="s86">They brought them here.</span> <span id="s87">They were waiting for them with a three-bedroom apartment, because the two mothers should come after them.</span> <span id="s88">So, they had a three-bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s89">And the television was on the airport, when the first families came.</span> <span id="s90">It was a big deal.</span> <span id="s91">And Ana was out of her mind that she will have some relatives…</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Ana is your granddaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Ana is the youngest.</span> <span id="s94">And there were two, young children, beautiful two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Can you say… before you go on, just, can you say how they’re related to you?</span> <span id="s96">And what their names are?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: My cousins…</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: My cousin’s daughter, my first cousin, my father’s brother’s daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s101">And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Galina.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Galina…?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Galina Bashikis (ph).</span> <span id="s105">Bashikis.</span> <span id="s106">My son, by coincidence got him a job with the Gray Construction Company, because she had a student, he had a student in one of the schools, who was his student and then she became a teacher.</span> <span id="s107">And he went back with his children there.</span> <span id="s108">He goes always, one semester he takes his class to schools and they are… Adopt a School, that’s the name of it.</span> <span id="s109">And they are teaching there, but they are just students, not graduate students and he’s observing them before they make their lesson plans and they have to show it to him.</span> <span id="s110">And he’s running from class to class.</span> <span id="s111">And one day, she came to that school and she said, “Does anybody know somebody who has connections to a construction company?”</span> <span id="s112">And that teacher, he says, “My fiancé,” one of the Grays’ son.</span> <span id="s113">He says, “My fiancé.”</span> <span id="s114">So, from that time on they hired him, and he’s a person who, he didn’t mind what kind of job they gave him.</span> <span id="s115">He did very hard job.</span> <span id="s116">And he loves the construction.</span> <span id="s117">He loves to see.</span> <span id="s118">He was in, I don’t know how many buildings he builded.</span> <span id="s119">He was already a big shot there.</span> <span id="s120">When they got their visa to come to America.</span> <span id="s121">And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow.</span> <span id="s122">In the middle of Moscow the apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s123">And they would have a beautiful apartment there.</span> <span id="s124">And the visa was starting to expire, so my cousin said, “It is not worth, what is thousands of thousands dollars that apartment.</span> <span id="s125">It doesn’t worth, you have to go.”</span> <span id="s126">He was in Odessa, but he helped them.</span> <span id="s127">He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and they came.</span> <span id="s128">And she was very happy.</span> <span id="s129">And when she got to the apartment she couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s130">You know, they lived in two small rooms there, so many people, four.</span> <span id="s131">I mean two children and the couple and the grandmother.</span> <span id="s132">And she was very happy.</span> <span id="s133">One day… she sent, before she came, she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name, because she didn’t know where to send it and they were all Russian books.</span> <span id="s134">And I said, “That woman is crazy.</span> <span id="s135">She needs American books.</span> <span id="s136">Why is she sending the Russian books?”</span> <span id="s137">But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever.</span> <span id="s138">The children, the big one… the little one didn’t go to school yet, but the big one went to school, to the same school where my husband got the job from the teacher.</span> <span id="s139">It was in their neighborhood.</span> <span id="s140">And she spoke beautiful English already and she had… when the grandmother came the following year in January, his mother came.</span> <span id="s141">She didn’t come, the other one.</span> <span id="s142">And she was helping her and she was translating and answering the telephone.</span> <span id="s143">And then I started to see it.</span> <span id="s144">I started to invite them for holidays, and she came.</span> <span id="s145">She sat at the table five minutes and after five minutes she excused herself and went to the porch to play with the children.</span> <span id="s146">I didn’t think about nothing, about it.</span> <span id="s147">I says, “It’s a little strange, but okay if she wants it.”</span> <span id="s148">When it come the second year, she said, “I love you, but please don’t invite us for the holidays.”</span> <span id="s149">Still I didn’t think it was something wrong there.</span> <span id="s150">Then she met a couple, I still don’t know who they are, a Christian couple, who went every week to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s151">And she got very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s152">And she went with the two children and the reason was, because she went for his American degree, what he got, no problem.</span> <span id="s153">He got his American degree, but when the children are home, he cannot study.</span> <span id="s154">And we go there.</span> <span id="s155">It’s more things to do there.</span> <span id="s156">We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s157">One day they come home, it was probably a year later and the father is asking them, “How was the zoo?”</span> <span id="s158">And the big one said, “What kind of zoo?”</span> <span id="s159">He says, “You didn’t go to the zoo?”</span> <span id="s160">She says.</span> <span id="s161">“No, we went to the church.”</span> <span id="s162">So he got very upset that she does it behind his back.</span> <span id="s163">Very, very upset.</span> <span id="s164">And I don’t know whether they knew it… he was married eleven years, but they knew each other five years already from the school.</span> <span id="s165">And I don’t know the situation, because the grandmother was there with them.</span> <span id="s166">But he was traveling a lot.</span> <span id="s167">The company was sending him constantly, because they mostly work outside from Lexington.</span> <span id="s168">They build big, big factories, not housing.</span> <span id="s169">And he was always sent out.</span> <span id="s170">One, two years after they were here, she says, “I want to go home for the summer, to visit my mother.”</span> <span id="s171">I says, “Isn’t it easier to bring your mother here?”</span> <span id="s172">She says, “No, my mother wouldn’t like it here.”</span> <span id="s173">She packed.</span> <span id="s174">And she liked me.</span> <span id="s175">She was working in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she was an engineer and she went for courses to… computer courses to the community college.</span> <span id="s176">But that job, cleaning job, she took at night, that she should be with the children during the day.</span> <span id="s177">What was the job?</span> <span id="s178">She was calling me on the phone constantly for hours.</span> <span id="s179">She says, “I am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices…” and she says, “It’s… in an hour I am ready.”</span> <span id="s180">Perfect.</span> <span id="s181">Salary was perfect, everything was perfect.</span> <span id="s182">Two years, right two years after in the summer, it was August.</span> <span id="s183">And sometimes I was taking her, I was driving her to work.</span> <span id="s184">They didn’t live close here, but I picked her up.</span> <span id="s185">They lived in, it’s Heritage Village, near Henry Clay High School.</span> <span id="s186">That’s where all the Russians lived at that time.</span> <span id="s187">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s188">I picked her up and I took her to work.</span> <span id="s189">And she says, “I want to tell you something, because I love you.</span> <span id="s190">But you must swear that you won’t tell it to Mischa.”</span> <span id="s191">Mischa, Michael is her husband.</span> <span id="s192">I thought, “My God what it could be that I cannot tell it to him?”</span> <span id="s193">So, I says, “Okay, I swear.”</span> <span id="s194">And I am driving.</span> <span id="s195">I almost made an accident what I heard.</span> <span id="s196">She says, “I’m not coming back.</span> <span id="s197">I took a ticket, round trip, but I’m not coming back.</span> <span id="s198">I don’t want my children to be brought up here.</span> <span id="s199">I want them to be brought up as Russians,” and it meant… because she never mentioned Jew.</span> <span id="s200">She mentioned Americans and Russians.</span> <span id="s201">I says, “You are talking about Americans as Jews and Russians,” right away I knew, “…as the Russian Orthodox Church?”</span> <span id="s202">She says, “No, no.</span> <span id="s203">I don’t mean that.”</span> <span id="s204">I says, “Yes you mean it.</span> <span id="s205">You mean it.”</span> <span id="s206">The husband was… I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s207">And he came home, and it was the little one’s birthday.</span> <span id="s208">And she made a birthday party and I was there.</span> <span id="s209">And they’re supposed to leave the following day to New York.</span> <span id="s210">And the father, who lived in Boston, was visiting… we have a summer home in the country, in the Catskills and he was with my son there.</span> <span id="s211">And he’s supposed to go to the airport, help her to go to the airport in New York.</span> <span id="s212">So, I said to myself, I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s213">I says, “Why are you doing it?</span> <span id="s214">How can you look in your husband’s eye and pack?”</span> <span id="s215">I don’t know, everything she took, what she could.</span> <span id="s216">Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone of them and they were little kids.</span> <span id="s217">She says, “If he would be better to me…” I says, “Better?</span> <span id="s218">He lives for you.</span> <span id="s219">He’s such a father and working like unbelievable that you should have everything.</span> <span id="s220">And you say better?”</span> <span id="s221">Better was that he didn’t let them go to church.</span> <span id="s222">That was the worst.</span> <span id="s223">And she told it in the hospital that if I don’t come back, because my husband is bad to me.</span> <span id="s224">So, what shall I do?</span> <span id="s225">I swore.</span> <span id="s226">I cannot tell it to Mischa.</span> <span id="s227">I called my cousin in the country.</span> <span id="s228">I says, “Look, I swore that I don’t tell it to Mischa, but I didn’t swear that I’m not telling it to you.</span> <span id="s229">Your daughter won’t come back.</span> <span id="s230">Please don’t help her to go on that plane.</span> <span id="s231">At least the children should be saved and taken away, because she kidnapped them.”</span> <span id="s232">She said, “That’s… it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s233">It’s impossible.”</span> <span id="s234">And when she didn’t come back after a month, she went for a month, and I said, I told it to Mischa.</span> <span id="s235">She says, “I don’t believe you.</span> <span id="s236">She’s the most honest woman in the world.</span> <span id="s237">If you would tell it to me right at that time, I wouldn’t believe you, that she is doing it to me.”</span> <span id="s238">And she did it.</span> <span id="s239">She kidnapped the two kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Tell me, Mischa was the one who’s actually related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No.</span> <span id="s242">She.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: She’s the one who’s actually related to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: She is my cousin’s.</span> <span id="s245">But I am… they have no one here.</span> <span id="s246">He has a brother, he’s in Australia.</span> <span id="s247">And he is here now with his mother.</span> <span id="s248">He doesn’t want to hear about it, to get married, because he lives for his children.</span> <span id="s249">I says, “Mischa, you are a smart man.</span> <span id="s250">You lost your children.”</span> <span id="s251">Every week, he is calling them on the phone.</span> <span id="s252">And two years ago, she let them come here for a month.</span> <span id="s253">They came alone by plane.</span> <span id="s254">And she came the last two weeks, because my cousin was begging her from Boston, that “Maybe I see you the last time.</span> <span id="s255">I am in not a good condition and please come.”</span> <span id="s256">She came.</span> <span id="s257">Before they came, he bought a house.</span> <span id="s258">They lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s259">They bought the house, that the children should have separated rooms.</span> <span id="s260">It’s a three-bedroom house near Man O’War.</span> <span id="s261">A new house.</span> <span id="s262">He makes nice money, so he could, he got the mortgage.</span> <span id="s263">And the children they have their rooms and they have their beds there what I bought them that time.</span> <span id="s264">The mattresses were brand new.</span> <span id="s265">And they have their… and even today, it’s they name on the door.</span> <span id="s266">They put they name on the door.</span> <span id="s267">What… where do they have it in Moscow?</span> <span id="s268">They have two bathrooms.</span> <span id="s269">They give one to the children.</span> <span id="s270">And they live like princesses here.</span> <span id="s271">They loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions, so I can make sure I’m understanding.</span> <span id="s273">She converted… did she convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: She wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: She was raised as a Russian…</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: She was raised nothing, because it was Communism.</span> <span id="s277">She couldn’t be raised with religion.</span> <span id="s278">But when Gorbachev took over they were allowed to go to the church.</span> <span id="s279">And when she saw it, she already didn’t want to come to America.</span> <span id="s280">She was the one who broke, broke, completely broke off the family.</span> <span id="s281">She wanted to come.</span> <span id="s282">She was the one.</span> <span id="s283">And she was telling me that she thought that she wouldn’t come anymore, but she said, “That’s not the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s284">That’s not an honest thing to do, that I started it and I should let them go.”</span> <span id="s285">But that was an honest thing what she did.</span> <span id="s286">You know?</span> <span id="s287">She wanted it.</span> <span id="s288">She wanted to come because of the church, because she couldn’t go to church there.</span> <span id="s289">They have here a Greek Orthodox, but that’s not good for her.</span> <span id="s290">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Let’s rewind a little bit.</span> <span id="s292">We started getting onto this because you were talking about your family that was in Russia.</span> <span id="s293">And you didn’t know any of that family other than your father’s brother?</span> <span id="s294">During the war or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No, I knew before the war about the whole family, because when my father was alive they corresponded constantly.</span> <span id="s296">And we, from Czechoslovakia, because I was brought up in Czechoslovakia, we sent them food.</span> <span id="s297">So, I knew they exist.</span> <span id="s298">And I remember when my grandmother died, my father’s mother, because I remember how he was crying.</span> <span id="s299">I was about, I don’t know, eight years old.</span> <span id="s300">And I remember when she died.</span> <span id="s301">I don’t remember when the father died.</span> <span id="s302">And I knew about him very well, because he speaks… no.</span> <span id="s303">Then my uncle was writing him constantly…</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Your uncle was writing who?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Writing to him.</span> <span id="s306">My uncle was my father’s brother, to whom I wanted to come to America.</span> <span id="s307">He was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s308">And he came with the last ship in 1940 to America.</span> <span id="s309">And then he was writing him.</span> <span id="s310">And after 50 years, 50 years, he went back to visit.</span> <span id="s311">And he was telling me about…</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: I’m sorry, but you’re talking about… he was writing to whom?</span> <span id="s313">To his father?</span> <span id="s314">When you said your uncle was writing to him, who was he writing to?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: To Izzy, his name is Izzy, my cousin who is the painter.</span> <span id="s316">He was writing to him and then he went to visit.</span> <span id="s317">And he had two sisters, two sisters alive at the time and him, who was the nephew.</span> <span id="s318">He was alive.</span> <span id="s319">So, after 50 years.</span> <span id="s320">He went back twice, because he went alone and then he took his wife one year.</span> <span id="s321">And so, I knew everything about him.</span> <span id="s322">And I knew that he was a big artist there, but he worked for the state, Communism.</span> <span id="s323">They always had work, but they had to do what they told them to do.</span> <span id="s324">So, he was a real artist and then he had a little studio separate from the house.</span> <span id="s325">And he painted what he wanted, because his dream… he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint Odessa as he knew it once.</span> <span id="s326">And he did it.</span> <span id="s327">They didn’t know about it, because he did the commercials for everything, for the ships and for operas and everything.</span> <span id="s328">His name was everywhere because he did the commercials.</span> <span id="s329">So, I knew about him.</span> <span id="s330">Now, when my uncle died in 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one else.</span> <span id="s331">And I started to write Russian, but it was very hard for me, because I never spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s332">But I wrote Russian and I understood Russian.</span> <span id="s333">So, with the dictionary, I wrote him Russian.</span> <span id="s334">And one day, he said, “Don’t struggle, I speak English.”</span> <span id="s335">And from then on, I was sending him English letters.</span> <span id="s336">And then he had an exhibition in Moscow and he was narrating it in English.</span> <span id="s337">And he sent us the tape.</span> <span id="s338">And we couldn’t use the tape here.</span> <span id="s339">I had to take it to downtown.</span> <span id="s340">I don’t know what’s the name of the place.</span> <span id="s341">Anyway, where they re-did it.</span> <span id="s342">It was a beautiful… I gave it to him when he came.</span> <span id="s343">I gave it back to him.</span> <span id="s344">I says, “I have you, and I have your paintings, and you should have that tape.”</span> <span id="s345">And I read in the Hadassah paper, last month, that his paintings are still… somebody, you know they have articles about the world, travelers and it was from Odessa and they mentioned his name, that his paintings are still there, but he’s not there anymore.</span> <span id="s346">So, that was my Russian family.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay, tell me your father’s full name and…</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Mikhail, he was Michael, Mikhail Klugman, because we never knew Klegman.</span> <span id="s349">Klugman.</span> <span id="s350">Mikhail Klugman.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: And tell how he came to leave Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: He was from First World War… it is not on the tape?</span> <span id="s353">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: It is, but I have more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: In First World War there were two brothers.</span> <span id="s356">The older brother was already in the war in 1914, before….1914, yeah.</span> <span id="s357">And he was a pharmacist, too.</span> <span id="s358">Both of them were pharmacists.</span> <span id="s359">And he was captured and they didn’t know about him, where is he.</span> <span id="s360">And one day, when my father was called in and he was captured in Prague and they took him behind the frontier to a pharmacy and there he meets his brother.</span> <span id="s361">And he met his brother and they never separated.</span> <span id="s362">They didn’t want to go back after the war because there were the biggest pogroms in Kiev and they didn’t want to go back there.</span> <span id="s363">And it was an international agreement that they can stay in the countries where they were captured.</span> <span id="s364">Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire.</span> <span id="s365">So, after a while when they were there, they took them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of them, together.</span> <span id="s366">I have, I think there’s a picture there, too, about them in Russia uniforms.</span> <span id="s367">They took them to Hungary and under the war my mother was working there in the office, in that place.</span> <span id="s368">And that’s how they met and fell in love.</span> <span id="s369">And my mother’s family was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s370">Nothing against him, it was nothing against him, but they were very worried that he’s a Russian citizen, what’s going to be?</span> <span id="s371">From then on, I think it’s there.</span> <span id="s372">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: First actually, can you say what your father’s brother’s name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Jacob Klugman.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And so they are living nearby one another and they ended up in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes, because they had to, because it was Communism in 1919 in Hungary for a little while only and they said that no matter what, every Russian is a Communist, Jew or non-Jew.</span> <span id="s378">And they put – oh I have a picture here.</span> <span id="s379">It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s380">They made a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s381">They builded near Russia… near Budapest and they put all the Russians there.</span> <span id="s382">My mother was married in 1919, the beginning of 1919.</span> <span id="s383">And they put them there.</span> <span id="s384">They didn’t know what’s going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s385">My uncle was there.</span> <span id="s386">He wasn’t married.</span> <span id="s387">My mother had a cousin, who was a lawyer and he came there one day.</span> <span id="s388">It was already May, middle of 1919, because she was pregnant with me.</span> <span id="s389">By the way, she got pregnant.</span> <span id="s390">She was pregnant with me.</span> <span id="s391">And she said, he said, “You can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come back to Hungary.”</span> <span id="s392">So, my mother, who was Hungarian, she had to sign that she never comes back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s393">It was easy to sign it for my father and my uncle, but they had to sign it.</span> <span id="s394">So, where should they go?</span> <span id="s395">In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was, the Czech map is Czech, Moravia, Slovakia, Carpathan.</span> <span id="s396">The Carpathan part, what was Hungary, after the war, the Czechs got it.</span> <span id="s397">My mother had a second cousin there and when she heard about it, what happened, she says, “Come to us.”</span> <span id="s398">They were well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s399">“Come to us.”</span> <span id="s400">So, they went there to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s401">It was at that time Czechoslovakia in 1920.</span> <span id="s402">When it came to me, to give birth, my mother got permission through that lawyer to go home and I was born in my grandmother’s house, but they didn’t have an apartment.</span> <span id="s403">They did have… they lived with those relatives, so they left me there with my grandmother and my mother’s sisters.</span> <span id="s404">She had three sisters.</span> <span id="s405">One of them was married, two were not married and a brother, who was never married.</span> <span id="s406">He was a bachelor.</span> <span id="s407">Because my grandmother was a widow when she was 34 years old, and she had five children.</span> <span id="s408">The son took over and he was working for the family.</span> <span id="s409">And that’s why he never got married, until the sisters got married and whatever.</span> <span id="s410">He was already 50 years old and he didn’t get married.</span> <span id="s411">So we lived there and 22 months after I was born, my mother was again – she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s412">She gave birth to my sister.</span> <span id="s413">The same thing happened.</span> <span id="s414">She went home with special papers and she was born there in my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s415">By that time they had already an apartment and they took me together with my little sister back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s416">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s418">What was your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Anna.</span> <span id="s420">But she was two “n’s” and she didn’t want two “n”.</span> <span id="s421">My daughter-in-law, she didn’t want two “n”.</span> <span id="s422">Not because of my sister, but she had a grandmother, whom she didn’t like, and she was Anna.</span> <span id="s423">So, that’s why she’s with one “n”, Ana, but she’s named after my sister.</span> <span id="s424">And the big one, Ilona.</span> <span id="s425">That’s a real Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s426">She’s named after my mother’s youngest sister, who saved my life.</span> <span id="s427">That’s in there, I think.</span> <span id="s428">So, Ilona is named after her.</span> <span id="s429">And Jacob, the boy is named after my uncle, who was in America.</span> <span id="s430">But she has an uncle, too, my daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s431">And she didn’t want him to be named Jacob, because she didn’t like – she doesn’t like her family.</span> <span id="s432">That’s the trouble here.</span> <span id="s433">She doesn’t like her mother.</span> <span id="s434">She never got along with the mother.</span> <span id="s435">That’s the big trouble and that’s why she cannot get along with me because she doesn’t want to hear mother.</span> <span id="s436">Only she’s the mother.</span> <span id="s437">And that’s the problem.</span> <span id="s438">So.</span> <span id="s439">But we manage to give his, the name Jacob, because she liked my uncle.</span> <span id="s440">She knew him and she liked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Tell me about your early childhood, and your earliest memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: I remember from kindergarten on.</span> <span id="s443">I went right away to Czech school.</span> <span id="s444">Kindergarten, elementary school, gymnasium.</span> <span id="s445">I wanted to be a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s446">And they had two kind of… my father wanted one of us, at least, to be a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s447">And we had two kinds of gymnasiums, very strict schools in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s448">All the professors were from Prague.</span> <span id="s449">And there were two kinds, one where you had to learn Latin, because every prescription was Latin and if you wanted to be a doctor or pharmacist you had to go to that gymnasium.</span> <span id="s450">So I went to… both of us went.</span> <span id="s451">I don’t even know what she wanted to be, because she was unbelievable smart, much smarter than I was.</span> <span id="s452">She was always worried about me, my sister, because it was only 22 months between us.</span> <span id="s453">And when I went to first class, I got whooping cough for six months.</span> <span id="s454">So I had to repeat the first class, so we were always together.</span> <span id="s455">We sat together.</span> <span id="s456">Here they don’t let you do it.</span> <span id="s457">We were always together and everybody thought that we were… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s458">Because we were dressed the same and they thought that we are twins, but we weren’t because it was 22 months between us.</span> <span id="s459">But we were together always in school.</span> <span id="s460">But she was a worrier always about me.</span> <span id="s461">I remember when she woke me up in the morning and let me repeat the lesson plan, lesson, what we had to do, you know.</span> <span id="s462">She was always worried about me.</span> <span id="s463">I was a good student, but to her it came very easy.</span> <span id="s464">To me, I had to work for it.</span> <span id="s465">And it was a very, very close family.</span> <span id="s466">I just, I cannot, cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s467">When they met, my father and mother on the street it was always like, you know, they were married yesterday.</span> <span id="s468">Very, very close.</span> <span id="s469">My mother was like a friend to us.</span> <span id="s470">With everything you could go to my mother and ask everything what you wanted and you got the right answer.</span> <span id="s471">I was a very, very naïve girl, very naïve.</span> <span id="s472">And one girl was once telling me that if you kiss somebody you can get pregnant, that kind of a business.</span> <span id="s473">So I always went to my mother.</span> <span id="s474">I says, “Is it true?”</span> <span id="s475">I don’t know what grade was it.</span> <span id="s476">But with everything…when I went on a date and I came home, I went to their bedroom, I sat on the bed and I told them everything what happened.</span> <span id="s477">That kind of a close family we were.</span> <span id="s478">And that’s why I cannot understand today’s generation, because it was so different.</span> <span id="s479">When I said to my granddaughter that I went for, for four years I had a boyfriend, a boy friend, friend, nothing happened between us.</span> <span id="s480">And for one year, for one year, he didn’t even kiss me, because he said he’s very afraid that if he’s going to kiss me, I’m going to leave him, because of my personality.</span> <span id="s481">He was an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he left a very wealthy girl because of me.</span> <span id="s482">He loved me very much, but I was so naïve that I didn’t think that I love him.</span> <span id="s483">But it was a beautiful, wonderful feeling that every week he came.</span> <span id="s484">We met twice a week, Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s485">Every week he came and his hands were behind his back and he brought me – because he knew I loved the… what are the little blue flowers?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Forget-me-nots?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Forget-me-nots?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: They are not forget me… anyway…</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Violets?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Violets.</span> <span id="s492">Winter, summer, always, always when he came, he had the violets.</span> <span id="s493">And it was a wonderful feeling to know that you have someone to go out with to the movies.</span> <span id="s494">We had five o’clock teas there.</span> <span id="s495">It was a very nice place where young people got together.</span> <span id="s496">And then he started to be called to the Army.</span> <span id="s497">And when he was called to the Army he was somewhere always close, so he eloped.</span> <span id="s498">He came home to see me on the weekends.</span> <span id="s499">And everybody was telling me that he’s looking at me like he loves me.</span> <span id="s500">And I was just laughing.</span> <span id="s501">I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s502">I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s503">After four years when I met my husband and he was already somewhere in Russia, somewhere in labor camp, him.</span> <span id="s504">And he wrote me and I wrote him.</span> <span id="s505">And I wrote him that what happened with my family and I’m going to get married, because I need to change my name.</span> <span id="s506">And when I wrote that letter I thought I’d die.</span> <span id="s507">Then I knew that I loved him.</span> <span id="s508">That feeling, I never, never forget.</span> <span id="s509">Such a naïvete.</span> <span id="s510">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s511">Then I really…</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: And he died.</span> <span id="s514">He died in Russia.</span> <span id="s515">He was Nicholas.</span> <span id="s516">He was Nicholas, actually it was Nicolash (ph) in Hungary.</span> <span id="s517">So it’s Nicholas.</span> <span id="s518">They were a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s519">His father had a pawn shop.</span> <span id="s520">And he had a sister, who was teaching piano.</span> <span id="s521">And we never spoke about marriage because he always said, he spoke already English at that time.</span> <span id="s522">And one day, in 1938, the Hungarians took back that part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s523">So we were in trouble, but we children didn’t realize it that we are in trouble, only my parents.</span> <span id="s524">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s525">And then he said to me, one day when he came home, he says, “Come with me to Israel.”</span> <span id="s526">I looked at him.</span> <span id="s527">I says, “Without my parents?”</span> <span id="s528">And it was no Israel, young people went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s529">Maybe he would be alive, if he would gone.</span> <span id="s530">He wouldn’t go without me.</span> <span id="s531">And I says, “I cannot go without my parents.”</span> <span id="s532">And he came back from some place.</span> <span id="s533">And we were always discussing other girls, and who is the cute girl, who is the nice girl.</span> <span id="s534">And one day, I was already married, when I heard that he engaged, a year later, he engaged a girl, whom we were discussing, that she is a nice girl.</span> <span id="s535">But they never got married, because he died in… they took him to Russia, that transport labor camp.</span> <span id="s536">And he died.</span> <span id="s537">And he was the only one who died from his family, because he had a brother who survived in England and his parents and sisters survived there in Uzhgorod where we lived.</span> <span id="s538">People were hiding them.</span> <span id="s539">He was the only one who died from the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: What was his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Gosh, I cannot believe it, that I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: That’s okay, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s543">How old were you when you started dating him?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So, you started dating him in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, when the Hungarians came in, yes.</span> <span id="s547">And 1941, until 1941.</span> <span id="s548">In 1941, I met my husband in Budapest and he was already… I don’t know which lagers.</span> <span id="s549">He was in labor camps, but they took them out from that part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s550">They took them out to Russia.</span> <span id="s551">In Hungary, they kept them in Hungary in labor camp.</span> <span id="s552">But that was part of, you know, that was __________ that time, they took, like over the border and they took them to camps.</span> <span id="s553">And when I wrote them that what happened, that I need another name.</span> <span id="s554">And he wrote me back a letter and he said, “If you would have told me, I would right away marry you.”</span> <span id="s555">And his friend was alive, very good friend and I met him once.</span> <span id="s556">And he said that for one day he disappeared in the woods and they thought he is committing suicide because of me.</span> <span id="s557">But then he came and they took him and all of them died.</span> <span id="s558">So, it was a terrible thing, terrible that I was so naïve, that I didn’t realize it that I am in love.</span> <span id="s559">Because I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s560">I, I… we just kissed, that’s it.</span> <span id="s561">And we wouldn’t, he wouldn’t dare to do nothing, because he said that, “Your personality is requiring such a…” –I cannot say it in English, that word.</span> <span id="s562">Respect.</span> <span id="s563">That he was afraid to kiss me for a year, because he thought that I am going to leave him if he is going to kiss me.</span> <span id="s564">I don’t know whether I would leave him, because I was very naïve, after.</span> <span id="s565">So it was like Plato… nobody believed us.</span> <span id="s566">Because they said when we went to the movies and we were like four couples together and they said, “He doesn’t look at the movies, he’s just looking at you.”</span> <span id="s567">It’s an unbelievable thing, and when I am telling it to my grand-daughter, she’s laughing, “Grandma, those are the nineties.”</span> <span id="s568">You know?</span> <span id="s569">It took me a long, long time to realize that my granddaughter were not seven years with his boyfriend and nothing happened between them.</span> <span id="s570">I just… I couldn’t imagine that something could happen… you know?</span> <span id="s571">I trusted her, because I was that way, so I thought, always I thought that Ilona is ours, from our family.</span> <span id="s572">And my husband always said to me, “No matter what, you always can count on Ilona.”</span> <span id="s573">He was always telling me that.</span> <span id="s574">And if you leave something for the children, he said, “Jacob is a boy, he will always make it.</span> <span id="s575">Leave more for Ilona.”</span> <span id="s576">That’s what he always said.</span> <span id="s577">He was mistaken, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Tell me, let’s go back a little bit again.</span> <span id="s579">You mentioned that you had wanted to be a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s580">Did your parents support that?</span> <span id="s581">Were they supportive of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yes, but I couldn’t, in ‘38 it was finished.</span> <span id="s583">I couldn’t go anymore to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Was it unusual at the time, for a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s586">It was unusual, I knew one only, in the city, who was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s587">But the Czech girls, I don’t know what for, they took Latin.</span> <span id="s588">We had all the Czech girls in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s589">And that was only… why would they take Latin?</span> <span id="s590">Only if they wanted to be doctors or pharmacists.</span> <span id="s591">But we didn’t get so far, that’s it.</span> <span id="s592">And I never knew what my sister, she still went one year to school when I was already in Budapest.</span> <span id="s593">Your back hurt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: I’m okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: So, I just really don’t know.</span> <span id="s596">I never, I don’t know what she wanted to be.</span> <span id="s597">It’s so interesting.</span> <span id="s598">I know she was 22 years younger, 22 months, and it was very hard to me, like, to go for my first ball.</span> <span id="s599">It was the medical students’ ball.</span> <span id="s600">And at that time he was already in the Army and one medical student, who went in Prague to school, to medical school.</span> <span id="s601">They didn’t have medical school there, now they have medical school there.</span> <span id="s602">And he was a short fellow and he knew that I am going out with that boy, but he was in the Army, so he took me.</span> <span id="s603">He came home for vacation and he took me to the Medical Ball.</span> <span id="s604">I would never forget that occasion, because it was chaperoned.</span> <span id="s605">My mother was there and it was winter and we went on the sled with horses, you know, that kind of it.</span> <span id="s606">I would never forget it.</span> <span id="s607">And my aunt from Budapest… every year, every summer we went to Budapest, my mother’s family, and they always dressed us up, the children.</span> <span id="s608">I remember that she gave me-- it was hers, but it fit me beautifully-- a light blue, long, velvet evening gown.</span> <span id="s609">And it was open, but it has a pearlerie (ph) what I could take off.</span> <span id="s610">I will never forget that day.</span> <span id="s611">And he never, he didn’t let me dance with no one else.</span> <span id="s612">Other boys wanted to… no.</span> <span id="s613">The whole night he was dancing with me.</span> <span id="s614">It’s a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s615">He became a pediatrician in Prague.</span> <span id="s616">And he went, I think that he went to German college.</span> <span id="s617">They had two colleges, Czech and German, he or the other one, the dermatologist went… one of them.</span> <span id="s618">The dermatologist, I had nothing to do with, because just my friend was marrying him and I know that he went to German college.</span> <span id="s619">But he went, I didn’t know whether he is alive or not.</span> <span id="s620">And when we came to Brooklyn, because that’s where we came, to my uncle.</span> <span id="s621">And one day I am walking on a street and I see a millinery shop, we had it in Hungary and I see the name.</span> <span id="s622">And I went in, and it was, because she had one in Uzhgorod in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s623">Can I hold it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: No, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: And she, that was his sister.</span> <span id="s626">And she says, “My God, you are alive.</span> <span id="s627">He’s not married.</span> <span id="s628">You are married?”</span> <span id="s629">I said, “Yes, I am married.”</span> <span id="s630">And he came to visit his sister from Prague and he wasn’t married.</span> <span id="s631">And he called me on the phone one day and I didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s632">My husband was very jealous and I wouldn’t even dare to invite him.</span> <span id="s633">But my husband was working and I spoke about an hour on the phone with him.</span> <span id="s634">And he was asking me, how I am doing and what I am doing and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s635">And then he went back and he married a German woman.</span> <span id="s636">I heard that he stayed in Germany, but he got divorced, too from that.</span> <span id="s637">First time he got married.</span> <span id="s638">But he was in love with me.</span> <span id="s639">And I knew that, that he was in love with me, but I would never like kiss him or something.</span> <span id="s640">No way.</span> <span id="s641">[Phone rings.]</span> <span id="s642">Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s643">If somebody knows me, they call me on my phone.</span> <span id="s644">Ana should be coming home.</span> <span id="s645">Maybe she is going, calling me.</span> <span id="s646">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: We have a little more time left on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So, can you tell me a little bit more about your early childhood?</span> <span id="s650">First of all, were you attending, was this a public school you were attending?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, public.</span> <span id="s652">We didn’t have private schools.</span> <span id="s653">It was very interesting under the Czechs.</span> <span id="s654">We had religion in the school.</span> <span id="s655">Every religion had their own religion.</span> <span id="s656">We had the rabbi coming in once or twice a week and the Christians had they priest.</span> <span id="s657">And the girls were sitting on his lap, the Czech girls, you know?</span> <span id="s658">On the priest’s lap.</span> <span id="s659">[Laughter.]</span> <span id="s660">Now, I know what it meant, but just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s661">After school we went to a German-speaking religious school and we learned more about religion.</span> <span id="s662">But it’s funny that I know my teacher’s name and I forgot what was, gosh, what was my boyfriend’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: You mean Nicholas?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I will remember it.</span> <span id="s665">No.</span> <span id="s666">The interesting thing is it was, what we learned, like praying, prayer, it was from my mother.</span> <span id="s667">My mother, she was forcing us, like every Friday night we had to pray and always even if we were crying that it’s too much, too much.</span> <span id="s668">It was hard.</span> <span id="s669">Every week, one more page.</span> <span id="s670">And actually we learned to pray from my mother, not in school.</span> <span id="s671">We learned about religion from that rabbi.</span> <span id="s672">We didn’t learn… we learned how to write, but that wasn’t Hebrew, that was like Yiddish.</span> <span id="s673">But the alphabet was the same and it was a time that they had there a paper, newspaper, a Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s674">And I could read it without punctuation.</span> <span id="s675">I have no idea about nothing, that’s why I never could go up to the Torah and read the Torah, because I have no idea.</span> <span id="s676">I have to learn, if I would want to read something, I would break my neck to learn it.</span> <span id="s677">You know?</span> <span id="s678">Because that’s without punctuation, the Torah.</span> <span id="s679">But otherwise I read fluently, but I don’t know what I’m reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: We spoke, first of all when they met, it was… my mother didn’t speak Russian, he didn’t speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s682">Both of them spoke German, so it was German.</span> <span id="s683">The starting was German, until my father learned Hungarian.</span> <span id="s684">And it was German for a long, long time, because we had two hours of gymnasium, every day two hours German.</span> <span id="s685">And the Czechs hated the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s686">My mother never learned Czech.</span> <span id="s687">She just spoke German and Hungarian, because my grandmother spoke German.</span> <span id="s688">When she was a little girl, she came from Slovakia where the part, where German lived and she spoke German.</span> <span id="s689">Not the Jewish, German.</span> <span id="s690">And when we went on the street and we were walking and we saw a professor coming from the school, because those are professors in gymnasium.</span> <span id="s691">It was like, what should I tell you?</span> <span id="s692">It was eight gymnasium, so it’s equal like four years college.</span> <span id="s693">Because after eight, elementary school and then it was a… plipravka (ph), between gymnasium and a year where we were preparing to go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s694">It was a year.</span> <span id="s695">So, and we saw some professor coming, so we right away started to pull my mother’s skirt.</span> <span id="s696">German, speaking German, that they shouldn’t know that we speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s697">Because they… we spoke so well Czech, that they didn’t believe that we are not Czechs.</span> <span id="s698">But then when they found out that we are not Czechs, but they didn’t know that we speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s699">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s700">So, we had to speak German on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: This must have gotten very confusing, just trying to…</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No, it wasn’t, when you are a child… and then when we were preparing to come to America.</span> <span id="s703">We were preparing after we heard what’s happening.</span> <span id="s704">My parents are telling us that we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s705">And my uncle managed to come to America, so we started to learn English, private.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s707">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: It was in 1940.</span> <span id="s709">We were preparing.</span> <span id="s710">And it was a teacher, who learned in England.</span> <span id="s711">He studied in England.</span> <span id="s712">He wasn’t a young man.</span> <span id="s713">And he was so proud of us, me and my sister, that we are so good, that when we went… small town, bigger than here, but it was still… it was the capital of Carpathan.</span> <span id="s714">It was a promenade.</span> <span id="s715">They builded it up beautifully, the Czechs, that time, near the water.</span> <span id="s716">We had a bridge dividing the city, so it was a very nice city.</span> <span id="s717">And it was a promenade, banks, sitting people, and he started to speak loud to us, English, that was, you know, his commercial.</span> <span id="s718">We had had English, Anna Karenina and everything already.</span> <span id="s719">We were very good.</span> <span id="s720">So Czech school.</span> <span id="s721">Czech I spoke perfect, German I spoke that time perfect, Hungarian and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Were you citizens of any…?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: You became Czech citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: We were Czech citizens.</span> <span id="s726">After five years we were, or even earlier, we were Czech citizens.</span> <span id="s727">But when the Hungarians came in, we were no citizens, because the Czechs run away.</span> <span id="s728">They went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s729">But we couldn’t go because we weren’t born there.</span> <span id="s730">And naturalized citizens couldn’t go with them and we were stuck there.</span> <span id="s731">And that’s how my parents were killed.</span> <span id="s732">The very first, because of that.</span> <span id="s733">But the other Russians, probably whoever is alive, oh, they are not alive anymore, because they were like my father’s age.</span> <span id="s734">But they were 46 years old when they killed them.</span> <span id="s735">They was the same age, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s736">And my sister was 19.</span> <span id="s737">And my sister could escape, but he says, “No way, I go where my mother goes.”</span> <span id="s738">And I had that guilt feeling that I wanted to commit suicide because of that, too.</span> <span id="s739">Because we were so close.</span> <span id="s740">And he said, “I go where my mother.”</span> <span id="s741">And we had no idea, where she went or what happened or where she going.</span> <span id="s742">It was terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s743">And that aunt, my mother’s youngest sister, who was very well-to-do when she got married, she was… they were very wealthy people.</span> <span id="s744">And she had one son.</span> <span id="s745">And he’s on the picture that I think.</span> <span id="s746">His name was George.</span> <span id="s747">My George is named after him, because then he became the child of the family who… the two brothers, my uncle, my mother’s sister’s husband, he was alive and his brother was alive.</span> <span id="s748">Because they were in a labor camp in Hungary.</span> <span id="s749">And when George was born, then George got his name then, he had a little boy… End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.</span> <span id="s751">I don’t think I actually asked for your mother’s full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Marvina Eichler.</span></p> <p><span

area?</span> <span id="s758">Or what was their history?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: The whole family, my grandmother’s children, they were born all there, but my grandmother was actually from a place, Zam Plain (ph), it’s called, from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s760">I told you that there were Germans there.</span> <span id="s761">My Grandmother, but all the childrens were born there.</span> <span id="s762">And all my grandmother’s sisters, who were living there too when she was a child, all their children were all born in Budapest.</span> <span id="s763">Everybody was, you know, the cousins and everybody was born in Budapest.</span> <span id="s764">And there were plenty of them.</span> <span id="s765">All of them, the least, had three children, my grandmother’s sisters, and more.</span> <span id="s766">And she had, herself, she had five sisters and a brother, but they were all born in Hungary, in Budapest, as far as I know, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t know no one who was born outside of Budapest.</span> <span id="s768">Except for my husband.</span> <span id="s769">He was… they were farmers, big farmers, in… I can’t even describe you where is it, outside, not in Budapest, of course.</span> <span id="s770">It was close to Eger, Eger is a big city.</span> <span id="s771">But they lived on a farm when he was a young boy and they were very wealthy people.</span> <span id="s772">And the first, I don’t know what year was it, when the Romanians came in and they took away the farm.</span> <span id="s773">Second time the Russians took away the farm and the Germans, they took away.</span> <span id="s774">Three times, everything was taken away and then their lives were taken away from them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: When you… when your mother, after your mother and father got married and you were living in Uzhorod (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Uzhorod (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s778">Uzhgorod is another name for it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Uzhgorod is Ungbar in Hungarian and the Czech.</span> <span id="s780">And that was Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s781">U Z and then accent over the Z and then horod.</span> <span id="s782">Uzhorod is, it was in the Carpathian Mountains.</span> <span id="s783">It was in a very nice place and a very beautiful city.</span> <span id="s784">And to me, every city what is divided with a river, the city itself, it’s a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s785">[Phone rings.]</span> <span id="s786">And that was divided.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Did your mother work, continue to work after she got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No, she never worked.</span> <span id="s789">She was just a hausfrau, house mother, but we were struggling.</span> <span id="s790">My father was… they were struggling until they… something happened with them.</span> <span id="s791">My mother, I remember she made our clothes, everything, she sewed alone by hand.</span> <span id="s792">We didn’t have even a machine, a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s793">But she tried the best and she tried to brought us up that we were really, everybody who spoke about us… and there are only two people in Brooklyn, who knew my parents from my childhood, only two people, two friends I have, who knew them and how they are talking about them.</span> <span id="s794">It’s terrible.</span> <span id="s795">One lived in Prague, she got married and then they came to America and her husband was a dermatologist and then he got Alzheimer’s disease.</span> <span id="s796">Anyway.</span> <span id="s797">So, she, we became, we are still friends, but now telephone friends.</span> <span id="s798">We are talking.</span> <span id="s799">And she has two very successful children, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s800">He’s a dentist.</span> <span id="s801">Middle of New York, he has an office.</span> <span id="s802">But they came after the Czech revolution that was in the sixties.</span> <span id="s803">They came with everything, with furniture, with Steinway piano.</span> <span id="s804">They brought everything with them.</span> <span id="s805">Oriental carpets.</span> <span id="s806">Not as we came, because they didn’t let us take nothing with us when we came.</span> <span id="s807">But only two people.</span> <span id="s808">And it’s so sad that only two people knew my parents.</span> <span id="s809">You know?</span> <span id="s810">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s811">Of course… no, my cousin, he doesn’t… in Canada, he doesn’t remember.</span> <span id="s812">My cousin in Budapest, she remembers my parents.</span> <span id="s813">She was younger than my sister.</span> <span id="s814">She’s younger than my sister was, but she is remembering my parents.</span> <span id="s815">But otherwise, no one remembers my parents.</span> <span id="s816">It’s very sad.</span> <span id="s817">And I don’t know about my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s818">I wrote down everything.</span> <span id="s819">They have it on tape and still they are very mixed up when I speak about an aunt, you see, we have somebody by the name of Ilou (ph), what was a sister-in-law of my aunt, but they have the same name.</span> <span id="s820">Because that was a second marriage to my uncle’s brother.</span> <span id="s821">And the name was the same Ilou and Ilia (ph).</span> <span id="s822">But the other one, the older one, she is not mixing it up.</span> <span id="s823">She knows the difference, who was Ilika (ph) to us and who is Ilou, she knows.</span> <span id="s824">Ilou she knows, she was here too.</span> <span id="s825">She’s alive.</span> <span id="s826">That was my uncle’s sister-in-law by second marriage, because the first wife died with the four year old little boy.</span> <span id="s827">And he always wanted children, so he married a younger woman than him and she couldn’t have never children.</span> <span id="s828">But she has a big family in Israel.</span> <span id="s829">She has a brother and she has a sister-in-law in Montreal, because her brother died when they came to Canada.</span> <span id="s830">When we came here, they went to Canada.</span> <span id="s831">And he was a paper (ph) engineer.</span> <span id="s832">He wasn’t used to Canadian winter, slippery.</span> <span id="s833">And he made a car accident and he got a stroke from it.</span> <span id="s834">And he didn’t die, but he got a second stroke and he died.</span> <span id="s835">And he was a young man.</span> <span id="s836">He was 42, something like that and he left his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada.</span> <span id="s837">And the wife had a German nana.</span> <span id="s838">She was a real German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her childhood.</span> <span id="s839">Because she had very, very wealthy parents, and she had a sister, she died, too.</span> <span id="s840">And her parents died, but that woman, she stayed with her all through her life.</span> <span id="s841">And she was bringing up her son, too.</span> <span id="s842">And then she died in Canada.</span> <span id="s843">She never went back.</span> <span id="s844">She was from Vienna.</span> <span id="s845">Very nice person.</span> <span id="s846">I remember her so well.</span> <span id="s847">I met her many times when we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s848">First they lived in Montreal and they moved to Toronto when the French started that you had to speak French.</span> <span id="s849">He’s an engineer, too, my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Can you say something more… let’s talk more about your childhood.</span> <span id="s851">Did you have any non-Jewish friends who you played with?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I had Czech friends, non-Jewish Czech friends, yes.</span> <span id="s853">They were very good friends.</span> <span id="s854">They had, they were entirely different… their thinking was different from ours.</span> <span id="s855">First of all they were very loose, the Czech girls, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s856">There were many, many, even in my class, there were three twins.</span> <span id="s857">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s858">There were many twins, girls.</span> <span id="s859">And, but they were good friends.</span> <span id="s860">And then we had Hungarian friends, Jewish girls friends.</span> <span id="s861">We had.</span> <span id="s862">We had quite a lot.</span> <span id="s863">And we got together, before I went out with the boy.</span> <span id="s864">We got together always, every week at somebody’s house.</span> <span id="s865">During the week it was strictly studying.</span> <span id="s866">And we went to movies and as I said… then we belonged to a Jewish organization, Kadima (ph), that’s actually, they have it in Israel now, too, Kadima.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Is that a Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: It is a Zionist organization, yes, and it was a youth organization.</span> <span id="s869">And in the summer we made excursions, but only for one day, in the mountains together.</span> <span id="s870">It was a very nice life in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s871">The Czech people are wonderful people and that was the real democracy.</span> <span id="s872">What I lived under, Masaryk and Benes (ph), that was a real democracy.</span> <span id="s873">And I am laughing when I am talking here about democracy.</span> <span id="s874">I says, “Do those people know what’s democracy?”</span> <span id="s875">You know, there are castes here and everywhere.</span> <span id="s876">And even in the hospital… I worked 27 years in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital.</span> <span id="s877">And there were very few people who were really, as you say, mensch people.</span> <span id="s878">Like it was a old doctor, he was the head of the Pediatrics.</span> <span id="s879">He was the only one who went there in the morning and he shook hands with the elevator guy and something like that.</span> <span id="s880">You know?</span> <span id="s881">It was… it was entirely different.</span> <span id="s882">They speak here about democracy, but they don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s883">I remember that once before, my husband… my father had many jobs before they had, they bought a… I don’t know what year was it.</span> <span id="s884">They bought together a drugstore.</span> <span id="s885">But drugstore, it means, because they didn’t have their diploma or certificate.</span> <span id="s886">And I have my own diploma, Russian diploma.</span> <span id="s887">So when he came to America, he worked in New York in a pharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the head of the Herbs department.</span> <span id="s888">They sell many, many.</span> <span id="s889">But he couldn’t do a prescription.</span> <span id="s890">And that was the situation with my father, too, when they went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s891">So they bought a drugstore, but they had everything but prescription drugs.</span> <span id="s892">But they didn’t have luncheonettes like here.</span> <span id="s893">It was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s894">But the trouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist died.</span> <span id="s895">And it was a beautiful new pharmacy.</span> <span id="s896">And his wife wanted my father to work for her.</span> <span id="s897">Okay.</span> <span id="s898">He took over and he was substituting outside.</span> <span id="s899">He knew pharmacists and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s900">He knows, he did everything.</span> <span id="s901">And then when he took over that pharmacy and my uncle had the drugstore.</span> <span id="s902">And it was a big place and a small place, because everybody knew everybody.</span> <span id="s903">So if somebody went to my uncle, they were… they felt bad that they don’t go to my father.</span> <span id="s904">That kind of a situation, you know?</span> <span id="s905">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s906">So on the end, he had to leave that pharmacy and he went back with my uncle, together, because, you know, there were lot of Russian people.</span> <span id="s907">They were non-Jews, lots.</span> <span id="s908">And they knew all each other.</span> <span id="s909">And one, oh, especially one, who let me go to the office.</span> <span id="s910">He had a very big position and he let me go to the office and learn the Russian typewriter.</span> <span id="s911">That’s how I knew how to type Russian.</span> <span id="s912">But it came very, very good after the war, when I worked for the dictionaries.</span> <span id="s913">I was the only one who typed Russian in Hungary.</span> <span id="s914">So they were all friends, non-Jews and Jews, the Russians.</span> <span id="s915">Of course, they were all educated people.</span> <span id="s916">I’m not saying that the others were because probably they were anti-Semitic, like, you know.</span> <span id="s917">Like it always was anti-Semitism in Russia.</span> <span id="s918">But they were very good friends.</span> <span id="s919">I never forget it, that one Christmas night, she said, “You must come to our church.”</span> <span id="s920">It’s very interesting, the Russian Orthodox church.”</span> <span id="s921">There, it was interesting.</span> <span id="s922">No, I don’t want to hear about it, what happened with her.</span> <span id="s923">And it’s different, I see it on the television.</span> <span id="s924">That it is entirely different in Moscow what it was there.</span> <span id="s925">It was a church where you didn’t have seats, you know?</span> <span id="s926">You were all standing and he was like the leader there or whatever.</span> <span id="s927">And everybody who came in got three kisses, you know.</span> <span id="s928">Three times you kiss.</span> <span id="s929">Very friendly, very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s930">They were very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s931">And then I remember it was a photographer, Kantor (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s932">And I don’t know how he survived, because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s933">And he survived, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s934">They sent him back with the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s935">And then my friends from Brooklyn, who knew them too, and they were in California and they met him.</span> <span id="s936">He was alive for a long time and he met their sons.</span> <span id="s937">So that kind of, you know, friends we had there, in Uzhorod.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: How did that, how did that begin to change after the Hungarian takeover of Uzhorod in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s940">1938.</span> <span id="s941">It was terrible because… I don’t know whether I say somewhere that my cousin came and wanted to adopt us?</span> <span id="s942">Okay.</span> <span id="s943">My cousin, who was in Siberia for many years.</span> <span id="s944">He lived in Budapest, and one day he came to Uzhorod and he knew about the situation, that they were worried what is going to happen, because they were thrown out from Hungary.</span> <span id="s945">He came and he said, “I am going to adopt the children.”</span> <span id="s946">Under eighteen he could have done it.</span> <span id="s947">“And just the name will change.</span> <span id="s948">They can’t stay with you.</span> <span id="s949">Just God forbid something happens that the children should be safe.”</span> <span id="s950">And I remember the day that they called us and they called us in the bedroom, my father and my mother and him.</span> <span id="s951">And they explained it to us and we started to cry.</span> <span id="s952">We thought that we are going to be taken away from them.</span> <span id="s953">And we couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s954">Why?</span> <span id="s955">Why?</span> <span id="s956">Why?</span> <span id="s957">Though I was 18 years old in 1938.</span> <span id="s958">But I just, we just… to take another name, and… they didn’t explain it to us, that what can happen.</span> <span id="s959">You know?</span> <span id="s960">Though we knew the story.</span> <span id="s961">We knew the story, but we didn’t think about it, that my father was never led back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s962">Only my mother and us, every summer.</span> <span id="s963">He never was let back to Hungary to go back.</span> <span id="s964">And suddenly he’s traveling to Hungary, because Hungary is, we are Hungary.</span> <span id="s965">And so after big, big discussions, we decided that we won’t do it.</span> <span id="s966">We children didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s967">And that costed my sister’s life.</span> <span id="s968">But my sister could be saved, and he didn’t want because… originally when they went to that cousin, she wanted to take my sister away, right away when she saw what’s going to happen, what’s happening.</span> <span id="s969">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s970">I wasn’t there in ‘41.</span> <span id="s971">And my sister didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s972">She could have been saved.</span> <span id="s973">And then she came, and she came… it was actually my grandmother’s side.</span> <span id="s974">Somebody I don’t know how they were cousins.</span> <span id="s975">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s976">Up to today I don’t know.</span> <span id="s977">But she wanted, she told me that she wanted to take her, but she is dead, too.</span> <span id="s978">She went to the camps, too.</span> <span id="s979">So probably my sister, if she would take my sister, she wouldn’t be alive anyway.</span> <span id="s980">But she says “No.</span> <span id="s981">Whatever is going to happen, it’s going to happen.”</span> <span id="s982">But nobody knew, nobody believed it that some thing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s983">So, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: You were in Uzhorod in 1938 and then it became…</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: In 1941…</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did you stay there until 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: My parents, yeah, I went in 1941, the first time, alone, in May to… no.</span> <span id="s988">In 1940, Christmastime, I went with my sister, alone, Christmas vacation to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s989">And one day, the boy with whom I went out and his friend, they came by car in Hungarian uniforms to see us.</span> <span id="s990">And I just, I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s991">It was very far away.</span> <span id="s992">And he was begging me that I should go home.</span> <span id="s993">He felt something.</span> <span id="s994">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s995">I didn’t know nothing that time, because I didn’t know my husband.</span> <span id="s996">But he says, “Come home and come home, and go home.”</span> <span id="s997">I says, “Okay, we are going to go home.”</span> <span id="s998">But we had a good time.</span> <span id="s999">They took us, I don’t know where we went.</span> <span id="s1000">Don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1001">They stayed there two days they had to go back because they were in the army.</span> <span id="s1002">And we went back…</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: To Uzhorod?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: In 1940 to Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s1005">We went back home.</span> <span id="s1006">And in 1941, in 1941, yes, in January, about in January, I had trouble with my rheumatic fever, because I had rheumatic fever when I was young, very bad.</span> <span id="s1007">I almost died from it.</span> <span id="s1008">Six months I was in bed, high fever.</span> <span id="s1009">That’s why I have heart trouble.</span> <span id="s1010">And I went back and my mother said that “Your sister is still in school.</span> <span id="s1011">Go alone.</span> <span id="s1012">You are now 21 years old, 1941.</span> <span id="s1013">You can travel alone,” because it was about a day by train from Uzhgorod to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1014">“And take the cure.”</span> <span id="s1015">I had a doctor there, who every year prescribed me a cure, what I had to take in a bath.</span> <span id="s1016">And he said that was a precaution.</span> <span id="s1017">It shouldn’t be trouble.</span> <span id="s1018">“And take your cure.”</span> <span id="s1019">Three weeks it took.</span> <span id="s1020">“And by the time you finished, we come after you.</span> <span id="s1021">Your sister will be finished.”</span> <span id="s1022">And that was in May and I went.</span> <span id="s1023">And I went, and I met my husband, who we met Christmas together when we were with my sister.</span> <span id="s1024">We went.</span> <span id="s1025">We saw him once.</span> <span id="s1026">He was introduced to us once.</span> <span id="s1027">His aunt and my aunt were very good friends.</span> <span id="s1028">But he didn’t live in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1029">He didn’t live in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Where did he live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: My husband?</span> <span id="s1032">Outside in Eger.</span> <span id="s1033">It’s a smaller town.</span> <span id="s1034">His sister lived there.</span> <span id="s1035">And he came to his aunt.</span> <span id="s1036">And I went there with my aunt.</span> <span id="s1037">They played cards together.</span> <span id="s1038">And suddenly somebody’s opened the gates, I never… and it was him.</span> <span id="s1039">He had a cousin, who was older than him.</span> <span id="s1040">And I was expecting that he is going to open the door, but my husband, he opened the door.</span> <span id="s1041">And I just looked at him.</span> <span id="s1042">Who is he?</span> <span id="s1043">I never heard from him.</span> <span id="s1044">And they introduced us to him, so my sister knew him, only my sister.</span> <span id="s1045">And he was talking to me.</span> <span id="s1046">And he was a very good looking guy.</span> <span id="s1047">And he was seven years older than I was.</span> <span id="s1048">And he, the next few days we supposed to go back home to Budapest, to Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s1049">And his aunt, in the morning comes to my grandma’s house, I was in bed still.</span> <span id="s1050">And he says, “Emilie,” my nickname was Millie.</span> <span id="s1051">The whole family knows me, Millie.</span> <span id="s1052">My name is Emilie, officially.</span> <span id="s1053">And I didn’t know that Millie is in America a name and I just continue being Emilie like in school, when I went to school.</span> <span id="s1054">But my friends and my family, everybody called me Millie.</span> <span id="s1055">He says, “Millie.”</span> <span id="s1056">She had a big voice, she says, “Frank fell in love with you and he wants to marry you.”</span> <span id="s1057">I say, “Oh please, don’t say me this nonsense, somebody sees somebody and right away they want to marry?”</span> <span id="s1058">I was not a bad looking girl, that’s true, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s1059">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1060">But still it was very funny to me.</span> <span id="s1061">And he said, “I know that you are going, you are going out with somebody, but how is it?</span> <span id="s1062">Is it serious?”</span> <span id="s1063">I says, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1064">We never spoke about marriage.”</span> <span id="s1065">We spoke about marriage, but he always told me that he cannot get married until he is not on his own.</span> <span id="s1066">He is in his father’s business and until then, he cannot get married.</span> <span id="s1067">He spoke a few languages.</span> <span id="s1068">He spoke already then very well English.</span> <span id="s1069">We never spoke about marriage, never.</span> <span id="s1070">I says, “We never spoke about marriage.</span> <span id="s1071">I don’t know how I stand and whatever.</span> <span id="s1072">We are friends, we are very good friends.”</span> <span id="s1073">So he says, “No, he’s serious.”</span> <span id="s1074">I says, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1075">Next day we went back to Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s1076">And I didn’t hear from him.</span> <span id="s1077">Only my aunt, that was my middle sister of my mother and she was a widow at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Serena.</span> <span id="s1080">And she said, “I met Frank” —Ferenz (ph), actually, Feri— “I met him and he’s constantly asking me when are you coming back, when are you coming back?”</span> <span id="s1081">So, one day I wrote to her, to my aunt, that I’m coming back to the bath.</span> <span id="s1082">Next day he was there, because that time he already lived in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1083">He had a business in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: He was actually, he will finish business college.</span> <span id="s1086">He had a business, here they don’t have those businesses, because that time was everything, the transportation with horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s1087">And he was in business, I am always saying we are eating his horse food, because, oat, oat.</span> <span id="s1088">That’s in Hungary horse food.</span> <span id="s1089">So, he had a business with oat.</span> <span id="s1090">But through the… it was a big business because he was connected to… I’m sorry, to… Wall Street, what is it?</span> <span id="s1091">Wall Street business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Wall Street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: It wasn’t Wall Street there, but every business, big businesses were… so it was a big business, and he made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1094">And he lived there.</span> <span id="s1095">But I knew about him.</span> <span id="s1096">They told me, he did tell me that time, that he just left his girlfriend, whom he went out for four years, because… his mother was against it because the girlfriend wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1097">And his sister already was married to a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1098">So she said, “It’s enough, one person.”</span> <span id="s1099">She was converted, she was married in a Christian church with popes, papers that she can get married.</span> <span id="s1100">Her daughter was born already as Christian.</span> <span id="s1101">And he loved his parents and he loved his mother and after four years he left the girl.</span> <span id="s1102">The girl wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1103">It was a country girl.</span> <span id="s1104">They had a restaurant there.</span> <span id="s1105">Because when he was living there with the same business in smaller… it was small town and he had his little farm alone and horse and everything.</span> <span id="s1106">And he lived alone there.</span> <span id="s1107">And then he wanted to get rid of her because of his mother and he came to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1108">And once he came, she came after him, but I never met her.</span> <span id="s1109">But he was telling me that she came after him because she was so in love with him.</span> <span id="s1110">So anyway, so that was the story that he fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s1111">You know?</span> <span id="s1112">She left… so, then I found out the story I says, “Oh, how do I trust him, if that’s the story?”</span> <span id="s1113">Because he left one, then he wants to marry me.</span> <span id="s1114">Well, anyway.</span> <span id="s1115">So we went out and it was already, I finished my cure and it was already war.</span> <span id="s1116">My uncle was already in America with the last ship and in ‘41 it was already bad.</span> <span id="s1117">And we went out for a dinner and he brought his friend with him, who was in the same business.</span> <span id="s1118">And we went to a restaurant and people are looking in the papers for the news.</span> <span id="s1119">It was no television, radios were, but no televisions.</span> <span id="s1120">And he took a paper and he’s looking in a paper and I am asking him something and he didn’t hear me.</span> <span id="s1121">And this way I did with my hand and I turned to his friend.</span> <span id="s1122">That he saw, that I waved and he took me home that night and I didn’t see him for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1123">He thought that I did it, that I don’t care about him.</span> <span id="s1124">He was so sensitive, but I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1125">For three weeks I didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s1126">The third week, I said, “I’m going home.”</span> <span id="s1127">I said to his aunt, because we were very close, even we lived very close.</span> <span id="s1128">And I said it to his cousin that I’m going home.</span> <span id="s1129">And he says, “Why, what happened?”</span> <span id="s1130">I says, “I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1131">I didn’t hear from him and that’s it.”</span> <span id="s1132">He went home to his mother, then his mother was telling me… I met his mother, very nice lady, she was very nice.</span> <span id="s1133">I met his parents.</span> <span id="s1134">I went to Eger.</span> <span id="s1135">He took me once.</span> <span id="s1136">And she was telling me that he came home next morning and he was crying.</span> <span id="s1137">He was seven years older than me, that she finally found somebody whom he loves, and she doesn’t want me.</span> <span id="s1138">He was… you know, it was a misunderstanding, the whole thing, but I didn’t know that he is such a sensitive guy, that he thinks… so it was a misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s1139">But he find out that I am going home.</span> <span id="s1140">Next day, it came a big rose, you know, flowers, and “Please don’t go.”</span> <span id="s1141">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: …the marriage certificate and then I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1143">I can’t remember what happened.</span> <span id="s1144">Probably… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1145">Because I remember what my father wrote, that he’s giving his crown of his life to him and he should take care of her, that kind of a style, you know.</span> <span id="s1146">And we agreed that my engagement will be third of July in my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s1147">Because we don’t have my uncle anymore there and that those relatives were not so close relatives that we should make an engagement.</span> <span id="s1148">Our family was always, my family, my mother’s family was always the family.</span> <span id="s1149">It was arranged everything, it was a Sunday and the whole family was together, the sisters and everything.</span> <span id="s1150">I remember a beautiful table was made and my parents, my sister should come up to the engagement and they never came.</span> <span id="s1151">That story you know.</span> <span id="s1152">That they were called to the police and I got a telegram from our friends that they called them to the police and they never let them out and “You disappear.</span> <span id="s1153">Go in hiding.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Who told you to go in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: My friends who lived near us in Uzhorod, they were our friends and they lived near us.</span> <span id="s1156">And they saw when they, they knew that they went to the police and they never came out.</span> <span id="s1157">And they said, “Probably they are looking for you,” because they knew everything, everything who was not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1158">Because we weren’t Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s1159">The papers were at the police.</span> <span id="s1160">That was the police.</span> <span id="s1161">And they knew that you were four people and they got only three people, so you better go to hiding.</span> <span id="s1162">So, I couldn’t get married, because he was already in labor camp, too, from 1941 on.</span> <span id="s1163">But that time he was home still.</span> <span id="s1164">With the… he was in the Hungarian uniform, he was so gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1165">He was an officer.</span> <span id="s1166">And he… we couldn’t get married, because in Hungary we couldn’t get married.</span> <span id="s1167">Only when we were 24 years old without the father’s consent, at that time.</span> <span id="s1168">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1169">Today you can get married if you are ten years old, I think.</span> <span id="s1170">So, he went, short, right after, they stripped him of his uniform and he went to labor camp.</span> <span id="s1171">And I stayed there with my grandmother and every night, I slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1172">Some other relatives and by his friends, because everything happened during the night, that they were looking for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Before we go on, you said something in the other tape I wanted to see if you could tell us more detail about, which was that your father came, was released from jail to come and see you.</span> <span id="s1174">Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1176">So, we didn’t know what happened to them or where they are.</span> <span id="s1177">And my, the youngest sister of my mother, Illie, Ilona, they found out that they brought up a lot of, a transport from Uzhorod to Budapest and they put them like in a jail.</span> <span id="s1178">But they were there for two weeks, and they went to visit them.</span> <span id="s1179">They talked to them and they went to visit them.</span> <span id="s1180">And my mother told them that I shouldn’t come there, because I look like her and it has no sense that I should be there, because they are going to get out from there.</span> <span id="s1181">And one day they let out my father with a policeman for money to my cousin’s house, who was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1182">He lived very close to that place and he wasn’t home already, just his wife.</span> <span id="s1183">And nobody was in the apartment and the police brought my father there and he left, the police.</span> <span id="s1184">And he says, “I come back…” this and that time.</span> <span id="s1185">I don’t know, it was an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s1186">And I met my father.</span> <span id="s1187">And first we just couldn’t talk, we were just crying and crying and we didn’t know what to say to each other.</span> <span id="s1188">And he was just constantly questioning me.</span> <span id="s1189">“Are you sure that that’s whom you want to marry?”</span> <span id="s1190">Because he knew about that I went out with that boy for four years.</span> <span id="s1191">And he said, “Are you sure, are you sure?”</span> <span id="s1192">And worried about me.</span> <span id="s1193">I says, “I am not sure of nothing, but I hope it will be all right.”</span> <span id="s1194">And he said, I said, “Look, my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family, so I hope it will be all right.”</span> <span id="s1195">And he called up from Uzhorod, he called Uzhorod and he called up the senators.</span> <span id="s1196">They were all Russians.</span> <span id="s1197">There were many Russians, they were non-Jews in Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s1198">And he knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1199">And they told him, “Don’t worry, tomorrow you’ll be out.”</span> <span id="s1200">And we parted and he says, “I hope we see each other tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1201">And tomorrow came and my aunt and even my husband, he wasn’t my husband at that time, my aunt and her husband, they all went to the train station, because they said the people are going to go home by train to Uzhorod.</span> <span id="s1202">Everybody went back, who was non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1203">The Jews went in separate cars to Kamana Spodovski (ph), where they killed them.</span> <span id="s1204">And my husband, he had a very, very soft heart, like him.</span> <span id="s1205">And he couldn’t even, he couldn’t see the scene.</span> <span id="s1206">Though they went with regular cars, not like with cattle cars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hungarian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1207">He run away.</span> <span id="s1208">He couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s1209">He just saw them from a distance.</span> <span id="s1210">And I think my sister recognized him.</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1212">That was that.</span> <span id="s1213">And then a few weeks, about two weeks later, I got a card from my sister, in my sister’s handwriting, that “We are in Kamana Spodovski (ph).</span> <span id="s1214">We don’t know what are we going to do here.</span> <span id="s1215">We don’t know if we are going to have where to stay, but we are here.”</span> <span id="s1216">And it was a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a Hungarian soldier brought it back.</span> <span id="s1217">And what I know from the museum, that’s why I went this Spring to the museum, I told you that.</span> <span id="s1218">To find out the truth.</span> <span id="s1219">Because she went first, my daughter-in-law, and asked about it, and met there somebody in the library, who was very nice.</span> <span id="s1220">And she, he showed her the book and he took out a few pages from the book and he made copies for me.</span> <span id="s1221">And he sent it to me.</span> <span id="s1222">He even spoke to me over the phone when my sister, when my daughter-in-law was there.</span> <span id="s1223">And he said, it wasn’t that time that they killed them.</span> <span id="s1224">I always thought that they killed them when they left in July.</span> <span id="s1225">When I was there, I looked at the book, but I couldn’t buy it.</span> <span id="s1226">It’s such a big book.</span> <span id="s1227">It was not only about them, because, he said, they said, and it’s here and it’s terrible, that 38 thousand people were killed in one day, because they didn’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s1228">Because they took them to Poland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time.</span> <span id="s1229">So they couldn’t help them.</span> <span id="s1230">Nobody could help them.</span> <span id="s1231">And the Germans didn’t know what to do with them, so they let them made their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1232">They took the clothes away, they put them on one line and on the orders.</span> <span id="s1233">They made a big, big grave and they had to make the grave.</span> <span id="s1234">And from the other side, the German soldiers were shooting them in the graves and right away, the tanks were running over them.</span> <span id="s1235">So I wanted that book, but it was no sense, because it was from… I have the pages what I needed.</span> <span id="s1236">And I see the pictures how they sit there on the end of the, the forest.</span> <span id="s1237">And the people… and I saw the… I told you about that 12 series what was on television, The Winds of War?</span> <span id="s1238">You never heard about The Winds of War?</span> <span id="s1239">Mitchum played in it.</span> <span id="s1240">It started only four series.</span> <span id="s1241">It was a beautiful movie.</span> <span id="s1242">It was a French-Jewish writer, who was in France and his niece was with him.</span> <span id="s1243">You don’t know that story?</span> <span id="s1244">It’s Winds of War, is the name.</span> <span id="s1245">It’s in the public library.</span> <span id="s1246">After that they made a 12 series, 12 two hours, 12 times, the whole summer and I saw all of it.</span> <span id="s1247">It was a Hungarian, originally he was Hungarian, an actor.</span> <span id="s1248">And his father was amongst those people who were taken and that was his idea to make that movie.</span> <span id="s1249">You see original pictures what the Germans took.</span> <span id="s1250">Because it starts out like a colored movie and suddenly it’s black and white pictures.</span> <span id="s1251">And you see the trains what we went in and I couldn’t look.</span> <span id="s1252">I said, “I see myself somewhere there.”</span> <span id="s1253">But when I saw, I saw the whole thing, how they killed them.</span> <span id="s1254">And then I really couldn’t look, because I said, “My God, I am going to recognize either my sister or somebody I’m going recognize.”</span> <span id="s1255">I couldn’t look at it.</span> <span id="s1256">Everything is in it, from the beginning to the end, with Auschwitz, everything.</span> <span id="s1257">Twelve series and it is in the public library, everybody can borrow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Going back to that time, to 1941.</span> <span id="s1259">What did you, did you have any idea of what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s1261">No idea what they were doing, what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1262">We heard from Slovakia, what was near us, Slovakia, they are taking young girls somewhere, only young girls.</span> <span id="s1263">And where they are taking them and what they are doing with them, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1264">And they were taking them to Auschwitz, because I recognized one of them.</span> <span id="s1265">Four years later, I recognized one of them.</span> <span id="s1266">They were taking them there.</span> <span id="s1267">They were building Auschwitz actually.</span> <span id="s1268">And many of them they made their lovers, the Germans, because they were all pretty girls they took.</span> <span id="s1269">And then I knew, that they took them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1270">And when it was starting to happen, already it started near the, where Elie Wiesel is from… near Romania it started.</span> <span id="s1271">They started to take people.</span> <span id="s1272">And they were always saying “It cannot happen in Budapest, it cannot happen.”</span> <span id="s1273">And when I said that it can happen, they always said “You are a pessimist.”</span> <span id="s1274">It cannot happen in Budapest, that was the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: So at the time, you are a young girl, you’re 21 years old.</span> <span id="s1276">Did you have any sense of the danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: I wanted to commit suicide, I wanted to commit suicide, first of all, because I didn’t know whether he will stay with me, my fiancé.</span> <span id="s1278">He was away.</span> <span id="s1279">I didn’t know what I am waiting for.</span> <span id="s1280">I knew my parents are somewhere.</span> <span id="s1281">I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1282">It cannot be… I even went, it’s unbelievable, I even went to a fortune teller.</span> <span id="s1283">And I let him, show my palm and tell me about my parents.</span> <span id="s1284">And they said that “They are very far away, don’t wait for them.”</span> <span id="s1285">That’s what she was telling me.</span> <span id="s1286">“They are in big danger.”</span> <span id="s1287">I just couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1288">But I had a feeling, that it’s something terrible happening, but I never had any idea.</span> <span id="s1289">No, never.</span> <span id="s1290">And when we were going to Auschwitz, I didn’t know where we are going, but I said, “Ah, maybe we go somewhere, where I can see or meet my parents.”</span> <span id="s1291">If I don’t, I didn’t know where we are going.</span> <span id="s1292">Nobody knew where we are going.</span> <span id="s1293">It was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1294">So when I wanted to commit suicide, my aunt saved me, my mother’s younger sister, Illie, Ilona.</span> <span id="s1295">And she had a 13-year-old boy.</span> <span id="s1296">And three years, I was, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1297">Every night I slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1298">And the third year, that before the Nazis came, she says, “You are not going nowhere.</span> <span id="s1299">Up to now they did look for you, you are our child, and you stay with us.”</span> <span id="s1300">And I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1301">I was like their child, they said.</span> <span id="s1302">They had a doctor who was, you know, house doctor, and he treated me like they child, and I was with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: So, you went into hiding in 1941.</span> <span id="s1304">Who was helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Until 1944.</span> <span id="s1306">Nobody was helping you, that was all family.</span> <span id="s1307">I went to my grandmothers, sisters, daughters, cousins.</span> <span id="s1308">And my husband had friends, they knew about it.</span> <span id="s1309">And I slept every night somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1310">During the day I stayed with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1311">And when I stayed with my grandmother, and I stayed there overnight, we were always in the basement, because they were bombing us.</span> <span id="s1312">Terrible bombing, the Americans.</span> <span id="s1313">They were going after the Germans, so they were bombing us.</span> <span id="s1314">In the morning we got up and we didn’t see nothing.</span> <span id="s1315">It’s very interesting that in that neighborhood it was nothing bombed, but my grandmother’s sister’s house.</span> <span id="s1316">Only one house was completely bombed and that’s… and everybody is gone from that family.</span> <span id="s1317">Only there is the girl, who is in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1318">That was that grandmother, that was that… her grandmother.</span> <span id="s1319">Only that house was bombed, to the ground, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1320">And she was the only one survivor from the whole family.</span> <span id="s1321">And she was holding onto me, me, me, me.</span> <span id="s1322">She wasn’t married.</span> <span id="s1323">And she survived, because her parents, when they saw what’s happening, they put her in a factory, like GE.</span> <span id="s1324">They made electric, but they worked for the army, and people who worked for the army, they didn’t take them to the camps.</span> <span id="s1325">They kept them in the factory until they finished the work.</span> <span id="s1326">In six months they were finished, then they throw them out to the streets.</span> <span id="s1327">So then she standing there, nobody, no parents and nobody, so what is she going to do?</span> <span id="s1328">So she met her aunt’s maid.</span> <span id="s1329">She was a very nice person and she knew somebody, a lady, whose husband was in… she was not Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp.</span> <span id="s1330">He died, he never came back.</span> <span id="s1331">And that lady lived in a separate home.</span> <span id="s1332">She had a house and she took in a few Jewish people who didn’t have where to go, who came out from the factory.</span> <span id="s1333">And it was a doctor amongst them.</span> <span id="s1334">And my niece, my cousin was amongst them, whom she took in.</span> <span id="s1335">And she was hiding them.</span> <span id="s1336">And then the neighbors went and told on her, that she is buying too much food and she’s alone, that it’s something going on there.</span> <span id="s1337">And that was found, that she pulled away the beds and all of them who were there, about eight people, they made a big, big hole in the ground and they slept every night, under the bed, in the ground.</span> <span id="s1338">And that’s how they were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No, I never knew her.</span> <span id="s1341">I never even knew her, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: What was your, what was your daily life like, during that time?</span> <span id="s1343">Those years that you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Hiding?</span> <span id="s1345">It was terrible, because I was… where we were hiding… no, the Germans weren’t in there, only in 1944… it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1346">It was frightening, because I never knew that somebody can grab me.</span> <span id="s1347">And I was afraid to go during the day through the streets, and it was a terrible life, terrible.</span> <span id="s1348">And I was very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s1349">And they worked on me very hard, really, that I shouldn’t commit suicide, because it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1350">Then he didn’t write to me, I don’t know for how long.</span> <span id="s1351">My fiancé.</span> <span id="s1352">So I didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1353">His parents were alive still and they lived in Eger, because they took away already the farm.</span> <span id="s1354">So they lived with the daughter.</span> <span id="s1355">She had a very big house.</span> <span id="s1356">A part of the house belonged to my husband, because that was an inherited house.</span> <span id="s1357">She inherited it.</span> <span id="s1358">She went, can you imagine that she went to a convent to school, because that was the best school there.</span> <span id="s1359">And she was the only Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1360">At that time she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1361">And when she was 18 years old and she came out, she met that guy.</span> <span id="s1362">She had a lot of Jewish doctors, who wanted to marry her.</span> <span id="s1363">She met that guy, who was a gorgeous guy and he had three kinds of doctorate, and he had a big, big job with the states.</span> <span id="s1364">And he fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s1365">And they were the biggest anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1366">His father… I told you that?</span> <span id="s1367">His father left a will, though his granddaughter was born already Christian, that his granddaughter cannot come to his funeral.</span> <span id="s1368">That kind of a man she married.</span> <span id="s1369">And she was going to the Catholic Church and everything.</span> <span id="s1370">And they lived together there.</span> <span id="s1371">The parents had a separate part of the house and they lived together.</span> <span id="s1372">But when everything was happening, he didn’t save the parents.</span> <span id="s1373">He saved his wife and the daughter, but he didn’t save the parents, because he, himself, was an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1374">I know.</span> <span id="s1375">I know, because he made once a remark, that I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1376">They had my stuff, because I left it by Christian friends.</span> <span id="s1377">A lot of personal things.</span> <span id="s1378">And when my husband was transferred to Budapest, I told him where the stuff is and he took it away and sent it to the sister.</span> <span id="s1379">So whatever is saved, first they saved it, our friends, but then my sister-in-law saved it.</span> <span id="s1380">So she had everything what was my dowry, my jewelry and everything.</span> <span id="s1381">So, he didn’t want it, you know, it was his.</span> <span id="s1382">He didn’t want to give it back to me.</span> <span id="s1383">And they said they don’t have it.</span> <span id="s1384">And one day they weren’t home and I go to the closet and I pulled out everything what was mine.</span> <span id="s1385">That was the story.</span> <span id="s1386">So it was terrible, terrible, really terrible.</span> <span id="s1387">And I know that he made anti-Semitic remarks in front of me.</span> <span id="s1388">And I know that he was an anti-Semite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, he made remarks about my aunt, who was the loveliest, the best, best person in the world, my aunt.</span> <span id="s1391">And he said, “That Jewish woman,” this way, about my aunt.</span> <span id="s1392">I don’t know what he said.</span> <span id="s1393">Said this and that.</span> <span id="s1394">This way to me, he is saying it about my aunt.</span> <span id="s1395">And I always had a feeling, because he was mad that my husband married me and not a Christian.</span> <span id="s1396">He was, you know?</span> <span id="s1397">Until he met me, it took him I don’t know how long, when I was once there for a week…he took me a week.</span> <span id="s1398">He took a chance, because he met my train and at that time already they were looking for, not passports, but identifications.</span> <span id="s1399">And he took a chance and he took me to meet his parents.</span> <span id="s1400">And him I met, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1401">He lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s1402">And it was a Sunday when we went there and they came home from church, both of them.</span> <span id="s1403">And he just, he came to the window I remember.</span> <span id="s1404">And he says, “Hello,” through the window, you know?</span> <span id="s1405">I know that he was mad that he wants to marry me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: When you were in hiding, what did… how did you occupy your time?</span> <span id="s1407">Did you read books?</span> <span id="s1408">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1410">I went to my aunt many times, who had the 13-year-old boy, during the day.</span> <span id="s1411">Because they lived in an other borough.</span> <span id="s1412">New Pest, and it was Rakospolota (ph), that was an other borough, they were, you know?</span> <span id="s1413">And I walked.</span> <span id="s1414">I remember I walked.</span> <span id="s1415">I was afraid to go by the street cars that they ask for identification or something.</span> <span id="s1416">And I walked.</span> <span id="s1417">I walked a lot.</span> <span id="s1418">And I walked to her house and I tried to spend with my cousin… he was a lovely, lovely boy.</span> <span id="s1419">And I really don’t know what I did the whole day.</span> <span id="s1420">I know when I was away my grandmother was very, very upset because she loved me and they were bombing during the day.</span> <span id="s1421">And once I wasn’t there during the bombing and I had to run to a pharmacy to… that was our friends.</span> <span id="s1422">The woman was my friend and the husband was a gynecologist.</span> <span id="s1423">And I ran to the pharmacy and I got to their basement.</span> <span id="s1424">When it was over I went home and my grandmother was out of her mind.</span> <span id="s1425">She was so upset.</span> <span id="s1426">She wanted always hold my hands, always.</span> <span id="s1427">And she almost died in my hands, because she lost her mind in the wagon, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s1428">Because to say something like that, that “Would you please comb my hair?”</span> <span id="s1429">She didn’t know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1430">And I didn’t know what’s happening, but I was very glad that she doesn’t know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1431">Such a smart woman what she was.</span> <span id="s1432">She didn’t even wear glasses and was reading the paper every day.</span> <span id="s1433">She knew about everything was going on in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Were you following what was going on with the war at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Whatever they printed in Hungarian papers, but nothing else.</span> <span id="s1436">And we knew.</span> <span id="s1437">We didn’t have correspondence with America.</span> <span id="s1438">It stopped, so I couldn’t even write to my uncle.</span> <span id="s1439">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1440">I didn’t know nothing about him.</span> <span id="s1441">How is he doing?</span> <span id="s1442">What is he…?</span> <span id="s1443">We knew in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1444">We got a few letters from America.</span> <span id="s1445">And he said, “I’m trying to get your affidavit, that you should be able to come.”</span> <span id="s1446">And I even have those letters.</span> <span id="s1447">And we knew that he find a job in that pharmacy, the German pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1448">And they lived in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s1449">I know that.</span> <span id="s1450">And his address was always in my head, that I know, too.</span> <span id="s1451">All the time.</span> <span id="s1452">I wrote it in the dirt in Auschwitz, his address, that I shouldn’t forget it.</span> <span id="s1453">In case, sometimes I can write to him.</span> <span id="s1454">Because it was, it was an unbelievable thing in Auschwitz, that you knew that you cannot get out from here, never.</span> <span id="s1455">And still something was dictating to you, don’t forget that address.</span> <span id="s1456">It was such a mixture, you know?</span> <span id="s1457">You knew that you are in a prison.</span> <span id="s1458">That you cannot get out from here.</span> <span id="s1459">And never, we never see the end, never saw the end of it, that we can get out from there.</span> <span id="s1460">And that woman, that Romanian woman, maybe she was a Gypsy, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1461">She was dark complexion, who was reading there, too.</span> <span id="s1462">They were reading palms.</span> <span id="s1463">And I says, “Okay, read my palms.”</span> <span id="s1464">One, it was before that, it was a private person when I went to.</span> <span id="s1465">But that one, I went and says, “Do it.”</span> <span id="s1466">And she said, “You are going to get out from here, and when you are going to get out from here, you will go for a very long trip overseas.</span> <span id="s1467">Your husband is alive, but he is in a hospital now.</span> <span id="s1468">He’s sick.”</span> <span id="s1469">And it was everything true what she was telling me.</span> <span id="s1470">And she said, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1471">And she said, “You will have three children.”</span> <span id="s1472">And it was everything true.</span> <span id="s1473">And you shouldn’t believe those things.</span> <span id="s1474">And it was everything true, because I asked him, “Were you in the hospital?”</span> <span id="s1475">And he says, “Yes, with terrible tonsillitis.”</span> <span id="s1476">In, near… no, it was already Hungary at that time, in Romania, it was Hungary and there he was near Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1477">They took it over, too.</span> <span id="s1478">And he was in the hospital from the labor camp, because he had very high fever and they put him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1479">So it was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: You described earlier on how you had been dating this other young man and then you just met your husband and that it was very quick.</span> <span id="s1481">And that you realized you were in love with the other young man.</span> <span id="s1482">Did you at some point realize that you were in love with this man that you were engaged to?</span> <span id="s1483">And when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: No.</span> <span id="s1485">I didn’t… I, well I saw him, I liked him, because he was very good looking and very lovable.</span> <span id="s1486">But I was… until he threw it out, I was keeping the other guy’s picture always in my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s1487">That was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1488">Then when I found out that he is gone, then… but still I had it.</span> <span id="s1489">And once he found it and he was very jealous.</span> <span id="s1490">And I says, “Don’t be jealous, he’s not alive anymore.”</span> <span id="s1491">But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1492">You see, when I came back and I met him, and I knew that he knew that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1493">Because they knew I am alive.</span> <span id="s1494">I told them, that they send to everywhere names from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1495">Eisenhower, the United States.</span> <span id="s1496">So, he knew that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1497">I didn’t know he was alive.</span> <span id="s1498">And it was a very, to me it was like a very strange thing, that I have a husband, you know?</span> <span id="s1499">I have to now get to know him.</span> <span id="s1500">I was two weeks with him.</span> <span id="s1501">He got two weeks furlough and he had to go back when we got married in 1944.</span> <span id="s1502">February, when I was 24 years old.</span> <span id="s1503">We got married and after two weeks… everybody said to him, “You are absolutely out of your mind to get married in those times.”</span> <span id="s1504">But he didn’t want to tell the whole story, that I need another name.</span> <span id="s1505">So he came from Romania and we got married, but the day when I was 24 years old, and… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.</span> <span id="s1507">So, let’s backtrack a little bit, you, you needed to get, you wanted to get… was your main motivation to get married because you needed another name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: ….</span> <span id="s1509">a different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: So it wasn’t necessarily that you were in love with your husband at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s1512">He was in labor camp and I was with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1513">I absolutely didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s1514">I went with him about three weeks, when we got engaged and then they took him away.</span> <span id="s1515">And he was madly in love with me.</span> <span id="s1516">And I then I said, God, who knows whether he will stay with me?</span> <span id="s1517">He will go through that.</span> <span id="s1518">I don’t know what’s going to happen with me.</span> <span id="s1519">He had his parents still then.</span> <span id="s1520">For three more years he had his parents, because they were killed in 1944.</span> <span id="s1521">I says what are his parents going to say to it and that kind of a business, you know?</span> <span id="s1522">I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Did you have any kind of false papers at all before you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: False papers?</span> <span id="s1525">No.</span> <span id="s1526">I got the papers late.</span> <span id="s1527">I have it here, Christian birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1528">Because when he came to the ghetto, I think somewhere it’s there that a day before, when we were in the ghetto, and one day he comes to the ghetto and I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s1529">I says, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1530">He said, “We were just transferred to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1531">The company was transferred to Budapest and I am not with them because I am driving a horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s1532">I am in a private house with the horse and you come right away with me and my sister is going to send you a Christian birth certificate and until then you are going to stay with me there.</span> <span id="s1533">You stay where I stay with the horse.</span> <span id="s1534">And during the day, I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1535">And I said, “Where is it?”</span> <span id="s1536">He says, “Not far away from here,” he said.</span> <span id="s1537">I said, “Well if it’s not far away from here, why can’t you come tomorrow, that I should put something together, some clothes?”</span> <span id="s1538">And he just didn’t want to leave, and he says, “Okay,” he said, “but I must tell you something.</span> <span id="s1539">If somebody wants to get… put you in a train, don’t let you do it.”</span> <span id="s1540">They saw it, when they came already, what’s happening in the country.</span> <span id="s1541">I didn’t know what he meant.</span> <span id="s1542">When I learned what he meant, we were pushed by the Nazis with the machine guns, so how can you not let yourself, you know?</span> <span id="s1543">So he didn’t know either how is it, how they do it.</span> <span id="s1544">But he said, “Don’t,” anyway.</span> <span id="s1545">So he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Well, let’s get to that story a little later, and go chronologically and stay back at the time and tell me about the time, how it happened that you and Ferenz got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: When we got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: He came home for two weeks…</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: You were telling it off the tape, but tell it on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1552">So he came home, he got two weeks furlough and everybody was telling him that he was crazy to get married in those times.</span> <span id="s1553">But he didn’t want to tell the whole story to everybody, that I need another name to survive.</span> <span id="s1554">We thought that I need another name to survive.</span> <span id="s1555">And we found a Justice of Peace, who, when I was 24 years old, that day, we got married, because before then I couldn’t get married.</span> <span id="s1556">Only when you are 24 years old without father’s consent.</span> <span id="s1557">And they changed my father’s birth certificate to Romania, instead of Russia.</span> <span id="s1558">And so he was covered.</span> <span id="s1559">And he married us.</span> <span id="s1560">And my aunt, we had two witnesses, one was a distant relative and I don’t even know who was the other witness.</span> <span id="s1561">I have to read it from the certificate.</span> <span id="s1562">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1563">And we got married.</span> <span id="s1564">And my aunt made a big dinner for the family.</span> <span id="s1565">And they send us to the city, to a very nice hotel.</span> <span id="s1566">And we went to the hotel and I was just very, very afraid because they constantly were checking on people and asking for their identifications.</span> <span id="s1567">And especially at night when we went down to eat.</span> <span id="s1568">And I says, “I cannot swallow, I can’t.</span> <span id="s1569">I’m so afraid here,” so, but we stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s1570">And next day we left and it wasn’t too far away from my cousin where I met my father.</span> <span id="s1571">That hotel wasn’t too far away.</span> <span id="s1572">And I remember that we went to that cousin, to his wife.</span> <span id="s1573">He didn’t know my husband.</span> <span id="s1574">And they didn’t come even to the wedding because it was in Budapest, that was in outskirts and they were already very bad times, so it was no traveling.</span> <span id="s1575">So I introduced him.</span> <span id="s1576">I spend there about, we spent a day there.</span> <span id="s1577">And then we went back to my grandmother’s house and we stayed there for two weeks, until he stayed there.</span> <span id="s1578">And then he left.</span> <span id="s1579">And I stayed with my grandmother, later, not with my grandmother, but with my aunt, because she had the much bigger house.</span> <span id="s1580">So, we stayed with my aunt, not with my grandmother when we stayed.</span> <span id="s1581">It was with my aunt.</span> <span id="s1582">And I stayed with my aunt, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: With your aunt Ilona?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Ilona, with her.</span> <span id="s1585">The other one, the other aunt, she was a widow and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1586">We didn’t even go on one train with her.</span> <span id="s1587">Somehow she went with his aunt, with my husband’s aunt, together on a train.</span> <span id="s1588">She wasn’t with us.</span> <span id="s1589">Only Ilona, my grandmother, my uncle’s sister, my uncle’s sister’s husband, they 13-year-old, two 13-year-old boys, then the four years old boy and my uncle’s brother’s wife with the four-years-old boy.</span> <span id="s1590">We were together in one train.</span> <span id="s1591">That part of the family, but the rest of the family, they were in another wagon, not in that, you know?</span> <span id="s1592">My grandmother’s sisters, because they were all there, but not in the same wagon.</span> <span id="s1593">We were 80 people in one.</span> <span id="s1594">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: But before that you started living, you described how you were moving from house to house and then you started living with your aunt full time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: With my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Can you say something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Full time, the third year, my aunt said, “It’s enough.</span> <span id="s1599">It seems they are not looking for you.</span> <span id="s1600">It was enough, you are our child.</span> <span id="s1601">You will stay with us.”</span> <span id="s1602">And I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1603">Once I was very, very sick, my pulse went up to 160.</span> <span id="s1604">And they called their doctor.</span> <span id="s1605">And the treatment was so different that time.</span> <span id="s1606">I remember that I was in bed and they rented from a medical supply store a big, big bottle what was full with ice-cold water and it had tubes in it.</span> <span id="s1607">And that tube was put on my chest, on my heart and the water was circulating in it.</span> <span id="s1608">That was the treatment.</span> <span id="s1609">And that was… I thought it was a heart attack, because it didn’t want to go out.</span> <span id="s1610">For three weeks it didn’t go down, the pulse.</span> <span id="s1611">And then I had another thing in 1942, that was terrible too.</span> <span id="s1612">I had the appendix taken out and I couldn’t have it done under my name.</span> <span id="s1613">I didn’t go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1614">And I went with my mother’s, with my mother’s oldest sister, whose son was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1615">And I went under her name to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1616">It was a private hospital.</span> <span id="s1617">And the doctor was a private doctor, who, he was a gynecologist.</span> <span id="s1618">Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain and pain and he just couldn’t find out what is it.</span> <span id="s1619">And one day my husband was there visiting.</span> <span id="s1620">It wasn’t my husband at that time.</span> <span id="s1621">And I just was like in two, I had such a pain.</span> <span id="s1622">And his office was in my, my grandmother, where my grandmother lived, in that house was his office.</span> <span id="s1623">And I went to him and I said, “I tell you the diagnosis.</span> <span id="s1624">I tell you what I have.”</span> <span id="s1625">He says, “What, what are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s1626">I said, “That must be appendix.”</span> <span id="s1627">And he says, “God, you are right.”</span> <span id="s1628">And he took me to a private hospital to Budapest and they started to operate on me.</span> <span id="s1629">And it was under my aunt’s name.</span> <span id="s1630">I was Halas (ph).</span> <span id="s1631">That’s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada.</span> <span id="s1632">And I went under that name.</span> <span id="s1633">And the operation was so long, they didn’t know what happened there, that the doctors are running for more anesthesia.</span> <span id="s1634">And my aunt is standing there and didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1635">My appendix was completely, completely curled up with my colons and it was a very, very long operation.</span> <span id="s1636">And my heart, it was weak.</span> <span id="s1637">They took me home by ambulance after.</span> <span id="s1638">But next morning, six o’clock in the morning, the doctor is there.</span> <span id="s1639">And he lived, that was in Budapest, in the city, the hospital.</span> <span id="s1640">And we lived in New Pest, so it was a big distant.</span> <span id="s1641">I says, “I am so sick that you are here?”</span> <span id="s1642">He says, “No, no, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1643">I just wanted to know how you feel.”</span> <span id="s1644">Then I found out what was happening and they had to take me home by ambulance.</span> <span id="s1645">And it was in ‘42.</span> <span id="s1646">And in ‘44 I have an unusual big cut and that’s how I went to Mengele.</span> <span id="s1647">So I thought that that will matter when he sees that.</span> <span id="s1648">But you know what was interesting?</span> <span id="s1649">That I had a friend, she was a woman, who had a mastectomy and she survived.</span> <span id="s1650">And Mengele saw it and she survived.</span> <span id="s1651">So they were very odd things.</span> <span id="s1652">And she came to Canada and she died in Canada.</span> <span id="s1653">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1654">Her son is an engineer.</span> <span id="s1655">He and my cousin, in Hungary, they went together to the… they started the engineering college together.</span> <span id="s1656">Her son and my cousin, who is in Canada, that lady’s son.</span> <span id="s1657">And they lived in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1658">And my cousin lived in Montreal at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1659">He went to McGill (ph) to finish his degree.</span> <span id="s1660">And we went to visit her, the lady, and she was alive for a few years.</span> <span id="s1661">And once her son had to go to Paris, to France for business.</span> <span id="s1662">I don’t know what kind of engineer is he, because mine is a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s1663">I don’t know what kind of engineer he… and while he was away, she got the pneumonia and she died.</span> <span id="s1664">They had to call him home.</span> <span id="s1665">She lived together with the son and with daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s1666">She married a Hungarian girl.</span> <span id="s1667">He wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1668">She was Jewish, the woman.</span> <span id="s1669">Her husband wasn’t Jewish, so the son wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1670">So she married a Hungarian, non-Jewish girl, who was already in Canada at that time.</span> <span id="s1671">And she spoke perfect French and she worked for the telephone company.</span> <span id="s1672">Very nice person.</span> <span id="s1673">We went there three times to visit her.</span> <span id="s1674">And for longest time, they couldn’t… he retired.</span> <span id="s1675">They couldn’t sell their house.</span> <span id="s1676">And two years ago they wrote me a letter, “Finally we sold the house and we moved to Kingston.”</span> <span id="s1677">It’s Canada, but it’s very close to the border.</span> <span id="s1678">And it’s a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s1679">And they live there.</span> <span id="s1680">They have two children.</span> <span id="s1681">And he said, “My son married a French woman with a daughter.”</span> <span id="s1682">The son.</span> <span id="s1683">A French woman, who has a daughter.</span> <span id="s1684">And the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she was a premature baby.</span> <span id="s1685">And she was very small, so they didn’t know that she survive.</span> <span id="s1686">She survived and she went to college and then she became the hostess on the Canadian Cruise Line, for… I don’t know how long she did it.</span> <span id="s1687">They were always… every Christmas they write me and I write them.</span> <span id="s1688">That’s how I know about them.</span> <span id="s1689">But when they lived in Montreal, they went, many times, my cousin and they were friends.</span> <span id="s1690">But since that time, I know only from Christmas cards what is happening to them.</span> <span id="s1691">And what’s interesting, my cousin’s son went to McGill, too.</span> <span id="s1692">And they live in Toronto.</span> <span id="s1693">But they stayed there and he went to McGill.</span> <span id="s1694">And he finished psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1695">And he wants to… I don’t know how they are doing it, it’s not a bad idea… be a lawyer and a psych, psychologist, psychologist and a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1696">So, he’s going to law school in Kingston, where they live now.</span> <span id="s1697">You know.</span> <span id="s1698">The father’s friends.</span> <span id="s1699">He’s going to Kingston, to law school.</span> <span id="s1700">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1701">I don’t know whether they see each other.</span> <span id="s1702">I don’t know what he was writing me about it.</span> <span id="s1703">I have to call them Sunday, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1704">I call Sundays only because it is cheaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Tell me, going back to wartime, where were you on the day, or do you remember the day that the Germans invaded Budapest in March of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Yes, of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Can you describe that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Oh, that was horrible.</span> <span id="s1709">I was in my grandmother’s house and we… we didn’t have televisions that time.</span> <span id="s1710">We just had radios.</span> <span id="s1711">We didn’t have televisions.</span> <span id="s1712">We just heard it on the radio, and how do we see it?</span> <span id="s1713">Because we saw them marching in.</span> <span id="s1714">And I don’t remember how did we see it, because we didn’t have televisions.</span> <span id="s1715">But I know and I see with my eyes how they marched into Budapest and where they stopped in the middle where it is divided, the Danube divides the city, you know?</span> <span id="s1716">Into two parts.</span> <span id="s1717">And they stop there, and right a way the Hungarian Army, right away, they went to greet them, and cater them, and did whatever they want even more.</span> <span id="s1718">Because they would never find out nothing if those countries wouldn’t help them, what they occupied.</span> <span id="s1719">Because they, who, which German knew for instance, that my sister-in-law was married, that she was once Jewish?</span> <span id="s1720">Who knew it?</span> <span id="s1721">Only the Hungarians who live there and they went and told on them.</span> <span id="s1722">That here is a couple who was married, converted and who was married to… and then they came, the Germans and the Hungarians together to look for her.</span> <span id="s1723">They did it themselves, the Hungarians, and they did it, I’m sure, in every country.</span> <span id="s1724">Otherwise how would the Germans know whom to take, who was the rich man, whom to call to the department, to their offices, whatever, and torture them?</span> <span id="s1725">How would they know?</span> <span id="s1726">Because they help them.</span> <span id="s1727">Because they were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1728">We didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Let me ask you something kind of funny, question.</span> <span id="s1730">How did you feel about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Klingel (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Oh, the last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: You know, I’m constantly thinking about it, since I’m talking to you.</span> <span id="s1734">You know the boy’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: What was it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Klingel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: And his first name was Nicholas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: And he had a nickname, Mitza (ph).</span> <span id="s1739">Was very, very good looking.</span> <span id="s1740">I think he was the best-looking Jewish boy in the city.</span> <span id="s1741">Very nice boy.</span> <span id="s1742">Very nice, respectful, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1743">And the parents, that’s interesting, too.</span> <span id="s1744">That they moved then, after the war they moved to Prague, the parents and the sister.</span> <span id="s1745">And my friend, who is now in Brooklyn, whose husband was a dermatologist, her children went, she gave them lessons, piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1746">His sister gave them piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1747">And they were saying it, I should have known that he would marry me.</span> <span id="s1748">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1749">That’s what they were saying, the parents.</span> <span id="s1750">And he was telling me, that he cannot talk about marriage, because he is working for his father.</span> <span id="s1751">He is not on his own.</span> <span id="s1752">And then they blame me, that I should have known.</span> <span id="s1753">We never spoke about marriage, only that one time he said that “I’m not talking about marriage, because, until I am not on my own.”</span> <span id="s1754">You know?</span> <span id="s1755">Probably they were against me.</span> <span id="s1756">I wasn’t a wealthy girl.</span> <span id="s1757">And she went with a… she left a girl for me, who was a bank director’s daughter, very wealthy daughter, very wealthy girl.</span> <span id="s1758">And he went with her and she left her because of me.</span> <span id="s1759">And then the parents were saying, my friend was telling me, that they were… the sister was telling it, that I should have known.</span> <span id="s1760">What did they know what went on?</span> <span id="s1761">I was introduced to his sister once.</span> <span id="s1762">I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1763">I was, I didn’t want… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1764">And once he went to swim in the summer and there is his sister.</span> <span id="s1765">And he did it by purpose, that she should know me, the sister.</span> <span id="s1766">And one day then, before he went away to, I don’t know where, the army.</span> <span id="s1767">And he left a book with me and I didn’t finish it.</span> <span id="s1768">And he said, “You bring it back to my mother.”</span> <span id="s1769">I was shaking, you know?</span> <span id="s1770">I was never in their house and I was shaking.</span> <span id="s1771">And I was so clumsy that I went upstairs, and she was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s1772">And in the hallway and I gave her the book.</span> <span id="s1773">And she was very nice and I was so nervous that I… she had some kind of a flower pot and I pushed it with my hand.</span> <span id="s1774">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1775">It broke.</span> <span id="s1776">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1777">It was very uncomfortable to meet them, because I had always a feeling that they are against me.</span> <span id="s1778">You know?</span> <span id="s1779">He would never, never say to me that, but I had a feeling that the parents were against me, because I wasn’t in their category.</span> <span id="s1780">And she left that girl, who was wealthy, because of me and that was my feeling about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Did you think about him a lot?</span> <span id="s1782">Afterwards when you were in hiding, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: When I was hiding?</span> <span id="s1784">About him?</span> <span id="s1785">I already knew that he’s dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: When did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: 1942.</span> <span id="s1788">In 1942 I found out through friends from Uzhorod, that all that, I don’t know how many friends together there went.</span> <span id="s1789">They took them to Russia.</span> <span id="s1790">And that maybe they killed them the same way as my parents.</span> <span id="s1791">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1792">They put them on the trains and they were in labor camp and that they were killed in 1942.</span> <span id="s1793">I really didn’t know about to whom first, you know?</span> <span id="s1794">To think about my parents, to think about him, to think about my husband, my future husband.</span> <span id="s1795">I really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1796">I was terribly mixed up, terribly.</span> <span id="s1797">And always worried, terribly worried.</span> <span id="s1798">That fear was unbelievable, that now they are going to get me, now they are going to… because I saw what they are doing.</span> <span id="s1799">If you didn’t wear the star, for instance, the Hungarian knew you.</span> <span id="s1800">And that was only in ‘44, when we had to start to wear the star, when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1801">But still, if you, I didn’t look Jewish, I could have gone wherever, but they knew me and they could tell it to please the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Did you think about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: That time?</span> <span id="s1804">I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1805">I couldn’t think different way.</span> <span id="s1806">I knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1807">I knew that I am in trouble with all other Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: I never thought about converting.</span> <span id="s1810">It wouldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s1811">Conversion.</span> <span id="s1812">It wouldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s1813">But I found lately, I found that Christian… I don’t even know whether I told George, because the last time when my husband went to Hungary—he went many times when he was retired—he went to Hungary because his sister was very sick for years and he said, “I want to see my sister.”</span> <span id="s1814">But his excuse was, because we had two little children buried there, he went to the grave.</span> <span id="s1815">And I was saying always, “Frank, they are in our hearts, those are only stones.”</span> <span id="s1816">I couldn’t say he wants to see the grave.</span> <span id="s1817">He wants to have it redone, the letters if they were in bad shape or whatever.</span> <span id="s1818">But his sister, he had that only sister and she was very, very sick, but her son-in-law was a doctor and he kept him alive, her alive.</span> <span id="s1819">And he was telling me, “If not me, she would be dead ten years ago.”</span> <span id="s1820">I think she had cancer of the liver, because on the end they had to operate on her.</span> <span id="s1821">And I saw her, the last time I saw her, that summer in ’89, and January she died.</span> <span id="s1822">And we came back in 1990, January.</span> <span id="s1823">They had to… she became yellow and he couldn’t help her anymore.</span> <span id="s1824">But he was telling me himself, if not me… because my niece was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1825">She called him from every meeting and everywhere, “Come right away because mother has fever,” and right away the injection.</span> <span id="s1826">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1827">She was a very good daughter.</span> <span id="s1828">And I was surprised how he was talking to him over the phone.</span> <span id="s1829">I says, “Marie,” her name is Anna Maria, “everybody can hear you.”</span> <span id="s1830">“I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1831">My mother comes first,” and that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s1832">So, he kept her alive, really.</span> <span id="s1833">My husband went to see her every year, and that year when he went, in ‘82, in ‘81, February, he had a heart attack, and he lived 17 months.</span> <span id="s1834">And in ‘82, June, he says, “I’m going to see my sister.”</span> <span id="s1835">And I spoke, I knew that three-quarter of his heart was gone.</span> <span id="s1836">And I spoke to his doctor, I says, “What should I do?</span> <span id="s1837">How shall I tell him that he cannot go?”</span> <span id="s1838">He says, “You know what, he can go.</span> <span id="s1839">He has a doctor there.</span> <span id="s1840">He will be safe.</span> <span id="s1841">But he cannot go rowing around nowhere in Europe.</span> <span id="s1842">He goes to one place and he can go.</span> <span id="s1843">And June 13th is his birthday, but I called him many times.</span> <span id="s1844">But I called him on his birthday.</span> <span id="s1845">I’m sorry, June 17th.</span> <span id="s1846">He was born, 1913, 17.</span> <span id="s1847">And I called him and he says, “I feel wonderful.</span> <span id="s1848">I feel very good,” and I always gave the report to the doctor, because he was from the same hospital were I worked, the doctor.</span> <span id="s1849">And he says, “Yes, he has around him more sick people than he is, so he’s feeling fine.”</span> <span id="s1850">And he came home and every first of July, we went out to the country house.</span> <span id="s1851">They were there already, here in 1979.</span> <span id="s1852">And we met there and I spend one week vacation there, because Ilona was born third of July.</span> <span id="s1853">And we spend her birthday.</span> <span id="s1854">And my husband came back end of June to spend the week in the country for her birthday.</span> <span id="s1855">And after that, we supposed to go to Canada, all of us by car.</span> <span id="s1856">And he said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1857">I came from a big trip.</span> <span id="s1858">You go with them to Canada.”</span> <span id="s1859">And she was pregnant with Anna that time.</span> <span id="s1860">She was pregnant with Anna, Ilona.</span> <span id="s1861">She knew that he wanted, because he always wanted children and the two died.</span> <span id="s1862">He always wanted children, so at least George should have more children.</span> <span id="s1863">So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1864">He said, “You go to Canada and I go home.”</span> <span id="s1865">And he was alone, traveling home.</span> <span id="s1866">And then I got a call from him in Canada that please bring a present to one of my co-workers.</span> <span id="s1867">I says, “Why to her?”</span> <span id="s1868">She says, “Because I was sick and she took me to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1869">So we packed and we came right back.</span> <span id="s1870">He was a few days in Intensive Care or in Coronary Care, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1871">He didn’t feel well.</span> <span id="s1872">And August 12th, August 12th, he died.</span> <span id="s1873">And I wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s1874">I was working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled.</span> <span id="s1875">And he was very upset about that and he came with me.</span> <span id="s1876">I went by bus.</span> <span id="s1877">They had private buses, because I went to the city periodontist.</span> <span id="s1878">And he came to the door and he looked so beautiful.</span> <span id="s1879">He had brown pants and a yellow shirt on.</span> <span id="s1880">And he said, “Nothing, nothing hurts me,” because he had back trouble, too.</span> <span id="s1881">He had a spine operation.</span> <span id="s1882">He said, “Nothing, nothing hurts me.”</span> <span id="s1883">And you know, you don’t think if it’s about your own, that the last day when you live, nothing will hurt you.</span> <span id="s1884">And that’s true.</span> <span id="s1885">But you just don’t think.</span> <span id="s1886">And I’m so happy that he said it… End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: …Szekely, took a little break for a few weeks there.</span> <span id="s1888">And now I wanted to just ask you, because I was reviewing the interview that we did last time and going over it, I had a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s1889">And one of them was, right at the beginning you were talking about the cousin of yours, who was the painter, who lived in Odessa.</span> <span id="s1890">And I wanted to make clear, was it his daughter that came over and stayed with you?</span> <span id="s1891">It was his daughter?</span> <span id="s1892">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: It was his daughter that came over and stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1894">We had an apartment here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: You told the whole story, so I don’t want you to go through that again.</span> <span id="s1896">But I just wanted to clarify…</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: It was my cousin’s, my father’s brother’s daughter and her family.</span> <span id="s1898">And he, himself, lives in Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1900">Did he come over at the same time as her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1902">He came over five years ago, six years ago because he is a citizen already, so it has to be five years ago.</span> <span id="s1903">He became citizen last year, ‘99.</span> <span id="s1904">So, five years ago, because he came with his sister and sister’s family.</span> <span id="s1905">Husband only, sister’s daughter and husband, because the husband had the parents there.</span> <span id="s1906">And they always, he and his sister lived always together and a niece and a husband.</span> <span id="s1907">So he belonged with them.</span> <span id="s1908">I couldn’t bring him, because only you could bring parents or sisters or brothers.</span> <span id="s1909">So, he went with them because he lived with them and he had his son… it’s not brother-in-law actually, because his husband… they had the parents there already, and through them.</span> <span id="s1910">That’s why he didn’t come here.</span> <span id="s1911">But his aim was if his daughter is here and their family is there, everybody to be in Kentucky together.</span> <span id="s1912">That’s what he wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: And tell me what his full name is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: He is, Isislav (ph) Klugman.</span> <span id="s1915">That was my maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: I see, so he was your father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: My father’s brother’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Okay, and we, last time we were going over mostly some questions about your childhood and some things that weren’t covered in the interview that the Shoah Foundation did.</span> <span id="s1919">And what I wanted to do mostly today is to talk about your experiences after the war, after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1920">But one of the things that wasn’t clear to me from the Shoah Foundation interview was, tell me if I have this right, when you were on the transports from Hungary to Auschwitz, you were with your grandmother and your Aunt Ilona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: With my Aunt Ilona and other aunts, too and her son.</span> <span id="s1922">My mother had four sisters, so I was with three of them.</span> <span id="s1923">But the closest was to me always Ilona, because when they took my mother and they killed them in, my parents in 1941.</span> <span id="s1924">So, she was the one who was unbelievably helping me.</span> <span id="s1925">And then the last year, before the Nazis came in, she didn’t let me go to hiding and she said, “You are our child, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1926">You stay with us.”</span> <span id="s1927">And so for one year I was with them until they took us all.</span> <span id="s1928">And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but not her son.</span> <span id="s1929">And my son was born.</span> <span id="s1930">To my son she was like a grandmother.</span> <span id="s1931">So when we left, we left to Vienna and we left them in Hungary, but we knew that they are coming after us, three weeks.</span> <span id="s1932">Because they had, they were elderly people already and they had visa to Israel and England and we knew that they are going to come.</span> <span id="s1933">And the time came then we came to America and we left them there.</span> <span id="s1934">And my son, he was so blaming me and he was so crying.</span> <span id="s1935">How can I do it, to leave them there?</span> <span id="s1936">He was nine years old.</span> <span id="s1937">He was the only relative whom he knew.</span> <span id="s1938">Like, she took care of him when I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1939">Because under the communism we had to work.</span> <span id="s1940">And she was everything to him.</span> <span id="s1941">And my heart was going out and I was explaining to him, “When we get to America and we become citizens we are going to bring…” and that was the plan, that we are going to bring them over.</span> <span id="s1942">But she died, unfortunately, from a gall bladder operation.</span> <span id="s1943">But I think that she had already liver cancer, but they don’t tell me, because nobody dies from a gall bladder operation.</span> <span id="s1944">It must have gone to the liver and the operation was okay.</span> <span id="s1945">She was alive for a few days.</span> <span id="s1946">And one day my uncle and his brother went to visit her.</span> <span id="s1947">They went every day, but one day when they went, she was dead.</span> <span id="s1948">I didn’t go, to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1949">Because we were here in ‘58 and that was in ‘63 and in ‘59 I got a job in the hospital when I was working and I says, “We don’t have either the money for the three of us to go,” so we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1950">But it was in the summertime and George was with some of our friends in the country.</span> <span id="s1951">They were having a bungalow they rented and we went over on the weekends.</span> <span id="s1952">We went to Poughkeepsie.</span> <span id="s1953">And he was there and I was afraid to tell him.</span> <span id="s1954">I was afraid to tell him.</span> <span id="s1955">And he wrote to his pediatrician in New York, who was the head of the Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and asked him to find out from me the truth, because he thinks that something is very wrong.</span> <span id="s1956">And he showed me the letter and he said, “You have to tell him.”</span> <span id="s1957">So, I was very, very upset to tell him.</span> <span id="s1958">And I found it out, my husband did, he got the letter and he didn’t want to tell me.</span> <span id="s1959">And we are driving out to the country and when he told me, we made an accident with the car.</span> <span id="s1960">I was, you know, so upset, we made… and it was an old car and we had the first car.</span> <span id="s1961">It was a big Pontiac.</span> <span id="s1962">But somebody ran into us.</span> <span id="s1963">It wasn’t our fault, and he ran away.</span> <span id="s1964">The guy ran away.</span> <span id="s1965">But I was so upset that how I am going to tell him, because it was like the end of the world.</span> <span id="s1966">He didn’t know no one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brother, my uncle’s brother lost his four-years-old child and the second wife never could have children.</span> <span id="s1967">So he’s named after my, Ilika’s son, he was George, too.</span> <span id="s1968">And he was everybody’s child, only child.</span> <span id="s1969">And when I had the other little boy, he was five months old when he died.</span> <span id="s1970">I named him after the four-years-old, who died.</span> <span id="s1971">He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: At one point in Auschwitz, you told in your interview with the Shoah Foundation about how you arrived in Auschwitz and how you were there for, I think two weeks before you were given your tattoo and before you started working.</span> <span id="s1973">When were you separated from Ilona?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Three weeks later.</span> <span id="s1975">She was, when we went to the barracks, she was put in the next barracks.</span> <span id="s1976">Because they put 60 people in one and she would be the 61.</span> <span id="s1977">So she was put in the next barrack.</span> <span id="s1978">But when I came back from work, they didn’t get food, those people who didn’t work and I gave them my half of the bread and I dressed them up.</span> <span id="s1979">I’m saying “them,” she was there with one of her friends, who had two twin sons and they are alive.</span> <span id="s1980">They went through all the… I told you that, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: No?</span> <span id="s1983">She had two twin sons, her friend and they went through all, all the experiments with Mengele.</span> <span id="s1984">They are alive.</span> <span id="s1985">They are in Israel.</span> <span id="s1986">One is in high… he has, I don’t know what kind of position, but they are not men.</span> <span id="s1987">They cannot get married, that’s what they did to them.</span> <span id="s1988">And I met them when I was in 1976, I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s1989">And that was one… we went to restaurant and my uncle’s brother was there with his second wife, who is alive and she is in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1990">She married him when George was born, the second wife.</span> <span id="s1991">And she was much younger than he was.</span> <span id="s1992">He wanted children and she couldn’t have children.</span> <span id="s1993">When we went to the restaurant then, I didn’t know what’s the surprise.</span> <span id="s1994">My aunt’s friend was there with her husband and she said she would never forget it, what I did for them.</span> <span id="s1995">Because they were naked.</span> <span id="s1996">I was, but my aufseren (ph) and the forewoman, she let me take out clothes, because I told her that my aunt is in the next camp.</span> <span id="s1997">And she let me take out clothes.</span> <span id="s1998">And I dressed them and I gave them food.</span> <span id="s1999">And one day when Mengele came to the camp and he was sorting out, because he came every week and sorting out people.</span> <span id="s2000">We had to get undressed and walk around him.</span> <span id="s2001">He had a stick in his hand and he’s pointing one here, one there and I was one here.</span> <span id="s2002">I knew I go back.</span> <span id="s2003">And she was on the other side and I didn’t know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s2004">I thought she goes to gas.</span> <span id="s2005">I didn’t know about nothing else.</span> <span id="s2006">And I knew that that’s gas there.</span> <span id="s2007">It turned out that they took her to Theresienstadt with her friend.</span> <span id="s2008">And they were working at an ammunitions factory and at night they stayed at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2009">And only when I went back, I knew that she is alive.</span> <span id="s2010">And she was everything to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Why don’t we jump forward to that time, because you described the rest of that experience in your Shoah Interview.</span> <span id="s2012">And then you, so after the war eventually you returned to Budapest and you were reunited with your, with your Aunt Ilona and your husband.</span> <span id="s2013">Talk more about that time, talk about the reunions with those people and how you were feeling and what your thoughts were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: I came, I think that’s in it, when I came to our station, people were standing there and waiting for people to come, because in whole Europe they were waiting for people to come because they knew who is alive, because Eisenhower… that I said, that he made a list from everybody and send it to the places where they came from.</span> <span id="s2015">So, they knew I am alive after liberation, but I didn’t know about no one.</span> <span id="s2016">And when we got to our station, I saw there are many people and I didn’t know no one.</span> <span id="s2017">I was shaking and I went to one of them and I says, “Excuse me, do you know someone by the name of Eugene Schwartz?”</span> <span id="s2018">And he started to scream and he says, “You are Emilie?”</span> <span id="s2019">I says, “How do you know it?”</span> <span id="s2020">He says, “Your uncle is waiting for you every day.</span> <span id="s2021">He was here today, too, but he had to go for some kind of a business.”</span> <span id="s2022">I says, “Business?”</span> <span id="s2023">It was October fifth, ’45, and they were liberated in April already.</span> <span id="s2024">And he says, “I’m going to phone him.”</span> <span id="s2025">And I says, “Telephones?”</span> <span id="s2026">You know.</span> <span id="s2027">So, he came in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s2028">“He has even a car,” she said, he said.</span> <span id="s2029">And I knew that he doesn’t drive.</span> <span id="s2030">He had a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s2031">They were very wealthy people before the war.</span> <span id="s2032">And they started to pull themselves together.</span> <span id="s2033">And he came and we were just, we couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2034">We were crying and crying and crying.</span> <span id="s2035">He loved me very much and he was just crying.</span> <span id="s2036">And finally when we stopped crying, didn’t stop, but we could talk, he said, “Your aunt is alive, but not my son.”</span> <span id="s2037">But I knew that 13 years old wouldn’t be alive.</span> <span id="s2038">I had one of my uncles, my mother’s brother, that was the only man in the family, who was never married because my grandmother was 35 years old when she was a widow and left with five children.</span> <span id="s2039">And he didn’t get married because he was supporting the family and he wanted the girls to get married and probably… but he was never married.</span> <span id="s2040">He was 54 years old.</span> <span id="s2041">And he was in labor camp in Hungary, but at the last minute when the Germans left, they managed to take him and he was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2042">And he was alive.</span> <span id="s2043">And they all lived together when I came back.</span> <span id="s2044">And he came…</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Who all lived together?</span> <span id="s2046">What was the whole group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: My… Ilika, her husband…</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: I’m sorry, say the first one again, because the mike…</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Illie, Illie, Illie, Ilona, Ilona, Ilona.</span> <span id="s2050">Ilona, her husband, his brother…</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Give everybody’s names, if you would please?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: Laszlo, Laszlo was his name… Laszlo is Vladislav… I don’t know what is Laszlo in English.</span> <span id="s2053">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: Laszlo.</span> <span id="s2056">And my uncle, Joseph, they all lived together, because his brother wasn’t married yet.</span> <span id="s2057">He lost his wife and four-years-old child.</span> <span id="s2058">My uncle’s brother wasn’t married.</span> <span id="s2059">And they live, they lived, before the war, it was a beautiful new house.</span> <span id="s2060">And the two families, my uncle and his brother lived in one house, two exact, the same apartments, the most modern.</span> <span id="s2061">And the German soldiers were in it when they came back and they ruined the whole house.</span> <span id="s2062">So they had to re-do it.</span> <span id="s2063">So, they lived next door, was my uncle’s parents’ house.</span> <span id="s2064">And they lived… that was an older house, and they lived in that apartment in his parent’s apartment, my uncle’s.</span> <span id="s2065">And then we came, I came back, and my husband.</span> <span id="s2066">I think it is there how I met my husband when I came back.</span> <span id="s2067">Okay, so we stayed there, but only for a few days because it was no room for us.</span> <span id="s2068">So we went to Eger, to his sister, what is another city.</span> <span id="s2069">It is about, I don’t know how many miles away.</span> <span id="s2070">It was a very nice town.</span> <span id="s2071">I knew that town before the war, because I went to visit his mother there, his family, his mother and father, who lived already with his sister, who was converted.</span> <span id="s2072">That story is in there, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: You mentioned, you talked about the sister last time, last time we were here, his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2075">His parents lived there.</span> <span id="s2076">And part of the house was my husband’s house, because that house was inherited.</span> <span id="s2077">And there were other relatives there from that part of the family and they wanted the part of the house.</span> <span id="s2078">And they shouldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2079">My husband paid it out.</span> <span id="s2080">So a part, it was a very big house, it was his.</span> <span id="s2081">So we had like a separate apartment, but together with them.</span> <span id="s2082">The kitchen was together, but we had two rooms and after the two rooms was the big dining room what separated us.</span> <span id="s2083">And in that apartment his parents lived, because they took away their farms.</span> <span id="s2084">They were big farmers, not in Eger, it was in another city, I mean village.</span> <span id="s2085">And they took away everything from them.</span> <span id="s2086">They took away, it’s interesting, first the Romanians before, after the first war, they took away, then the Russians took away.</span> <span id="s2087">The Germans took away.</span> <span id="s2088">So, they went back and forth and on the end, the Germans.</span> <span id="s2089">When the Germans took away, they had to leave.</span> <span id="s2090">And they let them leave and they left to their sister and their daughter.</span> <span id="s2091">And their son-in-law couldn’t save them, but he saved his family, my sister-in-law and his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: I have a few questions about that time.</span> <span id="s2093">One, did you have any hope at all that your parents and your sister were alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Hope?</span> <span id="s2095">No.</span> <span id="s2096">After Auschwitz, no, but before Auschwitz, I thought that they must be somewhere alive.</span> <span id="s2097">And when we went to Auschwitz I thought we go somewhere, where I’m going to meet them.</span> <span id="s2098">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s2099">I think I said it then, that once I went to a fortune teller, I said it, and they said that my parents are alive, but they are very far away.</span> <span id="s2100">And it turned out that they were really alive when I found it out from the Museum.</span> <span id="s2101">Because I thought after I came back that they were killed right away in June, July, when they took them.</span> <span id="s2102">August 24th they were killed, according to the Museum.</span> <span id="s2103">And they showed me pictures and where they took them.</span> <span id="s2104">And they knew about it.</span> <span id="s2105">30, what did they say, 130?</span> <span id="s2106">I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s2107">How many people, one day they were killed, because they were not only from Czechoslovakia, that part where we lived, but they were from Romania, what belonged once to Hungary, where Elie Wiesel comes from.</span> <span id="s2108">They were people from there, too.</span> <span id="s2109">And they were there, too.</span> <span id="s2110">So they were, I think, 38,000 in one day they killed.</span> <span id="s2111">Because they took them to Poland first, no, I know from them.</span> <span id="s2112">And they didn’t know what to do with them because all the Polish people were in the ghettos and they didn’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s2113">That’s why they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Can you tell me when and how you found out what had actually happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Actually I found out in 1948, because one of my first cousins was taken in 1941 to… we didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s2116">They took him from the street in 1941.</span> <span id="s2117">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s2118">And he just disappeared.</span> <span id="s2119">And in 1948, he came back from Siberia.</span> <span id="s2120">And when he came back and we met, that was my first cousin, my mother’s sister’s son, and when he came back, he asked me, “Where are your parents?</span> <span id="s2121">What happened to your parents?”</span> <span id="s2122">And I was telling him that I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2123">I got a card from my sister from Kamenetz Podolski (ph) and she’s writing, “We are here.</span> <span id="s2124">We don’t know what are we going to do.</span> <span id="s2125">When do we get an apartment or something to eat.</span> <span id="s2126">We have no idea.”</span> <span id="s2127">And the card had a Hungarian stamp on it, so I assume that she sent it with a soldier, a Hungarian soldier, back.</span> <span id="s2128">And from then on I didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s2129">And then my cousin was telling me, “My God, I was there when those people were killed.</span> <span id="s2130">I was on a horse and carriage.”</span> <span id="s2131">He was in… he went to underground with the Russians.</span> <span id="s2132">And how, I don’t know up to today, how he was riding a horse and carriage, and he was there, he said.</span> <span id="s2133">He saved a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2134">He put them under the hay.</span> <span id="s2135">He had no idea that my parents were there.</span> <span id="s2136">That was the first when I knew how they were killed, in 1948.</span> <span id="s2137">And I was back 1945 already from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2138">And I still didn’t know what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: During those three years then, before you found out and after you got back did you make any effort to find out what had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: I didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s2141">We became right away communists.</span> <span id="s2142">In 1948 we were communists.</span> <span id="s2143">I didn’t know where to ask, no idea.</span> <span id="s2144">And George was born in 1946 and my mind was… I am not saying that I was happy, but you know, I was happy that I have a family.</span> <span id="s2145">I always wanted a family and I never knew that I can have a family.</span> <span id="s2146">I never knew that I can have a child anymore, so I was very happy that I had a child.</span> <span id="s2147">And I never knew.</span> <span id="s2148">Never, and I didn’t come with no one.</span> <span id="s2149">Because a lot of people I met from my, from the place where they were home when they took my parents.</span> <span id="s2150">I have in Brooklyn two friends, only two, who knew my parents, in this whole world, only two.</span> <span id="s2151">Those people knew my parents and my sister.</span> <span id="s2152">And they knew what was happening to the non-citizens.</span> <span id="s2153">Because we were not citizens that time.</span> <span id="s2154">We were Czech citizens, but the Hungarians took it over, so we were now citizens.</span> <span id="s2155">And those people were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2156">I don’t know, yes, they were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2157">Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2158">They weren’t Russians.</span> <span id="s2159">They took only the Russians, no other citizens.</span> <span id="s2160">And so they knew that they took them somewhere, but they didn’t know why, because I was questioning them in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2161">I said, “Did you know what happened to them?”</span> <span id="s2162">They said they never knew what happened to them, they just knew that the transport went and never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: And I wanted to go back again and ask you a little bit more about the time right after the war had ended and you returned to Hungary.</span> <span id="s2164">You talked about how you wanted to have a family.</span> <span id="s2165">What else, what were your hopes at that point?</span> <span id="s2166">Were you thinking about the future?</span> <span id="s2167">Did you want to stay in Hungary?</span> <span id="s2168">Did you and your husband talk…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: We couldn’t go, we couldn’t go, we couldn’t go nowhere.</span> <span id="s2170">We had to stay in Hungary.</span> <span id="s2171">It was no way under the Russians, that we could get… I got in touch with my uncle, here in America.</span> <span id="s2172">And he wanted us very badly, but it was no way that we… maybe old people got visas already at that time to Israel, but young people didn’t.</span> <span id="s2173">And we were young people, so it was impossible.</span> <span id="s2174">And then in ‘49, I had the other boy, so I didn’t even think about it that we should go anyplace, to try.</span> <span id="s2175">And we didn’t have a bad life until it was really communism.</span> <span id="s2176">Because I had a maid, sleep-in maid.</span> <span id="s2177">I didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s2178">And in 1948 when it was really communism, I had to let her go, the girl, and I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s2179">Because everybody had to show what they are living from, because my husband was in private business and he couldn’t show how much he is making.</span> <span id="s2180">And he made nice money.</span> <span id="s2181">But I had to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Did your husband lose his business at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: No, well he lost it after, yes.</span> <span id="s2184">After he lost it.</span> <span id="s2185">And he couldn’t get a job, because they said he is a Capitalist.</span> <span id="s2186">It was very hard for him to get a job on his profession, but then later on he got a job.</span> <span id="s2187">He got a job later on, but it was not a state job.</span> <span id="s2188">It was again private.</span> <span id="s2189">He went together with somebody and they had… he was actually, he finished business college, but actually what was his business before the war, he was [laughing], I have to always laugh that we eat the oats, because that they gave to horses in Hungary.</span> <span id="s2190">And he was in that business, feeding, oat feeding, because everything was horses, not cars.</span> <span id="s2191">The transportation was horses and it was a big business, the animal food for the horses.</span> <span id="s2192">And they connected with the, with the… gosh, with the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Stock?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Stock Market.</span> <span id="s2195">So he had a big business and he made a lot of money, but whenever he made the money, we bought a Persian rug or we bought silver.</span> <span id="s2196">I have 40 kilo silver stuff.</span> <span id="s2197">I had a beautiful case and it was everything silver in it, because we couldn’t show the money.</span> <span id="s2198">We couldn’t put it in the bank or something.</span> <span id="s2199">And then they didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s2200">They bother us in one way: that we had a big apartment.</span> <span id="s2201">Because when my aunt’s apartment was ready, they renovated it, we moved in, in the old apartment and it was a very big one.</span> <span id="s2202">I mean large rooms, there were three large rooms.</span> <span id="s2203">And actually the fourth one was a room, too, the foyer, because we had furniture in there.</span> <span id="s2204">And we had a kitchen and bathroom and we had a room for the maid from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2205">And the third room was a very big, it was so big that George when he was little, he could bicycle in it.</span> <span id="s2206">That was his room.</span> <span id="s2207">And they took away from us that room.</span> <span id="s2208">You know?</span> <span id="s2209">And they made an apartment from it, a one-bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s2210">And they put in a family, only with one son.</span> <span id="s2211">A family with one son.</span> <span id="s2212">It was so big that they made kitchen, bedroom, bathroom… I don’t know, I never went in, what is it.</span> <span id="s2213">They were our neighbors.</span> <span id="s2214">But otherwise, we didn’t have trouble.</span> <span id="s2215">They took away the business of my uncle.</span> <span id="s2216">He had 40 pairs of horses and two big trucks.</span> <span id="s2217">They were the first ones, because they were in… in… how do you call it, that business, when people moved.</span> <span id="s2218">It’s a moving, not moving, actually it’s not moving.</span> <span id="s2219">But with the horses, too, they were renting it or whatever, to companies.</span> <span id="s2220">And very, very big business.</span> <span id="s2221">40 pairs.</span> <span id="s2222">And when it happened, they took my husband and he worked for them.</span> <span id="s2223">He loved horses, that was his life, the horses, horseback riding actually.</span> <span id="s2224">He loved it.</span> <span id="s2225">And so he worked for them.</span> <span id="s2226">But then they took away the business from them, from my uncle, so he had to… they didn’t work anymore because they were elderly people.</span> <span id="s2227">And when the opportunity came after the Hungarian Revolution, my uncle’s brother escaped to Vienna with his wife.</span> <span id="s2228">And family is supposed to go after them, but we didn’t succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: You did tell that story.</span> <span id="s2230">So your husband, what was the name of your uncle, who your husband worked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: That was my uncle Eugene.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Okay, Ilona’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Ilona’s husband and his brother, they were together.</span> <span id="s2234">And that was the business what they inherited from their parents.</span> <span id="s2235">It was a very old business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: And is that the same uncle, your uncle’s brother, who got out after the Revolution?</span> <span id="s2237">Is that the same one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Okay, no.</span> <span id="s2239">He started to work with them too.</span> <span id="s2240">He was in an entirely… End of Tape 3, Side B Tape 4, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: My uncle, my mother’s brother was in labor camp in Hungary and when the Germans were leaving, they managed to take him to Germany and he was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2243">And one day I was prescribing, I got always the Smithsonian magazine and it was a picture there, a nice article about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2244">And the picture showed Buchenwald and a part of the bunk beds, a part of the, it was the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Ya, and on the end of one of the beds, on the end was, the picture, they were all looking in the camera because it was after the war, and it was marked, Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s2247">And on the other side there were three men, between them, it was my uncle.</span> <span id="s2248">I recognized him.</span> <span id="s2249">It was my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: And his name was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Joseph.</span> <span id="s2252">And when Elie Wiesel was here about, that’s now four, five… Ilona was a senior, that’s four years ago.</span> <span id="s2253">Four years ago, he was here in Lexington and he had a wonderful, wonderful speech.</span> <span id="s2254">It was the Jewish Federation and the UK, they did it together.</span> <span id="s2255">And it was in UK, in the Memorial Hall.</span> <span id="s2256">Before that, they had a dinner in the club, but it was 150 dollars a plate, and I didn’t have 150 dollars for a dinner.</span> <span id="s2257">And people were coming out and they were telling him what a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands with him.</span> <span id="s2258">And I was very upset that I know that man from my co-worker, who was a very good friend, her father was very good friend, her husband, of Elie Wiesel and I couldn’t see him.</span> <span id="s2259">I couldn’t talk to him.</span> <span id="s2260">So when it was everything over, Ana was telling me, “Wait, wait, maybe you can see it, go to his dressing room.”</span> <span id="s2261">So, a gentleman was standing there from UK, they didn’t let nobody to see him.</span> <span id="s2262">And I went there.</span> <span id="s2263">It was the rabbi’s wife, that time, Rabbi Slaten’s (ph) wife, and she was talking for me.</span> <span id="s2264">And she says, “Would you let that lady in only for a few minutes?</span> <span id="s2265">She is the only survivor here in Lexington and she would like to talk to him, only for a few minutes.”</span> <span id="s2266">So he says, “Yes, I will do it, but she has to wait until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody’s going, they want to go, too.”</span> <span id="s2267">So, I was waiting, I says, “I gladly wait.”</span> <span id="s2268">So, I was waiting and he helped me down the steps, because they were wooden steps in the basement.</span> <span id="s2269">It was the… I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2270">He says, “Yes, we are hiding people.”</span> <span id="s2271">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2272">And it was nothing to hold onto and they were wooden steps and he was helping me to go down.</span> <span id="s2273">And suddenly I came and the door is open and he’s standing there.</span> <span id="s2274">He was a very, very attractive man.</span> <span id="s2275">And my heart was beating, that I couldn’t say nothing, so I says, “Hello.”</span> <span id="s2276">He was very friendly.</span> <span id="s2277">I says, “Hello.”</span> <span id="s2278">He says, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s2279">I didn’t say even my name, I was so excited.</span> <span id="s2280">I says, “I am a Holocaust survivor and I am the only one here.”</span> <span id="s2281">He says, “If you are a Holocaust survivor, you must be from Europe.”</span> <span id="s2282">I says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2283">He says, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s2284">I says, “Budapest.”</span> <span id="s2285">He says, “Budapest?”</span> <span id="s2286">And he starts to talk to me, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2287">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2288">I said, “You speak still Hungarian?”</span> <span id="s2289">Because he didn’t, I mean, I don’t know where he learned, because where he was, they were very religious people, his parents.</span> <span id="s2290">And I think they spoke Yiddish and not Hungarian, but he spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2291">And he was 15 years old, maybe in school, correct, in school, probably he learned.</span> <span id="s2292">He spoke wonderful.</span> <span id="s2293">And he says, “No, I can, because I have no one to talk to.”</span> <span id="s2294">His wife is French.</span> <span id="s2295">I says, “Don’t tell me, you speak Hungarian.”</span> <span id="s2296">And from then on he spoke Hungarian to me.</span> <span id="s2297">And he asked me where I know him from.</span> <span id="s2298">And I mentioned his friend’s name.</span> <span id="s2299">And he says, “Korman!</span> <span id="s2300">(ph)” He says, “I saw him last week!”</span> <span id="s2301">That’s what he’s telling me.</span> <span id="s2302">I says, “Yes, because of you he didn’t want to retire to Florida, because he was often…” he lives in New York, actually, and teaches in Boston.</span> <span id="s2303">And they had from that part of the town, Sighet (ph), they had an organization.</span> <span id="s2304">And that my friend’s husband went always there because he loved him.</span> <span id="s2305">And she then was telling me what went on in that organization and what happened at that organization [laughing] when they were together, so I knew a lot about him.</span> <span id="s2306">And I was telling it to him.</span> <span id="s2307">He says, “Because of you, he didn’t want to move to Florida.”</span> <span id="s2308">He says, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2309">I saw him in Florida.”</span> <span id="s2310">When he was down in Florida, he saw him.</span> <span id="s2311">So he was very nice, and then he says, what I am doing, and I told him that I am talking in schools, and he says, “Wonderful.”</span> <span id="s2312">He says, “What grade are you starting?”</span> <span id="s2313">I says, “Sixth.”</span> <span id="s2314">He says, “That’s the right grade to start, don’t do younger ones.”</span> <span id="s2315">But I did, because they were begging me.</span> <span id="s2316">Lexington School for five graders.</span> <span id="s2317">Ana went to SCAPA, they were four graders.</span> <span id="s2318">They were begging me, especially in SCAPA, they were very smart kids.</span> <span id="s2319">And here too, in Lexington School, they are very, very… I spoke twice already there.</span> <span id="s2320">And now I, the teacher was always asking me whether I know a book for children.</span> <span id="s2321">I am reading now in a magazine that he, Elie Wiesel, wrote his first children’s book about the Holocaust with pictures.</span> <span id="s2322">So, I try to get that book and I try to call that teacher in Lexington School, because she is very intelligent.</span> <span id="s2323">She is teaching fifth graders.</span> <span id="s2324">And they understood it.</span> <span id="s2325">What kind of letters I got from them, from the fifth… I just cannot believe it, how they understood it and how sorry they are for me.</span> <span id="s2326">And they cannot believe it, that I lived through that.</span> <span id="s2327">Fifth graders.</span> <span id="s2328">So I tell you the truth, that I spoke about 150, 160 times since I am here.</span> <span id="s2329">That if I cannot do it, because I will be the most unhappiest person in the world, because I feel the commitment that I have to do it.</span> <span id="s2330">I still have to do it, because there are many, many people, who don’t know it still and those are adults, mostly adults.</span> <span id="s2331">The children are starting to know me in schools, because I go back always, because they are different classes, and most of them they know.</span> <span id="s2332">In the colleges, too.</span> <span id="s2333">I was all over in every college, Berea, Midway, and the private college, Transylvania, twice, UK three times.</span> <span id="s2334">Community college.</span> <span id="s2335">So, they know all ready.</span> <span id="s2336">But the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they don’t know.</span> <span id="s2337">So, I will be really… and even if they call me to schools, next graders who didn’t hear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I always think about it.</span> <span id="s2338">That it give me… I cannot explain it, when I talk, I am very enthusiastic and I live it through again.</span> <span id="s2339">That’s true.</span> <span id="s2340">And I have to take a tranquilizer, I must take before I go.</span> <span id="s2341">And I never spoke about my parents, because I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2342">I was always crying.</span> <span id="s2343">And lately I am even showing the pictures of my parents.</span> <span id="s2344">And if they give me enough time to tell them that story on the end, I am including it, what happened to them and I am showing their pictures.</span> <span id="s2345">And I was so relieved that I did it.</span> <span id="s2346">Okay, I didn’t sleep at night, but I was relieved that I did something good for them who died.</span> <span id="s2347">You know?</span> <span id="s2348">I took it in my head that they died and they won’t be at peace until the last survivor is going to tell their story.</span> <span id="s2349">It’s… I cannot explain it, what happened to me, because I never spoke.</span> <span id="s2350">I never spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: So, in those years immediately after the war that you were in Hungary, you didn’t speak about your experiences at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: I didn’t speak, even in New York, never.</span> <span id="s2353">New York, I didn’t have to, because there were so many, I never heard denial.</span> <span id="s2354">And here I started only because I heard denial.</span> <span id="s2355">In Hungary I never spoke about it because the Hungarians are very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2356">And they told you that “Too many of you came back.”</span> <span id="s2357">It’s a Catholic country.</span> <span id="s2358">I am not saying that the intelligent people, but I heard it from people saying it.</span> <span id="s2359">So, in Hungary, I even went to a doctor, I wanted to take off my number because it was so uncomfortable when I was holding onto the train.</span> <span id="s2360">I went to the city.</span> <span id="s2361">I worked for the book publishers, you know, the dictionaries.</span> <span id="s2362">And that’s where they were telling, they were looking at those numbers like, “I would kill you,” you know?</span> <span id="s2363">Maybe it was in me that I thought it, but no.</span> <span id="s2364">Even today, even I told you, I was in 1978, in Hungary with Ilona… 1978?</span> <span id="s2365">What am I talking about?</span> <span id="s2366">She was born in 1970.</span> <span id="s2367">1989 I was with her.</span> <span id="s2368">I told you that story, no?</span> <span id="s2369">And we lived there for months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: You mentioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: We lived, my sister-in-law was still alive at that time, my husband’s sister and she took an apartment for us, because they had only a one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s2372">A very beautiful place.</span> <span id="s2373">And he took us for an apartment, a rental, close to them.</span> <span id="s2374">And it was a woman, whose husband was a school principal, but they were divorced.</span> <span id="s2375">And she had a son, an engineer and he didn’t live home and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and a living room.</span> <span id="s2376">One bedroom was separate and then she had a room in Bolotow (ph), near Lake Bolotow (ph), that she went there.</span> <span id="s2377">If she rented the apartment she went there, that she shouldn’t be home.</span> <span id="s2378">But we were always begging her, that it doesn’t bother us, she should stay home.</span> <span id="s2379">Because she was the only person who spoke English and Ilona could spoke to her English.</span> <span id="s2380">She was the only person.</span> <span id="s2381">And she worked for the… she was babysitting in the Canadian Embassy for somebody.</span> <span id="s2382">So, she spoke English well.</span> <span id="s2383">We were glad when she stayed home and when she stayed home she went down and she brought us always fresh bread and milk, and she was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s2384">We didn’t speak about religion, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2385">And the last day, the last day before we left, she came to me and she said, “I didn’t sleep the whole night.”</span> <span id="s2386">I says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s2387">She says, “Because I just find out, I just notice your number that you are Jewish and I am Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s2388">Nobody knows it in the house.”</span> <span id="s2389">In 1989, nobody knows it in the house.</span> <span id="s2390">“They are suspicious,” she said.</span> <span id="s2391">But her husband, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2392">I don’t remember already her name.</span> <span id="s2393">But it was a Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s2394">But he changed his name because it was a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s2395">He changed it when he was a school principal.</span> <span id="s2396">And once, she was telling that she was here in America in Los Angeles for a month and she’s mentioning a name, who invited her.</span> <span id="s2397">And I knew them, those people, that they were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2398">In New Pest, you know?</span> <span id="s2399">But still I just didn’t realize it that she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s2400">And she wouldn’t ask me and I wouldn’t ask her.</span> <span id="s2401">But one day, she wasn’t home and I see… I took the mail, and a letter came from Israel.</span> <span id="s2402">And when I gave it to her, she right away put it in her pocket.</span> <span id="s2403">Because she knew that my sister-in-law was converted and married to a non-Jew and she got that apartment and she thought we are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2404">She was afraid to say that she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s2405">So then… it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2406">And when we came home, I sent her some nylon panty hose because she couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2407">And for two or three years I was writing her.</span> <span id="s2408">And I didn’t realize it, she said, “I mentioned to you so many times who took me, who took me, who invited me…” and her son was there too.</span> <span id="s2409">I don’t know how long he was in Los Angeles, in California.</span> <span id="s2410">And I didn’t realize it, he went out once with that man, but he was married.</span> <span id="s2411">And both of them, he and the wife, invited her, but I didn’t… you know?</span> <span id="s2412">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2413">I didn’t know him personally.</span> <span id="s2414">But I knew, and I knew his name, those people who were in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: So that’s the situation, and even today, they are hiding people, they are Jews.</span> <span id="s2417">They are… it’s no good, it’s still no good in Hungary.</span> <span id="s2418">Under the communism, it was no Jew, we couldn’t say, no religion.</span> <span id="s2419">They were forcing us to work.</span> <span id="s2420">A Jewish boss, he was forcing us to work on the Jewish holidays and he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s2421">And one day, I thought it?</span> <span id="s2422">I said it?</span> <span id="s2423">--One day… his secretary was a very nice person.</span> <span id="s2424">She was Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s2425">But many people worked there, they were all intellectuals, because they were… whatever we had intellectually, if it’s something medical, the doctors that were there and engineers or whatever.</span> <span id="s2426">It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2427">And he, on the biggest holiday, Yom Kippur, he called us to his office, me and his secretary and he made us eat.</span> <span id="s2428">He was in the Party, the Communist Party because of his job.</span> <span id="s2429">But who saw it?</span> <span id="s2430">Why did he have to do it?</span> <span id="s2431">I couldn’t go to the synagogue, so I went home by bus, I remember.</span> <span id="s2432">Because it was, we lived in New Pest and that was in mid-town.</span> <span id="s2433">We were passing the street where the synagogue is, I jumped off the bus at that station and after work I went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2434">And in the concentration camp I didn’t know that it’s holiday or not holiday, but the Polish people knew it.</span> <span id="s2435">And they were telling us when it’s Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s2436">They knew it from outside the world.</span> <span id="s2437">Because people who went to work outside, they somehow got in touch with Polish people.</span> <span id="s2438">And then they said that tomorrow is like Yom Kippur, so I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s2439">I was used not to eat, because eat, the food was only bread when we got off from the work, you know?</span> <span id="s2440">I was fasting there and I go back and I have to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: Did you have a sense of faith at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: At the camp?</span> <span id="s2443">I lost my faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: After…</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: In camp, I was always saying, “Where is God?</span> <span id="s2446">Where is God,” when I found out what is going on in camp, that they killed all the little kids.</span> <span id="s2447">And I says, “Where is God that he let, that he let it do those people?</span> <span id="s2448">Where is God?</span> <span id="s2449">Is it a God?”</span> <span id="s2450">I absolutely didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2451">I just… I was saying that too, always, that I was, at night when we couldn’t go out after work, when we were already inside, but if we had the chairs just to look outside and look at the stars.</span> <span id="s2452">And I was unbelievable homesick, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2453">And I was just always saying, I says, “My God,” –‘my God’ I didn’t say.</span> <span id="s2454">I just said, “Does Frank,” Frank was my husband, “see the same stars what I’m seeing?”</span> <span id="s2455">Terrible homesick, and never, never thought that I can survive from there.</span> <span id="s2456">Never.</span> <span id="s2457">It was so impossible, you know?</span> <span id="s2458">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s2459">First of all, I didn’t know where is Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2460">I didn’t know that we are close to Krakow, we are in Poland.</span> <span id="s2461">I knew that we were in Poland, but I had no idea where we were.</span> <span id="s2462">And I never thought that it can happen, that the Russians are going to liberate it and we have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: So after the war when you went to synagogue, did you just go because of tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2465">After the war, no, after the war, we lived under communism and we went to synagogue secretly.</span> <span id="s2466">And it was a, a nursery, a preschool in the synagogue, and George went there.</span> <span id="s2467">But it was everything secretly.</span> <span id="s2468">When he went to school he had no religion.</span> <span id="s2469">He wasn’t allowed to say that he has religion.</span> <span id="s2470">No religion.</span> <span id="s2471">When we went to Vienna, for 17 months we lived there.</span> <span id="s2472">He was the only Jewish kid there.</span> <span id="s2473">And they were suspicious because they were praying every morning.</span> <span id="s2474">And once the teacher called me, “Why does he doesn’t pray?”</span> <span id="s2475">I said, “Because he has no religion.</span> <span id="s2476">We lived under communism, that’s why he doesn’t pray.”</span> <span id="s2477">And every day I was dying until he came home from school.</span> <span id="s2478">I was so afraid what’s going to happen, that they find out that he’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s2479">It was terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s2480">Hitler came from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2481">I told you that.</span> <span id="s2482">That even in 1957, when we went to Vienna, the workers, when they worked, they started with a bottle of beer and “Heil Hitler.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: So, when you went, but did you go, you didn’t go to synagogue because you had religious faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: No.</span> <span id="s2485">When I went back and I found Illie, Ilona, when I find her and I find her husband, her husband, they weren’t, they weren’t religious.</span> <span id="s2486">They were religious and not religious.</span> <span id="s2487">We didn’t have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2488">So my sister-in-law managed to buy every year a… she was close to the countryside and everybody knew them there where they lived.</span> <span id="s2489">Her husband had a very big position with the state.</span> <span id="s2490">And he, himself, was an anti-Semite, my sister-in-law’s husband.</span> <span id="s2491">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2492">I was telling you about it.</span> <span id="s2493">Okay.</span> <span id="s2494">But they managed, somehow, I don’t know how… we got every year a pig.</span> <span id="s2495">Pig!</span> <span id="s2496">So, and it was a butcher, who came to the house, and they made for us and for Ilona, for them… my uncle wasn’t alive at that time, Joseph.</span> <span id="s2497">Because he was very religious, you wouldn’t believe it that he went with a little prayer book to Buchenwald and he managed to bring it back with him.</span> <span id="s2498">Because that time already, they weren’t killing there, in Buchenwald, when he got there.</span> <span id="s2499">And he brought it back.</span> <span id="s2500">He was very religious.</span> <span id="s2501">That’s why he stayed with us, and not with Illie, Ilona, because of the pork.</span> <span id="s2502">But we ate the pork, too.</span> <span id="s2503">We had it, too.</span> <span id="s2504">Especially when he died, it was… we ate it because there was nothing else, and we had food for the whole year.</span> <span id="s2505">George doesn’t know it.</span> <span id="s2506">He doesn’t remember it, so I am not telling it to him.</span> <span id="s2507">And I am not telling it even to the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2508">Ana is crazy when she would hear it.</span> <span id="s2509">She’s watching always what you are ordering.</span> <span id="s2510">She is… yeah.</span> <span id="s2511">But he was the president of the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping many, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2512">That time it was secret.</span> <span id="s2513">Secretly, they went through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2514">So, that way he was religious, but, you know?</span> <span id="s2515">But we couldn’t show it that we were religious or not religious.</span> <span id="s2516">But we ate pork.</span> <span id="s2517">But I got back my religion.</span> <span id="s2518">I got my belief.</span> <span id="s2519">I got it back slowly, slowly I got it back.</span> <span id="s2520">I was always thinking about my mother, how he taught us, she taught us to pray in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2521">And when we went to the synagogue like Friday night or something, I was always thinking about it, how we were crying, but every week we had to read one more page.</span> <span id="s2522">And it was so hard for us, myself and my sister.</span> <span id="s2523">And I was thinking about them.</span> <span id="s2524">And as I was thinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion.</span> <span id="s2525">And especially when I came to America.</span> <span id="s2526">When I came to America and my uncle was… he wasn’t, he ate everything.</span> <span id="s2527">I’m not saying that they didn’t cook pork, but he was religious.</span> <span id="s2528">And I remember him and my father when they were together and Passover, when they were together.</span> <span id="s2529">And every Saturday they went to the synagogue and then they came to us and they were singing after lunch those songs that you are supposed to.</span> <span id="s2530">And when I thought about those things it came back to me, you know?</span> <span id="s2531">It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2532">And now I love to go to the synagogue, and I am so heartbroken.</span> <span id="s2533">I wasn’t there now three weeks, I think.</span> <span id="s2534">I am missing it.</span> <span id="s2535">And I’m missing it.</span> <span id="s2536">We don’t have a rabbi now.</span> <span id="s2537">He left.</span> <span id="s2538">I loved him.</span> <span id="s2539">It’s interesting that he’s near Cincinnati and Ilona was teaching here Sunday school art for four years.</span> <span id="s2540">And now he’s teaching in his new… she goes down to the new congregation and she’s teaching, but only twice a month because it’s 40 miles away.</span> <span id="s2541">So, and it’s, but… she sees him.</span> <span id="s2542">And I cannot see them.</span> <span id="s2543">I was very good friends with… she’s a very young woman.</span> <span id="s2544">His wife is from Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s2545">He’s from Minnesota, the rabbi.</span> <span id="s2546">And his parents were Czechoslovakians, Czechs.</span> <span id="s2547">His father, I met his father many times, he’s an optometrist.</span> <span id="s2548">When he came visit he still speak Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s2550">The Rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: The Rabbi?</span> <span id="s2552">Slaten (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: And he was at the Orthodox, no it’s …</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Conservative.</span> <span id="s2557">Slaten.</span> <span id="s2558">He has three sons and he was here 11 years.</span> <span id="s2559">My grandson was the first Bar Mitzvah with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: About the question where was God, did you just stop asking it or did you come up with some kind of answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: No, I didn’t get no answer because I knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s2562">I didn’t get no answer.</span> <span id="s2563">But I was just always questioning, “Where is God?</span> <span id="s2564">Is there a God,” that’s what I was saying.</span> <span id="s2565">“Is there a God, does he see what’s happening?</span> <span id="s2566">Why, why is it happening?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Do you ask yourself those questions anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Yes I am.</span> <span id="s2569">Why did it happen, actually?</span> <span id="s2570">Why did it happen?</span> <span id="s2571">For those innocent little kids, what could they do?</span> <span id="s2572">What kind of sins they had?</span> <span id="s2573">Babies.</span> <span id="s2574">What kind of sins they had that it happened?</span> <span id="s2575">And then I am going back to Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s2576">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2577">So what was there?</span> <span id="s2578">They killed the Jews all over.</span> <span id="s2579">Always.</span> <span id="s2580">The Jews are always the [laughing]… for everywhere and everything they are blaming the Jews.</span> <span id="s2581">So, it’s no answer.</span> <span id="s2582">It’s no answer.</span> <span id="s2583">First the Blacks came and after that the Jews.</span> <span id="s2584">Some places they… when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks, then there are the Jews the first who are blamed for everything.</span> <span id="s2585">Why?</span> <span id="s2586">Does anybody knows why?</span> <span id="s2587">I lived under democracy in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2588">It was a real, real democracy.</span> <span id="s2589">Nobody knows what’s democracy.</span> <span id="s2590">Only if somebody lived under that time Masaryk and Benes.</span> <span id="s2591">They always said, “We cannot be anti-Semitic, never.</span> <span id="s2592">Because we have the brain, and we are businessmen and we are everything what the Jews are.”</span> <span id="s2593">So I was thinking about it, that it’s jealousy.</span> <span id="s2594">It was jealousy from Hitler that they, he took it from… they were supporting him, the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s2595">They made him big.</span> <span id="s2596">And then when he knew what they are doing and why, then they killed them and he wanted to have it.</span> <span id="s2597">Why are they anti, I don’t know, anti-Semitic here, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2598">I never heard it from no one, but I can imagine that the Southern Baptist are anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2599">I am thinking it only because I was invited [laughing] to every church, every denomination, but never to a Baptist church.</span> <span id="s2600">So it must be something against the Jews.</span> <span id="s2601">They won’t say it to your face, but it must be.</span> <span id="s2602">They know it.</span> <span id="s2603">They saw me in the paper.</span> <span id="s2604">They know it.</span> <span id="s2605">And I was never, never, and I was on every Christian church.</span> <span id="s2606">What is that?</span> <span id="s2607">How do you call it?</span> <span id="s2608">What is it?</span> <span id="s2609">And I’m telling it to the children.</span> <span id="s2610">I’m finishing my speech, and I’m saying it to them that why I am doing it, I’m doing it that you should learn not to hate and you should teach your parents not to hate, because I don’t think so that a little kid knows what is to hate.</span> <span id="s2611">It’s coming from somewhere, from the adults.</span> <span id="s2612">Correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Can you remember and describe the events of the 1956 Uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2615">In 1956…</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: From your perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: …Nixon was in Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s2618">And the students from university, they got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s2619">And what was discussed, what wasn’t discussed, I don’t know between them, but when Nixon left, next day, it was the Uprising.</span> <span id="s2620">The students, the college students, they took over the radio station.</span> <span id="s2621">That was the first.</span> <span id="s2622">We didn’t have televisions.</span> <span id="s2623">That was the first.</span> <span id="s2624">And the Russians actually never left Hungary and they were all over scattered in the woods and around.</span> <span id="s2625">But we didn’t see them in the cities, but they were there.</span> <span id="s2626">And it was communism.</span> <span id="s2627">And Nixon was telling them, “Do it.”</span> <span id="s2628">How do we know that?</span> <span id="s2629">Because the last Prime minister, Nagy, Imre Nagy, who was killed by the Russians.</span> <span id="s2630">He was on the radio and he was begging, he was begging America and he was begging Nixon, he was telling him, “Okay, do it.”</span> <span id="s2631">He thought that we get some help.</span> <span id="s2632">So they came in with their tanks and with their soldiers.</span> <span id="s2633">It was a war.</span> <span id="s2634">They bombed… End of Tape 4, Side A Tape 4, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: …the apartment that we lived in Budapest, yes.</span> <span id="s2636">We lived there.</span> <span id="s2637">And so when they came in in 19… no that was 1956, the uprising.</span> <span id="s2638">Up to that point it was all right.</span> <span id="s2639">We worked and we were communist, but we worked.</span> <span id="s2640">I mean, the wealthy people were very afraid and we were very afraid with my uncle, that they are going to take them.</span> <span id="s2641">Because they came at night.</span> <span id="s2642">They knocked on the doors, and taked people on they, on their cars, on their… the Russians, with machine guns.</span> <span id="s2643">And they took them to villages, and they took them to villages and they left them.</span> <span id="s2644">There were certain villages where they were designated where they took the wealthy people.</span> <span id="s2645">And they couldn’t come back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s2646">But thank God, thank God it never happened.</span> <span id="s2647">Because that was against… again, it was somebody had to tell them who are the wealthy people.</span> <span id="s2648">And they were in very good friendship with everybody from the higher-ups there.</span> <span id="s2649">Because that was a borough, New Pest, where we lived.</span> <span id="s2650">And like New York has five boroughs, the same thing Budapest has.</span> <span id="s2651">And so they knew everybody, and they were friends with everybody, and so nobody told on them, so they weren’t taken away.</span> <span id="s2652">Their business was taken away, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2653">They weren’t taken away.</span> <span id="s2654">What was done to them, they had to move together, the two families, in one apartment, because it was too big for two people.</span> <span id="s2655">Gorgeous apartment.</span> <span id="s2656">House.</span> <span id="s2657">And they took away they apartment and they had to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother-in-law, two brothers.</span> <span id="s2658">And they had to rent the upstairs apartment.</span> <span id="s2659">They decided that they’d take the first floor and the second floor, it was a doctor, a gynecologist with his family.</span> <span id="s2660">But they didn’t take them out.</span> <span id="s2661">And from that, that they take out many wealthy people, many wealthy people married non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, but it wasn’t a match.</span> <span id="s2662">Just only because those people were giving them stay, somewhere to stay.</span> <span id="s2663">Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a second cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mother were sisters, cousins.</span> <span id="s2664">I’m sorry, first cousins.</span> <span id="s2665">And she is the only one who survived from that family, nobody.</span> <span id="s2666">She had two uncles and the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmother and her grandmother were sisters and that’s how the mothers were first cousins, my mother and her mother.</span> <span id="s2667">And she was an only child and the only survivor.</span> <span id="s2668">She survived.</span> <span id="s2669">Her parents put her in a factory.</span> <span id="s2670">I didn’t tell you all that?</span> <span id="s2671">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2672">To a factory where they were making like General Electric.</span> <span id="s2673">They were making light bulbs.</span> <span id="s2674">It was Tungsraum (ph), it was a very well known company.</span> <span id="s2675">I think, in fact, now after the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric.</span> <span id="s2676">Something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2677">But young girls, they worked there.</span> <span id="s2678">And when they took her parents, she was working there and they slept there and everything.</span> <span id="s2679">So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work, when the work was finished, they let them go.</span> <span id="s2680">But they didn’t have where to go, because they were, nobody was there already, we were all gone.</span> <span id="s2681">And that’s… I think I, somewhere I said that story, that she was hiding.</span> <span id="s2682">One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go, to a woman, who was non-Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp.</span> <span id="s2683">And she had a house.</span> <span id="s2684">And she took in about eight people, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2685">It was a doctor, it was my cousins and her boyfriend and I don’t know, about eight people.</span> <span id="s2686">And she was hiding them.</span> <span id="s2687">I told that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: You did mention that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2690">So why did we say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: So, going back to the 1956 uprising… remembering the events of the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: …1956, okay.</span> <span id="s2693">They came in with their tanks and they were horrible.</span> <span id="s2694">They were raping girls, the soldiers, the Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Did you see that happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: No, no, but we were very worried, because we had a maid at that time.</span> <span id="s2697">We were very close to her.</span> <span id="s2698">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2699">I remember that it was George’s birthday and he wanted a car.</span> <span id="s2700">Before that he knew what he wants in the toy store and we went, we went there and stood on line to get him the car.</span> <span id="s2701">And the tanks were turned towards us.</span> <span id="s2702">The end was so close to us.</span> <span id="s2703">Every minute, or when we are standing for bread, the tanks were turned always to shoot us.</span> <span id="s2704">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2705">Then, one day, I don’t know what happened… not one day, they did it many times.</span> <span id="s2706">But they were very close to us and they were shooting during the night.</span> <span id="s2707">And we were in the apartment and basements were on the other side of the building, the basements, and we had to run to the other side with the children.</span> <span id="s2708">I had at that time my cousin’s, who was in Russia, his two daughters.</span> <span id="s2709">They were with us because they went somewhere for vacation and it happened under the vacation.</span> <span id="s2710">And they lived far, very far from us.</span> <span id="s2711">They lived in Buda, what was very far from us and they couldn’t pick up the children.</span> <span id="s2712">And they stayed with us, two little girls.</span> <span id="s2713">We had to go to the basement because they were shelling in the backyard.</span> <span id="s2714">Terrible.</span> <span id="s2715">I don’t know how many nights we spent in the basement.</span> <span id="s2716">When it stopped, when they already were in control, I don’t know how long it took them.</span> <span id="s2717">It took them a long time, and they were in control.</span> <span id="s2718">Then Austria opened the borders, their borders and people who lived close, they could just walk over to Austria.</span> <span id="s2719">And thousands and thousands, and mostly the peasants, because they were all farmlands around the border, you know?</span> <span id="s2720">They went all over to Austria and in Austria they put up camps for them and America was sending money for it.</span> <span id="s2721">We were far away, we couldn’t go, because we were 400 miles away from the border, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s2722">So we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s2723">That story is in.</span> <span id="s2724">How did I get out, and the Russians.</span> <span id="s2725">That’s in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: I wanted to ask you… we’ll go on to Vienna and then talk about your journey to the United States.</span> <span id="s2727">But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and your relationship with him, because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and then all of sudden you met him after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: He was a stranger to me in that way, that I knew him for three weeks, when he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s2729">And then he couldn’t marry me because I was underage.</span> <span id="s2730">And then they took him in labor camp.</span> <span id="s2731">He was away, and I don’t know, a few times he wrote me cards.</span> <span id="s2732">But I didn’t know what’s going to happen, whether he stays with me whether he will wait for me.</span> <span id="s2733">And he was four years in labor camps, so I didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s2734">But I really… that’s why I say that I really didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s2735">I told you about the other boy, whom I went with somebody for four years.</span> <span id="s2736">So, I was very mixed up.</span> <span id="s2737">I was very mixed up.</span> <span id="s2738">I don’t know whether I fell in love with my husband right away.</span> <span id="s2739">But my heart was broken when the other one find out and then wrote me a letter, “Why did I do it?”</span> <span id="s2740">If he would know that I need a name, he would marry me right away.</span> <span id="s2741">And… but it was late already, everything was arranged that he fell in love with me, my husband.</span> <span id="s2742">So… he was seven years older, and I knew he was very good looking.</span> <span id="s2743">And I knew who was the family, first of all, because my aunt and his aunt were very good friends.</span> <span id="s2744">So, I knew the family from my own… and I didn’t know what’s going to be, and when I met him, you know, when we came back, I was terribly crying and he was crying, too.</span> <span id="s2745">But he knew I’m alive.</span> <span id="s2746">He knew, because he knew months ago already when they got the notice.</span> <span id="s2747">But he was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2748">But I wasn’t sure whether he has somebody in between or not, though we got married.</span> <span id="s2749">We were married in 1944, in February, when we got married.</span> <span id="s2750">For two weeks we were together and that was that.</span> <span id="s2751">And I was always, you know, afraid that they are going to take me still.</span> <span id="s2752">I am married, but we went to a hotel, I remember on the marriage night.</span> <span id="s2753">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2754">We went down to eat.</span> <span id="s2755">It was in the city, a beautiful hotel.</span> <span id="s2756">And everybody constantly was afraid that they are coming and asking for identification and that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s2757">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s2758">So I said, “Let’s check out.</span> <span id="s2759">I don’t want to stay here.”</span> <span id="s2760">We went back.</span> <span id="s2761">We went back, and we stayed with my grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, too, with Ilona.</span> <span id="s2762">Ilika is a, in Hungarian, I don’t know what it is in any language.</span> <span id="s2763">If somebody has a name, they make it like softer.</span> <span id="s2764">Ilika is softer than Ilona.</span> <span id="s2765">You know?</span> <span id="s2766">But that’s from Ilona, so we called her Ilika.</span> <span id="s2767">And I was Milika, my name was Millie, I mean my nickname is Millie.</span> <span id="s2768">Nobody knew me as Emilie, only in school, and at work.</span> <span id="s2769">But otherwise, the whole family and my friends… and then we came to America, I didn’t know that it’s an American name, too.</span> <span id="s2770">And I never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s2771">It was always Emilie and that was it.</span> <span id="s2772">But my friends are still calling me Millie on the phone and my cousin and everybody is calling me.</span> <span id="s2773">I have a cousin in Canada.</span> <span id="s2774">My cousin who was eight years in Siberia, seven years, from ‘41 to ‘48.</span> <span id="s2775">He has a son.</span> <span id="s2776">And he escaped after ‘56, they sent him, the parents.</span> <span id="s2777">He went to University at that time already, two years as an engineer.</span> <span id="s2778">And he was, when he came back he was a communist.</span> <span id="s2779">He wasn’t a communist, he was in the party and because of that, that he was in Russia and spoke already Russian, he got a very big job in the Ministry.</span> <span id="s2780">He was… as an engineer.</span> <span id="s2781">He knew that he never can come to America, because he was in the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s2782">So when it was finished, the communism, when the… I mean, when they opened the borders, he sent his son alone to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2783">But he had to go to Israel, because the plan was that the parents are going to come after him to Israel.</span> <span id="s2784">They knew that he cannot come to America.</span> <span id="s2785">We weren’t here.</span> <span id="s2786">And so he went alone to Israel, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his mother, and he stayed with the friends.</span> <span id="s2787">And he went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer, too.</span> <span id="s2788">And the parents went after him, they got passport.</span> <span id="s2789">Parents and two sisters, who were born after he came home, the two sisters.</span> <span id="s2790">But he escaped with his mother’s mother—grandmother, grandfather and he—they escaped the middle of Budapest.</span> <span id="s2791">I don’t know whether you heard about Wallenberg, that Swedish man?</span> <span id="s2792">He was hiding them.</span> <span id="s2793">He was from that group and his mother, and his grandmother and grandfather.</span> <span id="s2794">Grandmother.</span> <span id="s2795">Grandfather died before they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s2796">The grandmother went with them to Israel and she died in Israel.</span> <span id="s2797">My cousin went with them.</span> <span id="s2798">I mean of course he went with them.</span> <span id="s2799">He died in Israel.</span> <span id="s2800">And it is very interesting that his father was in the First World War and he got… he was in Siberia, too, his father.</span> <span id="s2801">And he got a nerve disease, nerves.</span> <span id="s2802">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2803">I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s2804">That was my mother’s sister’s husband.</span> <span id="s2805">And he got the same disease in Israel.</span> <span id="s2806">He was a young man.</span> <span id="s2807">He was 60, 62 when he died.</span> <span id="s2808">And he got a job as an engineer, but in a different field.</span> <span id="s2809">It was a margarine factory where he was in engineering, like making colognes and that kind of, you know?</span> <span id="s2810">Entirely different.</span> <span id="s2811">But they were okay.</span> <span id="s2812">Her father gave a lot of money to Israel, so they were okay in Israel.</span> <span id="s2813">The two sisters, my cousin’s two sisters were in Israel, the two sisters.</span> <span id="s2814">And the mother, she was here.</span> <span id="s2815">When she was 75 years old, she came to Canada and she came to me here and it was winter and she says, “God, I love to see the snow.</span> <span id="s2816">I never snow since I am in Israel.”</span> <span id="s2817">It was a big snow when she was here.</span> <span id="s2818">And she spent her 75th birthday here.</span> <span id="s2819">And two years later she died.</span> <span id="s2820">She had diabetes and she didn’t take care of herself.</span> <span id="s2821">She ate everything in the world, but she lived well.</span> <span id="s2822">I spoke to her daughter and she said, “That’s the only thing, we are happy that she lived well.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: Let’s go back, because we got off the subject, you were talking about your relationship with your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: So again.</span> <span id="s2825">So, I wasn’t, when I came back.</span> <span id="s2826">So I said, this was a long, long time.</span> <span id="s2827">I don’t know, maybe he find somebody.</span> <span id="s2828">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2829">I was two weeks his wife, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2830">I got back.</span> <span id="s2831">I met him before they came, before they took us, he came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2832">I told you that.</span> <span id="s2833">But it was just that, nothing, no relationship, we just met.</span> <span id="s2834">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2835">And then he left the ghetto and five minutes later we were surrounded.</span> <span id="s2836">But he was telling me that, “Don’t let you take them to the wagons.”</span> <span id="s2837">I didn’t know what he’s talking about.</span> <span id="s2838">He saw it on the way from Romania, of course, Romania, it was near the border there where they were.</span> <span id="s2839">What they are doing, they’re putting people… and when the wagons came, I remembered his words, I says, “Don’t let you put yourself …” Does he know that there are guns involved here?</span> <span id="s2840">He didn’t know that it was done with machine guns.</span> <span id="s2841">But he told me that “You are going to get a Christian birth certificate and you come with me.”</span> <span id="s2842">It was true, everything.</span> <span id="s2843">I told you that I find the birth certificate here.</span> <span id="s2844">I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s2845">Last time when he was in Hungary he brought everything.</span> <span id="s2846">His sister was very sick for ten years, but her son-in-law is a doctor and he kept her alive.</span> <span id="s2847">Because he was telling me when we were there, if not me, she wouldn’t be alive anymore.</span> <span id="s2848">Because the daughter was always hysterical and even from meetings she called him.</span> <span id="s2849">He was in a hospital like here, Walter Reed.</span> <span id="s2850">He was there, a pathologist, under the Communism.</span> <span id="s2851">So, he had a big job.</span> <span id="s2852">And she called him, “Right away come and give mother injections,” she yelled.</span> <span id="s2853">And I was there when she did it.</span> <span id="s2854">And he right away left everything, came and gave her injections.</span> <span id="s2855">I think that she had liver cancer, that’s what I think.</span> <span id="s2856">Because she had diabetes, diabetes, I don’t know whether it counts for me, that that family had diabetes, but my father’s sister had diabetes in Russia.</span> <span id="s2857">So it was in the family.</span> <span id="s2858">I always forgot about it and when they were asking me, “Did anybody have it in the family?”</span> <span id="s2859">And I always say, “I don’t know, they were killed when they were 45 years old.”</span> <span id="s2860">And I know my grandmother didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2861">I know the other sister didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2862">At that time I probably… I didn’t know even that his sister had it, because she was writing, my father, always to his sister.</span> <span id="s2863">And he translated the letters to us, but I didn’t think about it, you know, that she had it.</span> <span id="s2864">And now he was telling me, my cousin, that she had even a leg amputated because of diabetes.</span> <span id="s2865">So it is in my family.</span> <span id="s2866">But I don’t know whether I got it.</span> <span id="s2867">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2868">Because it was really, I had such a good doctor for 27 years and he never said that’s diabetes.</span> <span id="s2869">Only my periodontist always said that I have diabetes because of my gums.</span> <span id="s2870">It was always, he said, “What are they talking about, you have diabetes?”</span> <span id="s2871">And he always said, “No, you don’t have diabetes, it’s just elevated because of the medications what you are taking.”</span> <span id="s2872">Here the urologist was arguing with me, that I don’t have… I had urinary tract infection.</span> <span id="s2873">And he said, “You don’t have diabetes.</span> <span id="s2874">What are they talking about?</span> <span id="s2875">Because it’s not in your urine.”</span> <span id="s2876">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s2877">Well, anyway.</span> <span id="s2878">So then, when we lived in Eger, and we started to know each other.</span> <span id="s2879">And right away, I got pregnant, a month later I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s2880">We got very close and he was a very, very good man.</span> <span id="s2881">Very good.</span> <span id="s2882">He had such a heart.</span> <span id="s2883">He was so good.</span> <span id="s2884">He never said, like George, he never said nothing bad about nobody.</span> <span id="s2885">And he tried to help people and he was a person like, he worked in a hospital, and he… like nobody, you know… even in New York they don’t care about the Blacks.</span> <span id="s2886">He shook hands with the elevator man or whatever.</span> <span id="s2887">You know?</span> <span id="s2888">He was unbelievable good.</span> <span id="s2889">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2890">And when he retired, even before he retired, he went without me to Hungary, because I right away had four weeks vacation with the hospital.</span> <span id="s2891">And when he retired, he went every year back to Hungary to see his sister.</span> <span id="s2892">But the main thing to see the children’s grave.</span> <span id="s2893">And one day I told him, “Listen Frank, you see I am the mother.</span> <span id="s2894">You think that I don’t think about them?”</span> <span id="s2895">I says, “You go only to the stones.</span> <span id="s2896">You must realize it, that you go only to the stones.”</span> <span id="s2897">He says, “Yes, but at least I can fix up the letters if they are, you know, not in shape.”</span> <span id="s2898">They are not buried separate.</span> <span id="s2899">They are buried with my Uncle Joseph, in the same grave, the two little kids.</span> <span id="s2900">And then that was that reason, that he has an only sister and she’s very sick.</span> <span id="s2901">And then when he was very sick, he had a terrible heart attack in ‘81 and in ‘82, 17 months he lived.</span> <span id="s2902">And in between that he went to Hungary.</span> <span id="s2903">I said to the doctor, “What shall I tell him, that he cannot go?”</span> <span id="s2904">He says, “No, he can go, but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to Hungary.</span> <span id="s2905">And he’ll be all right there because his nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe there.”</span> <span id="s2906">And I called him every week on the phone.</span> <span id="s2907">And he said, “I’m fine, I’m fine.”</span> <span id="s2908">Three-quarters of his heart was gone.</span> <span id="s2909">“I am fine,” he said.</span> <span id="s2910">And I always gave the report to the doctor.</span> <span id="s2911">And he says, “He’s fine because probably he sees sicker people around him, and then he has the nephew there”.</span> <span id="s2912">And that was the reason, because when he came back in July, end of June… every July we were in the country for Ilona’s, Ilona was born July 3rd, and I left a week vacation for that, and we went to the country house, and he came back before that and he came with us and he was fine.</span> <span id="s2913">We wanted to go, all of us, to Canada after.</span> <span id="s2914">It’s not close, but it’s on the same highway to go to Toronto, where it’s close, like a country house.</span> <span id="s2915">It was a long ride, but still it was… I don’t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls.</span> <span id="s2916">We wanted to all of us go, and he said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2917">I came from a long trip now, I go home myself.</span> <span id="s2918">I drive home myself.</span> <span id="s2919">And you go with them.”</span> <span id="s2920">Laura was pregnant with Ana.</span> <span id="s2921">And he was so happy, because he always wanted a lot of children.</span> <span id="s2922">He was crazy for children.</span> <span id="s2923">And George was an only child, because the two others died.</span> <span id="s2924">And he always, he was very happy.</span> <span id="s2925">He loved them so much.</span> <span id="s2926">That’s the last picture from them before he left.</span> <span id="s2927">That was only Jacob and Ilona.</span> <span id="s2928">And he… it was in April.</span> <span id="s2929">No.</span> <span id="s2930">No, because George took him to the airport.</span> <span id="s2931">It was before he left.</span> <span id="s2932">He died in ‘82.</span> <span id="s2933">While we were in Canada, he got sick and he went himself to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2934">They took him in Intensive Care, Coronary Care, I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s2935">But I called him when he was already home.</span> <span id="s2936">And he said, “Bring a present to so and so.”</span> <span id="s2937">I says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s2938">He said, “Because he helped me.</span> <span id="s2939">I was in the hospital.”</span> <span id="s2940">So right away I packed and I went back.</span> <span id="s2941">And in August he died.</span> <span id="s2942">I wasn’t even around.</span> <span id="s2943">You know that story?</span> <span id="s2944">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2945">He was so good.</span> <span id="s2946">And he was so worried about me, because when I was sick, he didn’t get undressed.</span> <span id="s2947">He was… the whole… because I had two heart attacks, in ‘67 and in ‘70.</span> <span id="s2948">So, it was always me they were worried about.</span> <span id="s2949">So, he was always, he didn’t get undressed and he was… unbelievable nurse, you know?</span> <span id="s2950">He was very, very good.</span> <span id="s2951">And with the children, everything they… what we had, and every vacation they were always for those two children, because they lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s2952">They lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s2953">He loved them.</span> <span id="s2954">He loved George.</span> <span id="s2955">He loved them.</span> <span id="s2956">He was very upset that he’s an artist, because he thought that, he always of the Hungarian artist, and he was always telling them, “You know how the artists are living?</span> <span id="s2957">They are going barefoot because they don’t have money for they…” [Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2958">You know, he was always worried.</span> <span id="s2959">But when he said that “Don’t worry, I am going to teach.”</span> <span id="s2960">Then he was very happy, and he was always the first one whom George called.</span> <span id="s2961">That “I got tenure, I got even…” no, he wasn’t alive when he got full professor, only when he got tenure.</span> <span id="s2962">He was alive.</span> <span id="s2963">And he was very happy, and with every exhibition, though he didn’t like his paintings.</span> <span id="s2964">But he said he loves it, because he went from that kind of a, ultra-modern.</span> <span id="s2965">But he was supporting him.</span> <span id="s2966">And that was everything for him, George was everything.</span> <span id="s2967">That’s why we bought the house there, that he should have a studio.</span> <span id="s2968">But he always said to him, “If you want to be a real artist, don’t get married.”</span> <span id="s2969">But he wanted to be an artist, but he… I mean, he didn’t have no one else but us, that was a family, so he wanted a family.</span> <span id="s2970">So he got married.</span> <span id="s2971">And he loves his children.</span> <span id="s2972">He’s a very good father, and he’s very good to me, unbelievable good to me.</span> <span id="s2973">And nobody can understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: His wife cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s2976">And I, I… because they don’t know what is it… we went once to a psychiatrist, because she was very jealous of his love towards me.</span> <span id="s2977">She cannot, she cannot understand it that somebody can love two people different way.</span> <span id="s2978">And the psychiatrist explained it to me.</span> <span id="s2979">She would never understand it, because she never got along with her mother.</span> <span id="s2980">She loved her father, and the minute her father died, she left home.</span> <span id="s2981">So, she would never understand it.</span> <span id="s2982">So, I said to him, “So I am here, why I am here?</span> <span id="s2983">You won’t understand me either.”</span> <span id="s2984">It was an Italian guy.</span> <span id="s2985">I said, “You wouldn’t understand me.</span> <span id="s2986">What is it to be in the world alone?</span> <span id="s2987">Two of us, nobody, no family, just two of us.</span> <span id="s2988">Would you understand that?”</span> <span id="s2989">So he says, “I didn’t know that, she didn’t tell that.”</span> <span id="s2990">The trouble was, I walked in, he said… walked in.</span> <span id="s2991">I was in wheelchair, because I fell on the steps here.</span> <span id="s2992">18 steps, and in the wheelchair I was forced to go to the psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s2993">And he said to me, when I walked in, he says… Laura wasn’t there, we went together and separate.</span> <span id="s2994">And he says, “How many times your son called you when you were in New York?”</span> <span id="s2995">I says, “That’s the complaint?”</span> <span id="s2996">I says, “If you are a good son…” You.</span> <span id="s2997">That’s how I talked to him, “and your father would die, and your mother is alone in the world, you wouldn’t call her every night?</span> <span id="s2998">And I paid the telephone bills.”</span> <span id="s2999">So, that she was complaining that he’s calling me every night when the father died.</span> <span id="s3000">And sometimes saying, and it was something, no, between us and Ilona, which I thank God, Ilona… he always told me, “You can always count on Ilona.”</span> <span id="s3001">He loved Ilona.</span> <span id="s3002">Jacob was very little.</span> <span id="s3003">He loved Jacob, but Ilona was six… ‘82 and she was born ’76, six years old.</span> <span id="s3004">So Ilona was already a bigger girl.</span> <span id="s3005">And she always said, “You always can count on Ilona.”</span> <span id="s3006">And I must tell you, he was always teaching me if he dies, what is going to happen and how much I should divulge.</span> <span id="s3007">I says, “Frank, please don’t talk about that.”</span> <span id="s3008">He says, “I know I am going to die when I am 69.”</span> <span id="s3009">I says, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s3010">He says, “Because my uncle came home from hunting, he was fine, too.</span> <span id="s3011">And he dropped dead when he was 69.</span> <span id="s3012">And he had a heart attack,” so every night—I didn’t sleep many nights with him—every night he got shaved, he got dressed, and he was sleeping in that chair.</span> <span id="s3013">He was always prepared that he has to go to the hospital or something, after the heart attack.</span> <span id="s3014">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s3015">And he was always teaching me what to do and how to do it.</span> <span id="s3016">“And I leave you enough,” he said, “that you can live like a princess if you want to, but if you want to live with your daughter-in-law…” End of Tape 4, Side B Tape 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: Okay, tape number five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.</span> <span id="s3018">And you told on the other tape about your… how you got out of Hungary.</span> <span id="s3019">And then you went to Vienna?</span> <span id="s3020">Can you talk about what you did in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: You know how we got out from Hungary?</span> <span id="s3022">That you know?</span> <span id="s3023">Okay.</span> <span id="s3024">In Vienna I worked for International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s3025">Their office was in New York, and it was there a boarding school in the Vienna woods.</span> <span id="s3026">A Hungarian teacher was in Vienna from New York, who came there, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, and he wanted to help them to come over.</span> <span id="s3027">And his idea was to make a boarding school for the Hungarian refugee children.</span> <span id="s3028">Those were all peasants’ children.</span> <span id="s3029">The parents got… is it on the tape once already?</span> <span id="s3030">No.</span> <span id="s3031">The peasants who came over and they got a contract in Santo Domingo, I don’t know how many hundreds, that they get land there and they can work there and they get everything.</span> <span id="s3032">Food and everything.</span> <span id="s3033">And somehow, somehow, they couldn’t get in touch with nobody, but somehow the International Rescue Committee find out that they didn’t get nothing.</span> <span id="s3034">They put them on the fields and they didn’t give them nothing.</span> <span id="s3035">So they managed to bring them back.</span> <span id="s3036">So, they brought them back to Vienna and the parents, they put to the two camps.</span> <span id="s3037">And the children, for the children, who were young, school kids, young, elementary school kids, and there were some bigger ones, they made that boarding school.</span> <span id="s3038">It was a beautiful, beautiful place and it was like a palace in the woods.</span> <span id="s3039">And he talked them into it, that he will be head of the school.</span> <span id="s3040">And because they helped them anyway, the International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s3041">This way they can go to school.</span> <span id="s3042">So we had seven Hungarian teachers there.</span> <span id="s3043">And the young ones had school there.</span> <span id="s3044">And the older ones he took to the village, the first time I saw the… the Volkswagen bus.</span> <span id="s3045">He had a Volkswagen bus.</span> <span id="s3046">He took them by bus to German schools.</span> <span id="s3047">And they were looking for a person for the office, one person does everything.</span> <span id="s3048">And my… Ilona’s sister-in-law, who was already in Vienna—she’s Ilona, too, both of them—she spoke and was always corresponding, that’s what she did, in German, French, English, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s3049">And she worked for his very, very… her very, very, very, very rich cousin, who… he was so rich that he lived in an apartment in the middle of Vienna with his wife and two children near the opera house where Franz Josef, Franz Josef’s girl friend lived.</span> <span id="s3050">And unbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor with the same furniture.</span> <span id="s3051">And he was in a business that time that started, I don’t know what kind of electronics they started to make.</span> <span id="s3052">And he was a big businessman.</span> <span id="s3053">He was in Hungary, too, but in time he went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s3054">And he worked in his office, she worked in his office.</span> <span id="s3055">And she didn’t get enough, she thought that she didn’t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job.</span> <span id="s3056">Because she has those, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too.</span> <span id="s3057">And they recommended her to that job for International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s3058">Because the International Rescue Committee was in connection with the… they were connected to the embassy, American Embassy.</span> <span id="s3059">And she got that job.</span> <span id="s3060">And when she said it to the cousin that she’s leaving because she can get more money, the cousin said, “I give you the same money.”</span> <span id="s3061">So then she wanted to stay, because she didn’t have to travel.</span> <span id="s3062">I had to travel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in the woods.</span> <span id="s3063">And in the winter it was terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work.</span> <span id="s3064">But anyway.</span> <span id="s3065">So, she said, “Look, go there and tell him that you are my relative, and I have to give two weeks notice.</span> <span id="s3066">I cannot leave right away, I have to give note and I can fill it in for her.”</span> <span id="s3067">So right away he says, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s3068">He gives me a petty cash box with money.</span> <span id="s3069">That was so funny because I wasn’t used to that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s3070">And he told me what is the job, that I have to do the payroll.</span> <span id="s3071">I have to pay the people.</span> <span id="s3072">I have to, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3073">I had to do the bookkeeping, but I never did.</span> <span id="s3074">I took it home for my husband, because that was his job.</span> <span id="s3075">I hated bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s3076">And I never knew how to do it, but he graduated business school.</span> <span id="s3077">He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s3078">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3079">But when it came… he didn’t know that I am taking it home.</span> <span id="s3080">But when it came that I had to go with the German… not accountant, who was he?</span> <span id="s3081">Gosh… he was an accountant, yes he was an accountant.</span> <span id="s3082">And I had to give, where, what office, somewhere I had to go at the end of the year.</span> <span id="s3083">Because it’s the same thing, taxes.</span> <span id="s3084">He says, “What about?”</span> <span id="s3085">I couldn’t answer and I told him, “I am not doing it, my husband is doing it.”</span> <span id="s3086">[Laughing] I told him.</span> <span id="s3087">He didn’t care about it.</span> <span id="s3088">But anyway two weeks later when it was two weeks, he says, “Where is Mrs. Schwartz?”</span> <span id="s3089">Her name… I says, “She decided to stay.</span> <span id="s3090">If you want to keep me, okay.</span> <span id="s3091">If not, thank you that you kept me.”</span> <span id="s3092">She says, “Yes, I want to keep you.”</span> <span id="s3093">That’s how I got the job and they paid me in American money.</span> <span id="s3094">I got the… oh, the Germans didn’t want me.</span> <span id="s3095">They didn’t want to give me the… you had to have a certification that you can work there.</span> <span id="s3096">I was no citizen.</span> <span id="s3097">And they wanted the job.</span> <span id="s3098">So in the kitchen it was a German woman, who was the everything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything.</span> <span id="s3099">She was a German woman, but I was in the office.</span> <span id="s3100">And then he got it.</span> <span id="s3101">He got in touch with the Embassy and whatever and I got it.</span> <span id="s3102">I still have it, the okay that I can work.</span> <span id="s3103">And I got paid in American money.</span> <span id="s3104">It was… I don’t know, to me it seemed very much, because it was… I don’t remember how much I got.</span> <span id="s3105">But we didn’t live in a camp, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s3106">We lived in an apartment, we lived together with Ilona and her husband.</span> <span id="s3107">We had together an apartment.</span> <span id="s3108">And George went to school and she took care of George.</span> <span id="s3109">And she took back and forth him to school.</span> <span id="s3110">And then in summer, George came with me there, when it was summer vacation.</span> <span id="s3111">And they brought out there… they did everything for those kids.</span> <span id="s3112">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3113">And they brought a German artist there to teach them art in the summer.</span> <span id="s3114">And George was, my George was in the group.</span> <span id="s3115">And the first time he painted a head on a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s3116">A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree.</span> <span id="s3117">And he painted it, oil painting.</span> <span id="s3118">And the guy came to me and he says, “Do you know whom you have here?”</span> <span id="s3119">I says, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s3120">He said, “He’ll be a great artist.”</span> <span id="s3121">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s3122">And then in New York, too, in elementary… he came to middle school.</span> <span id="s3123">He didn’t lose nothing.</span> <span id="s3124">He was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house.</span> <span id="s3125">And he said, “Do you know…” the same words.</span> <span id="s3126">I said, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s3127">He says, “You must come to the principal with me.”</span> <span id="s3128">I went to the principal, and they showed me his work, what is he doing.</span> <span id="s3129">So, he wanted him to go to an art school in Manhattan, a high school.</span> <span id="s3130">I don’t know what was the name of it.</span> <span id="s3131">And we misunderstood it.</span> <span id="s3132">We thought it was music and art high school.</span> <span id="s3133">And we took him to music and art high school.</span> <span id="s3134">And it was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways, and that was, you know, it was so far away.</span> <span id="s3135">Were you in New York?</span> <span id="s3136">Yeah?</span> <span id="s3137">It was near the City University, behind City University, behind Columbia University.</span> <span id="s3138">And he was traveling for four years, because he had a portfolio and they took him.</span> <span id="s3139">So he went already to music and art high school.</span> <span id="s3140">And he was really good.</span> <span id="s3141">And after that he went to Cooper Union, where they take only 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them.</span> <span id="s3142">And Cooper Union is free, you know, that’s a Foundation.</span> <span id="s3143">And we just had to pay for the materials, but we didn’t have to pay for his college.</span> <span id="s3144">50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants.</span> <span id="s3145">He was amongst them.</span> <span id="s3146">So we finished that.</span> <span id="s3147">He never wanted to go out-of-town college.</span> <span id="s3148">He was accepted to Penn State University, and I don’t know where else he applied in case he cannot get to Cooper.</span> <span id="s3149">But he never wanted to leave us.</span> <span id="s3150">He said, “We didn’t come to America to be separated.”</span> <span id="s3151">We were three of us, that’s it.</span> <span id="s3152">My uncle was still alive, but we were three of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Q: Tell me something, did you talk to George about your family history, and what had happened to your family during the Holocaust, and what had happened to you, from the time he was a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">A: He knows.</span> <span id="s3155">Everything.</span> <span id="s3156">First of all he knows, he listened to the tape.</span> <span id="s3157">I always talked about it.</span> <span id="s3158">And he… sometimes I am mixing it up, that it was my husband to whom I talked or to him.</span> <span id="s3159">But he knows it.</span> <span id="s3160">He knows it.</span> <span id="s3161">And I have written down everything, but unfortunately I wrote it Hungarian and he cannot read it anymore, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s3162">And I really have to write it over in English, though I have tapes and for every kids.</span> <span id="s3163">I think my whole lifetime is in the tapes, so I don’t know whether it’s important to write it down.</span> <span id="s3164">But no, Ana gave me a batch that I have to put down the whole family history because they are making family trees, and for me, for my husband, for my husband’s sisters and everything, in the school.</span> <span id="s3165">She’s asking.</span> <span id="s3166">They are not aware of it, the grandchildren, just about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3167">He knew my husband, they knew, all of them knew my husband.</span> <span id="s3168">Not all of them.</span> <span id="s3169">Ana didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3170">Anna just always saying that “That chair was grandpa’s and I want to save it.”</span> <span id="s3171">They didn’t have really… they don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">Q: When you were in Vienna were you waiting for a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">A: Okay, that we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3174">It was a quota was over.</span> <span id="s3175">Closed.</span> <span id="s3176">They let in so many people everywhere, that it was no open quota.</span> <span id="s3177">That’s why we had to stay in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3178">And we stayed 17 months.</span> <span id="s3179">After 17 months they give for 1,000 people, and we were amongst the first ones because the International Rescue Committee took us.</span> <span id="s3180">I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit, but we didn’t need it because they paid for us and they took us, the International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s3181">And we were the very first ones.</span> <span id="s3182">The interesting thing was that by that time, maybe half a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes (ph) was her name, working as a… over the housekeeping.</span> <span id="s3183">She didn’t do nothing actually.</span> <span id="s3184">She lived in the middle of Vienna and she had a beautiful apartment, because we were there.</span> <span id="s3185">She invited us.</span> <span id="s3186">And she had a car, she came every, she wanted a job.</span> <span id="s3187">Her husband was Jewish, and he was killed somewhere in labor camp.</span> <span id="s3188">And she lived alone.</span> <span id="s3189">She was a fat woman.</span> <span id="s3190">And she had… her mother lived here, in New York.</span> <span id="s3191">But she stayed in Vienna and she lived a big life.</span> <span id="s3192">She had a big dog, I remember.</span> <span id="s3193">And she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job.</span> <span id="s3194">She wanted a job.</span> <span id="s3195">And she had a car and when she came, she picked me up every day by car and took me home by car, so it was much easier on me.</span> <span id="s3196">But the interesting thing was that I never told her that I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3197">I never told her.</span> <span id="s3198">I somehow, I don’t know, they didn’t see the number and… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3199">I never say, never told even that I was Jewish, to her.</span> <span id="s3200">He knew probably, he knew, of course he knew.</span> <span id="s3201">Haber was his name.</span> <span id="s3202">He was a school teacher in New York.</span> <span id="s3203">That was his idea.</span> <span id="s3204">And I don’t know what happened to him, and to the school, too.</span> <span id="s3205">Of course it’s not there anymore.</span> <span id="s3206">Habdersdorf (ph) was the name of the village.</span> <span id="s3207">And she, when we got the okay to come, we had to go to Salzburg, to the Embassy.</span> <span id="s3208">There was the American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes.</span> <span id="s3209">And so she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s3210">It was a beautiful, beautiful road.</span> <span id="s3211">Unbelievable scenery.</span> <span id="s3212">And then when we parted, I told her that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s3213">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s3214">She knew that I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3215">She didn’t know up to that point and she was very upset that I didn’t tell her before that I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3216">I never told anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: Did you not tell anybody because you were afraid or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: I never… I was very uncomfortable in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3219">When we first, it was May when we got there and beautiful and we had… already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came.</span> <span id="s3220">My uncle’s brother arranged.</span> <span id="s3221">And he was a Jewish man, who was saved in Singapore.</span> <span id="s3222">He went with his son to Singapore.</span> <span id="s3223">A very interesting man and he lived alone, an elderly man.</span> <span id="s3224">And he had a pretty nice big apartment.</span> <span id="s3225">And he had only one room for himself, and he gave two rooms and the kitchen to us.</span> <span id="s3226">And so we were there and the windows were open.</span> <span id="s3227">And when I got up in the morning and I heard the German language under the window, I got so crazy.</span> <span id="s3228">I went crazy.</span> <span id="s3229">My husband couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s3230">He didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s3231">He couldn’t get a job, but they gave him some kind of a… oh, no.</span> <span id="s3232">When we left I got a letter from the International Rescue Committee that when we arrive we should go to New York, to their main office and show them the letter that I work for them.</span> <span id="s3233">And we got a counselor there, and we went in and I give him the letter.</span> <span id="s3234">I didn’t say nowhere, it doesn’t say nowhere that story?</span> <span id="s3235">I gave him the letter, and he looks at me and says, “I don’t believe it that you don’t remember me.”</span> <span id="s3236">I says, “I’m so sorry, how do you know me?”</span> <span id="s3237">She says, “I was in the school there.</span> <span id="s3238">They came some, observe the school from New York, the International Rescue Committee.</span> <span id="s3239">Don’t you remember I was there with my wife and I was in one car with you going back to Vienna?”</span> <span id="s3240">Then I remembered.</span> <span id="s3241">I didn’t even think about it, you know, that is somebody.</span> <span id="s3242">So, he was very nice.</span> <span id="s3243">He said, “You don’t have to show me the letter, I know what you did there, but I must tell you, you did there everything.</span> <span id="s3244">But in America you have to do one thing, and good, not so many things what you did there in the office.</span> <span id="s3245">I’m going to send you to NCR school.”</span> <span id="s3246">When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn’t… you know?</span> <span id="s3247">I didn’t say no, but I didn’t go, when he told me to go to.</span> <span id="s3248">What happened, I didn’t know that, I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s3249">And I know it’s that I got pregnant in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s3250">I remember it, but I didn’t know that I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s3251">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3252">I had my period every month and I didn’t know that I’m pregnant.</span> <span id="s3253">And three months later I started to bleed like terribly and I didn’t know that I’m pregnant.</span> <span id="s3254">And I went to the doctor and he said you are pregnant, but you are going to have a miscarriage, because you have fibroids.</span> <span id="s3255">So, I didn’t go to International School.</span> <span id="s3256">And he called me on the phone and he called me when I came back from the hospital.</span> <span id="s3257">And I says, “I was sick, and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s3258">I had a miscarriage,” I told him.</span> <span id="s3259">“And I couldn’t go.”</span> <span id="s3260">But when I was better, they kept me, I was in the fourth month, and they kept me there five days.</span> <span id="s3261">They thought every day the babies, four months.</span> <span id="s3262">I was dying there.</span> <span id="s3263">I lost so much blood.</span> <span id="s3264">But then finally they did it.</span> <span id="s3265">And they said that “You have to come back in six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.”</span> <span id="s3266">And six weeks later I went back and they said, “No you don’t need it.</span> <span id="s3267">It was so big, everything because you were pregnant.</span> <span id="s3268">You don’t need a hysterectomy.”</span> <span id="s3269">So then I went back.</span> <span id="s3270">When he called me, I said, “No, I can’t go now.”</span> <span id="s3271">So he sent me to NCR school.</span> <span id="s3272">NCR was not the cashier machines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know.</span> <span id="s3273">They had big, big bookkeeping machines, before the computers.</span> <span id="s3274">Big bars, rechangeable that you could do everything.</span> <span id="s3275">You could go, big papers with monthly statements and you could go checks.</span> <span id="s3276">Other side I could put the vendor’s card and put down to whom I am paying.</span> <span id="s3277">And I went there and I learned it in one week.</span> <span id="s3278">Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, “Yes, I can type.”</span> <span id="s3279">So they taught me for the machine in one week and they gave me a job after one week.</span> <span id="s3280">I didn’t have any experience, but I knew how to do the machine.</span> <span id="s3281">And they gave me a job in a publishing company in Manhattan, Columbus Square or Circle or what was it.</span> <span id="s3282">And I had to travel from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s3283">I was so sick on the subways that I was more in the doctor’s office than at home.</span> <span id="s3284">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s3285">I cannot, even in Hungary what is above the ground I was always standing outside on the air.</span> <span id="s3286">I couldn’t travel.</span> <span id="s3287">And that was underground and was going on in New York subways.</span> <span id="s3288">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s3289">And that was a publisher, who made some kind of a… I don’t know whether it was comic books or what it was, I have no… Publishing company.</span> <span id="s3290">And they were two machines, it was a receivable and a payable.</span> <span id="s3291">And I was the payable and the other guy, a guy, a young guy, who was very helpful.</span> <span id="s3292">And he tried to teach me, because I knew the machine, but I didn’t have experience.</span> <span id="s3293">I didn’t have the speed, first of all, and if I made a mistake, I didn’t know how to correct it.</span> <span id="s3294">And he was very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s3295">But the comptroller… not comptroller, liked me very much, the comptroller, but the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I didn’t know from my life.</span> <span id="s3296">I didn’t know where is Massachusetts [laughing], and he was so proud of it, that he is from Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s3297">He was a misery.</span> <span id="s3298">And he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s3299">And he made my life, he got back the checks from the bank, what I was typing.</span> <span id="s3300">And he found mistakes.</span> <span id="s3301">He was so miserable and he said to me, “You just came.</span> <span id="s3302">You are a refugee, and you right away have to sit in an office?”</span> <span id="s3303">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s3304">A Jew.</span> <span id="s3305">I was very miserable.</span> <span id="s3306">It was 60 dollars a week, what was a nice pay at that time.</span> <span id="s3307">And they gave me even commissions.</span> <span id="s3308">I don’t know what was it, from sale or something.</span> <span id="s3309">I was there for three months and I was constantly looking for another job.</span> <span id="s3310">And one day from New York Times, I see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital is looking for an NCR operator.</span> <span id="s3311">They were on strike because they were already… the half, not the office, but the kitchen and the… I don’t know, cleaning people, they were in the Union.</span> <span id="s3312">And they had a strike.</span> <span id="s3313">The office, too, because nobody could, they had a black man working years on that machine, and he left because he got a better job under the strike.</span> <span id="s3314">And they didn’t have no one for three months.</span> <span id="s3315">They had young girls, but they left.</span> <span id="s3316">Young people don’t want to sit and work.</span> <span id="s3317">You had to sit at the machine.</span> <span id="s3318">So, when I saw that, it was in walking distance from us, the hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning, my uncle’s pharmacy.</span> <span id="s3319">So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning when I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance.</span> <span id="s3320">And I never thought that I stay there.</span> <span id="s3321">And the comptroller wasn’t… was out of town or I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s3322">He wasn’t there when I got the job.</span> <span id="s3323">So the personnel, she gave me the job.</span> <span id="s3324">And I was working, it was a big office and we had two machines like there, accounts payable and receivable.</span> <span id="s3325">The receivable was another woman working.</span> <span id="s3326">And the comptroller came back and he called me to the office and he greeted me and he was very, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s3327">And he said, “I must tell you one thing, if you do the job by Christmas…” they were behind three months with bills.</span> <span id="s3328">Well I saw those bins with bills.</span> <span id="s3329">“If you do it by Christmas, the job is yours.”</span> <span id="s3330">So I started to do it and I started to be very fast on the machine, very fast.</span> <span id="s3331">And I did it day before Christmas.</span> <span id="s3332">So, but women there, they were Jewish women, they were very jealous.</span> <span id="s3333">One of them, first of all I never spoke about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3334">Never.</span> <span id="s3335">It was mixed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and I never spoke to them about it.</span> <span id="s3336">And one woman, a Jewish woman, she said to me, “Why did you come to America?”</span> <span id="s3337">This way.</span> <span id="s3338">I says, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s3339">He says, “Why, the communism is not enough good?”</span> <span id="s3340">I says, “Maybe it is good for you because you have a house, every child of you has a car and you have a nice job.</span> <span id="s3341">You could change place with me,” I said.</span> <span id="s3342">[Laughing] Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s3343">She was a Leftist.</span> <span id="s3344">And she didn’t work on a machine, but she worked in the office.</span> <span id="s3345">That time it was everything together, the billing.</span> <span id="s3346">We had a big, big office and machine and no machine.</span> <span id="s3347">The machines were in the back.</span> <span id="s3348">And then there was another woman, who was like that man there, who was controlling me and she was miserable, too.</span> <span id="s3349">If I made a mistake, she was miserable.</span> <span id="s3350">And I was crying, and I went to the Comptroller and I says, “I just don’t know what to do.”</span> <span id="s3351">She says, “What’s happening?”</span> <span id="s3352">And I told him what’s happening.</span> <span id="s3353">He says, “You come to me, you don’t go to them.</span> <span id="s3354">If you don’t know something you come to me.”</span> <span id="s3355">It was a man.</span> <span id="s3356">And from then on, I was all right.</span> <span id="s3357">I had trouble because I had to answer the telephone.</span> <span id="s3358">I was payable and the vendors were calling me.</span> <span id="s3359">So, in the beginning I had big trouble.</span> <span id="s3360">I spoke English, but I spoke English, not Yankee.</span> <span id="s3361">Because I learned English from an English teacher in Czechoslovakia when it was Hungary already and we thought that we come to America.</span> <span id="s3362">We had private lessons.</span> <span id="s3363">And my sister was very, very smart.</span> <span id="s3364">And we were reading Anna Karenina in English and… I told you, no?</span> <span id="s3365">That story.</span> <span id="s3366">So we learned English.</span> <span id="s3367">And we didn’t understand each other on the phone, you know?</span> <span id="s3368">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s3369">So in the beginning I had problems, but then it was okay.</span> <span id="s3370">Even the Americans came to me, how do you spell that, how do you spell this?</span> <span id="s3371">You know?</span> <span id="s3372">That was the end.</span> <span id="s3373">But I never thought that I stay there 27 years.</span> <span id="s3374">I stayed there 27 years.</span> <span id="s3375">I went through many comptrollers.</span> <span id="s3376">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s3377">He left, but he was a long time there.</span> <span id="s3378">But he left.</span> <span id="s3379">And then one day the Personnel Director comes in, closes the door and he says, “Attention, please.”</span> <span id="s3380">Everybody looks up, “What is it?”</span> <span id="s3381">He says, “I must announce it, that from yesterday on, everybody is in the Union.”</span> <span id="s3382">So I didn’t know what does it mean and why is it good or bad, just in the Union.</span> <span id="s3383">Fine.</span> <span id="s3384">I don’t care where we are.</span> <span id="s3385">And it was an unbelievable advantage.</span> <span id="s3386">I was the highest paid because of the machines.</span> <span id="s3387">So, if somebody got three dollars pay and raise, I got five dollars raise.</span> <span id="s3388">From 60 dollars in one year, because I started with 60 back there in the other place, I went up to 125 dollars because of the Union.</span> <span id="s3389">And thank God, because of the Union, I have a pension today from the Union, and I have free medication.</span> <span id="s3390">My medication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, because they are sending me the company’s and that’s another pension, 4,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s3391">And I am getting pension.</span> <span id="s3392">And because… oh, that’s the story.</span> <span id="s3393">Before I… a year before I left, it was another strike.</span> <span id="s3394">And I didn’t go to work, because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s3395">You know?</span> <span id="s3396">Crossing the picket lines.</span> <span id="s3397">But I never picketed, never.</span> <span id="s3398">I was in the country for a month, it was a month strike.</span> <span id="s3399">And I was in touch with them.</span> <span id="s3400">I called always Personnel.</span> <span id="s3401">Personnel was begging me, “Please come back.”</span> <span id="s3402">Because by that time we had only one machine, it was no more receivable because they gave it out to computers.</span> <span id="s3403">So, I was the only machine and the only person who knew the machine.</span> <span id="s3404">They were typing checks, the people who were non-Union.</span> <span id="s3405">And it was horrible, horrible, they were behind, and terrible.</span> <span id="s3406">And he was begging me, “Please come back.</span> <span id="s3407">Come back, don’t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.”</span> <span id="s3408">And they were in the country and one day he calls me and he says, “Come back.</span> <span id="s3409">We are going to send you a Black girl down for you if you are afraid.</span> <span id="s3410">We are watching you when you when you are coming.</span> <span id="s3411">And please come back.”</span> <span id="s3412">And they went to the country and they dropped me off and they are watching it whether I go in.</span> <span id="s3413">It was no picketing.</span> <span id="s3414">It was no picket line anymore.</span> <span id="s3415">And I went in and then everybody was shocked, because nobody knew that I am not in the Union.</span> <span id="s3416">I couldn’t have, I couldn’t, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3417">It was… they just didn’t believe it that I am, you know, in the Union, in the Union, the people.</span> <span id="s3418">Because that was a job what was a confidential job, with the payroll and everything.</span> <span id="s3419">So they didn’t believe it that I am in the Union.</span> <span id="s3420">So, what happened, the person… End of Tape 5, Side A Tape 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">A: …you get out from the Union.</span> <span id="s3422">They didn’t know that I am close to retirement.</span> <span id="s3423">That I wanted to retire.</span> <span id="s3424">I didn’t know either.</span> <span id="s3425">If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and you get medication from the hospital, doctors from the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year.</span> <span id="s3426">I said, “How do I do that?”</span> <span id="s3427">He says, “I’m going to send a telegram,” because the Union was threatening us, that if we are still on strike they are not going to cover us medically.</span> <span id="s3428">Because they had very good medical coverage.</span> <span id="s3429">Every doctor wanted you if you were in the Union.</span> <span id="s3430">I says, “I cannot live without medical coverage.”</span> <span id="s3431">She says, “Okay so I’m going to tell them that you cannot be without coverage and you are out from the Union.”</span> <span id="s3432">So, for one year, I went out from the Union.</span> <span id="s3433">Then after a year, I wanted to retire.</span> <span id="s3434">I worked one year more than 65, 66 I was when I left.</span> <span id="s3435">And I says, “Can you put me back to the Union?”</span> <span id="s3436">Because they would have to give me a pension from the hospital if I am not in the Union.</span> <span id="s3437">So the personnel, the secretary, his secretary, arranged it that they paid me for one year dues, for one year everything, because they paid for medical for us, the Union.</span> <span id="s3438">And they paid for pension.</span> <span id="s3439">I paid the bills, hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Union.</span> <span id="s3440">I was paying them.</span> <span id="s3441">And they said that it was a mistake and they got me back to the Union.</span> <span id="s3442">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s3443">It was such a luck because I wouldn’t have the Union.</span> <span id="s3444">I wouldn’t have the pension because they say to me… I’m talking to some people from the hospital, “It’s terrible, it’s almost bankrupt.”</span> <span id="s3445">We were bankrupt after ten years, we went to Chapter 11.</span> <span id="s3446">I went to, through with them, voided thousands and thousands of checks and everything after ten years.</span> <span id="s3447">And they had to merge with another hospital.</span> <span id="s3448">It was St. Joseph… St. John’s.</span> <span id="s3449">Here is St. Joseph’s.</span> <span id="s3450">St. John’s Hospital.</span> <span id="s3451">And then we got more, we were the main hospital.</span> <span id="s3452">We got more employees.</span> <span id="s3453">It was 3,000 people.</span> <span id="s3454">And we paid everything.</span> <span id="s3455">We paid they bills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, everything.</span> <span id="s3456">It was everything through us.</span> <span id="s3457">So it was a very big job.</span> <span id="s3458">But I had a separate room because the machine was very noisy.</span> <span id="s3459">And I was alone in the room, so that was very good.</span> <span id="s3460">And they always wanted me to be a manager and I didn’t want to because I knew that I am out of the Union if I am a manager.</span> <span id="s3461">I says, “I do the job.</span> <span id="s3462">I am not a manager.”</span> <span id="s3463">So, I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions before we go on because we skipped your journey to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">A: My journey to the United States?</span> <span id="s3466">We came in 1958.</span> <span id="s3467">The International Rescue Committee from Salzburg brought us… Oh.</span> <span id="s3468">That was a very terrible thing, too.</span> <span id="s3469">They send us for x-rays, chest x-rays before you come.</span> <span id="s3470">And they didn’t want me let through.</span> <span id="s3471">I’m sorry, stomach.</span> <span id="s3472">They didn’t let me go through because they said that I have something on my lungs.</span> <span id="s3473">It turned out that I had pneumonia in the camp and I didn’t know about it and it showed.</span> <span id="s3474">And they said, “They can go, your husband and your son, but you have to go on another plane, because it’s something.”</span> <span id="s3475">I went crazy.</span> <span id="s3476">They didn’t want to go without me, but luckily they called me for a second x-ray and that was all well.</span> <span id="s3477">That was okay, so we came together.</span> <span id="s3478">But we came on a military plane.</span> <span id="s3479">I don’t know how many hundreds of people, and so uncomfortable, and we were sitting in the last row, near the toilet.</span> <span id="s3480">And they were only two seats, so we always changed.</span> <span id="s3481">One sits with George and then the other one was sitting alone, you know?</span> <span id="s3482">But we were sitting in the same row, but between us the aisle.</span> <span id="s3483">Very uncomfortable, very.</span> <span id="s3484">I think we were 24 hours in the air.</span> <span id="s3485">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s3486">And we stopped at Newfoundland, Newfoundland.</span> <span id="s3487">And then they give us there the first meal, a dinner.</span> <span id="s3488">And from that I got so sick, that the whole journey to New York, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3489">I was so sick.</span> <span id="s3490">But I was pregnant and I didn’t know, maybe that’s why I was sick from the food.</span> <span id="s3491">So when we arrived, it was that time Kennedy Airport… no, La Guardia, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3492">La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport.</span> <span id="s3493">And we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting for us and waving.</span> <span id="s3494">And we saw the first Black man in our lives.</span> <span id="s3495">They had a postman, who delivered the mail and he had a car.</span> <span id="s3496">And my uncle, he came always… he had like here in pharmacies they have a counter where you have food, too.</span> <span id="s3497">It was so strange to me, because there is no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies.</span> <span id="s3498">Pharmacy is pharmacy.</span> <span id="s3499">And he was telling him that if he has a free day, that he is going to pay him take him to the airport and wait for us.</span> <span id="s3500">So he was a fat man and it was the first time in my life that I saw a black man.</span> <span id="s3501">And he was taking us home to my uncle.</span> <span id="s3502">They lived not very far from the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s3503">Though the house was theirs, the pharmacy was one day apartments.</span> <span id="s3504">They lived in a separate apartment.</span> <span id="s3505">And he had a partner because his diploma… I have still his Russian diploma, was not certificated, so he had an American partner.</span> <span id="s3506">Very nice people.</span> <span id="s3507">They lived in the house, in the upstairs in the house.</span> <span id="s3508">They were very good friends.</span> <span id="s3509">They didn’t have children, and they didn’t have children.</span> <span id="s3510">They were very good friends.</span> <span id="s3511">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s3512">And so we were three days in our uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s3513">It was only, what they had, the living room is a big, big.</span> <span id="s3514">Bedroom they had, and a living room, a kitchen.</span> <span id="s3515">It was a private, private house.</span> <span id="s3516">I don’t know, bathroom, nothing else.</span> <span id="s3517">They had two in the house, two apartments in the house, the landlord and them.</span> <span id="s3518">And they rented for us, in that kind of a house, but in another street, an apartment, upstairs.</span> <span id="s3519">But it was small.</span> <span id="s3520">It was just a bedroom and a little living room and at the end of the living room was the kitchen, a small kitchen with a small frigidaire.</span> <span id="s3521">So, that was our first apartment.</span> <span id="s3522">And that was our street where George went to middle school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">Q: What were your first impressions of the United States, and what did you expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">A: I was very upset when they showed us pictures from New York at the Embassy.</span> <span id="s3525">I says, “My God, stones and stones and stones.</span> <span id="s3526">It’s no green nowhere.”</span> <span id="s3527">They showed us New York in the embassy.</span> <span id="s3528">It was very frightening.</span> <span id="s3529">When I went very, very first time to Manhattan, I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3530">I couldn’t look up because I was dizzy from the tall houses, but I loved it.</span> <span id="s3531">I love New York and that’s the place where I lived most of my life.</span> <span id="s3532">When I added up one day where I lived the longest, it was New York.</span> <span id="s3533">And I love New York.</span> <span id="s3534">I loved it.</span> <span id="s3535">We lived in Brooklyn, near the ocean.</span> <span id="s3536">I love the ocean.</span> <span id="s3537">I love the ocean in the Spring and in the Fall.</span> <span id="s3538">I don’t like to go in because the mob was there, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3539">But to walk on the Boardwalk, the sundown, the sunset, it was so relaxing.</span> <span id="s3540">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3541">And they were benches, you know, and we were sitting on it.</span> <span id="s3542">It was unbelievable, and I missed it here very, very much when I came here.</span> <span id="s3543">When I came here I knew Lexington, because he’s here for ‘79, 1979.</span> <span id="s3544">And three times a year I was here.</span> <span id="s3545">I had four weeks vacation, three weeks here and one week in the country house, that country house in the Catskills.</span> <span id="s3546">My husband loved it because he loved the country.</span> <span id="s3547">He loved it.</span> <span id="s3548">He loved it here.</span> <span id="s3549">When he saw the horses, and we wanted to retire here.</span> <span id="s3550">We came here and always looking for places where… we wanted a duplex.</span> <span id="s3551">We always thought it’s enough, we are together and separate.</span> <span id="s3552">But for them it was never enough, the duplex.</span> <span id="s3553">For us it would be, they are small apartments.</span> <span id="s3554">But anyway it didn’t come to it, because he died.</span> <span id="s3555">But he wanted to live here.</span> <span id="s3556">I loved the big cities.</span> <span id="s3557">I never lived in a small town, because where we lived in Czechoslovakia, that was the capital of that part.</span> <span id="s3558">And Budapest is beautiful.</span> <span id="s3559">So I couldn’t imagine to live… and they was always questioning where is the city here?</span> <span id="s3560">Where is the city?</span> <span id="s3561">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">Q: You mean in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">A: Here, yeah, but you go to… then they showed me downtown.</span> <span id="s3564">I says, “Oh my God.”</span> <span id="s3565">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s3566">Okay.</span> <span id="s3567">But I knew where I’m coming.</span> <span id="s3568">But still when I came here really, that this is now real, I thought I go to the nuthouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">Q: When you came to Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">A: When I moved here.</span> <span id="s3571">When I moved here in November of ‘86.</span> <span id="s3572">And I was very upset.</span> <span id="s3573">I was homesick.</span> <span id="s3574">So the first year, they went every year back to the summer house.</span> <span id="s3575">Every year they spent there and I went with them.</span> <span id="s3576">It’s half of mine, from the summer house.</span> <span id="s3577">My husband bought it for me and them, half.</span> <span id="s3578">But we paid their half with cash because they didn’t have money at that time, they just started teaching and they gave us the credit.</span> <span id="s3579">So we paid they half cash and they paid the other half out in ten years.</span> <span id="s3580">And it’s in the Catskills.</span> <span id="s3581">It’s a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s3582">It’s a small house, but it was very nice.</span> <span id="s3583">We have two bedrooms and in between us was the bathroom and the living room and upstairs it was a big, big attic and it was made up for a bedroom, but we didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s3584">Because we were four only.</span> <span id="s3585">They didn’t have even children at that time, ‘73.</span> <span id="s3586">And even in the winter we went up.</span> <span id="s3587">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s3588">It was very close to all the skiing place, all the people.</span> <span id="s3589">It’s very nice.</span> <span id="s3590">And he wouldn’t sell it, because he’s very sentimental, because Daddy loved it.</span> <span id="s3591">He would never sell it, and he loves it because he is away from here and he is going up four or five, it’s three acres, hill.</span> <span id="s3592">And underneath there is a big, big library, that’s our neighbor.</span> <span id="s3593">It’s a library for four, five towns, five little towns.</span> <span id="s3594">A big library.</span> <span id="s3595">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: Let me ask you something before we go on.</span> <span id="s3597">You described how when you arrived in New York and there were some people who, some even Jewish people who were not very respectful of you.</span> <span id="s3598">Did you find that to be common?</span> <span id="s3599">That American Jews did not treat you respectfully because you were a refugee and because you were a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">A: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">Q: Can you say more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">A: Especially here, here never were refugees in Lexington.</span> <span id="s3603">Not Jewish, or Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3604">They never were refugees here in Lexington.</span> <span id="s3605">And then up to today, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s3606">You are friends with the people in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s3607">They are not real friends.</span> <span id="s3608">You are friends in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s3609">There we socialize, but they wouldn’t invite you to their houses, even here.</span> <span id="s3610">Yes.</span> <span id="s3611">And what I found out, I found out that almost everybody’s fathers came from Europe.</span> <span id="s3612">Those people who are here 30 years or whatever… everybody’s, but still they are Lexingtonians.</span> <span id="s3613">And it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s3614">I don’t care, because just now I have only two friends, a lawyer and his wife, and from Winchester, Sylvia.</span> <span id="s3615">But she is again from the synagogue, because I don’t go to Winchester.</span> <span id="s3616">And I went when her husband died, I went to see her a few times, but otherwise I’m not driving outside of Lexington.</span> <span id="s3617">I’m glad I find my way here.</span> <span id="s3618">And so, she calls when they know that I’m sick.</span> <span id="s3619">But I really don’t have friends here.</span> <span id="s3620">And another couple, who is a Polish couple, the Habers.</span> <span id="s3621">You’ve were there?</span> <span id="s3622">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">Q: I’ve spoken with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3624">A: But they are very nice.</span> <span id="s3625">Last week she made a party, it was her birthday.</span> <span id="s3626">And I couldn’t make it, I was so sick.</span> <span id="s3627">Because in the beginning we made, we went to each other’s houses and we had a book club.</span> <span id="s3628">Everybody read the same book and we discussed it, book discussion club.</span> <span id="s3629">That woman died.</span> <span id="s3630">That was a pharmacologist’s wife.</span> <span id="s3631">And since she died, I am not going.</span> <span id="s3632">I am not going.</span> <span id="s3633">I could.</span> <span id="s3634">It’s the Haddassah.</span> <span id="s3635">You know what’s the Haddassah?</span> <span id="s3636">They have it, but I don’t like those people because they… I don’t like them because they went away from the synagogue and they have their own congregation, the Havarah.</span> <span id="s3637">And I cannot see that.</span> <span id="s3638">And in the beginning, when George moved here, they were so friendly to him.</span> <span id="s3639">They wanted to get him there.</span> <span id="s3640">And he would never go.</span> <span id="s3641">Because they have here a rabbi, who was blind.</span> <span id="s3642">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s3643">He died from diabetes, fairly young.</span> <span id="s3644">And he… I don’t like those people, because when they found out that George doesn’t want to belong there, it was finished with the friendship.</span> <span id="s3645">You know?</span> <span id="s3646">But when they come sometimes to the synagogue or whatever, they are nice to you.</span> <span id="s3647">You know?</span> <span id="s3648">But they have their own clique, only Havarah, but they are none of them from Lexington.</span> <span id="s3649">They are everybody from somewheres else.</span> <span id="s3650">And they feel that they are together and they help each other.</span> <span id="s3651">And it’s a bigger, there are 80 families now there.</span> <span id="s3652">They are always bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s3653">They don’t have a place where to pray.</span> <span id="s3654">They pray, I think, once a month or twice a month, I don’t know and always someplace else.</span> <span id="s3655">In the Christian church basement or someplace.</span> <span id="s3656">They don’t have a steady place.</span> <span id="s3657">Sometimes they pray here, too.</span> <span id="s3658">Pray here in the club.</span> <span id="s3659">But I really don’t have no friends.</span> <span id="s3660">Besides the three people and the librarian from the synagogue, she’s very nice.</span> <span id="s3661">But we don’t go to each other’s houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">Q: So, you think that people are prejudiced?</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">A: Yes, they are, they are, definitely they are.</span> <span id="s3664">They are very nice to you in the synagogue, you know.</span> <span id="s3665">But nobody would say, “Come.”</span> <span id="s3666">And the rabbi was different.</span> <span id="s3667">We were always over.</span> <span id="s3668">I was always invited, because they used to go too, and I didn’t want to go with them, like for Passover, to Indiana.</span> <span id="s3669">His best friend is there, from New York, best friend.</span> <span id="s3670">And I didn’t want to go, so I was always invited to Rabbi.</span> <span id="s3671">Sometimes with Ilona when she was here for Passover, but not to other people’s.</span> <span id="s3672">So it is.</span> <span id="s3673">They are.</span> <span id="s3674">I think they are.</span> <span id="s3675">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3676">In the beginning we had here big parties, because they came here, like guest speakers and they wanted to take them to homes.</span> <span id="s3677">I don’t know why they choosed us about two or three times and they met here.</span> <span id="s3678">And we contributed.</span> <span id="s3679">We made the cookies and cakes and everything.</span> <span id="s3680">And one couple came, he is very wealthy.</span> <span id="s3681">And he’s a nice guy.</span> <span id="s3682">He’s nice to me, very nice, in the synagogue, but they came and they looked around.</span> <span id="s3683">And I see that they are looking around themselves, you know?</span> <span id="s3684">They were away from the other people.</span> <span id="s3685">And I said, “Do you want to see the house?”</span> <span id="s3686">And she says, “Oh, you are acting like it would be your house,” she said, he said.</span> <span id="s3687">I says, “Yes, my money’s in that house.”</span> <span id="s3688">They thought that it’s… because it’s on their name.</span> <span id="s3689">Me idiot.</span> <span id="s3690">[Laughing] My friend, I have a pediatrician friend, a woman.</span> <span id="s3691">She doesn’t know up to today, that it’s _______.</span> <span id="s3692">She said to me, “Don’t you dare to do it, that it’s not only your name and George’s.</span> <span id="s3693">You made the money for it.”</span> <span id="s3694">That I put it on their name.</span> <span id="s3695">I trusted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">Q: Tell me something else, have you…</span></p> <p><span id="s3697">A: And that’s what I think, you know?</span> <span id="s3698">That’s how they are.</span> <span id="s3699">That’s the first and last time they were here, because it was a party for somebody.</span> <span id="s3700">And on the rabbi’s wife’s birthday, not this rabbi.</span> <span id="s3701">Another.</span> <span id="s3702">We had a rabbi who is from England.</span> <span id="s3703">Rabbi Smith (ph), he’s still here.</span> <span id="s3704">He works for the State Department now.</span> <span id="s3705">Because they… he was three years rabbi.</span> <span id="s3706">He couldn’t handle children.</span> <span id="s3707">He doesn’t have children.</span> <span id="s3708">And he is so smart that he is too smart for them.</span> <span id="s3709">Very, very smart man.</span> <span id="s3710">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">Q: Coming back to when you first arrived in America and you’re getting settled, did you consider yourself…what did it take to become an American for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3712">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s3713">I right away, when we were, right away, five years later, we were citizens, because you have to be five years.</span> <span id="s3714">No, I felt at home.</span> <span id="s3715">I felt at home, and we had our friends.</span> <span id="s3716">We had our friends.</span> <span id="s3717">We had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s3718">We had friends, Hungarian friends, of course, they were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s3719">Some of them came here from, from Australia and then we met here.</span> <span id="s3720">And then we an association, Budapest.</span> <span id="s3721">Every city had an association and we got once a month together in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s3722">They had five o’clock teas.</span> <span id="s3723">And of course, the end was always the Holocaust, talking about the Holocaust, because almost all of them were in Holocaust, you know, there.</span> <span id="s3724">So, I felt very well.</span> <span id="s3725">I felt… yeah.</span> <span id="s3726">The last six months when I left, when I was alone there, my husband died, I was there four more years alone and then they… _______… “George, when are you coming?”</span> <span id="s3727">I met a woman, who was my age exactly and he worked… I told you that too?</span> <span id="s3728">He worked, she worked in Manhattan in the jewelry section.</span> <span id="s3729">She was an American.</span> <span id="s3730">And she didn’t live very far from us.</span> <span id="s3731">And I went every week, I went to the theater.</span> <span id="s3732">I said it?</span> <span id="s3733">I told that story?</span> <span id="s3734">But we had private buses and they went certain hours, because I didn’t want to go by train.</span> <span id="s3735">And I didn’t drive to Manhattan.</span> <span id="s3736">She was going to the same beauty parlor as me and she was sitting near me.</span> <span id="s3737">And one day I hear that she’s talking about it that she was in Alaska and whatever, but still I didn’t talk to her.</span> <span id="s3738">Maybe I am not friendly.</span> <span id="s3739">I am not talking to people whom I don’t know, but I overheard everything.</span> <span id="s3740">But she noticed… yeah, I go to the bus and I am waiting on the bus.</span> <span id="s3741">And she lived in that street where the bus stop was and she went to Manhattan, too.</span> <span id="s3742">And she said to me, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s3743">It’s first time she spoke to me.</span> <span id="s3744">I said, “I am going to the theater.”</span> <span id="s3745">She says, “Alone?”</span> <span id="s3746">I says, “Yes, my husband died and I’m going alone.”</span> <span id="s3747">She said, “My God, would you get me a ticket, too?</span> <span id="s3748">For next performance?”</span> <span id="s3749">I says, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s3750">She said, “Because I am alone, too.</span> <span id="s3751">My husband died.”</span> <span id="s3752">And I said, “Where do I leave the ticket?”</span> <span id="s3753">She said, leave it with my beautician when you go the beauty parlor.</span> <span id="s3754">And I left the ticket, and from then on we became good friends.</span> <span id="s3755">And every week we went together, but not by bus.</span> <span id="s3756">I was driving.</span> <span id="s3757">I know how to drive, but she didn’t have a car.</span> <span id="s3758">She knew where to go, but I knew how.</span> <span id="s3759">And we went by car.</span> <span id="s3760">And there was the parking under the theater and it paid.</span> <span id="s3761">Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it’s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars, parking under the theater.</span> <span id="s3762">And after that we went always to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a wonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a garden restaurant, where they had coffee and cake.</span> <span id="s3763">After that we went up, and we were very good friends, but it was only six months because six months later I came.</span> <span id="s3764">And her son was a manager of the Days Inn Hotel in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s3765">And when we went, first time when we went to the country, first year, and I was very, very homesick for New York and I was depressed and I was crying in the country.</span> <span id="s3766">And George said, “Do you want to go to the city?”</span> <span id="s3767">I says “Yes.”</span> <span id="s3768">So, I called her up and her son gave us a suite for 25 dollars and we stayed there for three days.</span> <span id="s3769">And he went to the museum right away.</span> <span id="s3770">And I went, I think, with Laura to Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s3771">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3772">And I think that Ilona went with him, yes, to the museum.</span> <span id="s3773">And we stayed there three days.</span> <span id="s3774">And then again, one time I went only with Ilona.</span> <span id="s3775">I stayed there a week.</span> <span id="s3776">And I included her always, the woman for the theater, and they gave us a dinner there, for the… I remember before we left and she was there too, you know, in the hotel.</span> <span id="s3777">And we had a very good time, but it was only for six months.</span> <span id="s3778">I met her late.</span> <span id="s3779">I mean I saw her, but I didn’t know who she was and because I was there four years alone.</span> <span id="s3780">And she was alone four years, too.</span> <span id="s3781">And she was retiring, too, the same time.</span> <span id="s3782">She worked 20, 27 years, too.</span> <span id="s3783">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s3784">So it was late.</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">Q: Tell me something else, you mentioned early on that soon after you arrived you saw your first black man.</span> <span id="s3786">And that was near the time, just around the time when the Civil Rights movement was starting.</span> <span id="s3787">But tell me, were you surprised about the way that blacks were treated in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">A: In New York weren’t treated bad, but here, when he came here, the blacks were sitting in the back of the bus.</span> <span id="s3789">That I couldn’t imagine.</span> <span id="s3790">It was no sales ladies black, no one.</span> <span id="s3791">I didn’t see no one black, they were all separate.</span> <span id="s3792">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3793">And what was the most unbelievable thing, everybody wore sneakers.</span> <span id="s3794">In the subways, too.</span> <span id="s3795">And we said, “They don’t have shoes here?</span> <span id="s3796">Everybody’s wearing sneakers.”</span> <span id="s3797">We couldn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s3798">Everybody in the morning.</span> <span id="s3799">And then we saw people who went to bigger offices to work.</span> <span id="s3800">They had they shoes in they bags, because if you have to wait for a bus and, many times I was waiting with high heels and I said, “My God, I wish I would wear sneakers,” you know?</span> <span id="s3801">When I went to the city I was wearing always high heels.</span> <span id="s3802">Because in the office I was wearing always high heels.</span> <span id="s3803">And that was the custom.</span> <span id="s3804">We couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s3805">That was the most unbelievable thing when we went on the subway that everybody is in white sneakers.</span> <span id="s3806">We didn’t know about the segregation.</span> <span id="s3807">We didn’t know in Hungary about it.</span> <span id="s3808">We didn’t, we didn’t have blacks.</span> <span id="s3809">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s3810">Oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3811">I saw the first black man in the English Army.</span> <span id="s3812">I saw a soldier.</span> <span id="s3813">And it wasn’t even… I don’t know whether he was in the English army.</span> <span id="s3814">It’s interesting, they were taking us by jeep to Nuremberg from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s3815">And another jeep came and they were throwing to us from their jeep, oranges.</span> <span id="s3816">And it was a black soldier.</span> <span id="s3817">That was the first one.</span> <span id="s3818">Not the first one.</span> <span id="s3819">Yes, that was the first one.</span> <span id="s3820">But I just didn’t notice it, color, color… it was no difference to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">Q: I just wondered if, because you had come from a situation where the discrimination was, was, had such an effect.</span> <span id="s3822">Whether you expected something different in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">A: I didn’t know what to expect here.</span> <span id="s3824">I knew just I have an uncle here.</span> <span id="s3825">I didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s3826">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3827">The very, very bad experience was the very, very first time when we had a bigger apartment and George with the school was supposed to go to the Shakespearean play with the school to Connecticut.</span> <span id="s3828">And he comes home and he had a friend, who was a very tough guy.</span> <span id="s3829">He was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s3830">And he was with him, probably, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3831">And a black boy started to hit George.</span> <span id="s3832">And he hit him in his mouth.</span> <span id="s3833">He lost a tooth and he was bleeding and he couldn’t go to the show.</span> <span id="s3834">That was the very, very first time when I said, “Oh my God, what is going on here?”</span> <span id="s3835">In Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s3836">It was on the corner where we lived.</span> <span id="s3837">So then I said, “Oh my God.”</span> <span id="s3838">You know?</span> <span id="s3839">I didn’t know nothing about it.</span> <span id="s3840">It was a very strange thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">Q: Did you understand the reason why it had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">A: I think that they wanted the other boy, because he was a very tough guy.</span> <span id="s3843">He was wearing always boots and he had a knife in his boot.</span> <span id="s3844">So, he was his bodyguard.</span> <span id="s3845">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s3846">After that when it happened, he was always with him.</span> <span id="s3847">Because I didn’t know why it happened, because he is white.</span> <span id="s3848">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3849">But then I knew, you know, when it happened then I knew that maybe… but maybe they knew the other guy and they wanted him and they… he was weak.</span> <span id="s3850">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3851">I don’t know, but I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s3852">I felt terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">Q: Did you feel a little bit, was it, did you feel a little bit of prejudice after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3855">I tell you why, because I worked with blacks in the hospital.</span> <span id="s3856">My best friends were blacks, who are still calling me.</span> <span id="s3857">But not New Yorkers.</span> <span id="s3858">They were from Barbados, from Jamaica and they are different.</span> <span id="s3859">They are entirely different.</span> <span id="s3860">New York blacks are no good.</span> <span id="s3861">They are no good.</span> <span id="s3862">They are.</span> <span id="s3863">They are no good.</span> <span id="s3864">But those people, I don’t know whether they are more educated or why, but they were entirely different.</span> <span id="s3865">And we had… oh, that story is interesting, too.</span> <span id="s3866">We had New Yorkers, too, there and they hated each other.</span> <span id="s3867">The Jamaicans and the Barbadians, they hated the New York blacks in the office.</span> <span id="s3868">In the big accounting office.</span> <span id="s3869">So it was a big hatred between them.</span> <span id="s3870">And oh gosh, one had two daughters and one daughter married a New Yorker.</span> <span id="s3871">She is divorced.</span> <span id="s3872">She divorced him.</span> <span id="s3873">But they were very against him.</span> <span id="s3874">They feel that they are more.</span> <span id="s3875">They are.</span> <span id="s3876">They are more educated.</span> <span id="s3877">And one of them was going to school in England and her husband was an engineer.</span> <span id="s3878">And unfortunately they are different.</span> <span id="s3879">I didn’t come across a New Yorker black who was so nice as those.</span> <span id="s3880">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s3881">I’m not talking about Harlem.</span> <span id="s3882">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3883">But what was around me, that was my opinion and that’s how I felt, that they were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">End of Tape 5, Side B Tape 6, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">Q: This is tape number six, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.</span> <span id="s3886">When did you start speaking about your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">A: In 1986, when I came here, and I went to the beauty parlor and I had a short sleeve shirt on and the beautician said, “What is that?”</span> <span id="s3888">I said, “This is the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s3889">“The Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3890">My daughter was just taught in Tates Creek High that she shouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3891">That they shouldn’t believe it, it was a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3892">It was made up by the Jews.”</span> <span id="s3893">I thought I faint.</span> <span id="s3894">I says, “What?”</span> <span id="s3895">She says, “Yes, she was just taught.</span> <span id="s3896">And I very surprised to see you.</span> <span id="s3897">I never saw a survivor.”</span> <span id="s3898">Then a woman came here—I came here the first time alone when we didn’t move in yet and they had blinds made in the family room—and she was from McAlpins.</span> <span id="s3899">And I’m sitting in the chair and she sits near me, this way, and she noticed the number.</span> <span id="s3900">And she jumps up and she starts to scream.</span> <span id="s3901">I says, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s3902">She says, “I never saw somebody, I never saw nobody, who came back from there.</span> <span id="s3903">Let me have a, let me, can I make a prayer for you?”</span> <span id="s3904">And she kneels down and she starts to pray like I would come, you know, from somewhere, an alien.</span> <span id="s3905">It was unbelievable experience.</span> <span id="s3906">But after that when it happened, that she said they were teaching it.</span> <span id="s3907">She was teaching in Nicholasville, Laura, at that time.</span> <span id="s3908">And I told her, I says, “Where did you bring me?</span> <span id="s3909">That’s what they teach here?</span> <span id="s3910">I never heard it in my life.”</span> <span id="s3911">And she was very upset, and she spoke to the high school teacher there and she said, “How about if she would come to school?”</span> <span id="s3912">I says, “I cannot talk.</span> <span id="s3913">I never spoke in my life.”</span> <span id="s3914">She says, “How about if I come to your house?”</span> <span id="s3915">She said.</span> <span id="s3916">So she came, and I spoke to the microphone for two hours.</span> <span id="s3917">And from that moment on, she [phone rings] …She came from the high school.</span> <span id="s3918">I spoke two hours in the microphone.</span> <span id="s3919">And it was no stop.</span> <span id="s3920">They came to the house and they were begging me to come to speak in the high school there.</span> <span id="s3921">And it was a pretty bad experience, the very first one.</span> <span id="s3922">That was the first time when I spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">Q: What was the high school where you spoke?</span> <span id="s3924">Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">A: I don’t know whether, yeah, they have more.</span> <span id="s3926">I spoke at other high schools, too.</span> <span id="s3927">It was a regular high school, but I spoke at the high school there, when there were women who were pregnant and they were going to school.</span> <span id="s3928">That was another high school, but that was regular high school.</span> <span id="s3929">I don’t know what was the name, in Nicholasville, Jessamine County.</span> <span id="s3930">And they were, it was a man teacher, who was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s3931">He was a history teacher.</span> <span id="s3932">But it was a… they sat like around the wall in circle they put the chairs.</span> <span id="s3933">And on that side, on the left side, it was a circle with about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads and they didn’t look at me.</span> <span id="s3934">Because at that time I was beginner speaker and I started to speak and I asked them who believes in the Holocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they should put their hands up.</span> <span id="s3935">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s3936">And the whole time I was talking and they didn’t look at me.</span> <span id="s3937">So when I finished, and I was pretty nervous, that was my first speech.</span> <span id="s3938">But it was good because the teacher was absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s3939">And he was embracing me and “Thank God for you, that you are here,” and that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s3940">And I says, “And do you know whom you have here?”</span> <span id="s3941">He says, “Unfortunately, yes.”</span> <span id="s3942">So, that was a bad experience for me, you know, that there are skinheads there.</span> <span id="s3943">It was in Nicholasville.</span> <span id="s3944">But then I spoke many, many times in Nicholasville middle school, and when Laura was teaching, that was middle school.</span> <span id="s3945">And that high school.</span> <span id="s3946">I don’t know what was the name of that high school.</span> <span id="s3947">They were all girls, women, I mean, and one of them came to me.</span> <span id="s3948">They came after me and she said that, “I thank you very much for coming because my father is German and he is telling an entirely different story and I knew that it’s something wrong how he is telling it to us.”</span> <span id="s3949">So I had that kind of an experiences.</span> <span id="s3950">Then it was non-stop, one school after the other.</span> <span id="s3951">Then it was in Paris, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s3952">In Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education.</span> <span id="s3953">That was George’s department, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two appointments.</span> <span id="s3954">A very nice, very nice professor.</span> <span id="s3955">And he had student teachers in Paris, Kentucky, and he took me to Paris, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s3956">And some, they took videos there that day, but it was a very big wind and the windows were open.</span> <span id="s3957">They didn’t have air conditioners.</span> <span id="s3958">And the videos didn’t came out.</span> <span id="s3959">Well, so he took me the second time and he took with him a professional videotaper from U.K. And I didn’t know nothing, who else is there, but I saw that they are women there and they are taking pictures, too, from me.</span> <span id="s3960">And they are writing.</span> <span id="s3961">I had no idea that the paper is there.</span> <span id="s3962">He called The Herald.</span> <span id="s3963">And that was the first time when I was in The Herald-Leader.</span> <span id="s3964">And when I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop.</span> <span id="s3965">People were calling me.</span> <span id="s3966">Schools were calling me, and I can tell you that I spoke in every school in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160 times already.</span> <span id="s3967">Because usually I, they put together six, seven, eight grades usually in the auditorium.</span> <span id="s3968">And if the next bunch of kids comes, they call me back again.</span> <span id="s3969">And in every high school I spoke, too.</span> <span id="s3970">In every high school.</span> <span id="s3971">I spoke twice in Dunbar.</span> <span id="s3972">In… what is that station?</span> <span id="s3973">Bryan Station, Bryan Station, they were very nice there.</span> <span id="s3974">I spoke in Lafayette.</span> <span id="s3975">Now I have to go again.</span> <span id="s3976">Because I spoke when Ilona was there and still the teacher is there and now Anna has the teacher.</span> <span id="s3977">And she, he was asking whether your grandmother still does it.</span> <span id="s3978">And Henry Clay, I spoke at Henry Clay.</span> <span id="s3979">Twice I spoke already at the Community College.</span> <span id="s3980">Three times at U.K. I spoke in the nurse’s department, Psychiatric Nurses’ department.</span> <span id="s3981">And then the other was the Middle Eastern studies, both of them twice.</span> <span id="s3982">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">Q: Have people been receptive mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s3984">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s3985">Very, very nice.</span> <span id="s3986">Very nice.</span> <span id="s3987">Very, very nice.</span> <span id="s3988">I cannot tell you, I have a whole drawer, from letters, what they are doing, Montessori school.</span> <span id="s3989">All the Montessori schools I spoke.</span> <span id="s3990">There are three of them here.</span> <span id="s3991">I spoke in Scapa, I don’t know how many times.</span> <span id="s3992">And what they do, the Scapa… oh, I spoke, lately I spoke in the Adult Education at night.</span> <span id="s3993">That’s education at U.K. I have a series for the concerts, five tickets for the U.K… not U.K., concerts what they are doing, gosh, five a year.</span> <span id="s3994">Five concerts, from all over the world they are coming.</span> <span id="s3995">And the teacher, the professor that sits in front of me, she is a woman, but is George’s colleague actually.</span> <span id="s3996">So, she never… I don’t know, she was always afraid to ask me and we always talk to her.</span> <span id="s3997">And a few weeks ago, it was a concert and she turns around and she says, “Are you alright?”</span> <span id="s3998">And I says, “Yes, why?”</span> <span id="s3999">I wasn’t all right the week before and George was there with Ana.</span> <span id="s4000">And she says, “Oh, can I ask you to talk?”</span> <span id="s4001">I says, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s4002">And one of her students, they are all for Masters, teachers who are going for Masters.</span> <span id="s4003">And one of her students is from Scapa.</span> <span id="s4004">And she’s her best friend.</span> <span id="s4005">And that woman, she is a pastor’s wife from the Lutheran church, Mrs. Gross.</span> <span id="s4006">Wonderful, wonderful person.</span> <span id="s4007">I don’t know how many times I spoke.</span> <span id="s4008">And what she is doing, she binds the books what the children are writing.</span> <span id="s4009">The letters, and it’s unbelievable what they are doing.</span> <span id="s4010">And flowers they are giving me.</span> <span id="s4011">And that professor, Dr. Backner, I don’t know how many times he took me.</span> <span id="s4012">He was, unfortunately he didn’t get tenure at U.K. because he wasn’t writing.</span> <span id="s4013">But he said he didn’t want the tenure.</span> <span id="s4014">He was there six years.</span> <span id="s4015">And then he was principal in Georgetown.</span> <span id="s4016">And he called me there, too.</span> <span id="s4017">I spoke in Georgetown for him, and he picks me up, and he takes me home, and in-between he takes me to a restaurant when he takes me home, to the nicest restaurants to eat.</span> <span id="s4018">And it was an opening here in Lexington, what’s it, Lexington Traditional.</span> <span id="s4019">It’s on Nicholasville Road.</span> <span id="s4020">And I asked him when he was in… because I spoke there two or three times and I knew it was an opening there for principal.</span> <span id="s4021">And I ask him in Georgetown whether he wants to come to Lexington.</span> <span id="s4022">He lives here.</span> <span id="s4023">And he says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s4024">I says, “Because I know it’s, I don’t know the principal who is there, just in between.”</span> <span id="s4025">He lives, she was, he was Laura’s principal in Jesse Clark.</span> <span id="s4026">He lives in our corner.</span> <span id="s4027">And I said, “Is Mr. Mossgrave there?”</span> <span id="s4028">And he says, “Oh, not a bad idea.”</span> <span id="s4029">And then I spoke to Mossgrave.</span> <span id="s4030">I says, “Would you please call him because you are here only for a few months.”</span> <span id="s4031">[Laughing] Because he is retired, and he works a few months only because of the Social Security probably.</span> <span id="s4032">And he got the job.</span> <span id="s4033">He got the job.</span> <span id="s4034">So I already spoke twice to him here, in _______.</span> <span id="s4035">And last time his wife picked me up, and we met in the restaurant, Chaise (ph).</span> <span id="s4036">And he came there from school and his daughter came, too.</span> <span id="s4037">It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s4038">His daughter was for a whole year in Belarus.</span> <span id="s4039">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s4040">She said, she loves the people there and she wants to learn the language.</span> <span id="s4041">Very nice person.</span> <span id="s4042">And both of them came to listen to me, too.</span> <span id="s4043">The wife and the daughter, last time that I spoke.</span> <span id="s4044">It was the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s4045">Q: When you started speaking about your experiences, did you find that memories were coming up that you hadn’t thought of?</span></p> <p><span id="s4046">A: Everything is coming up.</span> <span id="s4047">I don’t… if they give me enough time, I am telling them from beginning to the end, everything.</span> <span id="s4048">Memories are always with me, not coming up, they are always with me.</span> <span id="s4049">And I don’t try to forget it.</span> <span id="s4050">Sylvia tries to forget it.</span> <span id="s4051">That’s the difference between me and Sylvia.</span> <span id="s4052">And it’s a big difference, because she married an American man and she never had to talk about it.</span> <span id="s4053">So it’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s4054">But she doesn’t want to talk about it with me either.</span> <span id="s4055">And she was in the same place.</span> <span id="s4056">She was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s4057">And she doesn’t want, she says what she has left over, life, she wants to make it happy.</span> <span id="s4058">I cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s4059">I cannot erase it that they killed my parents.</span> <span id="s4060">I can’t.</span> <span id="s4061">And the six million people and everybody and big, big family from my grandmother’s side.</span> <span id="s4062">I can’t.</span> <span id="s4063">I can’t forget it, no one day.</span> <span id="s4064">And I am dreaming about it, especially when I’m talking, I’m dreaming.</span> <span id="s4065">I said once to my heart doctor, I says, “I just don’t know, I cannot sleep.</span> <span id="s4066">Maybe I shouldn’t talk anymore.”</span> <span id="s4067">He said, “You just take your pill and talk.”</span> <span id="s4068">[Laughing] That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s4069">They are so funny the doctors.</span> <span id="s4070">They have my pictures, when I am in the newspaper, they put it in they files.</span> <span id="s4071">So, when they bring the files, here you are.</span> <span id="s4072">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s4073">Yeah, lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4074">Q: You talked earlier, I guess it was the last time, about how you had such guilt feelings after your parents and your sister were killed.</span> <span id="s4075">And I wondered if you ever got over guilt feelings?</span> <span id="s4076">If you ever got over that?</span></p> <p><span id="s4077">A: I, look, I have a guilt feeling always about my sister, yes.</span> <span id="s4078">How is it that she said… it’s fate.</span> <span id="s4079">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4080">I have to come… I have to forget that guilt feeling, because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s4081">I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s4082">And I am sure that if I would be there, I would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s4083">Because she had an opportunity to escape and she says, “I go where my mother goes.”</span> <span id="s4084">And if I would be there, I would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s4085">I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s4086">It was a coincidence.</span> <span id="s4087">I had problem with my rheumatic fever that year and I had to go… my mother send me first.</span> <span id="s4088">Every summer we spent there in Budapest at my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s4089">And I took every year a cure for my rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s4090">When it was nothing wrong with me.</span> <span id="s4091">The doctor said we should do it that it shouldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s4092">And I had a doctor there, in one of those baths that they have.</span> <span id="s4093">It’s wonderful waters they have.</span> <span id="s4094">And he gave me a cure for three weeks.</span> <span id="s4095">And it wasn’t my fault that I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s4096">I was thinking about it many times.</span> <span id="s4097">That I should make, I shouldn’t be so guilty because it wasn’t my fault.</span> <span id="s4098">First time in my life, I was 21, and first time in my life I was traveling alone.</span> <span id="s4099">It was 400 miles on the train to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s4100">Because I finished school and my sister was still in school, otherwise we would go together.</span> <span id="s4101">The year before, Christmas, we went together with my sister.</span> <span id="s4102">So it wasn’t my fault.</span> <span id="s4103">It was fate.</span> <span id="s4104">It was fate.</span> <span id="s4105">And when I was telling it in some schools and I says… children were asking me, how come that you survive?</span> <span id="s4106">I says, “That’s the only question I cannot answer you.”</span> <span id="s4107">And the principal, not principal, the Superintendent, I didn’t know that he was there.</span> <span id="s4108">He said… he was sitting in the corner.</span> <span id="s4109">“I tell you why,” he said.</span> <span id="s4110">“That she should spread it to the people.”</span> <span id="s4111">I says, “Thank you very much for helping me out, but I think my sister could have spread it, too.</span> <span id="s4112">So, it is nice that you think about it this way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4113">Q: Do you feel safe and at home in this country, and in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s4114">A: I’m every year alone in this house, now I don’t go with them in the country.</span> <span id="s4115">And this year I am thinking about it.</span> <span id="s4116">That they really shouldn’t do it, that they leave me alone here.</span> <span id="s4117">I went with them every year, but I don’t know how many years now, about four years, I don’t go because Laura wants to be alone with George.</span> <span id="s4118">And he says we are here together the whole year, we are together.</span> <span id="s4119">Though it’s my house, I cannot go there.</span> <span id="s4120">So, I went there three years ago.</span> <span id="s4121">She went to Hungary with Ana, because she was never in Hungary, Ana.</span> <span id="s4122">She was never in Hungary.</span> <span id="s4123">Ilona was with me.</span> <span id="s4124">I took Ilona. ’</span> <span id="s4125">89, after her, that was my Bat Mitzvah present to her in ‘89.</span> <span id="s4126">I took her to Hungary for three weeks and one week in Vienna we were.</span> <span id="s4127">And so, she went with Ana.</span> <span id="s4128">I gave Ana her Bat Mitzvah present, the ticket, to go to Hungary.</span> <span id="s4129">So Laura had a free ticket that she’s collecting, you know, the free flights.</span> <span id="s4130">So they went to Hungary.</span> <span id="s4131">And then I went for three weeks to the country and stayed with George.</span> <span id="s4132">I had a great time.</span> <span id="s4133">I had a great time.</span> <span id="s4134">What should I tell you.</span> <span id="s4135">So, that’s the situation.</span> <span id="s4136">I won’t go there now, sick as I am.</span> <span id="s4137">See we have always only one car there, and I am depending on them.</span> <span id="s4138">And it’s not comfortable anymore.</span> <span id="s4139">I took now, when the children are there, upstairs the bedroom, because it’s a… they made a window, you know, the skylight there.</span> <span id="s4140">And they have air conditioner up there.</span> <span id="s4141">I cannot go steps up again, and up and down.</span> <span id="s4142">And they made a half bathroom there, I made.</span> <span id="s4143">I had to pay half for it, the time that I am up there.</span> <span id="s4144">And that’s only half bathroom.</span> <span id="s4145">If I want to take a bath, I have to go downstairs.</span> <span id="s4146">It’s no more comfortable for me.</span> <span id="s4147">It came to a point that it’s no more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s4148">Q: I just was wondering if you felt that America had become home to you and that you, also whether you felt like…</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">A: It was my home.</span> <span id="s4150">New York was my home.</span> <span id="s4151">It was my home.</span> <span id="s4152">I never, when I went even to Hungary, I never said I’m going home.</span> <span id="s4153">That I can erase because of what they did to us.</span> <span id="s4154">You know?</span> <span id="s4155">I was born there.</span> <span id="s4156">And all the relatives there.</span> <span id="s4157">But I never, never said “I am going home.</span> <span id="s4158">I am going to Hungary.”</span> <span id="s4159">New York was my home.</span> <span id="s4160">I felt at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s4161">Q: Do you think that people in this country and in this day and age are, are paying attention enough to the dangers of what happened during the Holocaust and making sure that it couldn’t happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s4162">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s4163">The people are so far away from it.</span> <span id="s4164">Even then, when it happened, I think, they were so far away from it, that it’s only me that I am afraid that it can happen and what can happen.</span> <span id="s4165">It’s only me who went through.</span> <span id="s4166">They are laughing when I am saying it, that I am afraid from everything.</span> <span id="s4167">I am afraid of my shadow, you know, that kind of a situation.</span> <span id="s4168">But no.</span> <span id="s4169">When we went to Hungary and they were asking us, “How could you live there?</span> <span id="s4170">This is a jungle there, in New York.”</span> <span id="s4171">You know?</span> <span id="s4172">They have a very bad opinion of what’s happening in New York.</span> <span id="s4173">It’s happening here, too.</span> <span id="s4174">This is much smaller and what’s happening here, when you open the television, they start the killing.</span> <span id="s4175">Okay, it’s a family killing or whatever but it’s happening.</span> <span id="s4176">It’s happening here, too.</span> <span id="s4177">And it’s always worse for the people who don’t live in a place.</span> <span id="s4178">You know, it seems much worse.</span> <span id="s4179">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4180">I wasn’t afraid in New York where I lived.</span> <span id="s4181">Once I was very afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have to give back Hong Kong, and they were coming.</span> <span id="s4182">And he said that he wants it for his family.</span> <span id="s4183">Baloney.</span> <span id="s4184">He made a business from it.</span> <span id="s4185">He made from a two-family house, four families.</span> <span id="s4186">For money, he’s getting rent.</span> <span id="s4187">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s4188">From the basement he made two apartments and two apartments what we had upstairs.</span> <span id="s4189">I went to see it when… there’s no garage.</span> <span id="s4190">From the garage he made an apartment.</span> <span id="s4191">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s4192">And he wanted to get out from it, the last minute.</span> <span id="s4193">But he had 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down?</span> <span id="s4194">How much?</span> <span id="s4195">I don’t know how many thousands he had to put down when we made the agreement.</span> <span id="s4196">It was in the lawyers, collateral, you know.</span> <span id="s4197">And he wanted to, if he doesn’t get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got the mortgage what he wanted.</span> <span id="s4198">The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted.</span> <span id="s4199">But he wanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s4200">But then he would lose that money.</span> <span id="s4201">I think it was 25.</span> <span id="s4202">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s4203">Anyway.</span> <span id="s4204">And I was getting phone calls and it was a strange, strange accent, that I am going to come and kill you.</span> <span id="s4205">So then I said, “My God, I want to get out as early as can from here.”</span> <span id="s4206">You know?</span> <span id="s4207">I think they were those people, those Chinese, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4208">Then I was very afraid.</span> <span id="s4209">Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed.</span> <span id="s4210">So I slept, not in our house, we lived in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment, we were robbed.</span> <span id="s4211">But that’s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s4212">But otherwise, otherwise I didn’t have that fear.</span> <span id="s4213">I didn’t go on the subways, I was driving.</span> <span id="s4214">And it was very dangerous already, in the hospital, too.</span> <span id="s4215">So it was a parking lot across the street where I paid parking.</span> <span id="s4216">And I just ran to the building.</span> <span id="s4217">It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s4218">I got out at the last minute really, because if you walked in the hospital itself, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or something, people from outside came and they took it off.</span> <span id="s4219">So it was a very dangerous place.</span> <span id="s4220">And it is very interesting that every hospital in New York, it is in a bad place now.</span> <span id="s4221">It is very interesting.</span> <span id="s4222">Even Flowers (ph), Fifth Avenue, my God, my husband was operated, spine operation and I went to visit him with George.</span> <span id="s4223">Behind it there were big buildings and we had to get off the subway.</span> <span id="s4224">And they were throwing bottles against us.</span> <span id="s4225">That was the best hospital, the name Flower, Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s4226">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s4227">That was years ago.</span> <span id="s4228">Stay in Harlem, or no.</span> <span id="s4229">So, we came here.</span> <span id="s4230">What I was seeing today on the television show, it’s really scary, about five black guys, who are thieves.</span> <span id="s4231">And that show is from New York, and how they are stealing cars and how they are just bumping into people’s cars.</span> <span id="s4232">And then innocent women, they get out, what happened.</span> <span id="s4233">And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other car behind them and they take that car because it’s a better car than theirs.</span> <span id="s4234">There were five of them.</span> <span id="s4235">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s4236">I don’t know how they can say it on the television this way.</span> <span id="s4237">And there was a detective there, too.</span> <span id="s4238">And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it and they are selling it.</span> <span id="s4239">And she said, “How much you get for that car?”</span> <span id="s4240">She says, “We sell it for parts, 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s4241">And if it’s a Mercedes, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars.”</span> <span id="s4242">This is, this is, now again a more dangerous life since I came.</span> <span id="s4243">They were stealing cars, of course they were stealing cars, but that way I didn’t hear it, never, when I was living there.</span> <span id="s4244">So it’s now 13 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s4245">Q: What about anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s4246">A: In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s4247">Q: Living in Lexington, have you experienced anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s4248">A: Actually no, because I am not… I think in this neighborhood, yes.</span> <span id="s4249">I didn’t experience it, but I have a friend, who is married to a Chinese man.</span> <span id="s4250">She’s from Canada.</span> <span id="s4251">And she, nobody was her friend, only I. [Laughing.]</span> <span id="s4252">But she lives here a long, long time, and her mother was Russian.</span> <span id="s4253">And she was born in Canada.</span> <span id="s4254">And she’s telling me that this neighborhood, when she… they builded the house.</span> <span id="s4255">They didn’t allow Jews in this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s4256">That was what she was telling me.</span> <span id="s4257">And then I had a remark.</span> <span id="s4258">Somebody came, I don’t know who was it, those guys who are, you know, trying to convert you.</span> <span id="s4259">I don’t know which religion was it.</span> <span id="s4260">And I said, “I am not interested.</span> <span id="s4261">I am Jewish.”</span> <span id="s4262">And he said, “What is it, everybody is Jewish in this neighborhood?”</span> <span id="s4263">I says, “No, minority.”</span> <span id="s4264">They are all Baptist here, in this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s4265">But now there are a few Jewish families.</span> <span id="s4266">But she said that they weren’t allowed here in this neighborhood, Jews.</span> <span id="s4267">I didn’t, as I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4268">I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s4269">And she, she was unbelievable, they didn’t want to take her nowhere between them, because she was marrying to a Chinese.</span> <span id="s4270">He is a genius.</span> <span id="s4271">He is now 70, I don’t know, something.</span> <span id="s4272">He got tenure.</span> <span id="s4273">He was with IBM originally.</span> <span id="s4274">And then he was teaching at UK.</span> <span id="s4275">And now he is teaching in Frankfort in state university.</span> <span id="s4276">And at age 70 they gave him tenure.</span> <span id="s4277">He is such a genius.</span> <span id="s4278">But he is Chinese.</span> <span id="s4279">And she has two Chinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and a son, both of them are doctors.</span> <span id="s4280">And they were really suffering in this neighborhood, she said, because they were Chinese kids.</span> <span id="s4281">She was always telling me what they went through.</span> <span id="s4282">So, it’s any difference, Chinese or Jew?</span> <span id="s4283">If they don’t, if it’s not their own, then they don’t like you.</span> <span id="s4284">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4285">We are friends.</span> <span id="s4286">With this building now.</span> <span id="s4287">Those people lived before them a very long time here, 20 years.</span> <span id="s4288">He was a pathologist and she was Head of Pathology at UK.</span> <span id="s4289">And we didn’t go to each other’s houses, but when we spoke we were very nice.</span> <span id="s4290">And her daughter, Jenna’s daughter, when she got married in Louisville all the neighbors got together, five of us and we went all to the wedding, to her daughter’s wedding, because she didn’t have any family here.</span> <span id="s4291">She doesn’t have any family here.</span> <span id="s4292">And because I am Jewish and she is married to a Chinese [laughing] so we are very good friends.</span> <span id="s4293">We are going together, she helps me enormously.</span> <span id="s4294">She is a very good person.</span> <span id="s4295">Now she was, she was nurse, actually.</span> <span id="s4296">She went for nursing in Case Western, in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s4297">She met him there somewhere, I don’t know, in Ohio.</span> <span id="s4298">She… really, she felt it at UK.</span> <span id="s4299">She was in the Nursing department and she was the head of the private nurses at that time they had.</span> <span id="s4300">And she had to give the patients the nurses.</span> <span id="s4301">And she is absolutely, you know, she didn’t know about discrimination.</span> <span id="s4302">And she gave once a black nurse to a white person.</span> <span id="s4303">She was fired.</span> <span id="s4304">And then when she was fired from there she started to tutor.</span> <span id="s4305">She is very good in math.</span> <span id="s4306">And she tutored all the kids from this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s4307">She knows everybody because she was a tutor.</span> <span id="s4308">And from that, because it was not enough what her husband made, they send the two children to medical school.</span> <span id="s4309">The daughter is a psychiatrist and she is having now the first baby, she is waiting every minute, though she is 35 years old.</span> <span id="s4310">Yeah, she is.</span> <span id="s4311">And she lives in Louisville.</span> <span id="s4312">And the son is in Louisville, too.</span> <span id="s4313">He is a general practitioner, but he wanted to be a surgeon.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">End of Tape 6, Side A Tape 6, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s4315">A: …here that I am accepted.</span> <span id="s4316">I think because of the speeches, that’s why.</span> <span id="s4317">Many people know me, and many people want me, and many people are very grateful that I am teaching and I am teaching the children about history, what is not, unfortunately, not in history books.</span> <span id="s4318">It’s only a few words about the Second World War, the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s4319">And I don’t know whether it ever will be.</span> <span id="s4320">And they are very grateful and gracious.</span> <span id="s4321">And really they do everything for me.</span> <span id="s4322">They pick me up, they take me home, they take me to eat.</span> <span id="s4323">They give me presents.</span> <span id="s4324">It’s unbelievable what they are doing, those people.</span> <span id="s4325">And I think that it’s sincere.</span> <span id="s4326">Those people who, you know, who are calling me and I am talking… so it’s many people.</span> <span id="s4327">150 times I talk, it’s many people.</span> <span id="s4328">They are sincere.</span> <span id="s4329">And they are not anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s4330">They are not.</span> <span id="s4331">I’m convinced 100 percent about many, many of them, they are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s4332">Q: Anything else you’d like to say before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s4333">A: Before we close?</span> <span id="s4334">You are a nice person.</span> <span id="s4335">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s4336">I like you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4337">Q: You’re a nice person, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s4338">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s4339">[Laughter.]</span></p> <p><span id="s4340">Q: I thank you very
