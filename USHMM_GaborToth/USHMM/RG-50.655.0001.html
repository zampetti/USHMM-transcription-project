War Years Around the time of the middle ages, the decree was that all Jews had to take on surnames because previously they went by their Hebrew lineage.</span> <span id="s14">Many people got their name from the region where they lived, or the name of a town, or their profession, and so forth.</span> <span id="s15">My mother’s name was Hannah Hochstien, meaning a high rock or mountain.</span> <span id="s16">My father’s name was Simon Szklasz.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">My mother’s village was called Dubenka (I’m spelling it phonetically).</span> <span id="s18">The only place where I found it spelled out was on etched glass on a wall at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC.</span> <span id="s19">It was such a small village—it was never important enough for a regular map.</span> <span id="s20">But on that etched wall in Washington it exists.</span> <span id="s21">Dubenka.</span> <span id="s22">It was a small village in the province of Lublin, which was a major city in Poland.</span> <span id="s23">This is where our family traced back its generations for hundreds of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">My paternal grandparents lived in Chelm, about thirty miles from Dubenka.</span> <span id="s25">It’s also in the Lublin province but it was considered the big city.</span> <span id="s26">In both of those places—the entire region—either you were Jewish or you were Roman Catholic.</span> <span id="s27">They were the two basic religions.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">I read once in the census of 1938, the population of Chelm was 30,000 people.</span> <span id="s29">Fifty percent were Jews.</span> <span id="s30">So that gave me some understanding why Hitler chose to build most of the death camps in Poland because most of his victims were already in place, already in the region.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">My people were country people, particularly on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s32">My maternal grandfather, as his father before him, was a cobbler.</span> <span id="s33">As a cobbler in Europe in those days he fixed shoes, saddles, and anything with leather that farms needed, or estates.</span> <span id="s34">In my grandfather’s case, he had a route of estates.</span> <span id="s35">He would travel each day to a different estate where they knew him.</span> <span id="s36">He would work on whatever repairs were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">He was kosher so he never ate in their houses.</span> <span id="s38">They would boil him hard-boiled eggs and he would have his own bread.</span> <span id="s39">And he generally ate somewhere outdoors.</span> <span id="s40">But this was done for religious reasons, and frankly in my opinion it was carrying religion too far, but this is how they were—very orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Left to right: Gershon Hochstein, baby Bluma, Rachel and Hannah (my mother).</span> <span id="s42">Family photographs were given to me by an aunt who lived in America for many years.</span> <span id="s43">She got this from my parents before the war.</span> <span id="s44">On the back side is Yiddish writing.</span> <span id="s45">They sent these photographs to Houston and wrote greetings on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Toward Friday his route would take him back to Dubenka where he would be home in time for Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">By Friday afternoon, of course, all practical work stopped.</span> <span id="s48">Everything—what had to be in order—was done.</span> <span id="s49">And even though he was a humble man and a humble worker, once he came home he would dress in his finery and he would be like the king of the house and my grandmother would be the queen, Shabbat was considered such an important holiday.</span> <span id="s50">In fact, in Judaism Shabbat is considered the most important holiday, more important than Passover, than Yom Kippur, than any of the other feasts, because Shabbat is the only holiday mentioned in the Ten Commandments.</span> <span id="s51">The day of rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">My grandfather on my father’s side was a cabinet maker.</span> <span id="s53">He made home-made furniture.</span> <span id="s54">People didn’t have built-in closets in those days in Europe so my grandfather would make wardrobes for them, tables and chairs, fine work.</span> <span id="s55">In fact, his big wedding gift to my parents when they married was such a cabinet for their clothing.</span> <span id="s56">That was their pride and joy.</span> <span id="s57">It was their only nice piece of furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">My grandmother on my father’s side was named Naomi.</span> <span id="s59">She was a bit of a business woman.</span> <span id="s60">She had a little kiosk with candy and shoelaces and other things.</span> <span id="s61">Many many orthodox women helped to support their families this way.</span> <span id="s62">All of them were good seamstresses because they had to make their own clothing, very much in the mode of the early pioneer women in America in the west.</span> <span id="s63">Naomi’s complexion was dark—people called her “the gypsy”—and she was prematurely grey.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">I only know the precise manner of death of my grandmother Rachel on my mother’s side, and my grandfather David on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s65">Grandmother Rachel was being hidden by a Christian family in a hayloft with the youngest child, Mira.</span> <span id="s66">That’s all she had left by then.</span> <span id="s67">They were hiding her, and of course they were in danger, too.</span> <span id="s68">The Nazis used to offer a bounty, so someone betrayed the hiding place, and my grandmother and this little girl were dragged out from the hayloft some distance from the farm and shot.</span> <span id="s69">The owner of the farm, the young man, survived.</span> <span id="s70">And he told my mother—because after they walked her away to the side of the road in a ditch, they heard shots.</span> <span id="s71">And that’s all that was ever seen of her.</span> <span id="s72">She was simply shot and thrown into a ditch, as if of no consequence.</span> <span id="s73">Not human.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">The Hochstein family: Bluma (standing): left to right: Rachel, Mira, Gershon, and Moise.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">The other death verified that I am know, of how and when they died, was my paternal grandfather, David.</span> <span id="s76">When we were hiding in the Ukraine—this must have been ’40, ’41, around that time—people from our district were still running away and hiding in the forest.</span> <span id="s77">And naturally they looked for people from their own towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">This man found us, with a group of other people from the same district.</span> <span id="s79">Everyone was eager to hear news.</span> <span id="s80">Somehow that was a turning point for my psyche, I think.</span> <span id="s81">He came in and everybody surrounded him, and wanted to know news of their relatives or their friends.</span> <span id="s82">And Mama was there, my father wasn’t.</span> <span id="s83">And she said.</span> <span id="s84">Did you know David Szklasz?</span> <span id="s85">That was my grandfather’s name.</span> <span id="s86">The man said, yes—he knew him.</span> <span id="s87">He’s dead, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">My mother said, ‘How?</span> <span id="s89">Where?’</span> <span id="s90">‘He died of hunger,’ and he went on with the conversation to tell other people other things.</span> <span id="s91">My mother started to cry and he got angry with her and said, ‘Stop your crying.</span> <span id="s92">There are worse ways to die than hunger.’</span> <span id="s93">In hunger you just sort of lay down and expire from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s94">So from that standpoint this man felt—he was already so hardened by what he had seen—that dying of malnutrition was considered benign, was considered OK.</span> <span id="s95">And I heard this.</span> <span id="s96">Children were definitely not heard but seen in that generation.</span> <span id="s97">My mother started to cry.</span> <span id="s98">I stood there but it registered in my mind, that if I should ever die—dying of hunger—at least I won’t hurt.</span> <span id="s99">That was something that you sort of put away in your brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Those were my formative years.</span> <span id="s101">That’s how it was.</span> <span id="s102">And I was one of the lucky ones because very very few children of my generation survived.</span> <span id="s103">The killing machine was designed that anybody under fourteen, who was not fit and husky and strong, would not be a burden to the occupation.</span> <span id="s104">So it is really a miracle that I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">This, believe it or not, is me.</span> <span id="s106">Nothing elegant.</span> <span id="s107">My parents were a young couple, my father was a tailor, and you can see they posed me on his work table because behind me are the pictures he would show customers of what he could do for them.</span> <span id="s108">But this was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Those were the early years when we were still in hiding in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s110">It is a highly agricultural area, even today, aside from one or two big cities like Kiev and Odessa, but otherwise it is very agricultural.</span> <span id="s111">So my father’s skill with these big scissors helped save our lives—they weigh about six pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">In fact, those that could survive were usually the ones who had a practical skill.</span> <span id="s113">Being a carpenter, being a tailor, being a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s114">My father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s115">In a cold climate, everybody needed something: a garment made or an older garment remade.</span> <span id="s116">People didn’t have Wal-mart to go to, to buy.</span> <span id="s117">So consequently, if you were useful, you had a better chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">My father was engaged as an apprentice after his bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s119">Poor people had no other choices—he had no choice to get a higher education.</span> <span id="s120">He was placed as an apprentice with a master tailor and he became sort of a servant and resident in the household.</span> <span id="s121">And this is how he learned the tailoring trade.</span> <span id="s122">Then when Papa was old enough and the agreement with the tailor had expired, like an indentured servitude, Papa went to Warsaw, and this is where he learned the actual finer points of tailoring.</span> <span id="s123">So he studied in Warsaw and then he went to a city called Lodz.</span> <span id="s124">Lodz in Poland at that time was the textile capital of eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">He learned about fabrics and weaves and the finer points because it is not enough to know how to sew, you have to sew with the way the grain of the fabric is woven and all those finer details.</span> <span id="s126">So Papa studied his craft since he was a bar mitzvah boy.</span> <span id="s127">All his life, that’s all he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Those were my people.</span> <span id="s129">We were ordinary, very much like everyone else, country people from small towns.</span> <span id="s130">Everybody tried to learn a trade or something practical because it was necessary.</span> <span id="s131">Education was not only limited for economic reasons but it was limited because if you were a Jew, even if you started to go to school, you were harassed and bullied to the point where if you reached the third or fourth grade, you’d have to drop out.</span> <span id="s132">It was impossible to stay there or you were beaten up every day.</span> <span id="s133">People in larger cities and in more western countries in Europe had a better chance for an education than people in Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s134">The assimilation process had already begun and many Jews did everything they could to fit in so that they could go to school, to gymnasium, and get an education and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">These were my parents at the time they were married.</span> <span id="s136">They were very nice-looking people, very good-looking people and very much in love.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">For my parents, their formal education was very limited.</span> <span id="s138">And yet, I can remember from my earliest years, whenever we were together, if we had some sort of table to sit at and eat perhaps a meal or something, my parents and I always talked politics.</span> <span id="s139">They were extremely interested in politics.</span> <span id="s140">They were very well informed about everything that was going on around them.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">There was no radio, there were no newspapers, there was no television, no internet—nothing like we have now.</span> <span id="s142">Big cities, of course, had newspapers.</span> <span id="s143">However, in my time it was the Occupation.</span> <span id="s144">So the newspapers were the propaganda sheets issued by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s145">But my parents kept informed by always getting in touch with people as I described.</span> <span id="s146">Whenever someone would come from the other areas, they would make sure that they would get all the information.</span> <span id="s147">It was a network, and I must say it saved many many lives, because at least we knew a little bit of what was going on.</span> <span id="s148">A little bit.</span> <span id="s149">Later on, in fact, the news of the death trains—the transports to the death camps—was also known.</span> <span id="s150">The secrets were let out by people who escaped occasionally from them, or by people who saw the trains being loaded up with people.</span> <span id="s151">My parents were always very interested and attentive.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Our sources of information during the horror years were extremely limited, mainly by word of mouth, or after seeing an action.</span> <span id="s153">An actione was where you might be somewhere minding your own business and suddenly there was a sweep.</span> <span id="s154">There were whistles and soldiers would come around and suddenly scoop up all the people that were walking around.</span> <span id="s155">And this is how they would scoop up Jews—if you didn’t have the right papers, or if you looked Jewish, or if you were bearded as an orthodox Jew might be.</span> <span id="s156">With men, they had an especially humiliating way of identifying Jewish men.</span> <span id="s157">They would make them undo their pants and check if they were circumcised, mainly a quick practical look, but it was also done in the most humiliating open way, right on the street.</span> <span id="s158">I saw some of that.</span> <span id="s159">I didn’t always fully understand what I saw, but I saw.</span> <span id="s160">I can’t explain what it does to you.</span> <span id="s161">Maybe it depends on the person.</span> <span id="s162">I was angry.</span> <span id="s163">I knew I was Jewish and I knew there was something dangerous about being Jewish, but I didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s164">We were people, we were human beings.</span> <span id="s165">But that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">All Jews were literate in the sense that they always learned Hebrew from a very young age.</span> <span id="s167">My parents spoke and read Polish because they did go to primary grades until they were old enough to be ousted from there.</span> <span id="s168">So they could read and they were always among other Jewish people who were perhaps more educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">The leaders in communities, the rabbis, were always the first ones to be taken away.</span> <span id="s170">Because once you remove people that you look up to, the ordinary person feels more confused, more disturbed, more ‘what do I do, I don’t have anyone to ask for advice.’</span> <span id="s171">So the important people were immediately disposed of, whisked away, who knows where.</span> <span id="s172">But those that were left had to have good survival skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">All Jews, in the sense of knowing a language, were literate.</span> <span id="s174">They read and understood (particularly in the liturgy) Hebrew, and they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s175">Yiddish was the lingua franca in the European world.</span> <span id="s176">It is a Germanic language, with Hebrew and Slavic words thrown in.</span> <span id="s177">But it is basically German.</span> <span id="s178">In fact, quite recently I read a little article that the German government, now, the present government in Germany, is subsidizing schools that want to begin Yiddish classes because it considers Yiddish a sibling of German.</span> <span id="s179">So when you think of such ironies, it makes my head spin.</span> <span id="s180">Hitler is turning in his grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">When my parents married, they lived in Chelm, that was the big city.</span> <span id="s182">So I remember that there was a hill and we lived in the business district because downstairs is where people had shops.</span> <span id="s183">And upstairs is where they had apartments or lofts.</span> <span id="s184">And my parents lived in such a district so that my father could have his customers.</span> <span id="s185">It was downhill and when I started walking and running, I knew no bounds.</span> <span id="s186">So I would run down the hill.</span> <span id="s187">There were no vehicles to speak of in that town except horses and carriages, occasionally wagons.</span> <span id="s188">Police officers and Polish army officers always wore capes, so I would invariably get under somebody’s cape, and my mother had to retrieve me.</span> <span id="s189">But those are fleeting memories that come to mind of normalcy.</span> <span id="s190">That was my childhood.</span> <span id="s191">That was the fun.</span> <span id="s192">Running away and running under somebody’s cape for a second or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">These are my parents as young married people with a little girl.</span> <span id="s194">Here I must have been perhaps two.</span> <span id="s195">This was taken before the war.</span> <span id="s196">As you see they are in normal clothing and quite serene and well fed and well groomed.</span> <span id="s197">And again this was a picture that was sent to our American relatives because they wrote in Yiddish what they were all about.</span> <span id="s198">When we came to America my relatives who sponsored us gave us these pictures.</span> <span id="s199">Otherwise we wouldn’t have had any.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">But beyond that, all I remember is really that I was told to be quiet.</span> <span id="s201">If my mother made a signal to her lips, that means don’t utter a word, don’t breathe, if you can help it.</span> <span id="s202">When we were at times close to being discovered in hiding, my mother taught me that if you put a fist in your mouth, you can’t scream.</span> <span id="s203">So my fist in those days was very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">And I learned to do that.</span> <span id="s205">To this day I instinctively do that.</span> <span id="s206">Years ago my husband and I were driving from Corpus to Victoria and we hydroplaned because it had been raining.</span> <span id="s207">And my children were asleep in the back seat.</span> <span id="s208">My husband tried to get the car under control, and it was a close call.</span> <span id="s209">I knew we were in danger.</span> <span id="s210">And the first thing I did was put my fist in my mouth because that’s how I learned to be quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Obedience from children was the absolute for survival.</span> <span id="s212">It wasn’t just a fetish.</span> <span id="s213">That’s why many people formed groups.</span> <span id="s214">You couldn’t survive just husband and wife and child—you had to have a group, a nucleus of people—everybody lent their talent to what they could do so it helped the group.</span> <span id="s215">We became an extended family.</span> <span id="s216">But I must say, even though they were my own fellow Jews, many groups did not want anyone with young children.</span> <span id="s217">Children were always more of a danger of giving your hiding place away.</span> <span id="s218">But because of my father’s skill with tailoring, which would bring us sometimes food, sometimes some vitamins or a bar of soap that we would need.</span> <span id="s219">That’s why I was usually the only child in the group.</span> <span id="s220">I had no friends until later because people didn’t want to be with little children.</span> <span id="s221">Children met danger.</span> <span id="s222">I was somewhat luckier because of my father’s skill.</span> <span id="s223">That was the canopy of protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">My mother always gave my birth year as 1938.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t know why but I’ve always suspected because of my memories that my mother fudged about age; I think I was born in 1936.</span> <span id="s226">I know she always fudged about her own age, always to be younger.</span> <span id="s227">But I think in the war years she would tell officials that I was younger, hoping that perhaps I’d get extra rations or attention.</span> <span id="s228">What she didn’t know was that she put me in more danger because infants—the younger the child—the more of a nuisance it was for the killing machine.</span> <span id="s229">So she had no way of knowing it, but over the years from my memories, I’ve always suspected that I am a year of two older than I exist on my records.</span> <span id="s230">I was small, and she bundled me up when it was cold, so perhaps I could pass for younger.</span> <span id="s231">But she couldn’t hide the fact that I was a toddler.</span> <span id="s232">And because there was no privacy for adults, I heard everything.</span> <span id="s233">I understood everything.</span> <span id="s234">So, again, there was this danger of children being around if you were talking about some strategy to escape, to hide somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">That’s why, after liberation in 1945, when we started getting out and getting with fellow survivors, I was always the oldest one in the group.</span> <span id="s236">The others were always younger than I, or born in the Displaced Persons camps.</span> <span id="s237">In the DP camps, everyone married so they could became pregnant, because they wanted to start families again and have normal lives.</span> <span id="s238">But I was an oddity because I survived the actual war period.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">My earliest years of awareness were always focused on safety, on necessity, on food and hygiene.</span> <span id="s240">Many many people died for lack of hygiene, more even than perhaps were killed by bullets.</span> <span id="s241">And the reason is, if you don’t have normal facilities for basic hygiene, and you are depressed anyway, and you’re hungry, and you’re being hunted, hygiene becomes the lowest priority.</span> <span id="s242">The thing I remember the most is my mother used to wash me, sometimes in cold water, but she’d wash me because hygiene was so important—we were in many situations with diseases and all kinds of uncomfortable situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">One thing my parents taught me was not to be eager to own things.</span> <span id="s244">I have a lot of artwork on my walls but it is all posters or reproductions framed—cheap stuff.</span> <span id="s245">The reason for it is I have never seen any reason to invest in bulky investments like paintings.</span> <span id="s246">The cabinet that my grandfather David made for my parents as a wedding gift.</span> <span id="s247">When they were preparing to disappear, to hide, their landlord, who was Jewish, felt t that things couldn’t get that bad.</span> <span id="s248">He said, ‘Look, you’re a young guy.</span> <span id="s249">You have to feed your child, your wife.</span> <span id="s250">You can’t schlep this piece of furniture.</span> <span id="s251">Why don’t you sell this to me?’</span> <span id="s252">And my father said, ‘It’s a deal.’</span> <span id="s253">So the landlord bought the nice cabinet that was made as a wedding gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">We escaped.</span> <span id="s255">I survived, My parents survived.</span> <span id="s256">The landlord did not, because he was a man who acquired.</span> <span id="s257">He acquired furniture, possessions, and then he was too busy sitting and trying to protect them.</span> <span id="s258">It’s kind of like when a hurricane hits here.</span> <span id="s259">If you live in a low-lying area you must get out no matter what, because your life is more important then your furniture, your possessions.</span> <span id="s260">Like in any other catastrophe, and this nobody foresaw, this horrendous world war—nobody wanted to go far from home.</span> <span id="s261">Nobody.</span> <span id="s262">So it was only the people that were poor, young couples that had nothing much to lose except their lives.</span> <span id="s263">It was almost a little bit of an adventure.</span> <span id="s264">They were the first ones to run away, to run into hiding, to bride someone to hide them.</span> <span id="s265">It was survival, without us even knowing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Fate.</span> <span id="s267">We attribute to everything to God.</span> <span id="s268">When I make plans for tomorrow, the Jewish way of saying is, well, I’ll go tomorrow, God willing.</span> <span id="s269">Or I’m flying to Toronto, God willing.</span> <span id="s270">We are afraid to put out fate in our own hands.</span> <span id="s271">We know we must have a higher power.</span> <span id="s272">I’m not particularly religious or very orthodox, but I’m very spiritual in that way because that’s how we were brought up.</span> <span id="s273">And frankly it saved many people who had a spiritual base because those that were free thinkers and less religious and no roots at home, suddenly found themselves in these dangerous times and they didn’t have a spiritual foundation.</span> <span id="s274">And that made survival harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Even believers were challenged in their faith, like Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s276">I saw him, one time.</span> <span id="s277">I was invited to SMU in Dallas where he spoke.</span> <span id="s278">As a survivor, I’m on lists and I was invited to hear him speak.</span> <span id="s279">I was very eager to hear him speak because I go to so many schools and speak to so many students in the course of a year, I wanted to know, am I saying the right thing?</span> <span id="s280">It’s very important as an educator.</span> <span id="s281">And Elie Wiesel, who just turned 80 recently, he is very much (from seeing him close up and hearing him speak) he’s very much a man as my father was, as we all were.</span> <span id="s282">We’re spiritual, we hung on to our heritage, but we were not particularly observant of every little thing.</span> <span id="s283">We are not like the hasidim who are in New York, with the peyote.</span> <span id="s284">We’re not like that, and that’s why, my grandmother, because they were so ultraorthodox, immediately upon being married, would wear a wig.</span> <span id="s285">Both of my grandmothers, in that older generation—that was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s286">You would be disgraced in the community as a young bride if you didn’t, so that was part of conforming to that society.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">We became less observant but we held on to our spiritual base.</span> <span id="s288">This was handed down.</span> <span id="s289">My children grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is hardly a bastion of Jewish culture and Jewish practice.</span> <span id="s290">However, in my home they always knew you better be home Friday afternoon by 3:00 or 4:00,, wash up, be presentable, come to the table with clean hands, because it is Shabbat dinner.</span> <span id="s291">And we lighted candles.</span> <span id="s292">My husband and I were not regular temple goers because he would be tired, or I would want to watch 20/20 on television.</span> <span id="s293">Always with the news.</span> <span id="s294">So we were not particularly observant in that sense.</span> <span id="s295">But the spirituality of Judaism for us has always been very real and very important.</span> <span id="s296">As I grow older I find I’m becoming even more so.</span> <span id="s297">Now I have the time, I don’t have small children depending on me.</span> <span id="s298">And I have the means by how I can help someone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">I didn’t get to speak to Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s300">I didn’t get to meet him except in a receiving line.</span> <span id="s301">We said hello and nice to meet you.</span> <span id="s302">He mentioned in his remarks that he came from a small town in Hungary.</span> <span id="s303">It was called Geset, I think.</span> <span id="s304">I can’t remember now the exact town.</span> <span id="s305">But as we passed by in the receiving line I introduced myself and I said, ‘I also came from a small town called Chelm.’</span> <span id="s306">And he started laughing, and I knew why.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">The writer, Shalom Alechem, the great Jewish writer, made my town famous for being sort of like the fools.</span> <span id="s308">We were foolish.</span> <span id="s309">If we went to the market to buy feathers for the bedding, and we didn’t want to have to carry these bags of feathers home.</span> <span id="s310">So we would say, we’ll go in the wagon and get home sooner and we’ll let the feathers drift in the wind and they’ll come to us.</span> <span id="s311">So Shalom Alechem made our town famous and there are many many stories about the wise men of Chelm.</span> <span id="s312">In fact, whenever I speak to someone from eastern Europe and they are my age, I say, ‘You’re going to laugh, when you know where I come from,’ and they invariably do.</span> <span id="s313">Our town was famous for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">But it was a spiritual community.</span> <span id="s315">My father was bar mitzvahed in a synagogue that wasn’t particularly grand or anything, but it was seven hundred years old.</span> <span id="s316">That’s how far our roots in eastern Europe went back.</span> <span id="s317">And we thought nothing of it.</span> <span id="s318">We belonged there.</span> <span id="s319">Yes, we were Jews, we were a persecuted minority, we knew why.</span> <span id="s320">Sort of.</span> <span id="s321">And we knew that certain hardships were natural for Jews.</span> <span id="s322">But we still belonged.</span> <span id="s323">We were part of the culture because of our skills.</span> <span id="s324">Jews made up the middle class of that culture.</span> <span id="s325">There were the peasants, who worked the land, and the landed aristocrats; many times they were absentee landlords.</span> <span id="s326">And then there were the Jews who made up the middle class of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">All of that has now been destroyed forever.</span> <span id="s328">There are only remnants in Poland of a few elderly Jews who live there because they have no place else to go and they live on the charity of American Jewish help.</span> <span id="s329">I belong to several organizations that have annual dues that go to old-age homes and older citizens not only in Poland but what used to be the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s330">We make sure they have matzo for Passover and things like that.</span> <span id="s331">The world that I come from, the world my parents were born into, it’s gone.</span> <span id="s332">Some buildings exist, but they are museums.</span> <span id="s333">They are totally abandoned; they are curiosities.</span> <span id="s334">The whole society is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">The young people in Europe, the young generation, unless they are from a very academic family, unless they go into higher education, don’t even know that there was once a vital Jewish community in their cities.</span> <span id="s336">They don’t even know.</span> <span id="s337">In fact, there have been incidences where some Jews who have gone back for restitution to claim their properties and have encountered a lot of hostility because these young people don’t know them—‘who the hell are you.</span> <span id="s338">My father gave it to me.’</span> <span id="s339">The fact that the father may have gotten it by betraying a Jewish family and making sure they were taken away is beside the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">And that’s why, right now in America, I’ve begun to feel somewhat uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s341">Because religion has crept into our daily psyche, especially Muslims vis-à-vis the rest of us, the Judeo-Christian people.</span> <span id="s342">What is still happening with the mosque at the site in New York, is making me very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s343">Granted, people may be sensitive about having a mosque in the neighborhood of such an event as 9/11.</span> <span id="s344">However, as I told my fellow Jews recently at a meeting, what if when we announced breaking ground on Saratoga that we were going to build a synagogue there twenty years ago, suddenly the people in the neighborhood said, ‘Stop, we don’t want the Jews here, we don’t want you to build a synagogue.’</span> <span id="s345">It goes against being American.</span> <span id="s346">It goes against the Constitution.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">As much as we fear Muslim extremists and deplore what they do, if we ever dismantle the Constitution, we’re all lost.</span> <span id="s348">That’s how I feel.</span> <span id="s349">I’m frankly somewhat in the minority among my own community here, because the emotions run deeper than the reasoning.</span> <span id="s350">The Constitution is something abstract, it’s a paper in Washington; it lies under glass.</span> <span id="s351">But it is our safety every day of our lives, the minute we wake up in the morning till we go to bed at night.</span> <span id="s352">The fact that we don’t have to open our doors to some authority in the middle of the night because someone says, ‘Open your doors, we have to search your place.’</span> <span id="s353">This is the Constitution.</span> <span id="s354">And a lot of people find that very very hard to reconcile because of the emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">I’m very uncomfortable with the way many people, maybe most, feel about Muslims.</span> <span id="s356">They are not distinguishing between extremists and the ordinary Muslims who live among us.</span> <span id="s357">Islam has taken the best elements from Judaism and from Christianity and incorporated them; it respects and admires the prophets from the Old Testament.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">My mother and I, after liberation, lived in a city that in Polish is known as Szczenin.</span> <span id="s359">It’s on the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s360">It is very close to Gdánsk, which is another big port on the Baltic.</span> <span id="s361">Originally, that city was German.</span> <span id="s362">It was called Stattin.</span> <span id="s363">Stattin has a history.</span> <span id="s364">Catherine the Great, who became empress of Russia, happened to be the daughter of the duke that ruled that area, so she was called the Princess of Stattin.</span> <span id="s365">It’s just something I remember from history.</span> <span id="s366">But it was a German city; it is now a Polish city and has been since 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">We know, we hear, of Palestinians who were never born in what is now modern Israel, but their parents and their grandparents have given them keys and locks, and they go around and they say, this is the key to my property, and when the Jews will be vanquished or thrown into the sea, then I’m going to go back and this will be my property.</span> <span id="s368">They’ve never seen it.</span> <span id="s369">They were not born there.</span> <span id="s370">I can’t go back to Poland and bring a key to where I was born or claim anything.</span> <span id="s371">That’s it.</span> <span id="s372">It’s a dilemma.</span> <span id="s373">I can both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Americans don’t always study history.</span> <span id="s375">But we have to think back after Pearl Harbor, when Japanese Americans, born and bred in California and the west coast, were also uprooted and put in internment camps.</span> <span id="s376">When I first heard the story of the Japanese internment (to show you how misery qualifies) because I’m always comparing the Holocaust with other problems, I thought: It’s not so bad.</span> <span id="s377">There were no gas chambers there, there were no ovens there.</span> <span id="s378">I’m sure American MPs were as benign as they could be.</span> <span id="s379">So all they did was uproot them from their homes and intern them in these compounds.</span> <span id="s380">Of course, the more I studied the Constitution, and as I became older, I realized that the difference is not so black and white.</span> <span id="s381">America has its own problems.</span> <span id="s382">It’s that way and it’s discouraging.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">The horror years as I remember them are based mostly on events, because we didn’t have calendars or dates.</span> <span id="s384">I remember events, and that’ why I started questioning my own age, and my mother would never own up to it.</span> <span id="s385">But I felt that she registered me as younger, but I remember so many things that a little child would not have been able to.</span> <span id="s386">The horror years began when the Germans invaded any town.</span> <span id="s387">They immediately cordoned off the Jewish neighborhoods or a Jewish street, or they’d pick at random some area so that Jews who didn’t live there had to move in there.</span> <span id="s388">That was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s389">Every Jewish person conquered by Germany was immediately herded into a ghetto, a compound.</span> <span id="s390">I remember everybody was whispering.</span> <span id="s391">It was like everybody felt that if they made themselves almost invisible, that they would be in less danger.</span> <span id="s392">So people whispered.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">And then I remember when Papa came to Mama—and of course no one consulted me, I was the little one—they whispered something about a farmer, and I didn’t hear all the specifics.</span> <span id="s394">But as it turned out, this farmer had to cross the ghetto from one gate to another to get to his own place because the city was so cut up by the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">He crossed this area every single day with a wagon of hay.</span> <span id="s396">He became a fixture.</span> <span id="s397">Everybody saw him and nobody saw him.</span> <span id="s398">Nobody paid attention.</span> <span id="s399">Papa knew how to deal with the Polish peasants, the ordinary people, the farmers.</span> <span id="s400">Many times they would come to him, sometimes with a blanket and say, make me a coat.</span> <span id="s401">So he knew how to talk to them.</span> <span id="s402">Apparently my father had some zlotys, some Polish currency at the time.</span> <span id="s403">And of course it didn’t help us to have money because we couldn’t buy anything, and it was too dangerous to try to approach a German soldier to bribe.</span> <span id="s404">We didn’t know how to act.</span> <span id="s405">But Papa knew that the polish farmer would understand currency.</span> <span id="s406">They arranged some kind of a deal….</span> <span id="s407">none of us were big people.</span> <span id="s408">My father was 5’6” or 5’7” at the most, and in those days he was a young man so very thin.</span> <span id="s409">My mother was petite, and I was a small girl.</span> <span id="s410">So the arrangement was that we’d get under the hay when the farmer was in an area where we could dart out.</span> <span id="s411">We would be like a sandwich, like in the middle.</span> <span id="s412">I’m still allergic to hay!</span></p> <p><span id="s413">We never owned a suitcase because I remember all those years of wandering, of being uprooted, we always had bundles.</span> <span id="s414">Mama would take like a pillow case and stuff it with whatever we had.</span> <span id="s415">Sometimes it would be a shawl, because most east European women had shawls, sometimes for decoration, sometimes just to keep warm.</span> <span id="s416">So we always had bundles.</span> <span id="s417">I wasn’t given anything to carry.</span> <span id="s418">My parents had their bundles, and we got into the hay, and the farmer sort of straightened the hay, covered us up so it would look normal.</span> <span id="s419">And we just went past the gate and the soldiers waved to him.</span> <span id="s420">We heard quiet talking and banter.</span> <span id="s421">The Germans were trying to speak Polish and the Poles were trying to accommodate them in German.</span> <span id="s422">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s423">They would have put bayonets through that hay to check what contraband he had.</span> <span id="s424">But he was a fixture, and that’s what my father counted on.</span> <span id="s425">My father was not a highly educated man in the formal sense, but he was very bright, and he was very good at sizing up a situation.</span> <span id="s426">Since this farmer—they were so used to seeing him—why bother, let him go by.</span> <span id="s427">And that was our good luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Once we were out of the ghetto, the few zlotys my father was able gave him didn’t cover very much.</span> <span id="s429">And they were afraid to help Jews because they put themselves in danger.</span> <span id="s430">The area was very wooded, a heavily wooded forest.</span> <span id="s431">To this day that region is a very major source of lumber.</span> <span id="s432">My parents had started to hear of some young people—daredevils—who had run into the forest and were hiding.</span> <span id="s433">They’d dig into bunkers and hide out, and if the weather was OK then you could manage to sleep in the outdoors.</span> <span id="s434">Like the film Defiance.</span> <span id="s435">Some of the scenes reminded me very much of how we lived.</span> <span id="s436">The problem for us was, our group—we had become like an extended family—we were not a paramilitary group like in the film.</span> <span id="s437">We were just people trying to survive.</span> <span id="s438">But the reason it helped us survive in a group was because everybody added their particular skill or knowledge or way of handling things helped the group.</span> <span id="s439">So my father’s tailoring helped even then, because there is a very short summer there; it’s cold weather so you are always worrying about having enough clothing for the cold.</span> <span id="s440">Papa was very good at repairing anything that needed repair.</span> <span id="s441">And if anyone could steal a blanket from somewhere, blankets were heavy, he would make them a jacket.</span> <span id="s442">It wasn’t a fashion plate but it served the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">The reason why they accepted my father and me and my mother, but primarily me.</span> <span id="s444">They wouldn’t have been so quick to accept us because being a child was a handicap.</span> <span id="s445">A child can scream out.</span> <span id="s446">A child can give you away.</span> <span id="s447">All of it depended on silence and on just disappearing.</span> <span id="s448">But since my father was useful, and he knew many of these young men from the area—many of them had been bar mitzvahed together or went to the same religious school, so they knew each other—that’s how we started on our saga of hiding and escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Whenever possible we would look for normal shelter, and that would mean a farm with a barn or some kind of a shed.</span> <span id="s450">Sometimes if the house was big enough, they would hide us in the house.</span> <span id="s451">If it was a big enough farm the group could scatter, but we always tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s452">There were about a dozen in our group, always back and forth.</span> <span id="s453">Sometimes somebody would just never come back, if they had gone out to forage for food or something.</span> <span id="s454">Many times they just never came back.</span> <span id="s455">People didn’t even talk about it because the results were obvious.</span> <span id="s456">They must have been captured or killed.</span> <span id="s457">And sometimes a new person would drift in.</span> <span id="s458">So there were about a dozen people.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Most of the time it was the elements that were our major enemy.</span> <span id="s460">The weather was cold and very wet and because the forests were thick, even if there was sunshine, it barely penetrated to us.</span> <span id="s461">And of course food.</span> <span id="s462">Food was the fuel that made you survive.</span> <span id="s463">Food was the hardest thing to find.</span> <span id="s464">.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">My mother had blue eyes, as I have.</span> <span id="s466">She was fair, so she could more easily pass as a non-Jewish person.</span> <span id="s467">So sometimes it became my mother’s assignment if there was a farm nearby and somebody had clothing or an object to trade—everything became like a currency.</span> <span id="s468">Mama would go.</span> <span id="s469">I was the prop.</span> <span id="s470">The rationale was that if the farmer opened the door and saw a woman with a child—they were all devout Catholics—that he would have some pity and want to sell her food.</span> <span id="s471">Nothing was given, it was strictly a commercial transaction, but he might be willing to trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Mama was very careful.</span> <span id="s473">She could pass—her Polish was excellent, her eyes were blue with her light hair and she a very pretty girl—she could pass as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s474">But I looked very Semitic.</span> <span id="s475">I have my father’s features, the high cheek bones, the straight nose.</span> <span id="s476">And so since the weather was always cold, wet, depending on where my mother approached, she always covered my face up…up to the eyes.</span> <span id="s477">You talk about a burka.</span> <span id="s478">Mama would hide my features except for my eyes.</span> <span id="s479">And she would come to the door and say, ‘I need food’ and ‘Do you have some bread, do you have some eggs, can you sell me a piece of butter.’</span> <span id="s480">This is how it went on.</span> <span id="s481">It was a great risk, but sometimes when she saw that the farmer had enough compassion, when he was relaxed and willing to trade, then Mama would uncover my face.</span> <span id="s482">I had very black hair…exactly what you would call the Semitic look.</span> <span id="s483">You can see it in my father’s features.</span> <span id="s484">Of course he couldn’t show his face in situations like that because it was a give-away.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">That’s how we would forage for food and always try to stay ahead.</span> <span id="s486">We had reports through contact with farmers of how quickly the Germans were advancing.</span> <span id="s487">The Polish army tried to fight tanks on horseback.</span> <span id="s488">It was a non-starter.</span> <span id="s489">When we found out how close the Germans were at a given time, we would move on, we would find another area to huddle in.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t ever remember a camp fire.</span> <span id="s491">They must have used some kind of shelter for it or something, but I don’t remember it because, again, it spelled danger.</span> <span id="s492">If you have a camp fire there are certain smells from the wood or if you warm up a piece of food or something….</span> <span id="s493">I never remember a camp fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">How we kept going, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s495">We had no compass.</span> <span id="s496">We had no map.</span> <span id="s497">We were just trying to stay ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s498">So the Germans were our compass, in a sense, because as they spread out through the Ukraine, we kept going eastward.</span> <span id="s499">At that time, Russia and Germany had a non-aggression pact.</span> <span id="s500">So we fell into the hands of Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s501">They found us, and they were very paranoid about spies.</span> <span id="s502">So they took us in hand and immediately identified us as Jews—Yev’rey or Zid—and those words were spit out with such contempt, like the “N” word is perhaps by bigots here.</span> <span id="s503">Suddenly we were under Stalinist control.</span> <span id="s504">And they were very harsh.</span> <span id="s505">They made us wait in places until there were more people.</span> <span id="s506">It was like gathering fish in a net.</span> <span id="s507">When there was enough of us….</span> <span id="s508">by then we had come to a railroad track, and as soon as a freight car was available (in Yiddish it is vagon) we were made to get into those.</span> <span id="s509">They are quite high off the track.</span> <span id="s510">I remember the men had quite a time climbing in and the women had to be literally lifted up and put in.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Where?</span> <span id="s512">It must have been near Kiev.</span> <span id="s513">By the time we were at the Kiev railroad station, I remember there was no food for some time and there was a woman walking around with a big pot and a ladle.</span> <span id="s514">And she was selling like a cup worth of soup.</span> <span id="s515">It was the only hot beverage of any kind that we had had in days.</span> <span id="s516">So Mama bought some and made me drink it.</span> <span id="s517">It had cabbage but it was mostly liquid.</span> <span id="s518">It was from that time on that we were transported by the Russians, under their control.</span> <span id="s519">We were schlepped here, there, but we were never told where.</span> <span id="s520">We were never told why, but we knew why—because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s521">We were never where we were being taken.</span> <span id="s522">At some point when they had enough of these wagon-loads of people, they pulled out of this major area, and then we started a long, long trip.</span> <span id="s523">And we ended up in what turned out to be Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">There was no furniture of any kind in those freight cars.</span> <span id="s525">If you found yourself a wall or a piece of a wall, or a corner, that was the ideal place.</span> <span id="s526">That way, your back was protected, and your possessions, because in time of stress, people can steal from each other.</span> <span id="s527">If we found ourselves a corner we were quite happy.</span> <span id="s528">It was dark in those wagons.</span> <span id="s529">There were slits or narrow openings on the very top, but you wouldn’t call them windows.</span> <span id="s530">And a normal person would have to stand on somebody’s shoulders to see out.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">We traveled for a long time.</span> <span id="s532">The farmers came to the train and try to sell us some stuff) somebody would say, this could become a shiddach, a match.</span> <span id="s533">People were thrown together for such long periods of time that they would pair up and become a couple.</span> <span id="s534">I remember those conversations.</span> <span id="s535">But nobody explained anything to me.</span> <span id="s536">I was going where I was told and I did what I was told.</span> <span id="s537">That was from day one.</span> <span id="s538">That’s how my parents instructed me to be.</span> <span id="s539">So whatever I was told, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">I heard in the distance—sometimes I may have heard thunder, but sometimes I may have heard artillery, who knows—when I heard those sounds, there was fear.</span> <span id="s541">There was fear on the adults’ faces, too.</span> <span id="s542">Sometimes we would hear shots that were very close to the train.</span> <span id="s543">I don’t know if there were sentries or if somebody was just executed.</span> <span id="s544">Life was so cheap.</span> <span id="s545">Life didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s546">Here when somebody has a bad accident you call 911 and an ambulance comes and suddenly you are surrounded by people who want to help you.</span> <span id="s547">In our circumstances, life was cheap.</span> <span id="s548">You would hear shots; nobody would say much of anything.</span> <span id="s549">It was just obvious.</span> <span id="s550">We were prisoners of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">This is something I’ve never really quite accepted.</span> <span id="s552">My mother, who was born just before or into the First World War, and my father, too—practically all the people that were around us were of that generation—they were not so afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s553">They were more afraid of the Russians, because during the First World War—the last war that didn’t make total war on civilians—my parents and others like them remembered that war and thought it won’t be so bad.</span> <span id="s554">The Germans are very cultured people.</span> <span id="s555">They will help us.</span> <span id="s556">They will understand.</span> <span id="s557">It was incredible because we didn’t know what else was happening.</span> <span id="s558">And my parents and others like them went by the fact that when they were children and the First World War was raging, the Germans were very civilized and very polite to women and children.</span> <span id="s559">The Second World War was the first time in recorded history of total war, and that meant it didn’t matter if you were a civilian.</span> <span id="s560">It didn’t matter if you were two years-old or five years-old or if you were ninety-five years-old.</span> <span id="s561">Everybody was a potential enemy, disposed of.</span> <span id="s562">Ironically, the people around us all felt that if we could just hear some German, be around German soldiers, it would be easier for us.</span> <span id="s563">My parents and others like them grew up on stories about the Russian Cossacks who would make pogroms.</span> <span id="s564">That was the boogey-man, that was the big danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">When we finally got to Siberia, we were dropped off the train at a little village.</span> <span id="s566">Very primitive, very humble, very poor.</span> <span id="s567">Siberians have always been the underdog in Russia.</span> <span id="s568">They would say, ‘If you go to the house and the people want to take you in, maybe you will get some shelter from them.</span> <span id="s569">Or maybe you can live in their shed.’</span> <span id="s570">There was no other way to survive.</span> <span id="s571">In our particular case, there was my mother and I, my father, and my young aunt, my aunt Bluma—she was an older teenager—seventeen or eighteen when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s572">She had been visiting my parents in the bigger city, in Chelm, from Dubenka.</span> <span id="s573">She didn’t want to be in Dubenka.</span> <span id="s574">So when the war broke out, she was trapped and she was the one who fled and went everywhere we went.</span> <span id="s575">We would go to the door and knock.</span> <span id="s576">Siberians, in their own way…they kind of knew about Jews but in a very primitive way.</span> <span id="s577">Communism had wiped out religion and they weren’t used to all that stuff.</span> <span id="s578">They took us just as people who were victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">I remember one farmer who had a cabin.</span> <span id="s580">The total size couldn’t have been bigger than my dining room.</span> <span id="s581">In that cabin he and his old wife slept, and they had a granddaughter (because the young people, daughters and sons, were all at the front fighting) and they had a cow in their barn.</span> <span id="s582">In fact, that first winter the cow had a calf, and the farmer brought it in.</span> <span id="s583">We’re city people—what is this?</span> <span id="s584">My mother was terrible.</span> <span id="s585">She said, ‘Oh, it smells’ (she was covering her nose.</span> <span id="s586">My mother was a bit of a princess).</span> <span id="s587">The farmer felt that the calf wouldn’t survive the cold so the calf stayed for the winter months in this small cabin, where there was the couple who took us in, their granddaughter, my aunt Bluma, and my parents and I.</span> <span id="s588">We somehow managed.</span> <span id="s589">Sense of privacy—there was no privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">We had to make ourselves useful to pay our way.</span> <span id="s591">There was no such thing as paying rent.</span> <span id="s592">We had to be useful.</span> <span id="s593">By “useful” they meant any kind of chores that came along.</span> <span id="s594">This may be disgusting.</span> <span id="s595">Hygiene for everybody, it was always a problem, living under those conditions.</span> <span id="s596">Lice were a way of life; they were a fact of life.</span> <span id="s597">The farmer had short hair—he didn’t have much of a problem.</span> <span id="s598">But the woman had longish hair, which she wore in a knot.</span> <span id="s599">Our way of paying our rent—either my mother, or Bluma, or I—were supposed to sit down on a stool, twice a week like a ritual, and the woman would sit on the floor.</span> <span id="s600">She had a comb and she would part her hair.</span> <span id="s601">With something like a flat knife, we had to squeeze the lice.</span> <span id="s602">And then she would wash her hair, and I remember I saw these things floating in the water.</span> <span id="s603">But that was our way of paying our rent.</span> <span id="s604">She couldn’t do this by herself; it was a disgusting thing to have to do.</span> <span id="s605">Mama did it once, and she complained about it bitterly and cried over it.</span> <span id="s606">So then my aunt Bluma did it for awhile, but then she became sick.</span> <span id="s607">The old lady (she wasn’t really old; she looked old to me) said, well, the girl can do it.</span> <span id="s608">So I took up this chore and she liked very much the way I was doing it.</span> <span id="s609">I had lighter hands, and I was more timid about it, so I wasn’t hurting her.</span> <span id="s610">That’s how we spent our first winter in Siberia for the privilege of having some shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">They would bake their own bread; they did everything themselves.</span> <span id="s612">But occasionally, if there was something they could share with us, if they had a larger quantity, they could add more water to the soup, they’d share it.</span> <span id="s613">Papa was always there with his needle and thread, and he would mend everything and would be useful that way.</span> <span id="s614">Papa was not an outdoorsman.</span> <span id="s615">He was an indoor worker.</span> <span id="s616">That was our first winter in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">My mother never never talked about it afterwards.</span> <span id="s618">One time I made the mistake of starting to tell something to an American friend.</span> <span id="s619">If looks could kill.</span> <span id="s620">My mother was so ashamed of how we had to live that it was absolutely taboo.</span> <span id="s621">When I come to classes, to schools—I don’t mention things like that because I know, to the average American, such things sound so disgusting.</span> <span id="s622">And they were.</span> <span id="s623">But that was the way of life, and that was the way of survival.</span> <span id="s624">That was what we had to do.</span> <span id="s625">It was like being raped and the victim feeling ashamed instead of the person who did it to you.</span> <span id="s626">We were, in a sense, raped every day of our existence during those years.</span> <span id="s627">We ended up being ashamed of how we had to live or how we had to make compromises.</span> <span id="s628">Traditional Jews are very hygiene-conscious.</span> <span id="s629">A Jew cannot come to the table and eat unless the hands are washed.</span> <span id="s630">To this day, the first thing I do when I walk into the apartment is put my purse down, go to the sink, and wash my hands.</span> <span id="s631">It is ingrained, an old habit.</span> <span id="s632">But it was the part of that hygiene that went with our religion that saved many of us because we were more careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Once or twice, the farmer had a banya, a bath house.</span> <span id="s634">It was a little cabin away from the main house.</span> <span id="s635">It was very small.</span> <span id="s636">He explained to us that he would build a little fire pit in that cabin.</span> <span id="s637">Nothing else except a bench.</span> <span id="s638">But he would put in some rocks and get them good and hot.</span> <span id="s639">Sometimes he did it the night before.</span> <span id="s640">And then there was some kind of a plant—it was like a little broom.</span> <span id="s641">So there was the steam.</span> <span id="s642">In order to get your circulation going and in order to really feel clean and invigorated, once you were sweating, we’d each hit each other with this little broom.</span> <span id="s643">We didn’t have brushes or luffa, not any of these lovely things we have now.</span> <span id="s644">This is how we stayed clean.</span> <span id="s645">And I remember those baths because—the old man was very civilized—he would arrange the heat just right.</span> <span id="s646">Then he would say, the women go first.</span> <span id="s647">For a change we had a sense of privacy.</span> <span id="s648">My aunt, my mother and I, the lady of the house and her granddaughter would all go in there, take off our clothes, and use the steam and the plant to clean ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">I have since found out that in many Slavic countries they use what I called a little broom.</span> <span id="s650">There is a plant that has thin little branches that was always used.</span> <span id="s651">In some Scandinavian countries, when people want to take a steam bath and really get their circulation going, this is what they would use.</span> <span id="s652">In a perverted sort of way, we were treated to a spa, but we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s653">It didn’t feel like a spa.</span> <span id="s654">When we got ourselves covered up, dried off as best we could, then the farmer and my father and a couple of other men—maybe neighbors—would come in and do that.</span> <span id="s655">That was not done every week, that would have been a luxury.</span> <span id="s656">It was done only now and then throughout the winter.</span> <span id="s657">Hygiene was very hard to maintain but very important.</span> <span id="s658">And that was how we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Authorities knew we were there.</span> <span id="s660">There was a little truck—the only motorized vehicle that I ever saw in that village—and they would bring bread.</span> <span id="s661">I guess there was a certain allotment of bread for us and for the farmer and his wife.</span> <span id="s662">They were to get a little extra bread because they had taken us in.</span> <span id="s663">That was their reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">The cow was milked.</span> <span id="s665">In late afternoon, when he would milk the cow, they were waiting for the same little truck to come by with milk cans.</span> <span id="s666">The government took away all the milk that he produced.</span> <span id="s667">Everything was geared to the war effort and the government effort.</span> <span id="s668">That’s collectivism, that’s Communism.</span> <span id="s669">So even the milk that the farmer was able to get from his one cow was not even his own.</span> <span id="s670">So he got smart.</span> <span id="s671">He would take his granddaughter and me, call us into the barn—nobody thought much of germs.</span> <span id="s672">He had this tin mug and he would have it filled up with milk.</span> <span id="s673">It was still warm.</span> <span id="s674">Real milk, before it is pasteurized, has a certain sweet smell to it.</span> <span id="s675">He would give a mug full of milk that the little girl and I shared.</span> <span id="s676">That had to be done in the barn so that nobody would see it because he had to fill up these metal milk cans, two of them, and that was milk that didn’t belong to him and he could have no share of.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Life was very primitive for these people also, not just for the Jews.</span> <span id="s678">At some point when the weather changed, and it became warmer—what could pass for a summer in Siberia—we were told to pack our bags, that we were being taken to a permanent place.</span> <span id="s679">We were taken by wagons to a city—compared to the village—called Stalinsk.</span> <span id="s680">That was a take off on the name of Stalin.</span> <span id="s681">In those days everything that you could imagine was named for the heroes of their Communist revolution.</span> <span id="s682">So this town was called Stalinsk.</span> <span id="s683">I don’t know how big it was, but compared to the village, it was much bigger.</span> <span id="s684">It was a regular town.</span> <span id="s685">It even had a trolley.</span> <span id="s686">It had a big oriental market.</span> <span id="s687">You go there, you barter, you trade, you sell, you buy.</span> <span id="s688">That helped us to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">We were in Stalinsk.</span> <span id="s690">Papa was immediately given a workroom—perhaps the size of my living room—there were sewing machines and other equipment.</span> <span id="s691">And of course my father’s scissors.</span> <span id="s692">They couldn’t build, they were so under stress from the war, they couldn’t afford to stop and built new factories.</span> <span id="s693">They had little factories wherever they could find space.</span> <span id="s694">So Papa was a foreman in such a little factory.</span> <span id="s695">The Russian women in the factory called him Simon Davidovich, because they went by the patrimony, meaning the son of David (my grandfather’s name was David).</span></p> <p><span id="s696">And they made Russian uniforms.</span> <span id="s697">Everything, again, for the Russian front.</span> <span id="s698">I remember because that’s where those scissors became so fixed in my mind.</span> <span id="s699">My father had to cut several layers of material and it was fairly heavy material, for cutting out the pattern for the uniforms.</span> <span id="s700">In modern factories there are machines so once you have a pattern, you guide the machine—it can cut through anything.</span> <span id="s701">We didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s702">Papa had to cut, and sometimes he would try to cut as many as five or six layers.</span> <span id="s703">That’s all he could accommodate.</span> <span id="s704">And how do I remember those scissors?</span> <span id="s705">Because at the end of the working day, my father’s hand would be so swollen and so stiff and in pain, truly in pain, and Mama would heat up some water, and I would help him soak his hand.</span> <span id="s706">That eased up some of the pain, and of course the next day it was back to the same old thing.</span> <span id="s707">That was my father’s tenure as a foreman in a uniform factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">On a warm day in the summer of 1942, my mother left me off there to play.</span> <span id="s709">She would go to this big bazaar to see what she could buy or sell—everything was of value.</span> <span id="s710">I was with my father.</span> <span id="s711">Papa used to give me pieces of fabric and I would play in a corner and not get in anybody’s way.</span> <span id="s712">I had my back to the working area in my own little corner.</span> <span id="s713">And suddenly it got very very quiet.</span> <span id="s714">I mean, quiet.</span> <span id="s715">When I realized it, I turned around.</span> <span id="s716">There were two men in civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s717">They didn’t wear the hats like a homburg.</span> <span id="s718">They wore caps, with a sort of visor.</span> <span id="s719">But for some reason, they had a certain way of being official-looking, and they were not afraid of anybody.</span> <span id="s720">The reason it got so quiet is because they were immediately recognized.</span> <span id="s721">They were the NKVD, now known as KGB.</span> <span id="s722">During Stalin’s time the secret police was the NKVD.</span> <span id="s723">And these people had the same power as the SS in Germany.</span> <span id="s724">They came in.</span> <span id="s725">We didn’t know that my father was in any trouble.</span> <span id="s726">That’s why this was such a shock.</span> <span id="s727">They came in.</span> <span id="s728">The Russians who worked in the shop recognized that they were thugs of the NKVD.</span> <span id="s729">They went to my father, and they said something quietly to him.</span> <span id="s730">And I remember his face turned grey.</span> <span id="s731">It wasn’t even white; it turned grey.</span> <span id="s732">This was the fear.</span> <span id="s733">He had a lady there who was a very good seamstress.</span> <span id="s734">I guess she was his helper, his second in command.</span> <span id="s735">He told her to do whatever it was she had to do, because, he said, ‘I have to go.’</span> <span id="s736">He got his coat.</span> <span id="s737">They had a vehicle outside that reminds me of those old fashioned black taxis in London.</span> <span id="s738">That’s why the people in the shop recognized that they were the real McCoy.</span> <span id="s739">They took my father away, and that was all.</span> <span id="s740">Nothing else was said.</span> <span id="s741">The shop started humming again and working.</span> <span id="s742">When my mother came back to fetch me, they told her.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">They don’t tell you where they’re taking you, whether it is this jail or this precinct.</span> <span id="s744">So what it amounted to, my father was taken away.</span> <span id="s745">I tried to run after him.</span> <span id="s746">That’s when I saw him enter this vehicle.</span> <span id="s747">I chased it a little but all I got in my face was some dust.</span> <span id="s748">I couldn’t outrun a vehicle.</span> <span id="s749">I did not see my father until 1948, when he came to the camp in Austria where we where.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">My father was in the Gulag camps for six years, mainly as a tailor.</span> <span id="s751">At one point, he was forced to work in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s752">We got this information by way of people who told us because from time to time if they released a prisoner, Papa would always give them our name and see if they could look up his wife and his little girl.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t know how, but these people really did.</span> <span id="s754">And they weren’t necessarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s755">The coal mines in the region where we lived didn’t have enough laborers.</span> <span id="s756">At one point they emptied out the camp…the cooks, the tailors, everyone, including my father.</span> <span id="s757">He was a tailor, he was not a laborer for a mine.</span> <span id="s758">So they sent them down and there was an accident.</span> <span id="s759">Some people were hurt badly.</span> <span id="s760">My father came out with a wounded left leg, starting at the ankle going almost up to his knee.</span> <span id="s761">It was six or seven months after the event that we found out about it.</span> <span id="s762">His leg healed miraculously but it was just the skin.</span> <span id="s763">When you touched the leg you touched bone.</span> <span id="s764">It was always very dangerous for my father to bump into anything with that leg—God knows what could happen.</span> <span id="s765">In fact, once we came to America, Papa didn’t want to hear about surgery or anything like that, so one orthopedic doctor recommended a “sleeve” on his leg to protect it from the usual bumps or scrapes.</span> <span id="s766">That is why I was so caught up with the Chilian miners rescue broadcast by CNN.</span> <span id="s767">These miners in Chili, they were like my father.</span> <span id="s768">I was mesmerized.</span> <span id="s769">I could relate to this, I could understand.</span> <span id="s770">Misery has no geography, it has no language barrier.</span> <span id="s771">I could feel what those women and children felt as they were waiting for something to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">The prison was a day’s walk from Stalinsk.</span> <span id="s773">My mother would go to try and see him; she would call them visits.</span> <span id="s774">You try to pick out your person among hundreds of prisoners who were being marched for exercise.</span> <span id="s775">All of them were wearing grey, cotton clothing.</span> <span id="s776">All of them had shaved heads.</span> <span id="s777">Everybody looked the same.</span> <span id="s778">The reason all of them were wearing this same grey clothing is that my father helped make it.</span> <span id="s779">The jacket of that suit was called a kofika.</span> <span id="s780">It was padded with cotton so that there was fabric on the outside, then the padding of the cotton, and then a lining of sorts.</span> <span id="s781">That would be the garment that these men had to keep them warm in arctic weather.</span> <span id="s782">Later my father told me that sometimes he had a bit of material left over and he was able to improvise and make caps.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">My father was put in charge.</span> <span id="s784">He was really instrumental in saving people’s lives.</span> <span id="s785">If he would see someone who was just physically down, he’d ask, can you sew anything?</span> <span id="s786">Then he would say, ‘This guy, I want this guy, because he can help me.’</span> <span id="s787">He had to teach him to sew something so that the game wouldn’t be given away.</span> <span id="s788">And he did it a few times.</span> <span id="s789">He told me that it made him feel good because he had saved these people’s lives.</span> <span id="s790">They were not all Jews.</span> <span id="s791">The camps in the Gulag were mixed.</span> <span id="s792">Most of the people there had been common criminals, guilty of some crime.</span> <span id="s793">Many, probably most, were political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">When my father’s case was finally adjudicated, my mother was told that the reason he was kept and would be kept was because they found out he was a counter-revolutionary and he spoke against Stalin and he hated Communism and that’s why he was taken away.</span> <span id="s795">And many many other people with him in these camps were in the same category.</span> <span id="s796">So there were common criminals and then there were people who were caught up in this insanity like my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">His trade—I cannot say it enough—my father’s skill was the thing that saved him.</span> <span id="s798">He was able to keep a primitive kind of fireplace in the workroom.</span> <span id="s799">You had it for warmth or to boil up some kipitok or hot water.</span> <span id="s800">There was no tea or coffee available, but even if they had hot water to drink, it took away the chill.</span> <span id="s801">He would keep it going and they’d always provide him with a few pieces of coal or maybe wood.</span> <span id="s802">He asked for, and got permission, to sleep in the shop.</span> <span id="s803">He and a couple of his helpers had the luxury of sleeping on those work tables, which were just platforms.</span> <span id="s804">But at night they’d have their blanket and they would stretch out on these work tables and that way they didn’t have to sleep with fifty other people in a barrack.</span> <span id="s805">They could keep little bit warmer and felt in a little bit more in control of their own lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">That was my father’s life for six years.</span> <span id="s807">We had no communication from him, so we did not know any details of this.</span> <span id="s808">We only found out after he was liberated and joined us.</span> <span id="s809">During these years, though, my mother kept writing.</span> <span id="s810">I used to be so angry with her.</span> <span id="s811">We were starving, and she’d always sell of something to try and buy us a piece of bread, or whatever.</span> <span id="s812">But she would be convinced that if she would just mail this letter to camp number so-and-so, whatever it was (the camps didn’t have a name, they had a number), that he would get her letter.</span> <span id="s813">So she wrote in Yiddish, which is a Germanic language but it uses the Hebrew alphabet, which makes is sort of unique.</span> <span id="s814">She would write in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s815">She would write her heart out.</span> <span id="s816">How hard it was, how much she missed him, and so forth.</span> <span id="s817">My mother was busy writing letters that probably went nowhere because the Russians couldn’t read Yiddish and they censored everything in those days.</span> <span id="s818">She would put out any extra money she had for that postage and send letters to Siberia.</span> <span id="s819">She was convinced that he would get these letters, but we found out later that he never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">I realize now, that’s what she needed to do.</span> <span id="s821">She was so in love with my father, and it was not one of those arranged marriages like the olden days.</span> <span id="s822">They were really a loving couple, and the family was torn apart.</span> <span id="s823">My mother was always very sentimental.</span> <span id="s824">And of course she and my father were such a pair that after the war.</span> <span id="s825">They arranged for a sort of nanny for me in the Displaced Persons camp in Austria, to school me (I was a barbarian, having never been in school).</span> <span id="s826">That was the main reason why they used her.</span> <span id="s827">But they also wanted some time for themselves.</span> <span id="s828">They wanted to get to know each other again.</span> <span id="s829">Of course they were a young couple, and they were suddenly torn apart by this horrendous war and never thought they would see each other again.</span> <span id="s830">I was just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">At the time, however—when I’d go to the post office with her and saw her give out these last few zlotys for this mail—I would be so angry because that meant we couldn’t buy food, frankly.</span> <span id="s832">This is one of the most important lessons of my childhood.</span> <span id="s833">Something didn’t seem right about this, something didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s834">When I saw other people, the husband and the wife and the children, I saw how the adults would first and foremost take care of their children.</span> <span id="s835">This was not the case with us.</span> <span id="s836">I felt that I couldn’t depend on my mother, that even though she was the grown up, I could not depend on her for simple things like food.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">From that point, my mother and I developed a relationship that lasted really for the rest of our lives.</span> <span id="s838">I think maybe it happened to many families but people don’t always talk about it.</span> <span id="s839">Many of the survivor families, because of various circumstances, even after liberation and after normalcy, even in America when we immigrated, we couldn’t have the typical nuclear family.</span> <span id="s840">Some women who had the same experience as my mother, totally abandoned any thought of the husband.</span> <span id="s841">If he came back, he came back.</span> <span id="s842">If he didn’t, too bad.</span> <span id="s843">Their primary responsibility if they had a child was the child, and then sometimes they would remarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">In my mother’s case it was the opposite way.</span> <span id="s845">She had a fixation about my father and I was always second.</span> <span id="s846">She didn’t mean it in a bad way.</span> <span id="s847">My mother was not an educated woman in the formal sense.</span> <span id="s848">Their generation didn’t know about psychology and the effects things have on people.</span> <span id="s849">I think she felt, I’m her child and I’m her daughter and will always be so.</span> <span id="s850">That’s a given.</span> <span id="s851">She did not understand that as I was maturing and I was very observant.</span> <span id="s852">I still am.</span> <span id="s853">But I was observing how other families were after liberation.</span> <span id="s854">I didn’t know if my father would ever come back.</span> <span id="s855">But I knew as far as my mother was concerned, I have to learn to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s856">She would not make the compromises that were necessary, even for my sake.</span> <span id="s857">She also suffered, of course.</span> <span id="s858">I was only eight years old, but you’d be surprised how old you can feel when you have to make do.</span> <span id="s859">My mother didn’t beat me; she didn’t abuse me.</span> <span id="s860">She just didn’t realize how this changed my character.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">I still think, as a mother and a grandmother—it may sound very harsh—but if I had maybe a husband who was maybe alive, maybe dead, but I had this child right here, who needed food—no, I would not write to my husband and spend the money on postage.</span> <span id="s862">I’m not like that, I never have been.</span> <span id="s863">That’s one of the legacies of my history.</span> <span id="s864">We became a little bit hard, not always sentimental about some things.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Surviving without my father was probably one of the hardest times in our lives aside from the original hiding and scurrying from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s866">In Stalinist Russia, you were better off being a family member of a murderer.</span> <span id="s867">My father was a political prisoner because of what he was accused of, a counter revolutionary and speaking out against communism and so forth.</span> <span id="s868">Suddenly people who knew us, his fellow workers, were afraid to be associated with us even though they liked us and felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s869">So you become, in Stalinist Russia, you become a pariah, an untouchable, if anyone in your family was accused of crimes against the state and taken into camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">My mother was told that we would be allowed to live in the room that we had been assigned to us.</span> <span id="s871">My young aunt was with us.</span> <span id="s872">In Stalinist Russia, you didn’t go out and look for a job and have an interview.</span> <span id="s873">They assigned you a job.</span> <span id="s874">And everything was geared to the war effort, and there were factories and shops, depending on how useful you would be to the state.</span> <span id="s875">My mother absolutely refused to go into a factory.</span> <span id="s876">She wasn’t used to that; she couldn’t work; and besides, she had a small child.</span> <span id="s877">I’m afraid my mother used that excuse whenever she was faced with a crisis.</span> <span id="s878">I was small, but the point was that had she agreed to go to a factory or some designated job, I would have been allowed to go to a state school, like nursery school or kindergarten.</span> <span id="s879">The curriculum there was like everything else; writing, reading, certain amount of music, very patriotic singing.</span> <span id="s880">I would have been structured into a life that would be suitable with other children.</span> <span id="s881">It was not like living in a boarding school; I would be able to go home.</span> <span id="s882">But the important thing was that they would feed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Mama absolutely refused to work.</span> <span id="s884">Once again, I couldn’t depend on my mother.</span> <span id="s885">I believe, still, that an adult has no right to put herself ahead of a child’s needs.</span> <span id="s886">The consequences of her refusal were severe.</span> <span id="s887">They took all our ration cards away, and suddenly we had no source of eating or the basics.</span> <span id="s888">Never mind shopping, but just getting enough rubles to buy something in the way of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">So how did we live?</span> <span id="s890">Mama knew a lot of people who had lived in Siberia for generations.</span> <span id="s891">They were Russian Jews but Russian citizens.</span> <span id="s892">Many of them had very important positions in the local hierarchy of government.</span> <span id="s893">There is a bazaar in every major Russian city, especially where we lived because it was so close to Asia.</span> <span id="s894">So they would give my mother items to sell.</span> <span id="s895">It could be clothing, it could be lipstick, it could be bars of soap.</span> <span id="s896">Then she would get a commission for whatever she would sell for them.</span> <span id="s897">They had some sort of formula and understanding, and it worked.</span> <span id="s898">At least it worked for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">I could only be taken out when the weather was relatively mild or before the real frosts came.</span> <span id="s900">It is hard to estimate now, but I think four or five months out of the year the weather would be mild.</span> <span id="s901">That left most of the year when I could not go out.</span> <span id="s902">My mother would come home and many times she was able to find food items from the bazaar from her earnings.</span> <span id="s903">My aunt was working in a factory cafeteria.</span> <span id="s904">She was conscripted like a soldier.</span> <span id="s905">So that left me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">We had a small room with a big window.</span> <span id="s907">My mother would make sure I had some food.</span> <span id="s908">Because of the cold, every room in Russia had a brick corner, which would be your oven.</span> <span id="s909">You could put in pieces of wood, pieces of coal.</span> <span id="s910">You had warmth for the room, and if you improvised something on top, you could put a kettle to cook whatever.</span> <span id="s911">So that was our stove.</span> <span id="s912">Mama always had on the side a little cupboard area to try to make sure the coal didn’t get on everything.</span> <span id="s913">These things I would need to keep that fire going.</span> <span id="s914">It was up to me to do that through all the hours of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Mama would get all her stuff ready.</span> <span id="s916">I remember she had a lock.</span> <span id="s917">It was not like the locks you have in America; you have a lock and you turn the key.</span> <span id="s918">It was a big lock that she had, and when she would leave the room and me, she hung that lock on the outside of the door.</span> <span id="s919">I had no way of leaving that room.</span> <span id="s920">It wasn’t that Mama didn’t trust me, but where was I to go.</span> <span id="s921">It was cold and it was alien to me.</span> <span id="s922">Everybody was at work.</span> <span id="s923">So I was in that room about five months out of the year for three years, between 1942 and 1945.</span> <span id="s924">That’s how my mother and I managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">My aunt would come home every thirty-six hours because she had a shift of twenty-four hours, and then she would come home to sleep.</span> <span id="s926">Looking back on it now, my family used to tease me about it, and my aunt used to tell these stories on me.</span> <span id="s927">I was lonely.</span> <span id="s928">There was no way to say, I don’t want this and I’ll throw a tantrum and I won’t behave.</span> <span id="s929">You just accept what is there.</span> <span id="s930">My loneliness was so profound, when my aunt was home, trying to sleep because she had to go back to work the next day for twenty-four hours, I used to go and touch her eye lids and force her eyes open.</span> <span id="s931">She was a good sport about it, when I think back, now as an adult.</span> <span id="s932">When you’re sleepy, and here is this child forcing your eyes open so you can talk to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">It was not a good situation.</span> <span id="s934">No radio, no television, none of the things we now know in the world.</span> <span id="s935">I couldn’t read yet.</span> <span id="s936">I didn’t have any books.</span> <span id="s937">So I would sit in the window.</span> <span id="s938">If I’d see a bird or a dog running by, I would think, I wonder where that dog is going.</span> <span id="s939">Isn’t he cold?</span> <span id="s940">Has he had food to eat today—just sort of make up stories in my mind.</span> <span id="s941">I lived in my mind.</span> <span id="s942">When I came to America and I had to learn English, our radio was on all the time when I was home.</span> <span id="s943">I did in Russia as a child what the radio did for me later, except the radio gave me the material.</span> <span id="s944">I was living in my own mind then.</span> <span id="s945">I didn’t like it; I was very lonely.</span> <span id="s946">But I remember I was always very resigned to my situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">I would look out the big window.</span> <span id="s948">The house was on a little hill, so I could see when my mother would get off the little trolley that would be the last station for the area, and I could see her coming.</span> <span id="s949">And it was like joy—the joy that my mother was finally coming home.</span> <span id="s950">And of course she was tired, she was cold.</span> <span id="s951">But it was somebody there.</span> <span id="s952">This is how we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">The warm weather was lovely because my mother would take me with her to the big bazaar.</span> <span id="s954">Even so, it was still the middle of the war.</span> <span id="s955">Russia suffered many casualties and there were soldiers who had been maimed—amputees.</span> <span id="s956">They didn’t get much help from the government.</span> <span id="s957">Once they were healed, they were on their own.</span> <span id="s958">At the bazaar, many times, if soldiers knew how to play the garmoshka, a little accordion, or a mandolin, a balalaika, they would sit with their cap on the ground.</span> <span id="s959">The understanding was that they would sing all kinds of folk songs, patriotic songs, love songs, and passers by would sometimes stop and listen and toss in a coin.</span> <span id="s960">That’s how these poor men would make their living.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">The three or four months when the weather was acceptable for me to be out (I was still heavily dressed) my mother would bring me to the bazaar and she would say, ‘Stay right here,’ because this man was singing.</span> <span id="s962">That was his station, his spot.</span> <span id="s963">And I would stay.</span> <span id="s964">Hours passed.</span> <span id="s965">I was so enthralled.</span> <span id="s966">I used to learn all these Russian melodies and songs, and then when I’d be home I would repeat them to my mother and she was very entertained.</span> <span id="s967">But this was my entertainment.</span> <span id="s968">And it was lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Something funny happened.</span> <span id="s970">Mama would leave me there with always something in my pocket to eat.</span> <span id="s971">But no money.</span> <span id="s972">As people gathered, they were bigger than I was, and pretty soon I’d find myself toward the back.</span> <span id="s973">And I wanted to be up front as close to the singer as I could be, so I could hear everything and see him.</span> <span id="s974">I told Mama, ‘I have to have some kopeks in my pocket because I want to be in the front, and I can’t stand there for hours and listen to him sing and not put something in the cap.’</span> <span id="s975">She was cooperative about that and gave me some coins, so I felt I paid my way.</span> <span id="s976">I had an orchestra seat, so to speak.</span> <span id="s977">When I say this now, it is humorous.</span> <span id="s978">But this was normal for us.</span> <span id="s979">This was normal life.</span> <span id="s980">If the weather was good and if it wasn’t especially cold and if it wasn’t snowing, I had a chance to be at the bazaar.</span> <span id="s981">That was especially good.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">We did not know any dates.</span> <span id="s983">We did not know any events.</span> <span id="s984">There was no such thing as a newspaper.</span> <span id="s985">The newspaper of record in Stalinist days was called Pravda, which means “Truth.”</span> <span id="s986">But it was the biggest lie.</span> <span id="s987">There were headlines in Pravda but I didn’t read Russian.</span> <span id="s988">Neither did my mother.</span> <span id="s989">We didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s990">On one of these warm days, with a little sun coming through, my mother took me with her to spend the day at the market.</span> <span id="s991">As the trolley drove into the business center of the town, we started seeing many people—the further we went the more people we saw—and then we suddenly saw them hugging and kissing and singing and smiling—it was very different from anything else I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s992">Finally, when some people got off the trolley, and other people came on, we found out that the war in Europe was over.</span> <span id="s993">That’s why these Russians were so overjoyed and happy.</span> <span id="s994">Total strangers kissed and hugged, men and women—it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s995">It was just the joy that finally, the killing would end.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">We did not know that the world war also had a Pacific theatre.</span> <span id="s997">We had no knowledge of that at all.</span> <span id="s998">We didn’t really know who was fighting whom; we only knew Russia was fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s999">But we didn’t know that it had involved all other nations or that there was a Pacific war as well.</span> <span id="s1000">In any case, we found out the war was over, and somehow you had a spring in your step and you felt better about things.</span> <span id="s1001">That day we spent the day in the market as usual; of course there was more excitement.</span> <span id="s1002">Mama really splurged.</span> <span id="s1003">There was a man who sold clay cups full of baked milk.</span> <span id="s1004">Untreated milk has cream in it, and he would bake soup dishes full of milk and the cream would rise to the top and get brown.</span> <span id="s1005">As a treat for that day, Mama bought me one of these cups of milk and it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Chapter 2: Displaced Soon after this event—perhaps a week or two at the most—we got an order that was delivered something like Western Union—from the Russian authorities that since we were stateless people and we were Jews, we had to report to a certain railroad station and take our bundles with us.</span> <span id="s1007">A train was waiting, and we were being expelled from Russia to go back to our various homelands.</span> <span id="s1008">The Russians didn’t want to have foreigners there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">It still left us in limbo, because mother knew my father was still in a Gulag camp.</span> <span id="s1010">He was not being repatriated; he was staying there.</span> <span id="s1011">For how long we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1012">The news that everyone received with joy was not necessarily received with joy by us.</span> <span id="s1013">I remember my mother crying, because as soon as we got that order, she didn’t know what she should do because my father was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1014">Mama considered staying put; staying and taking whatever consequences.</span> <span id="s1015">Luckily, prisons have a certain network.</span> <span id="s1016">Papa knew my mother very well.</span> <span id="s1017">There was an amnesty when the war ended, and lot of people were released from many of the camps.</span> <span id="s1018">And since the town we lived in was more or less a crossroads, many of them ended up in that town.</span> <span id="s1019">Papa sent out a message, ‘Leave, leave, leave, because later you may not be able to.’</span> <span id="s1020">Once my mother got that message, there was no question about our staying in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">We reported to the train, and that was our exit from mother Russia.</span> <span id="s1022">This was summer of 1945—the weather was nice.</span> <span id="s1023">We were six weeks on that train.</span> <span id="s1024">Our train was full of homeless refugees that were shipped out to their homelands.</span> <span id="s1025">Coming back into Russia, the opposite direction, were trains bringing back injured soldiers, and they took priority.</span> <span id="s1026">Even now it probably takes the better part of a week to travel by train from Siberia into what is European Russia.</span> <span id="s1027">For us, the reason it took six weeks was because every time, when there was a train going back into Russia with these injured soldiers, our train was put to the side so that these people could get by.</span> <span id="s1028">Sometimes we stood for a few hours, sometimes for several days.</span> <span id="s1029">There was no control of your life.</span> <span id="s1030">You were always at the mercy of whoever gave the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">We were on the train for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1032">There was one event that I’ll remember as long as I live.</span> <span id="s1033">As we traveled into Poland, people started to get off if they were close to their own town.</span> <span id="s1034">We were somewhere in the Krakow area.</span> <span id="s1035">Several young men wanted to go exploring because they knew the area, they had lived there.</span> <span id="s1036">They were going to find fresh food to buy from farmers or see if anyone was alive from their families.</span> <span id="s1037">Off they went, and one was the son of a family who lived with us in this cattle car.</span> <span id="s1038">They were gone for many many hours.</span> <span id="s1039">Everybody was waiting for the news they would bring back.</span> <span id="s1040">They returned—it was almost dusk—I remember the boy that was from our own car.</span> <span id="s1041">He was young and happy and looking forward to an adventure.</span> <span id="s1042">He came back looking like an old man.</span> <span id="s1043">They had come across huts that were the gas chambers of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1044">They found on the walls, in some cases, scratched in from whatever people had—names, some names in Hebrew—also message like: ‘We are dying, we are being killed off,’ something to that effect.</span> <span id="s1045">That’s when suddenly people like us, who had been driven deep into Siberia, found out that our people were killed here by the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">They brought back potatoes, and right away we improvised with a bonfire.</span> <span id="s1047">You take a stick and you push it through the potato and roast it over the coals.</span> <span id="s1048">I was a girl scout long before I came to America!</span> <span id="s1049">We roasted the potatoes and there were a few children younger than I—but no adult, even though we were all hungry, no adult touched those potatoes.</span> <span id="s1050">They did give them to us, the children.</span> <span id="s1051">In the distance (it was a long train) I saw a circle of people, men gathered around.</span> <span id="s1052">And that was the first time in my life I heard words of the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.</span> <span id="s1053">These men had brought back the news that apparently there was a lot of killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s1054">Nobody knew who was who.</span> <span id="s1055">It was just out of respect.</span> <span id="s1056">That’s why they didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1057">The mourning period has some prohibition about eating right away.</span> <span id="s1058">This was out of respect to these totally unknown victims, whose only sign was a scratch of a name on a wall.</span> <span id="s1059">We had a minion, a quorum.</span> <span id="s1060">There have to be a minimum of ten men for Jews to pray.</span> <span id="s1061">There ended up being many more than ten.</span> <span id="s1062">It was the first time I had ever heard Kaddish, and it was alien—Hebrew and Jewish tradition was unknown to me.</span> <span id="s1063">And I heard people crying as well.</span> <span id="s1064">Later in the night when things settled down and we closed the doors because it was cold, everybody was very subdued.</span> <span id="s1065">We had some candles so that we could have some lighting.</span> <span id="s1066">I said, ‘Mama, why were they praying.</span> <span id="s1067">?’</span> <span id="s1068">She was crying and she said, ‘They discovered that some Jews had been killed.’</span> <span id="s1069">That’s really all we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">As we entered more and more into European areas, the Ukraine and into Poland, people got off, so the train got emptier and emptier.</span> <span id="s1071">My aunt, by then, from the time we had started on the transport out of Siberia, had hooked up with a group of young people her own age, and she stayed in another cattle car.</span> <span id="s1072">So it was just Mama and I.</span> <span id="s1073">But we saw her every time we would stop; she would come over.</span> <span id="s1074">Mama said, she was afraid to stop anywhere in Poland because here she is a woman with a small girl and a young lady (Bluma was about eighteen, nineteen at the time).</span> <span id="s1075">She said, we are all females and it is dangerous.</span> <span id="s1076">I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1077">She said, I want to stay on the train until the end of the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">The end of the line came at a city on the Baltic which had been renamed by then.</span> <span id="s1079">It was now part of Poland because the borders had been redrawn at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1080">It had been the German port city of Stattin.</span> <span id="s1081">We knew is as Szczecin.</span> <span id="s1082">And there we had to get off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">We started walking because we wanted to find a place, a room, where we could live, sleep.</span> <span id="s1084">Street after street, it was like being in a moon-scape.</span> <span id="s1085">Everything was bombed out…everything.</span> <span id="s1086">Sometimes you’d see a wall at the front of a building and you’d think, wonderful, this might be it.</span> <span id="s1087">And then you’d go into a courtyard and it was demolished, mountains of brick and mortar and concrete and that was it.</span> <span id="s1088">Because it was a port it was heavily bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">We finally found a room that we shared, Mama and I were in one room and the lady who took us in was in the other room.</span> <span id="s1090">She had a little boy about my age, and coincidentally, her husband was also in the Gulag camps.</span> <span id="s1091">And she had no idea when or if she would ever see him again.</span> <span id="s1092">She was resigned that he was dead.</span> <span id="s1093">I remember because Mama was a little resentful and judgmental because the woman said that she was already looking for a husband.</span> <span id="s1094">Perhaps she was.</span> <span id="s1095">The other woman had resigned herself that her husband was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">We lived in this arrangement.</span> <span id="s1097">The agencies to help were just beginning to set up their clinics.</span> <span id="s1098">There was an infirmary, there was a little post office, and people were still coming out and finding each other and discovering who survived.</span> <span id="s1099">So it was like a center.</span> <span id="s1100">There was dining room at the center, like a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s1101">It should have been the end of our hunger.</span> <span id="s1102">But my mother was too proud to stand in line with the hundreds of perfectly able-bodied people.</span> <span id="s1103">People stood in line and were not too proud to get in line and have a bowl and get some stew.</span> <span id="s1104">…nourishment.</span> <span id="s1105">If she didn’t stand in line, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1106">It was for her sake as well; she was just as hungry as I.</span> <span id="s1107">But it effected me more because I was a kid, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1108">These were bad days.</span> <span id="s1109">Mama would go to the market place, like a flea market, and try to sell some item of clothing so she get some money to buy food.</span> <span id="s1110">It didn’t always work and she didn’t have anything to sell any more.</span> <span id="s1111">It was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">It was at that point, because I was older and I began to understand more, that this gulf between my mother and I deepened.</span> <span id="s1113">Adults have to put pride aside if you have a young child who is depending on you.</span> <span id="s1114">You have to be careful how you handle the situation.</span> <span id="s1115">You have no way of knowing how a child—a child is a person, only smaller—you have no way of knowing how a child is going to react.</span> <span id="s1116">I resented it.</span> <span id="s1117">Mama would not put her pride aside even for my sake.</span> <span id="s1118">She would not ask for help.</span> <span id="s1119">The help was there but she would not ask for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">This was another learning experience for me.</span> <span id="s1121">My mother was a loner in a communal situation.</span> <span id="s1122">To get along it wasn’t enough to be pleasant, not to appear territorial.</span> <span id="s1123">You had to be part of things.</span> <span id="s1124">But she refused.</span> <span id="s1125">She insisted on her way.</span> <span id="s1126">Very often this alienated us from the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">My reaction was: Fine.</span> <span id="s1128">I have no one to depend on, so I will do whatever I can to help myself.</span> <span id="s1129">Then there was a time they were recruiting orphans to get on ships from Antwerp, from Genoa, to get on illegal ships and try to break the blockage that the British had already set up around Palestine limiting Jewish immigration.</span> <span id="s1130">A lady came in and asked the teacher, how many of the kids are orphans.</span> <span id="s1131">The teacher said, ‘You’ll have to ask them.’</span> <span id="s1132">I don’t know if there were many like me.</span> <span id="s1133">He said, ‘You’ll get on a train.</span> <span id="s1134">You’ll be given food, and we’ll go to a port where you will board a ship for the land of Israel.</span> <span id="s1135">How many of you want to sign up?’</span> <span id="s1136">And my hand went up.</span> <span id="s1137">I signed up as an orphan.</span> <span id="s1138">I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s1139">That evening I told Mama, “I signed up to go somewhere and they’ll give us food.’</span> <span id="s1140">Right away she was a little bit suspicious because you have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1141">The next day she found out what I had signed up for: an orphan train, transport, to go first to Holland, Belgium—these orphans were picked up all over Europe and then transported to a holding place—when there were enough of us they would board the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">My mother was very angry with me, very upset.</span> <span id="s1143">How could I do that to her.</span> <span id="s1144">How could I shame her so.</span> <span id="s1145">And I said, ‘Mama, I didn’t want to do anything bad.</span> <span id="s1146">I just wanted the food that they promised.</span> <span id="s1147">And they said our parents could join us later.’</span> <span id="s1148">I tried to make every excuse in the book but she very hurt.</span> <span id="s1149">She was very angry.</span> <span id="s1150">She talked to the people in charge and my name was taken off that list.</span> <span id="s1151">And I felt cheated, because I was already counting on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Mama was a nice person.</span> <span id="s1153">She was in some ways, politically and militarily, certainly naïve.</span> <span id="s1154">She was a young woman from a little village.</span> <span id="s1155">The war broke out.</span> <span id="s1156">It was a big shock to her, too.</span> <span id="s1157">And she was not the aggressive kind that uses her elbows to get something.</span> <span id="s1158">She was very Victorian, lady-like.</span> <span id="s1159">To this day, virtue like that doesn’t mean a thing to me because I think the world is a battle.</span> <span id="s1160">And I think people do have to fight for what they want in many ways.</span> <span id="s1161">Mama was not like that.</span> <span id="s1162">She waited until it would be brought to her.</span> <span id="s1163">Nothing gets brought to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">This also was a turning point.</span> <span id="s1165">We got over that bump in the road, but this is how our relationship began to evolve as I was old enough to understand and to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s1166">I never felt that I could depend on my mother.</span> <span id="s1167">It was unfortunate, it wasn’t her fault.</span> <span id="s1168">She just didn’t realize what she was doing.</span> <span id="s1169">That’s how it was.</span> <span id="s1170">Those were the ‘formative years’ of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">My value system, my table of priorities, is basically still the same.</span> <span id="s1172">In a different way, perhaps, but still the same.</span> <span id="s1173">I cannot be so altruistic that I give everything away.</span> <span id="s1174">My children, at times, wanted this and that.</span> <span id="s1175">My way of dealing with it was, ‘Look, you want this because you want this.</span> <span id="s1176">It’s not because you have to have it.’</span> <span id="s1177">So it’s not as if I was depriving them of food.</span> <span id="s1178">But I am getting older.</span> <span id="s1179">They live far away from here.</span> <span id="s1180">Even with the best of intentions, they can’t be here for me.</span> <span id="s1181">I said to my daughter this last time when I was visiting, ‘You know, if I get sick I have to call the agency and hire someone to go to HEB and shop for me.’</span> <span id="s1182">You can just impose on friends so much, and then it gets old.</span> <span id="s1183">I think that my attitude came from that period of when I was very young.</span> <span id="s1184">I am not proud of that, but it is the truth about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">I know it doesn’t sound nice but it’s not so awful.</span> <span id="s1186">The reason is because you don’t feel like a victim all the time.</span> <span id="s1187">You don’t feel dependent all the time.</span> <span id="s1188">When my husband became ill with Parkinson’s, I must tell you that I was a widow long before he actually passed away because of his illness.</span> <span id="s1189">I took care of him here in the apartment for all the years that he was ill.</span> <span id="s1190">But the last six months, I felt that if I could not get a good night’s sleep without worrying that he might fall when he goes to the bathroom, or whatever, that I would collapse.</span> <span id="s1191">So it was a matter of deciding.</span> <span id="s1192">I didn’t like my decision.</span> <span id="s1193">I’m sure he didn’t like it either.</span> <span id="s1194">He’d been in the hospital this last time; he had pneumonia, he had other things wrong, heart failure, and Parkinson’s.</span> <span id="s1195">He said, ‘Maybe I’ll feel better when I get home.’</span> <span id="s1196">As the day drew nearer when he would have to leave the hospital, I said, ‘Danny, we’re not going to go home.</span> <span id="s1197">There is a very good place that will have professionals taking care of you with professional equipment.’</span> <span id="s1198">He didn’t have as many falls because they could lower the bed for him, way low, so he wouldn’t fall.</span> <span id="s1199">And I said, “I just cannot do it,’ because I was just running out of steam.</span> <span id="s1200">It wasn’t that I wanted to have a social life.</span> <span id="s1201">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1202">And he knew it.</span> <span id="s1203">He felt sad, but he understood.</span> <span id="s1204">He was very understanding that way.</span> <span id="s1205">So the last six months of his illness….</span> <span id="s1206">he had Parkinson’s that was like Lou Gehrig’s disease.</span> <span id="s1207">It immobilized his esophagus and his vocal cords, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1208">and it was very debilitating.</span> <span id="s1209">He couldn’t go out anywhere, he couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1210">He had to stay on liquids, mainly.</span> <span id="s1211">At the end he could not speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">I remember thinking, at the time, OK, you’ve done the best you could.</span> <span id="s1213">The year he died, it was a few months short of our 43rd wedding anniversary.</span> <span id="s1214">And I felt in my heart that I had done the best I could and I had done it for him.</span> <span id="s1215">I had put everything aside.</span> <span id="s1216">I didn’t see people.</span> <span id="s1217">I didn’t do volunteer work.</span> <span id="s1218">But the last six months, the survivor instinct kicked in.</span> <span id="s1219">I’m always aware when it kicks in.</span> <span id="s1220">I will go along and help and be helpful.</span> <span id="s1221">But then something kicks in that says, Hold it.</span> <span id="s1222">You are at risk.</span> <span id="s1223">I will hurt myself.</span> <span id="s1224">And what good would it do?</span> <span id="s1225">It wouldn’t have made his Parkinson’s go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Those values, prioritizing things, started about that period.</span> <span id="s1227">Sometimes it has made me a nice person.</span> <span id="s1228">Sometimes, perhaps, people don’t think I’m so nice.</span> <span id="s1229">I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s1230">To be honest, it doesn’t bother me if I know I’ve done the best I could I have this fixation about food.</span> <span id="s1231">I was in Toronto recently and Naomi and I ran into a special deli to get something.</span> <span id="s1232">And she parked someplace near the entrance where the deli displays were.</span> <span id="s1233">This place caters to weddings, and in the cases on display were these cakes and pies, decorated with fruit, and they were so artistic and they were so beautiful.</span> <span id="s1234">To me, it was like walking into Tiffany’s and seeing diamonds.</span> <span id="s1235">I saw this beautiful food.</span> <span id="s1236">And of course I can’t touch it because I have diabetes and I don’t want to gain any more weight.</span> <span id="s1237">And it’s silly; I wasn’t even hungry.</span> <span id="s1238">But these thoughts keep surfacing.</span> <span id="s1239">When I walk into HEB, it’s a flash.</span> <span id="s1240">I never thought that I would ever be in a situation where I not only would have enough food but could offer someone food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Sometimes when I look around at all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1242">It is very pleasant to live well and in nice surroundings with a beautiful view.</span> <span id="s1243">But it all seems so—how on earth did I get here?</span> <span id="s1244">I never thought that we would really make it.</span> <span id="s1245">People like us, we try to make up for the things we lost or for the things we didn’t have a chance to get during those horror years.</span> <span id="s1246">This desire to make up goes even to the third generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s1248">I think that this kind of attitude about family and about life is what kept the Jews going.</span> <span id="s1249">I’m sure other people have their own sense of how to cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">When I was in Poland five years ago, I didn’t go to my home town because I would have had to leave the group and I didn’t choose to go.</span> <span id="s1251">But of course I was in Warsaw and in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1252">Someone in the bus asked, ‘What would you do that you could really enjoy if you went to your home town.’</span> <span id="s1253">And I said, ‘I would knock on every door, and I would say, “You don’t know me.</span> <span id="s1254">But I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s1255">I survived.</span> <span id="s1256">And I live in America.</span> <span id="s1257">And I have a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s1258">’” I think most of the group understood.</span> <span id="s1259">That’s what I felt like doing.</span> <span id="s1260">I would want them to know, yes, I’m a Jew, a Zid, but I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">And that’s why when I go to groups at various schools, my presentations are, in one sense, different from what other survivors say.</span> <span id="s1262">I refuse to say, ‘Look at poor little me.’</span> <span id="s1263">I am thankful I survived.</span> <span id="s1264">I feel grateful for the life I’ve had and the opportunities since and the nice things.</span> <span id="s1265">But I’m not a victim.</span> <span id="s1266">I’m the hero of this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">This is very important to us.</span> <span id="s1268">It is a matter of one’s pride.</span> <span id="s1269">These miners in Chili will go through a period of adjustment.</span> <span id="s1270">When they are finally out of the spotlight, and when they have time to understand how close it was for them between life and death, they will want to make the most of life now.</span> <span id="s1271">They will want to enjoy their lives.</span> <span id="s1272">The little things are not going to be so important anymore.</span> <span id="s1273">I think they’ll also have a better sense of giving to other people, of sharing.</span> <span id="s1274">Because I know that whatever my circumstances are, I support all kinds of situations and agencies.</span> <span id="s1275">Many of them are out of town and nobody knows and nobody has given me a banquet and said, ‘Oh you wonderful person, you.’</span> <span id="s1276">But that’s not what it is meant to be.</span> <span id="s1277">It makes me feel good that once I had to be on the receiving end and didn’t always receive.</span> <span id="s1278">And I feel good when I can help.</span> <span id="s1279">It’s a strange feeling but it’s a good feeling.</span> <span id="s1280">It is another way of saying, thank God.</span> <span id="s1281">Thank God.</span> <span id="s1282">Without that, there’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">I’ve always felt close to Catholic people because of my early exposure.</span> <span id="s1284">I was taught to blend in with Catholic when we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s1285">To this day I’ve always told my Jewish friends that I feel as at home in any Catholic Church as I do in my own synagogue.</span> <span id="s1286">I know the rituals, I understand them.</span> <span id="s1287">I always had Catholic friends.</span> <span id="s1288">In fact, the people who are fundamentalists are a different story.</span> <span id="s1289">I went to school with two sisters who were my best friends at the time.</span> <span id="s1290">I came to school one Monday morning with a bad headache.</span> <span id="s1291">I had been to a Jewish wedding the night before and we’d had lots of champagne and wine and you name it.</span> <span id="s1292">When one of them asked me, what’s the matter (I must have looked green).</span> <span id="s1293">And I said, ‘Well, I was at a wedding last night and I must have had too much wine.’</span> <span id="s1294">She said, ‘Oh Leah, we’re going to pray for you.</span> <span id="s1295">We’re going to save you.’</span> <span id="s1296">And I thought, what from?</span> <span id="s1297">My orientation is more with Catholicism.</span> <span id="s1298">Among the Christian sects, Catholicism is the closest in its rituals and attitudes and sacraments to Judaism.</span> <span id="s1299">I learned about Catholicism before I learned anything about Judaism, so it’s just natural.</span> <span id="s1300">I feel a kinship with Catholic people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">All these things that shaped my life happened at a fairly young age.</span> <span id="s1302">I can’t explain it.</span> <span id="s1303">I’ve never worked with children that come from difficult families.</span> <span id="s1304">But I’m willing to bet that those children have a more mature way of looking at life than the child who has the birthday party and the Easter egg rolls.</span> <span id="s1305">Because they’ve already seen a slice of life that isn’t so happy, that had to be endured and they had to cope.</span> <span id="s1306">Human nature is not that different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">In the long run, if I had to really sum up my views, it made me strong, and thank God for that.</span> <span id="s1308">When you lose out on a lot of other things, you have to find something that compensates you for it.</span> <span id="s1309">Because of the way I’ve had to live, because my husband was ill for about ten years and now I’ve been alone for seven, it made me strong enough to cope with all that.</span> <span id="s1310">You’d be surprised, when you have Parkinson’s, the friends are not so quick to come and visit; they feel uncomfortable because you look so gnarled and twisted.</span> <span id="s1311">We didn’t socialize with anyone the last years or see anybody.</span> <span id="s1312">There were times I felt sorry for myself, but fleetingly, very seldom, but I felt, look where you started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">And that’s always on my mind, always.</span> <span id="s1314">When I go to take a bath, do you know what a luxury it is to have running water, hot and cold running water.</span> <span id="s1315">Many people don’t realize it.</span> <span id="s1316">Last night the security person downstairs call me.</span> <span id="s1317">He said, ‘Mrs. Goltzman, I just wanted to let everybody now that the utility people called to say they might shut off our water in the building for a few hours during the night because they were fixing something.’</span> <span id="s1318">I immediately went to make sure I had cold water in my frig, which I always keep.</span> <span id="s1319">Fine, no big deal.</span> <span id="s1320">The reason such things are no big deal is because I can do without it.</span> <span id="s1321">Air conditioning, I cannot give up.</span> <span id="s1322">I’d die.</span> <span id="s1323">Otherwise, for all the negative stuff that happened, it made us strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">I think Israel is, in a sense, a composite picture of those survivors, because it’s made up of survivors.</span> <span id="s1325">They are now perhaps already deceased or they are very old or they are grandparents.</span> <span id="s1326">But their grandsons and daughters are now the ones who guard the borders and who go into the military.</span> <span id="s1327">But Israel is, in a sense, that symbol of what it takes and how you cope with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">In the DP camp, we heard about Aliyah Bet—the movement to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1329">“Bet or “B” was the second letter of the alphabet; it meant that it was a secret movement.</span> <span id="s1330">They contacted people like us but also whole families with husbands, and said, ‘Would you be willing to leave Poland forever and possibly end up in Palestine?’</span> <span id="s1331">My mother agreed.</span> <span id="s1332">This was all very clandestine, very quietly done.</span> <span id="s1333">We were told what to take and how to go about it.</span> <span id="s1334">Take only a small bundle, which is all we had anyway.</span> <span id="s1335">We put on a couple of layers of clothes because we had the extra clothes and we needed them later.</span> <span id="s1336">We met other people in a sort of school who were in the same situation.</span> <span id="s1337">And then we were taken in trucks, lories covered up.</span> <span id="s1338">We were taken on the road.</span> <span id="s1339">It was long long hours of being shaken up.</span> <span id="s1340">There were two benches in the truck and the rest of the space was floor space, but most of the time you weren’t so lucky so you had to sit on the floor of the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">It was long long overnight trip.</span> <span id="s1342">I slept a lot—dozed and then the sun comes up.</span> <span id="s1343">I was very disoriented.</span> <span id="s1344">The only reason I know it was very long was because the grown ups were talking about it.</span> <span id="s1345">We ended up in a city called Poznan.</span> <span id="s1346">By the time we were in Poznan, things were looking up, as far as I was concerned, because we were getting regular meals.</span> <span id="s1347">I was getting food.</span> <span id="s1348">We were put in a building like a school.</span> <span id="s1349">There were a lot of people there, all Jewish, all in the same predicament we were in.</span> <span id="s1350">Then they said, ‘We don’t know exactly when, at a certain point—it could be a few days, it could be a week from now—you will be taken across the frontier into Czechoslovakia.’</span> <span id="s1351">Of course I have always suspected that the Palestinian Jews were doing all this for us, had their contacts.</span> <span id="s1352">They had bribed guards on the border.</span> <span id="s1353">But they didn’t tell us that.</span> <span id="s1354">In order to maintain control so that people didn’t get noisy, they made us feel that this is very secret.</span> <span id="s1355">And since we were all so used to being quiet and invisible, we took their word for it, of course.</span> <span id="s1356">And it was for the best, when you cross a frontier.</span> <span id="s1357">So we crossed into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1358">It was dawn, I was so sleepy.</span> <span id="s1359">The grass had dew on it.</span> <span id="s1360">We were told there was a train coming and this train would take us into the city of Prague.</span> <span id="s1361">And there we would be transferred to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">The first time I ate an apple I was struck by its fragrance.</span> <span id="s1363">It is the same about colors.</span> <span id="s1364">In Siberia all I had seen for years were drab grey, brown, black, nondescript clothing.</span> <span id="s1365">Anything people could cover up with and keep warm.</span> <span id="s1366">There were no colors.</span> <span id="s1367">When we were put in the train for several hours and they said, you’re in Prague, which meant we are as far away from the Russians as we could be, and I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s1368">They opened the big door—the sliding door on the freight train—there were people standing there on the platform.</span> <span id="s1369">I saw them like flowers.</span> <span id="s1370">They were wearing colors.</span> <span id="s1371">There was yellow, there was green, there was red.</span> <span id="s1372">And in my eyes, these were not people, they were flowers because all I could see were the colors.</span> <span id="s1373">Maybe that’s why I still like colorful clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">That was Prague.</span> <span id="s1375">From Prague we went again on a train and ended up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1376">Once we were in Vienna, in summer of 1946, we knew that we were now under American control and everybody breathed a sigh of relief.</span> <span id="s1377">Austria and Germany after the war was divided into four zones: the French, the British, the Russians, and the Americans.</span> <span id="s1378">My mother always wanted to be as close to the Americans as possible.</span> <span id="s1379">They brought us to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">By that time, the people who guided us and took care of us, knew that not all the Jewish refugees would be going to what was then British-mandated Palestine.</span> <span id="s1381">Vienna was like a holding place for many many refugees from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s1382">Incidentally I can say that I had the honor of living once in a Rothschild mansion.</span> <span id="s1383">In a suburb of Vienna that was used for this holding camp for refugees was one of the estates that the Rothschild family had owned for many years.</span> <span id="s1384">We were using the grounds, in tents under the trees.</span> <span id="s1385">The building was very large and ornate on the outside.</span> <span id="s1386">But inside it was filled with filing cabinets and there was a medical clinic and desks where people would come to give them information, to try to get visas.</span> <span id="s1387">It was sort of a clearing house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">I got very sick there.</span> <span id="s1389">It was warm weather, so we were in tents.</span> <span id="s1390">But I developed a very high fever.</span> <span id="s1391">The one thing they did very well was take care of the survivors medically.</span> <span id="s1392">They immediately diagnosed that I had scarlet fever and x-rays were taken to show that I also had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1393">We were always living in such closed-in quarters.</span> <span id="s1394">Sanitation was at its best limited.</span> <span id="s1395">It’s not surprising we caught everything.</span> <span id="s1396">Many people did not survive it.</span> <span id="s1397">If you were lucky and blessed, you built up a strong immunity and made it.</span> <span id="s1398">In this Rothschild clinic, my mother got a paper directing us to such-and-such hospital in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1399">It was for children and it handled only communicable diseases.</span> <span id="s1400">So the hospital cut them off, quarantined them from anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">We walked some distance.</span> <span id="s1402">The hospital was surrounded by a garden, sort of a little park with benches.</span> <span id="s1403">At that time in Austria the Catholic nuns were very much a part of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1404">They wore their long habits and white headdresses; it gave a special feeling of quiet and peace.</span> <span id="s1405">In any case, by the time my mother took me to this area, it was late afternoon.</span> <span id="s1406">We had to sit on this bench and wait until mother superior called us; there were other people ahead of us.</span> <span id="s1407">Suddenly I started hearing very soothing melodies.</span> <span id="s1408">I thought, I must already be dying.</span> <span id="s1409">This is how the angels must sound.</span> <span id="s1410">It turned out that the nuns were singing vespers.</span> <span id="s1411">That’s what I was hearing.</span> <span id="s1412">I thought it was very heavenly.</span> <span id="s1413">It was a nice coincidence because I was a kid and anxious about going to the hospital and having to be separated from my mom.</span> <span id="s1414">The soothing music helped a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">I was taken into this hospital.</span> <span id="s1416">As soon as they signed me up in the front entryway, my mother and I couldn’t even touch hands.</span> <span id="s1417">She was sent away.</span> <span id="s1418">It was like a total quarantine area.</span> <span id="s1419">I was in that hospital for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1420">I always marvel at the care.</span> <span id="s1421">It made up a little bit for what we had been through.</span> <span id="s1422">Between the American army and the local authorities, the care provided to survivors was really top notch.</span> <span id="s1423">Many people with TB were sent to Switzerland for recovery because of fresh air there, the sanitariums.</span> <span id="s1424">All in all I got excellent care.</span> <span id="s1425">I was in a ward with many other children.</span> <span id="s1426">It was co-ed because we were young; nobody cared about that.</span> <span id="s1427">I remember my bed was like a large crib.</span> <span id="s1428">I guess it was so you don’t fall out at night.</span> <span id="s1429">It was larger than a baby’s crib but it had four walls around it that were only put up at night, when we went to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">It was a very regimented schedule.</span> <span id="s1431">One doctor, especially, I remember him so well because you could hear him coming down the hall.</span> <span id="s1432">He was wearing lederhosen.</span> <span id="s1433">Lederhosen are very popular in the Tirol, in Bavaria, and in Austria.</span> <span id="s1434">They are literally men’s shorts, made out of leather, with straps, quite distinctive.</span> <span id="s1435">Sometimes they were inherited from one family member to another, and were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1436">This doctor’s way of dressing was a shirt and lederhosen, and then he had a gown.</span> <span id="s1437">The reason why we knew he wore shorts was because when he turned around, we could see his bare legs.</span> <span id="s1438">But he also wore something like wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1440">It was like the Dutch wear—clogs.</span> <span id="s1441">So you could hear him.</span> <span id="s1442">Whenever we were up in the morning to be checked, our temperature, etc., we could hear our doctor coming.</span> <span id="s1443">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s1444">There were many children there.</span> <span id="s1445">I’m sure he didn’t have much time to spend with each child.</span> <span id="s1446">But the fact of his lederhosen and his wooden shoes clanging away on those tile floors—I remember that.</span> <span id="s1447">He was very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">I was given foods of all kinds.</span> <span id="s1449">I had to take orders like in the army.</span> <span id="s1450">With nuns of the old school, and in Austria, you do not say, ‘I want this’ or ‘I don’t want this.’</span> <span id="s1451">You do it, and that was that.</span> <span id="s1452">I was hungry because some of these foods were new to me, and they were good so they built me up.</span> <span id="s1453">My mother’s last words as we were separated at the door were, ‘You be a good girl and do everything they tell you.’</span> <span id="s1454">And that’s what I did for six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">The parents used to come and not be allowed to visit.</span> <span id="s1456">The hospital had big windows and the parents were allowed in the garden.</span> <span id="s1457">I was perhaps on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1458">If you got a place in front of the window and waited long enough, you could see your parents.</span> <span id="s1459">A few times I could see my mother and knew she was around, and she knew I was OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">It was nice to be with other children because I had not had a chance to be in a normal environment where you have give-and-take and you have certain hours of the day when you are with others.</span> <span id="s1461">The separation of six weeks in Vienna was the first time that I had been overnight without my mother.</span> <span id="s1462">It was very nice because you always made friends with the bed next to you.</span> <span id="s1463">I remember that some children died.</span> <span id="s1464">Some did not survive the illnesses that they had.</span> <span id="s1465">I had made friends with a boy in a bunk next to mine.</span> <span id="s1466">We were roughly the same age.</span> <span id="s1467">He spoke German only, so we got along fine because my German was coming along and Yiddish is German, anyway.</span> <span id="s1468">So we were communicating beautifully.</span> <span id="s1469">We became buddies.</span> <span id="s1470">I remember one night there was some commotion next to me.</span> <span id="s1471">There was activity, and then I dropped off to sleep again.</span> <span id="s1472">When I woke up, his mattress was rolled up.</span> <span id="s1473">The crib was bare.</span> <span id="s1474">When I asked about him, they told me that he had died during the night.</span> <span id="s1475">He didn’t make it; the fever was too much.</span> <span id="s1476">Those intrusions of reality were all too common.</span> <span id="s1477">They served to remind me that yeah, you are a kid and you are being taken care of, but you still aren’t safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">But at least I had the satisfaction because I never heard anyone cry out in pain, like punishment or anything.</span> <span id="s1479">So I knew—remembering the commotion around me at night (at first I thought it was a dream but it must have been when they were tending to him)—I didn’t hear any cruelty.</span> <span id="s1480">It was reassuring in that sense.</span> <span id="s1481">But I missed him.</span> <span id="s1482">And that was already toward the end of my six-week stay there.</span> <span id="s1483">A few days later I was examined, I was x-rayed, and apparently given a clean bill of health.</span> <span id="s1484">My mother was waiting for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">These camps were temporary, like holding places.</span> <span id="s1486">From there we were sent by American military trucks to a regular Displaced Persons camp.</span> <span id="s1487">From Vienna we entered the DP system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">I don’t know how this picture got into my mother’s files.</span> <span id="s1489">The original was a very small picture, which I had enlarged.</span> <span id="s1490">There is a stamp on the original; it is approved by the U. S. army , the U. S. censor.</span> <span id="s1491">It is a picture when one of the camps where we had to live was liberated.</span> <span id="s1492">When we were liberated from Siberia, we came into Austria and the only places to live were the former camps.</span> <span id="s1493">So they had to first clear out corpses and the bodies and those who had TB, communicable diseases.</span> <span id="s1494">And so this picture happened to be with my parents effects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">It was in a little village near Linz.</span> <span id="s1496">I think it was called Abelsberg.</span> <span id="s1497">If you walked into the village you could take an electronic trolley and go into Linz.</span> <span id="s1498">It is a considerable larger city, one of the major cities in Austria.</span> <span id="s1499">That DP camp became, for me, at least, my first sense of some normalcy.</span> <span id="s1500">My mother was allowed a room.</span> <span id="s1501">The showers and toilets were down the hall—one communal one—but each family unit had a regular door and it locked.</span> <span id="s1502">The entire area looked like it might have been a campus.</span> <span id="s1503">I don’t quite know.</span> <span id="s1504">Housing was at a premium.</span> <span id="s1505">Some of the camps weren’t as comfortable but I remember that Abelsberg was not bad at all.</span> <span id="s1506">We stayed there (this was the end of 1946-1947).</span> <span id="s1507">In cold weather I never really got to go out because Mama was afraid I would get sick and I didn’t have clothes for it.</span> <span id="s1508">Austria is milder than Siberia, of course.</span> <span id="s1509">The reason we were in the DP camps—there were quite a few of them, sort of a spider network of camps—they had been work camps for people originally assigned to Mauthausen, a major work center and also an extermination center.</span> <span id="s1510">The reason we lived in proximity to Mauthausen was because that’s where the housing was—for slave laborers who were useful and who could contribute to the war machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">My mother, through the HAIS (Hebrew Aid International Society) was able to get in touch with her aunts in Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s1512">And they started sending us care packages.</span> <span id="s1513">There is such a thing as a care package, even though people think it was a joke.</span> <span id="s1514">Depending on how much the sender wanted to spend state-side determined what the recipient would get on the other end.</span> <span id="s1515">Apparently Mama had written to them that as far as food and such, we were being take care of.</span> <span id="s1516">But there were some things that were in short supply.</span> <span id="s1517">Also, everything was useful on the black market.</span> <span id="s1518">So if my mother couldn’t use something that was in the package, she would always be able to sell it or trade it for something more useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">The first care package was very memorable in my mind not just for the package but what was in it.</span> <span id="s1520">Mama was not with me at the time when somebody from downstairs brought the so-called mail to people.</span> <span id="s1521">It was a package 8 x 20 or 11 x 14.</span> <span id="s1522">And it said ‘care’ and my mother’s name.</span> <span id="s1523">I saw USA so I ripped it open.</span> <span id="s1524">Mama had not said anything about it, so I didn’t know we were getting a care package.</span> <span id="s1525">I remember it had a tube of toothpaste and a tube of hair cream.</span> <span id="s1526">It had a bottle of aspirin.</span> <span id="s1527">It had a bottle of vitamin C. And it had a giant bar of chocolate—Hershey chocolate wrapped distinctively in a rich maroon colored paper with silver writing.</span> <span id="s1528">You could smell it through the wrapping.</span> <span id="s1529">Chocolate is something I’m still in love with.</span> <span id="s1530">I ignored the other things in the package and I opened the bar of chocolate…a pound of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1531">Mama didn’t tell me to look for it, to expect it, nothing.</span> <span id="s1532">I still feel innocent of any crime.</span> <span id="s1533">I broke off a piece, and I ate it.</span> <span id="s1534">It tasted so good.</span> <span id="s1535">Through the afternoon, I ate it and ate it, and I finished the bar of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1536">All that was left was the wrappings, which I was too cowardly to destroy.</span> <span id="s1537">I wouldn’t have been caught—I wasn’t a very good thief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Mama came home—she was happy to get the package.</span> <span id="s1539">And then she saw the empty wrapper from the Hershey bar.</span> <span id="s1540">She was so angry with me.</span> <span id="s1541">That was one of the few times she whacked me across my bottom really hard.</span> <span id="s1542">The reason was that there were bakers in the village or in Linz that wanted to start baking those good Austrian/Viennese pastries and they needed chocolate.</span> <span id="s1543">So they made deals with survivors like us, that if we got chocolate from the Americans we’d trade for a little butter or a piece of cheese or a few eggs.</span> <span id="s1544">So Mama had very practical plans for that chocolate.</span> <span id="s1545">But I did not know about it.</span> <span id="s1546">Had I known, I would have been more careful.</span> <span id="s1547">She punished me for that.</span> <span id="s1548">And after that, when packages, came, I didn’t dare open them.</span> <span id="s1549">The Austrians were anxious to start baking again, they had been without good chocolate for a long time, and there was trade back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">As far as regular eating, the Americans provided a regular dining room and two shifts for each meal since they couldn’t accommodate everyone at once.</span> <span id="s1551">So we always went to the first shift because I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s1552">They served us on metal trays and the trays had little compartments.</span> <span id="s1553">And each tray had stamped on it ‘U.S.’ because it was part of the military equipment.</span> <span id="s1554">The spoons were regular soup spoons.</span> <span id="s1555">At the end of the handle was a little hole that you could put a chain through it and hang it around your neck.</span> <span id="s1556">It also had stamped on it: ‘U. S.’ Those were our utensils.</span> <span id="s1557">We ended up stealing a few of the spoons because we could use them for other things.</span> <span id="s1558">But when we were served food in these makeshift cafeterias it was on those trays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">I developed a very bad habit during that time.</span> <span id="s1560">Again, it couldn’t be helped because food had been such an issue and such a problem.</span> <span id="s1561">Everybody kind of went crazy.</span> <span id="s1562">I ate very fast because if you ate fast you could go up and ask for another portion, any amount.</span> <span id="s1563">We ate in the morning and around noon time, and then in the evening.</span> <span id="s1564">Noon time was the best meal.</span> <span id="s1565">I learned to eat very fast and it was a habit that for years plagued me.</span> <span id="s1566">It’s not good to eat fast.</span> <span id="s1567">It may not even be healthy.</span> <span id="s1568">I had to get out of that habit.</span> <span id="s1569">It was an embarrassing habit.</span> <span id="s1570">But in the mornings for breakfast there were eggs that turned a slight shade of green.</span> <span id="s1571">They were in large aluminum containers that you scooped out like in a cafeteria.</span> <span id="s1572">But if you stood long enough in line the very top layer of the egg turned slightly green.</span> <span id="s1573">And then the soldiers dishing it up would scoop it out and the inside was yellow.</span> <span id="s1574">The reason, we found out later, was because these were powdered eggs and they had been treated a certain way and dehydrated and that was why they turned green.</span> <span id="s1575">We had eggs and plenty of bread (sometimes still hot from the bakery).</span> <span id="s1576">To me everything tasted delicious because it was fresh and it was good and there was plenty of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">At noontime we would have some sort of meat and beans, which we had to get accustomed to eating because in Europe, beans were used as feed for cattle and we were not used to seeing it on a plate for human beings.</span> <span id="s1578">But we learned.</span> <span id="s1579">The same was true of corn.</span> <span id="s1580">They fed us an American diet.</span> <span id="s1581">But the meat was interesting.</span> <span id="s1582">It smelled divine.</span> <span id="s1583">When we walked up, there were large slices, sort of brown, and they put it on your tray.</span> <span id="s1584">A lot of religious people decided not to eat it, and I started hearing that it was not kosher.</span> <span id="s1585">They knew it was meat; they needed the nourishment but it was not kosher because they didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1586">It turned out to be Spam.</span> <span id="s1587">The first time I mentioned this story about spam, I spoke at a traveling club at the Pope Pius X—and they invited me to speak to them.</span> <span id="s1588">There were quite of few men in the audience, older gentleman who had been in the army.</span> <span id="s1589">And I said, ‘I don’t care how many jokes you have, but I want you to know that I lived on Spam and I loved it.’</span> <span id="s1590">And they thought it was very funny.</span> <span id="s1591">But I did love it.</span> <span id="s1592">It was protein.</span> <span id="s1593">It was tasty.</span> <span id="s1594">It was a little bit more salty then I was used to, but it was OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">At night they would give us sandwiches or stuff that was kind of dry.</span> <span id="s1596">There were times when they didn’t have the personnel to cook or something went array, and they would bring in packets that soldiers would get at the front, the rations.</span> <span id="s1597">The cans would be sort of dull, not shiny cans with labels but sort of a dull green.</span> <span id="s1598">I later learned that these were called C-rations that the army used in the field.</span> <span id="s1599">You could guess what was in them—you never knew.</span> <span id="s1600">But it was food.</span> <span id="s1601">Those things were not often served, but once in awhile until the authorities got organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">This was taken in the DB camps.</span> <span id="s1603">This is me.</span> <span id="s1604">This would have been 1947, ‘48.</span> <span id="s1605">I was wearing braids, long long braids, as any school girl.</span> <span id="s1606">I remember we had to take pictures to send to my relatives because they needed to see what shape we were in order to see if they really wanted to sponsor us because if we were physically ill, we would not be able to come.</span> <span id="s1607">So I remember my mother borrowed this blouse for me so that we could look presentable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">We were very shabby, even months after liberation.</span> <span id="s1609">People from America, Jewish people, would send clothing—cast-off stuff.</span> <span id="s1610">By the time it reached us it was wrinkled or ruined.</span> <span id="s1611">So the women and the girls especially started to trade clothes back and forth.</span> <span id="s1612">There would be one room in each camp that was like a store room.</span> <span id="s1613">A person, one of the survivors, would be appointed as the store keeper.</span> <span id="s1614">His function was to see that whoever came would get a winter coat, get some winter clothing, get some shoes.</span> <span id="s1615">Underclothing was always a problem.</span> <span id="s1616">When it came to pictures, we kind of understood the system.</span> <span id="s1617">We had to be sponsored.</span> <span id="s1618">Nobody wanted to sponsor someone who looked crippled, perhaps, or unable to work, unfit.</span> <span id="s1619">So we made our-selves up to look presentable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">We lived in Abelsberg.</span> <span id="s1621">The one event I remember—and that tied me to my heritage because I knew nothing of Judaism—I thought it was late summer but it must have been early fall because everyone started talking about Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s1622">The women were washing their hair and trying to curl it.</span> <span id="s1623">The men would take their suits and try to air them out—refresh their clothing for the holiday.</span> <span id="s1624">It was important.</span> <span id="s1625">So it came and there was one room that was set up like a chapel, like a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1626">I don’t know where they found a Torah but there was a Torah.</span> <span id="s1627">There were many people in the group who could read the Torah.</span> <span id="s1628">We didn’t need a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1629">So holidays were observed.</span> <span id="s1630">It was fine, in fact they were even observed in what I later found out was the most orthodox custom.</span> <span id="s1631">The room was set up like theater-style, with the chairs and in front of you was the bimah where the Torah would be.</span> <span id="s1632">In the middle of the room they hung a rope with blankets hanging.</span> <span id="s1633">My mother and I were directed to one side and on the other side of the blanket were the men.</span> <span id="s1634">And I didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1635">I knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1636">Later it was explained to me.</span> <span id="s1637">That separation is called machitza.</span> <span id="s1638">It is Hebrew for the separation of the sexes.</span> <span id="s1639">In the orthodox tradition, women prayed upstairs if a synagogue had a balcony.</span> <span id="s1640">But in our case it was simply a blanket that would hang in the middle.</span> <span id="s1641">The women and girls would be on one side and the men and boys would be on other.</span> <span id="s1642">The adults were so used to this custom so they made no issue of it.</span> <span id="s1643">I found it strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">So that was my introduction to openly organized Judaism and the high holy days.</span> <span id="s1645">Soon after that, within a week, I started to hear about Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur (those who spoke Yiddish say Yom Kíppur.</span> <span id="s1646">In Hebrew it is Yom Kippúr).</span> <span id="s1647">Some people were saying, ‘I want to be able to fast,’ because it was their first year of freedom.</span> <span id="s1648">And some of the doctors were alerting pregnant women that they never had to fast.</span> <span id="s1649">Others who were sick and frail shouldn’t fast.</span> <span id="s1650">But everyone wanted to try and fast.</span> <span id="s1651">It didn’t concern me, I was always hungry.</span> <span id="s1652">Even when there was food I was always gobbling up.</span> <span id="s1653">I knew about Yom Kippur and food was very much a part of the formula, the preparation of the food.</span> <span id="s1654">Late in the afternoon (Jewish holidays begin at sundown the day before) people began to get very nervous because they had been waiting for the trucks to come in and bring that hot food, and there was no food coming.</span> <span id="s1655">You’re supposed to eat a good meal so that you can fast the next day.</span> <span id="s1656">No preparations were being made so people started to worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Then we were told by an American officer (he spoke a little Yiddish but he must have been from Brooklyn) that there was no food coming; there had been some difficulty.</span> <span id="s1658">They brought us army food—those little square packets filled with dark green cans.</span> <span id="s1659">All of a sudden from this conglomeration of people who were helpless and frail and beaten, and very sad for the most part, came a committee.</span> <span id="s1660">And the committee started going to every cluster of people and we went on a strike.</span> <span id="s1661">I say ‘we,’ but I was told.</span> <span id="s1662">I had no part in that decision; I was told what to do.</span> <span id="s1663">But we went on a strike.</span> <span id="s1664">They said, no matter what they bring, if they do not bring us hot food to begin Yom Kippur, we will not touch anything.</span> <span id="s1665">Everyone was bound by it.</span> <span id="s1666">Being so regimented from the camps and the war years, everybody went along with it.</span> <span id="s1667">But this time it was for a principle.</span> <span id="s1668">It was the fact that we needed to have that respect for our holidays.</span> <span id="s1669">We needed to celebrate them in a nice manner.</span> <span id="s1670">Of all the days not to get a hot meal where you sit down and eat at leisure…so we went on this strike.</span> <span id="s1671">Pretty soon we started seeing more jeeps coming into the courtyard and officers were coming.</span> <span id="s1672">There was a lot of talking back and forth but we didn’t understand any of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">The only thing we understood was when this Brooklyn Jewish officer came with his very fractured Yiddish to say, ‘We have to wait and we’ll get some food and just be patient.’</span> <span id="s1674">People sat down where they were in the middle of the courtyard and they were not going to move.</span> <span id="s1675">I don’t know how long this went on.</span> <span id="s1676">It was late afternoon, almost sundown.</span> <span id="s1677">Before we knew it, the barrier at the gate came up (we were not free to come and go in these camps without a pass) and about three trucks pulled in.</span> <span id="s1678">Everyone scurried away; these trucks were huge.</span> <span id="s1679">Lo-and-behold, only America could do this, on these trucks were metal pots and containers—regular hot food brought in from somewhere, steaming away.</span> <span id="s1680">We had our trays.</span> <span id="s1681">Then the older men who were perhaps rabbis said, ‘OK, don’t rush.’</span> <span id="s1682">The instinct was to rush over—we were hungry and it was almost sundown.</span> <span id="s1683">They were very strict about this.</span> <span id="s1684">‘Don’t go near this until you wash your hands.’</span> <span id="s1685">This Jewish officer with this broken Yiddish was told that we required another thing: basins of water so people would have a chance to wash their hands.</span> <span id="s1686">He got the point.</span> <span id="s1687">Water was produced and we were ceremonially able to wash our hands.Then the rabbi said, ‘You can line up and get your food.</span> <span id="s1688">But we must show these Americans that yes, we’re hungry, but we are not animals.’</span> <span id="s1689">As a kid I knew I was Jewish and I knew it had always been a terror because there was always something dangerous about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1690">I somehow had to reconcile with the fact that Jews were normal people who had certain standards.</span> <span id="s1691">We had to wash our hands before we went anywhere near the line to get the food from the trucks.</span> <span id="s1692">That was my first organized Yom Kippur season; it is etched in mind.</span> <span id="s1693">It was after that that I became curious about Jewish customs and Jewish melodies.</span> <span id="s1694">In fact, I remember after Yom Kippur I went to Mama and I asked, why did the rabbi say, ‘Oi oi oi oi oi?’</span> <span id="s1695">in the prayer.</span> <span id="s1696">The prayer is a lamentation for Yom Kippur is very sad in some ways because you are asking for forgiveness.</span> <span id="s1697">This is all I heard, the oi oi oi.</span> <span id="s1698">Mama tried to explain to me.</span> <span id="s1699">I learned my Judiasm at that time on the run.</span> <span id="s1700">A little bit at a time.</span> <span id="s1701">Here, there a custom.</span> <span id="s1702">And that’s how I learned.</span> <span id="s1703">It was only later when I had access to books that I began to study what is all this Judaism about and I began to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">That Yom Kippur I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1705">To this day, when I go shopping away from home, the first place I go is to the kitchen sink and wash my hands.</span> <span id="s1706">And then I begin putting things away.</span> <span id="s1707">This is such an ingrained habit.</span> <span id="s1708">I have since learned that that was the quality, the custom in our heritage, that saved many people.</span> <span id="s1709">If you were observant of the hygienic laws—kosher isn’t just about food, it is about your personal hygiene as well—these good personal hygienic habits helped many people survive.</span> <span id="s1710">Whereas people who didn’t have a religious background and were in despair, they were hungry—they were the first to die of epidemics, of bad food, because they didn’t take the care that the more observant Jews did.</span> <span id="s1711">That was another way in my mind that I realized: this is a good custom, this is a nice thing that people do if they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1712">This is the way I slowly learned about my heritage.</span> <span id="s1713">Otherwise I was a total barbarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">This is the same period in Austria.</span> <span id="s1715">This is how they used to pose people, very artificially.</span> <span id="s1716">I remember my mother borrowed this dress for herself to send to her aunts in Houston.</span> <span id="s1717">She wanted them to see that we were healthy and we were kept and we were not disabled.</span> <span id="s1718">They had heard such awful stories and they didn’t know how we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">We lived in these camps a total of five years, between 1945 and 1950.</span> <span id="s1720">We were moved from Abelsberg to another camp in the same area, except that as the camps emptied when people started to Palestine, go to Australia, go to South Africa—wherever they got sponsored—the camps became smaller so they would move us to another camp for the space.</span> <span id="s1721">In the second camp, Mama and I had a room.</span> <span id="s1722">Everything was OK.</span> <span id="s1723">We waited and we waited.</span> <span id="s1724">Mama wouldn’t go any place or move anywhere or entertain any suggestions to emigrate until her husband would come home.</span> <span id="s1725">Everybody said, ‘Well, you know, if the Russians took him away in 1942, you are probably a widow and you might as well make arrangements.’</span> <span id="s1726">But Mama wouldn’t hear of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">One day in late afternoon Mama and I went to the village, because in the village was a little cinema.</span> <span id="s1728">And I loved films.</span> <span id="s1729">I couldn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s1730">They were American films with the horses running.</span> <span id="s1731">I couldn’t understand them but I loved the music.</span> <span id="s1732">So we went to the films.</span> <span id="s1733">And when we came back it was pretty dark in that hallway.</span> <span id="s1734">We felt safe because they were all the same refugees as we were, but still you had to be a little careful.</span> <span id="s1735">As we got up the steps to the second floor, Mama and I saw a kind of shadow of a man standing by our door.</span> <span id="s1736">I pulled back, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1737">Mama was startled, but she instantly recognized that it was my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">What can you say about a reunion like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">I was afraid to go near my father.</span> <span id="s1740">I had not seen him in six years.</span> <span id="s1741">And his head was shaved; his hair was just beginning to grow back.</span> <span id="s1742">His face was thin, malnourished, so he had a very scary look.</span> <span id="s1743">I didn’t recognize him at first.</span> <span id="s1744">My memory was very sketchy of him.</span> <span id="s1745">I was really a daddy’s girl before they took him away.</span> <span id="s1746">But I was sort of taken aback.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">This is a picture my father when he came back from a Russian prison camp, a slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s1748">His head was almost totally shaved so he was very self-conscious about it, and that’s why he’s wearing a hat.</span> <span id="s1749">But he was a very good looking man, and the Semitic feature are very pronounced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">He looked OK as far as clothing and he seemed clean and all.</span> <span id="s1751">But that shaved head scared me until finally when he spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1752">My nickname in Russian was Leda, Leditchka, which means little Leda.</span> <span id="s1753">Papa called me that, and that’s when the memories came back; that was his voice, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">In 1948 our family came together again.</span> <span id="s1755">As long as Papa was away, we were just sort of drifting, no resemblance to any kind to family life.</span> <span id="s1756">After Papa joined us, it was good.</span> <span id="s1757">The authorities of the camp wrote him up in the morning because he had to report to get his ration card.</span> <span id="s1758">When we started to make inquiries about immigrating to the U. S.—my mother had already started but everything was in limbo while she waited for her husband—they started to work on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Suddenly, everything came to a screeching halt.</span> <span id="s1760">We didn’t know this at the time and learned only much later on, but by 1948 the Cold War between Russia and America was on full force.</span> <span id="s1761">The Russians used to kidnap people to drag them back to the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s1762">So everybody who had any east European connections were afraid to go near them.</span> <span id="s1763">The office that handled us was known as OSS—later the CIA—these were people that were trained to be on the lookout because they didn’t want spies or saboteurs or war criminals to enter the United.</span> <span id="s1764">States.</span> <span id="s1765">So here is this man, yes, his wife is a bone fide refugee, and his little girl, but he has no papers.</span> <span id="s1766">No identity.</span> <span id="s1767">Nothing to tell them that he is who he says he is.</span> <span id="s1768">When the Russians finally released my father, they didn’t provide him with any sort of documentation.</span> <span id="s1769">It took constant talking and doing everything we could—taking numerous trips into Linz where we could see somebody official—no progress.</span> <span id="s1770">We didn’t know about a Cold War.</span> <span id="s1771">We only knew that suddenly we weren’t quite welcome with the Americans.</span> <span id="s1772">They felt that we might have ulterior motives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">One of the aunts in Houston that helped sponsor my parents had a son who had been drafted and ended up as a GI in Germany.</span> <span id="s1774">I remember that when Mama got a letter from Houston written in Yiddish from this aunt, she said, ‘Oh, good.</span> <span id="s1775">The son is stationed in Germany and he’s going to make every effort when he has some time off to come and visit us in the camp.</span> <span id="s1776">Because he speaks English and he’s a soldier, he will be ale to straighten out and make everyone understand who we are.’</span> <span id="s1777">The cousins name was Charles.</span> <span id="s1778">In Yiddish he was called Sudic.</span> <span id="s1779">We didn’t know him but we knew his name.</span> <span id="s1780">He came and all of our neighbors around were so impressed because here was a soldier with all the American insignia.</span> <span id="s1781">It was like the messiah had come, or at least a helper to the messiah.</span> <span id="s1782">So for several days, Charles (much to his credit) would go with my parents.</span> <span id="s1783">One time he went without my parents because he had to talk with somebody and he was told to come by himself and to bring everything that he had as far as our papers.</span> <span id="s1784">He went there and he spoke to whoever, and then he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">When we saw him coming back we thought, we’re on our way to America.</span> <span id="s1786">He sat down and again…language is so important.</span> <span id="s1787">He spoke some Yiddish but not enough to be coherent to any of us.</span> <span id="s1788">My parents understood.</span> <span id="s1789">Poor thing, he’s an America; he doesn’t speak other languages.</span> <span id="s1790">We managed.</span> <span id="s1791">He knew why he had gone there, and my parents wanted to know when we were getting on a ship.</span> <span id="s1792">Charles started to tell them in Yiddish as best he could that this is why and that’s why and this is missing and that’s missing and we have to get this paper and that document and so forth.</span> <span id="s1793">He kept referring to our case, the caseload that the officers had, and don’t forget that yours is only one of thousands of cases like yours.</span> <span id="s1794">Your case is going to come up on such and such a day.</span> <span id="s1795">At the end of his soliloquy, my father (who had a sense of humor that was funny but sort of gallows humor) says to my mother in Yiddish, ‘What is this idiot talking about?</span> <span id="s1796">I send him to get me to America.</span> <span id="s1797">He comes back and talks to me about food.’</span> <span id="s1798">We were all confused.</span> <span id="s1799">Why?</span> <span id="s1800">Because the word ‘case’ in English means what we all know.</span> <span id="s1801">But in German and in Yiddish it means ‘cheese.’</span> <span id="s1802">So every time cousin Charles would say, ‘Your case came up for this, your case came up in front of so-and-so, your case is one of many,’ all my father heard was ‘cheese.’</span> <span id="s1803">It was very frustrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">After a few days, Charles left to go back to his duties in Germany.</span> <span id="s1805">We were still glad to see him, he left us a lot of chewing gum, but that was again for me a sort of side lesson.</span> <span id="s1806">Again, all this conversation took place around me.</span> <span id="s1807">Charles didn’t report to me; he didn’t talk to me about it.</span> <span id="s1808">But I observed everything.</span> <span id="s1809">The language—our understanding hinged on one word.</span> <span id="s1810">Papa would not have been so aggravated and so disappointed if Charles had known to use another word, or had we understood English.</span> <span id="s1811">It was sort of like another flower was planted in my garden.</span> <span id="s1812">Language is very important.</span> <span id="s1813">I made a vow to myself that when I come to America—we still believed we were going—I have to master the language.</span> <span id="s1814">My cousin was talking about a case and my father thought he was talking about cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Now when I think about it, it’s laughable.</span> <span id="s1816">It was very frustrating at that time.</span> <span id="s1817">My father said, ‘I was in a Russian slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s1818">They don’t give you identity papers; they give you a number.’</span> <span id="s1819">The American officers themselves were at a disadvantage.</span> <span id="s1820">They were young, perhaps experiencing their first time abroad.</span> <span id="s1821">They weren’t used to what was going on.</span> <span id="s1822">Not until the aftermath of the second world war, no one had seen so many civilians, ordinary people who were refugees that were homeless and stateless.</span> <span id="s1823">The conversation had hung on one word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">By the summer of 1950 we were given the green light and went through a series of other holding camps.</span> <span id="s1825">We were in Salzburg for a few weeks, and then another camp, and finally we were sent by train to Bremen.</span> <span id="s1826">Bremen was the big port city in Germany where all the ships went to America.</span> <span id="s1827">We were in Bremen for two or three months during most of the warm weather, because when we got on the ship (remember we had no calendar) it was already cool; it was November.</span> <span id="s1828">We were on board a military ship used to transport GIs who were finishing their tour of duty.</span> <span id="s1829">These ships would be arranged so that one deck would be given over to refugees.</span> <span id="s1830">The rest of the ship was for us off limits and given to American sailors and personnel who were going home and changing their duties.</span> <span id="s1831">We had very little contact with them, and maybe under orders; they were removed from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">After weeks in Bremen, we finally got on the ship, and I remember it was cold.</span> <span id="s1833">The women and girls were sent to one side and men to the other side, reminiscent of Germany.</span> <span id="s1834">We were OK as long as we were with Americans.</span> <span id="s1835">It turned out that they had set up a sort of dormitory.</span> <span id="s1836">If you got by a wall, you had a bunk.</span> <span id="s1837">But if you were in the middle of the room you had a hammock.</span> <span id="s1838">My mother had a bunk and I had a hammock.</span> <span id="s1839">For hours there was only silence.</span> <span id="s1840">But eventually we heard the engines start up and we pulled away from the dock.</span> <span id="s1841">It was a bitter sweet moment.</span> <span id="s1842">For many of the refugees, especially German Jews, they were leaving their home forever, everything they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">It took several hours to make it out to open sea.</span> <span id="s1844">And I remember in the middle of the night there was some kind of commotion.</span> <span id="s1845">My mother started throwing up and then I did.</span> <span id="s1846">Everyone in the room was sea sick, really pitching.</span> <span id="s1847">I don’t know if the sailors had anticipated this, but we had never been on the sea, never even seen the sea.</span> <span id="s1848">I was sea sick for three days, my mother for much longer.</span> <span id="s1849">My father, too, was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">After a few days the sea quieted and we were allowed on deck to get some fresh air.</span> <span id="s1851">We had several days of calm.</span> <span id="s1852">Then we ran into a storm with very rough water.</span> <span id="s1853">Waves crashing over the deck.</span> <span id="s1854">They announced in several languages that we were to go below, so we all headed down to our room.</span> <span id="s1855">There was one man who was totally alone.</span> <span id="s1856">He spoke to no one.</span> <span id="s1857">No one knew his name or where he was from.</span> <span id="s1858">Perhaps he didn’t hear the announcement.</span> <span id="s1859">Perhaps he didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1860">But there was no one there to make sure he came down.</span> <span id="s1861">And tragically he was killed, thrown by a wave against one of the metal pipes on deck.</span> <span id="s1862">He was found the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">I will never forget that man.</span> <span id="s1864">Because of him I have a sort of eleventh commandment.</span> <span id="s1865">You cannot survive alone.</span> <span id="s1866">No one can.</span> <span id="s1867">We need a network of family and friends.</span> <span id="s1868">We need a community to survive.</span> <span id="s1869">I had learned that lesson earlier, though not as graphically.</span> <span id="s1870">My mother had been so focused on my father, she withdrew physically and emotionally from the people around her—fellow survivors, fellow Jews, fellow mothers.</span> <span id="s1871">She exhibited symptoms of depression.</span> <span id="s1872">I would overhear other women talking to her: ‘Hannah, you cannot give into this.</span> <span id="s1873">You must think of the child.’</span> <span id="s1874">But she erected this wall, even between the two of us.</span> <span id="s1875">That wall never really came down.</span> <span id="s1876">I had to hide my problems from her, keep them inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">If someone had known the man, if he had just one other person who looked after him, then he would not have died.</span> <span id="s1878">What a sad, lonely, tragic death after surviving the war.</span> <span id="s1879">I went to the man’s funeral because I wanted to see the flag.</span> <span id="s1880">I thought that when someone is buried at sea, the coffin and the flag would go into the sea together, and I thought that I would see the flag floating on the waves.</span> <span id="s1881">But of course the coffin slides from under the flag into the sea.</span> <span id="s1882">An elderly Jewish man took on the role of rabbi.</span> <span id="s1883">Perhaps he was a rabbi, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1884">But he chanted the prayer for the dead, the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s1885">And again, it became part of my understanding of my Jewish heritage.</span> <span id="s1886">I began to understand that being Jewish more than just being born from certain parents.</span> <span id="s1887">There was a culture, a religion, a set of rituals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Gradually the air felt warmer.</span> <span id="s1889">In fact we had not docked in New York so didn’t see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1890">Instead we sailed into the Gulf of Mexico.</span> <span id="s1891">We docked in New Orleans, since the passengers on the ship had been sponsored by Americans in the south of the U. S. .</span> <span id="s1892">We had been on the ship for fifteen days.</span> <span id="s1893">When we disembarked there were volunteers, perhaps from the local synagogue or Jewish relief services, handing out turkey sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1894">That night we were again served turkey, and when we got on the bus for Houston the next day, they gave us packages of turkey sandwiches to take with us.</span> <span id="s1895">My father, in his ironic humor, said: ‘Don’t these Americans eat anything but turkey?’</span> <span id="s1896">We had arrived on Thanksgiving Day, and of course they would serve us turkey that day and the next.</span> <span id="s1897">And you know, to this day, I always make sure I cook at least a turkey breast at Thanksgiving time, even though I don’t have family here.</span> <span id="s1898">It is a way of celebrating arriving in this country on Thanksgiving, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Chapter 3: In America Being an immigrant is a very lonely experience.</span> <span id="s1900">Most American don’t realize that.</span> <span id="s1901">Even if you are lucky enough to live in a city where there is another large group of immigrants with a similar background, still there is the complete cutting off from your own culture, your own customs, your language.</span> <span id="s1902">Everything must be learned anew.</span> <span id="s1903">Basic manners, how to speak on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1904">My parents and I rented our first flat.</span> <span id="s1905">We had three rooms (a bedroom, living room, kitchen), and a bathroom that we had to share with another tenant next door, a young couple.</span> <span id="s1906">Whenever we would go to bathe, we always took a can of ajax cleaner with us because the tub had to be scrubbed out, in our opinion, so that it would be hygienic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">When I was in school no one could pronounce Szklasz; the teacher couldn’t and the kids started to laugh.</span> <span id="s1908">I realized I had better shorten it in some way, so I changed it to Sklar, and that made it more pronounceable for Americans.</span> <span id="s1909">Every immigrant has to change if you want to acculturate.</span> <span id="s1910">America is much more open now.</span> <span id="s1911">But in 1950 in Houston, it was like, we’ve done it this way all the time and we’re going to do it again.</span> <span id="s1912">So on top of having to learn English English, I discovered in short order that I had to learn Texan English.</span> <span id="s1913">Of course, I could never master it.</span> <span id="s1914">To this day I am still learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Sunday was always a lonely day for my parents and me in the early fifties.</span> <span id="s1916">Sometimes on Sunday mornings we would have someone that would run by and have a cup of coffee because we lived by a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1917">These were fellow immigrants who had children; they would drop their child off for Sunday school, then they came by and visited us for coffee.</span> <span id="s1918">But it was not a regular thing so we couldn’t always have guests.</span> <span id="s1919">When we did it was like a mini-United Nations—a little Hungarian, a little Russian, Yiddish, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">But most of the time the Sundays were lonely because we only had each other.</span> <span id="s1921">If you get on well, fine.</span> <span id="s1922">If you have a good discussion and a good day and nobody is angry, fine.</span> <span id="s1923">If something is not pleasing and your parents are unhappy with you or you are unhappy with your parents, you are stuck with the three of you.</span> <span id="s1924">My parents and I did not have a vehicle for the first five years we lived in this country.</span> <span id="s1925">We couldn’t afford it, and my father felt it was an unnecessary luxury even if we had been able to save, and he wanted us to save money to buy furniture and buy eventually his own house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">So Sundays we were stuck.</span> <span id="s1927">We would go sometimes for long walks.</span> <span id="s1928">My father loved to walk, and very early on he made an observation that even on main thoroughfares, where there were plenty of cars going and coming, that a person could get killed and nobody would stop.</span> <span id="s1929">As I got to know American society more and more, I realized that to some extent that’s true.</span> <span id="s1930">People do get mugged and things happen, and not everyone stops to be a good Samaritan.</span> <span id="s1931">My father was very observant early on of the American way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Sometimes the relatives that had sponsored us would come to visit us Sunday evening, after they would do all their other stuff over the weekend.</span> <span id="s1933">They would drop by to see how we were.</span> <span id="s1934">Being that Sunday night was a school night, we would retire fairly early, I especially.</span> <span id="s1935">My bedroom was not a bedroom; I slept in the living room where a sofa unfolded.</span> <span id="s1936">With the hot climate of Texas and with no air conditioning in the early 1950s, naturally my night gown was very thin, and I was already a young girl.</span> <span id="s1937">So when these relatives would come, my parents (in gratitude for being sponsored to come to America, for the sake of comradeship, and because they were lonely) they turned on the lights and welcomed them.</span> <span id="s1938">I had to jump up from bed and get a covering and fold the bed up so there would be room to sit.</span> <span id="s1939">At first we took it as a sign of affection that they came to visit us, but after while what amazed us is that they didn’t come a little earlier.</span> <span id="s1940">Why didn’t they realize that we are so limited on what we could do on weekends?</span> <span id="s1941">Why don’t they ever come and take us for a ride?</span> <span id="s1942">But this was not the case.</span> <span id="s1943">They were not evil; they were just human, and that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">These were the early years as an immigrant.</span> <span id="s1945">As I got my sea legs in American society, my main concentration was being a student.</span> <span id="s1946">My parents, of course, immediately worked—my father from day one, my mother as soon as she could speak English.</span> <span id="s1947">She sold clothing in shops.</span> <span id="s1948">Everything in Houston in those days was on Main Street.</span> <span id="s1949">There were no shopping malls so it was easy for a foreigner to get a job.</span> <span id="s1950">You took a bus downtown and then you went from shop to shop until you found employment.</span> <span id="s1951">My father worked downtown at Sakowitz—the show place of retail in Houston; it was the Neiman Markus of Houston.</span> <span id="s1952">Sakowitz was his only employer in the United States; they were very fond of him and he worked for them all of his working life in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">My job was school.</span> <span id="s1954">My family and I saw our education, particularly my education, as important—just as important as my parents earning a living.</span> <span id="s1955">They had no illusions about their own lives, that they would be to some extent limited language-wise, education-wise, and in many ways.</span> <span id="s1956">But they certainly wanted me to benefit from coming to America.</span> <span id="s1957">My parents were probably in their mid- to late thirties.</span> <span id="s1958">They were young people.</span> <span id="s1959">They didn’t feel young.</span> <span id="s1960">They didn’t seem young to me.</span> <span id="s1961">But when I look at a portrait of my parents of their 25th wedding anniversary, I realize they were young people.</span> <span id="s1962">They were in the peak of their lives but had to concentrate on working and making sure that I had every opportunity to get an education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">By opportunity I don’t mean that there were outside benefits or help.</span> <span id="s1964">But I knew I could stay in school as long as I needed to.</span> <span id="s1965">I would graduate and not have to drop out as soon as I learned the language in order to work.</span> <span id="s1966">When I was a senior in high school, many of my friends were signing up for university; they were all going out of town.</span> <span id="s1967">My going out of town was out of the question.</span> <span id="s1968">There was no money for it.</span> <span id="s1969">Luckily there was the University of Houston, Rice University, St. Thomas University.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">When I entered my senior year, Papa and I had a dialogue, a conference about my plans.</span> <span id="s1971">What was I going to do after I graduated?</span> <span id="s1972">My parents were not exactly pushing me toward a college education because of the traditional outlook of Europeans—I was of marriageable age, I had plenty of boyfriends, dates and such that I would be eligible.</span> <span id="s1973">So they felt that I could marry.</span> <span id="s1974">I said I definitely wanted to go to college.</span> <span id="s1975">They said, OK, what’s the opportunity?</span> <span id="s1976">When I found all the data on what was involved, I came to my father (he took that interest…Mama would sit by and listen) and he said, ‘Here is the deal.</span> <span id="s1977">If you want to go to the University of Houston, go.</span> <span id="s1978">We’ll try and make it as comfortable for you as we can.</span> <span id="s1979">We’ll help with the tuition but you still have to work part time so that you can help finance this education.</span> <span id="s1980">You have a roof over your head by living at home, and whatever is in the refrigerator you can eat so you won’t go hungry.</span> <span id="s1981">That’s as much as I can help you.’</span> <span id="s1982">That seemed fine to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">After my first year of high school, which included P.E. and study hall, I realized that I didn’t need all that.</span> <span id="s1984">My father had gotten me a Saturday job at Sakowitz.</span> <span id="s1985">Then I found out that by requesting from the school that I be excused from P.E. and study hall, that I could leave school at 1:00 instead of 3:00, I could get on a bus and go to town and work practically half a day.</span> <span id="s1986">So this is what I did after my first year of high school and then into the university years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Once I was in college I also discovered that being a college woman and working downtown in a very fine store, I needed a wardrobe.</span> <span id="s1988">Beth Yeshurun synagogue, which is now in a very different part of Houston, was at that time fairly close to where we lived.</span> <span id="s1989">They needed Sunday-school teachers who knew some history, knew Hebrew, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1990">So I went and applied and was accepted.</span> <span id="s1991">Beth Yeshuran paid young teachers like me $30 per month.</span> <span id="s1992">And the month could have four Sundays or five Sundays, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1993">But from 9:00 to 12:30, half a day, you had to be at the synagogue with a classroom full of children and teach them something.</span> <span id="s1994">So I had a job for Sundays, part of the day.</span> <span id="s1995">That $30 was sacrosanct; it was holy because I used that money solely for a revolving charge account at Sakowitz, where I worked and got a discount on my wardrobe.</span> <span id="s1996">I bought myself the kind of clothes that would be presentable at school and on the floor where I worked.</span> <span id="s1997">I was fine with it; I was thrilled with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Those years were the most productive of my life.</span> <span id="s1999">When I look back on them, they were hard, they were long hours, they were fatiguing.</span> <span id="s2000">But you felt alive because you were accomplishing so much.</span> <span id="s2001">That’s how I felt.</span> <span id="s2002">My parents were glad of that because I didn’t complain or tire of it or say, ‘No, I want to go to football games or be able to visit a girlfriend now and then, or go swimming at a pool.’</span> <span id="s2003">I was fine with work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">The University of Houston at that time was a private school; it was not affiliated with the state system of colleges.</span> <span id="s2005">By living at home, my tuition ran $450 per semester.</span> <span id="s2006">This was in 1955.</span> <span id="s2007">If you calculate the value of money, it was an expensive education.</span> <span id="s2008">My books were extra.</span> <span id="s2009">If I was lucky I could get a used book; if not, I had to buy them new.</span> <span id="s2010">I graduated from high school in the summer of 1958—I immediately registered for summer school at the university.</span> <span id="s2011">By attending each summer, I graduated in three years in the summer of 1961.</span> <span id="s2012">I majored in political science and history.</span> <span id="s2013">I minored in English.</span> <span id="s2014">That was my college life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">I didn’t realize how much I was accomplishing until recent years when I heard about the drop-out rate of American students from high school and the failure rate of college students whose parents work hard to finance their education or who take on loans.</span> <span id="s2016">I looked on every expense of my semester as an investment.</span> <span id="s2017">When I went to class, I knew I had to study to absorb the information.</span> <span id="s2018">I had to understand it to pass the test because that was my dividend from my investment.</span> <span id="s2019">That’s how I thought of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">I graduated from college the end of summer of 1961.</span> <span id="s2021">I was married in August.</span> <span id="s2022">When I came back from my honeymoon I attended commencement.</span> <span id="s2023">We drove into Houston from Corpus Christi and my husband and parents saw me go up in my cap and gown, and I felt I had accomplished something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">When I joined my parents and my new bridegroom after I had returned my gown (I kept the tassel) it was time to leave.</span> <span id="s2025">My husband Danny said, ‘OK, now it’s time to go home and start cooking.’</span> <span id="s2026">I was fine with that.</span> <span id="s2027">I didn’t make an issue of it.</span> <span id="s2028">I felt, ‘You’re going to be disappointed because I don’t know how to cook.’</span> <span id="s2029">For my husband, who was a very traditional man, brought up in a very traditional home as well, and who was a little older than I, that was the way of married life in those days.</span> <span id="s2030">Unless (God forbid) you needed the paycheck to help your husband pay rent or buy food, a woman would go in and become a full-time homemaker in every sense, building a family and social life, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">That is how my education evolved and ended when I came to Corpus Christi after my wedding in August of 1961 and the beginning of married life.</span> <span id="s2032">When I was in school, I had only time for required reading.</span> <span id="s2033">Some of it was good, some of it was dull, some of it was totally unnecessary, but I did it.</span> <span id="s2034">I realized after I was free, now I can read for enjoyment, just pure pleasure.</span> <span id="s2035">I became addicted to books.</span> <span id="s2036">I have a wonderful library.</span> <span id="s2037">I invest a lot of money in buying my own books.</span> <span id="s2038">Some books are reference books in the way of histories or biographies, so I want to keep them for my own collection and some day I plan to give them to some institution.</span> <span id="s2039">I became an avid reader.</span> <span id="s2040">Sometimes it made my husband a little bit lonesome; I was about reading like some men are about football games.</span> <span id="s2041">He understood it; he was in a way very proud of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Even my mother-in-law was very proud of me.</span> <span id="s2043">She was a simple person; she came here as a young women.</span> <span id="s2044">She learned to read English.</span> <span id="s2045">Her education was the newspaper.</span> <span id="s2046">Every morning, when people left for work, she would read the paper from cover to cover.</span> <span id="s2047">When I came into the picture, she was many times embarrassed or felt awkward about not really understanding deeper issues because her education was limited.</span> <span id="s2048">But she was a bright lady.</span> <span id="s2049">We had coffee every morning for the first year of my married life.</span> <span id="s2050">I’d drop off my husband (he would ride to the family business with his father to leave me the car) and I would stay for coffee.</span> <span id="s2051">She would cut out articles.</span> <span id="s2052">Sometimes she knew certain articles were important but she didn’t fully understand them.</span> <span id="s2053">They might be political or historical.</span> <span id="s2054">She was too embarrassed to ask her own children; they didn’t understand that when you didn’t have a formal education you didn’t understand every nuance, and language, and so on.</span> <span id="s2055">She and I had this little secret pact that she would save articles and over coffee in the morning she would say, ‘Now Leah, this is about Israel, or this is about what Congress is doing, or this is about the president, but what does it really mean?’</span> <span id="s2056">Then I would read it and we would converse in Yiddish and I would explain to her the inner workings of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">For the first ten years of my married life, my in-laws had all of us over for Friday night Shabbat dinner.</span> <span id="s2058">There would be conversation at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s2059">My mother-in-law was so proud of herself because she was able to take part in the conversation.</span> <span id="s2060">Sometimes she would argue with my father-in-law because he would say, ‘This is how it is going to be like’ or ‘This is who we should vote for.’</span> <span id="s2061">She would say, “No, no, no, that’s not it.’</span> <span id="s2062">And my father-in-law would sit with eyes wide open and would be amused or surprised that she knew this.</span> <span id="s2063">She knew it because she and I sort of helped each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">It was a reciprocal thing.</span> <span id="s2065">I helped her understand some issues in depth, and she by example taught me to become a home maker because I knew nothing of cooking.</span> <span id="s2066">The first two or three months of our married life, my hands looked like I was a veteran of a war.</span> <span id="s2067">My hands were cut and they were burned and they were skinned.</span> <span id="s2068">If you don’t know your way around the kitchen you are accident-prone.</span> <span id="s2069">My mother-in-law taught me these skills and I, in turn, would help her understand the deeper meanings of certain issues in English that she couldn’t quite grasp.</span> <span id="s2070">We had a good relationship.</span> <span id="s2071">My husband worked for his family, and it is a given that mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws don’t get on.</span> <span id="s2072">But we did.</span> <span id="s2073">There were times I had to make sure there were certain boundaries that they understood, but all-in-all my in-laws and I got along very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Life went on.</span> <span id="s2075">I had two children, a son and daughter.</span> <span id="s2076">I have five grandchildren now.</span> <span id="s2077">I’m a matriarch.</span> <span id="s2078">Isn’t that crazy?</span> <span id="s2079">Throughout my high-school days, my college days—from the time I was here and I was growing into an adult and I had responsibilities, the responsibilities were not only to myself.</span> <span id="s2080">This is very common among all survivor families—we don’t always realize it.</span> <span id="s2081">We tended to be very protective of our parents.</span> <span id="s2082">And we tended to be very involved not only in building our own lives but helping them get pleasure from our lives.</span> <span id="s2083">There is a certain word in Yiddish—nakhes.</span> <span id="s2084">Nakhes.</span> <span id="s2085">I’ve heard it translated as the pleasure you feel when you see your first grandchild take his first step.</span> <span id="s2086">That special pleasure.</span> <span id="s2087">We survivors, especially those who were young enough and survived with our families, we tended to want to give them this—I don’t think there was a movement or an organization—it was simply a trend that many of us felt.</span> <span id="s2088">It was not discouraged by the older generation.</span> <span id="s2089">Whenever I reached a landmark in my education, graduating from high school, entering college, and so forth, my parents always said, ‘We’re so proud of you because we feel that God has been special to us.</span> <span id="s2090">It isn’t just that we survived but we have this pleasure of seeing you flourish.’</span> <span id="s2091">So many of us—and I’ve talked to people with my background from Toronto, Canada to Australia—we realized we had the same values concerning our families.</span> <span id="s2092">Very protective of our parents.</span> <span id="s2093">When you see your parents abused, threatened, brutalized, and you are a child, you can’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s2094">You can’t help them.</span> <span id="s2095">You can’t protect them.</span> <span id="s2096">Giving them back something, repaying them for that terror, that was up to us when we grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">This is a picture of my son’s bar mitzvah with my father, my father-in-law, and my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">In most Holocaust families, children who managed also to survive, and even those who were born right after the war, I think many of us had this attitude.</span> <span id="s2099">When I had my children, it was a big deal.</span> <span id="s2100">Not just in the usual sense but even more so.</span> <span id="s2101">When I see the generations who are in this picture, with the new generation being my son—that was the bonus of my survival.</span> <span id="s2102">When they finally saw my children (they didn’t live to see my grandchildren)….</span> <span id="s2103">we made a trip to Houston every month for a weekend.</span> <span id="s2104">My husband was very nice about it; I wanted my parents to know the grandchildren as well as did the grandparents in Corpus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">We planned a trip to Israel when Gary was six and Naomi was nine.</span> <span id="s2106">We were due to leave late September of 1973.</span> <span id="s2107">We were here for Yom Kippur when the temple was on Craig Street—Temple Emmanuel.</span> <span id="s2108">It is now a Texas landmark.</span> <span id="s2109">But when we went to services, the Rabbi announced the Yom Kippur War from the pulpit.</span> <span id="s2110">Sitting in services, I remember just being so enraged and I whispered to Danny, ‘They may have ruined Simchat Torah, because we were going there for the rest of the high holy day celebrations.</span> <span id="s2111">But they are not going to ruin my birthday.</span> <span id="s2112">I’m going to re-book us for January of ’74.’</span> <span id="s2113">And I did.</span> <span id="s2114">And we went in January of 1974 when they were still fighting over the Golan Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">This is our passport photo for the trip to Israel.</span> <span id="s2116">In those days you could take a group photo instead of individual ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Life was fulfilling.</span> <span id="s2118">Life is fulfilling.</span> <span id="s2119">My main volunteer effort since I’ve lived in Corpus Christi has been confined to being involved and helping the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2120">That gives me a lot of satisfaction.</span> <span id="s2121">That’s life to me.</span> <span id="s2122">Life to me, to my parents and people like us—life has been a gift.</span> <span id="s2123">Is a gift.</span> <span id="s2124">I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s2125">I’ve had my ups and downs, illness, losses of family members and friends.</span> <span id="s2126">But on the whole, I still feel very very lucky.</span> <span id="s2127">I have been allowed (and my parents were thankfully allowed) to live out our lives in a normal way.</span> <span id="s2128">When I reached my fiftieth birthday, I woke up—usually women think, I’m getting older, how awful.</span> <span id="s2129">I didn’t feel that way.</span> <span id="s2130">The first thing that struck me was: I have already outlived the life-span of both my grandmothers.</span> <span id="s2131">They were under fifty when they were murdered by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2132">To have longevity in that sense, to live out your normal life span of whatever God gives you, is very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">We didn’t talk about our experience when we first came.</span> <span id="s2134">Everybody said, don’t talk about it, don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s2135">It will only depress you.</span> <span id="s2136">One time my family was invited to one of the uncle’s homes.</span> <span id="s2137">He had come to this country at the turn of the century when he was seventeen years-old, so he was a Texan and had lived here during the Second World War.</span> <span id="s2138">It was a special Shabbat; they had invited other people.</span> <span id="s2139">And someone asked my mother, ‘Was it really so bad, the stories of starvation?’</span> <span id="s2140">Before my mother could even respond, her uncle, the host, across the table, said, ‘Hannah, don’t complain.</span> <span id="s2141">We also suffered in America.</span> <span id="s2142">We couldn’t get any beef.</span> <span id="s2143">We didn’t have any roasts or steaks and had to eat chicken.</span> <span id="s2144">We could not go on vacations because petrol was rationed and we couldn’t buy tires for the cars, so we couldn’t take any trips.’</span> <span id="s2145">We were sitting there, and the three of us were suddenly very quiet.</span> <span id="s2146">And we realized, even I, there’s no point in talking.</span> <span id="s2147">These people don’t understand.</span> <span id="s2148">They can’t imagine it.</span> <span id="s2149">So we didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2150">The general climate throughout the early years was don’t talk about it, it is unpleasant, it will depress you and other people.</span> <span id="s2151">You’d be better off if you don’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">The times were already changing by our bicentennial—1976.</span> <span id="s2153">Everyone in those days was eager to add to the tree of America their own branch of where they had come from—how they added to the tree of America.</span> <span id="s2154">The television program Roots was about the black slave experience; it was very moving.</span> <span id="s2155">The Jewish Community Council got a call from Ray High School that they needed somebody to come and speak to the students about the Jewish community in Corpus Christi and, if possible, the Jewish immigrant experience in America.</span> <span id="s2156">Nobody else was available and the director said, ‘Take this.</span> <span id="s2157">I haven’t the energy to start calling and giving people a script.</span> <span id="s2158">Go to the school and talk to them.’</span> <span id="s2159">Driving to the school, I started thinking, What do I do?</span> <span id="s2160">I didn’t get off the Mayflower.</span> <span id="s2161">How do I try to make American teenagers understand how I am a part of the American tree, because my roots were not as deep as the others.</span> <span id="s2162">I didn’t know what else to do, so I told them my story.</span> <span id="s2163">It was like a flood.</span> <span id="s2164">Corpus Christi is a small community; word got around.</span> <span id="s2165">Teachers and church groups and Kiwanis and Rotarians heard about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">I’ve been doing this kind of work every since 1976.</span> <span id="s2167">That year was so full of celebration, and everyone suddenly realized that the United States didn’t just plunk down from the planet Mars.</span> <span id="s2168">It took so many people and their sacrifices and all peoples of the world to make this country.</span> <span id="s2169">The word got around about me, and ever since then I have been invited to many group, not only to speak on Holocaust information.</span> <span id="s2170">One time I gave a seminar for four or five Sundays at the United Methodist Church on Jewish History going back to Biblical times.</span> <span id="s2171">The reason I remember that particular assignment was because the last Sunday that I was finishing up, that was the weekend Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.</span> <span id="s2172">Of course it was very much on everyone’s mind.</span> <span id="s2173">It brought all of us back to when John Kennedy was assassinated.</span> <span id="s2174">And when I came, the people were very gracious and said, ‘You know, we would have understood if you had chosen not to come.’</span> <span id="s2175">And I said ‘No, this is something I wanted to finish and I need to speak to you about it and it’s fine.’</span> <span id="s2176">So I finished that assignment and we spoke of Israel and the dream of safety for Jews—that’s what Israel represents.</span> <span id="s2177">It was the same Sunday that their beautiful Statue on Shoreline was dedicated.</span> <span id="s2178">This is the kind of exposure Corpus has given me and I to Corpus Christi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">It has been beneficial on both sides.</span> <span id="s2180">It did allow me to finally be able to talk about the past without crying.</span> <span id="s2181">Before that time, whenever something came up, it was difficult because you choked up and you can’t give information when you get so emotional.</span> <span id="s2182">Teachers tell me that of all the courses of study—there is so much more information now, films, books, television—students relate to the Holocaust more than they can relate to the Civil War, which was a very horrendous catastrophe for the United States.</span> <span id="s2183">But it’s far removed in years.</span> <span id="s2184">They can’t relate to a soldier at the battle front unless they have someone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">But you show them evidence and you can say, I was there.</span> <span id="s2186">I was one of these herded individuals that was pushed and driven and taken without any control of my own life to any camp.</span> <span id="s2187">I always lived in camps.</span> <span id="s2188">Until I got on the ship at the age of fourteen in Bremen, Germany in 1950, we always lived in some kind of compound.</span> <span id="s2189">It was always some kind of communal living.</span> <span id="s2190">It was not by choice but by necessity.</span> <span id="s2191">And it was always under control, first the German control, then the Russian control.</span> <span id="s2192">In Siberia we weren’t behind barbed wire but we were certainly under Stalinist control.</span> <span id="s2193">And then in the DP camps in Austria and southern Germany where we lived, there were separate camps for Jewish refugees versus other nationals.</span> <span id="s2194">The reason why the Jewish camps were separate was because many other people who considered themselves victims of the Nazis, and certainly they had lost their homelands and were homeless, many of them had collaborated with the Nazis in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2195">The authorities were afraid to put other groups and Jews in the same camps.</span> <span id="s2196">So Jewish camps were separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Until the age of fourteen, I lived in some sort of communal, separate, controlled housing situation.</span> <span id="s2198">What that does to you, it gives you a lot of self control.</span> <span id="s2199">You live in very limited space.</span> <span id="s2200">You have to make sure your things are not stolen or drift away.</span> <span id="s2201">You have to make sure you are not imposing on other people because that will make you a nuisance.</span> <span id="s2202">You have to be able to stand up for your rights so nobody imposes on your turf, so to speak.</span> <span id="s2203">It molded, in sense, who I am, and that’s the effect it had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">This is what American students understand best when they study the story of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2205">When they see a film like The Bridge on the River Kwai—I loved the film, I love the acting, I love the music especially.</span> <span id="s2206">But the entire film was terribly resented in Britain and in Australia and the Commonwealth countries.</span> <span id="s2207">The camp life for prisoners of war depicted in the Pacific theater was accurate.</span> <span id="s2208">But the entire story of that bridge and the fact that someone made it extra strong to show how special British prisoners and soldiers could be, and the fact that someone risked their lives and blew up the bridge, that is a fabrication—the bridge is there.</span> <span id="s2209">The soldiers, the slaves that were working on it, in constructing it, went through great suffering, and died on every yard of that bridge that was built on the River Kwai.</span> <span id="s2210">I don’t remember if there were any protests in this country about the authenticity of the story.</span> <span id="s2211">But in Britain and in Canada, in Australia, in many Commonwealth countries where the British came from who were in the Pacific theater and were prisoners of war, people very much resented this film.</span> <span id="s2212">It’s like a fairy tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">That’s another reason why I do what I do.</span> <span id="s2214">History can too easily be changed.</span> <span id="s2215">If it’s done in a dramatic way, if it’s written in a very powerful way, it becomes believable.</span> <span id="s2216">Schindler’s List is another example.</span> <span id="s2217">Schindler’s List is true, it happened.</span> <span id="s2218">Perhaps toward the end Mr. Schindler was touched and realized what he had helped do—he saved people.</span> <span id="s2219">But he started out as a profiteer, as a speculator.</span> <span id="s2220">He only became human at the very end, when suddenly he was on the wrong side because he was German and his credentials were questionable.</span> <span id="s2221">He was very grateful that many of the Jews he helped save came forward and testified to that fact.</span> <span id="s2222">He counted on an annual vacation to Israel to be among friends.</span> <span id="s2223">Yes, history can sometimes be invented as it was in The Bridge on the River Kwai, or it can be changed.</span> <span id="s2224">I think that the film Schindler’s List tries to stay as true to life as possible because he’s not pictured as a angel with wings.</span> <span id="s2225">He’s pictured as an opportunist in fact, and this is what he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">This is what American young people, and maybe older people as well, can relate to.</span> <span id="s2227">My mission, if you will—it is a mission because my going to visit schools and churches and wherever else I’m invited to speak—has become a moral imperative.</span> <span id="s2228">I don’t do it as a job.</span> <span id="s2229">I don’t get paid for this.</span> <span id="s2230">I do get flowers occasionally from the schools I visit and sometimes beautiful thank-you notes which I’ve saved over the years.</span> <span id="s2231">Beyond that, it is a moral imperative for me.</span> <span id="s2232">I live in a small community and there were very few survivor families who settled here.</span> <span id="s2233">Of those that did settle, many left because they couldn’t make a living here, or they wanted a more Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s2234">Those that stayed became old and are now frail and not healthy and cannot go out.</span> <span id="s2235">All of them, including myself, have always been self-conscious about standing in front of a group and speaking because of their limited English.</span> <span id="s2236">It cannot be helped, it’s the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Here I am living in a community like Corpus Christi and I have this unusual background, and I’m alive and kicking.</span> <span id="s2238">I was lucky enough to get an American education and become conversant in English.</span> <span id="s2239">Wouldn’t it be a shame if I sat back and said, ‘I don’t have time for this,’ or ‘It’s not convenient today’ or ‘I’d rather not, it’s too private, it’s too personal.’</span> <span id="s2240">I don’t want people to look at me as a victim.</span> <span id="s2241">That’s very important.</span> <span id="s2242">It would morally be very irresponsible of me, as a Jewish person, given my luck, my benefits, my survival, if I didn’t do what I’m doing.</span> <span id="s2243">And that’s why I’m doing it.</span> <span id="s2244">On top of that, it’s like fate.</span> <span id="s2245">If you go to Houston, if you go to Toronto, if you go to New York, Boston—cities that have a larger Jewish community, then there are other people, or sometimes the second general, the children of survivors, who go out to speak to schools.</span> <span id="s2246">But in Corpus Christi, I’m it.</span> <span id="s2247">I’m not burdened by it.</span> <span id="s2248">I’m honored by it.</span> <span id="s2249">I’ve never turned down an assignment except an invitation from Hondo, Texas, when I didn’t have anyone to drive me.</span> <span id="s2250">But I’ve had small groups of students from smaller communities who get on their school buses and they come to the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s2251">We welcome them, give them cookies and punch and give them a history lesson.</span> <span id="s2252">This is what I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Sometimes it is personally inconvenient.</span> <span id="s2254">But I make it my business to be available and to go.</span> <span id="s2255">My visits to every school and every group and every church I’ve visited, without exception, I have been well received.</span> <span id="s2256">People are so gracious and interested in a broader view because I speak not only of the Holocaust history of my own life but I can speak about why Jews support Israel , why it is so important for an Israel to be there.</span> <span id="s2257">I can speak to biblical history and how Judaism started, the beginnings of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s2258">These are all very inter-related subjects.</span> <span id="s2259">Why did Hitler find it so easy to brainwash countries, not only Germany but Austria was an accomplice and other fascist countries.</span> <span id="s2260">Why was it so easy?</span> <span id="s2261">You take two thousand years of Christians who went to church and by and large would hear the teaching that Jews were Christ killers.</span> <span id="s2262">I’m sad to say that in some churches, that view still goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">The Christian community, in a sense—I’m talking of the beginning of Christianity—by building a following, they had to separate themselves from anything Jewish.</span> <span id="s2264">My parents told me, every Sunday after church in their towns, sometimes people were afraid to leave the house.</span> <span id="s2265">Many priests were very much of the old school.</span> <span id="s2266">They taught their flocks what they were taught as children.</span> <span id="s2267">And this went on for generations.</span> <span id="s2268">Sunday was not always a comfortable day for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2269">Easter time was a dangerous time in every small town in Europe, not just in Poland, for obvious reasons.</span> <span id="s2270">Just like a politician can be truthful and honest and forthright, so can padres.</span> <span id="s2271">But sometimes they put their own spin on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">The religious history of Christians prepared the world for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2273">In the past fifty years, thank God, Christian leaders and theologians have realized this and are now revising their own history.</span> <span id="s2274">The separation of Jew and Christian happened a long time after the time of Christ.</span> <span id="s2275">But they didn’t bother to say that.</span> <span id="s2276">I read a book about Jesus as a person at the time of the Roman Empire—written by a minister.</span> <span id="s2277">He said that he understands where anti-Semitism came from.</span> <span id="s2278">He once opened a Sunday-school book that said: ‘And Jesus was a good Christian boy, because he’d go to church every Sunday.’</span> <span id="s2279">And of course, any educator, any historian who has read bible history, would know that Jesus was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2280">He lived as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2281">He objected to the system of his day as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2282">He died as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2283">It was only much later generations that his followers changed the tone—mainly Paul.</span> <span id="s2284">What passes now for Christianity is not the word, but it’s more the word of Paul, who preached vehemently because he wanted to build up a following.</span> <span id="s2285">And he succeeded.</span> <span id="s2286">That is why, after two thousand years, a civilized country like Germany was ready and willing to kill the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">November 8th and 9th are the anniversary days of Kristallnacht, the date when the Holocaust began.</span> <span id="s2288">That happened in 1938.</span> <span id="s2289">This was when Nazi party people went in a very coordinated fashion and looted and burned synagogues and Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s2290">The police, the normal German police that patrolled streets, stood by with their arms folded and looked on.</span> <span id="s2291">In a normal situation when there are vandals, a policeman steps in to try to stop it.</span> <span id="s2292">But Kristallnacht was so coordinated that your ordinary German policeman knew, and probably his sympathies were with the crowd, so hands off.</span> <span id="s2293">This is why I studied history because so much had happened to us and we didn’t have dates, we didn’t have books, we didn’t have information.</span> <span id="s2294">We were totally in the dark.</span> <span id="s2295">And it was only after some sense of normalcy that I became aware of a calendar of time, of where I was when.</span> <span id="s2296">And then it’s like backtracking to find out where you came from and why did this happen to you, and how it could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">My most important travel happened five years ago.</span> <span id="s2298">I had sworn to my family, and had felt it myself, for fifty years almost, I would never never go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s2299">I would never stand on European soil because to me it is soaked with Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s2300">But at a point in my life—my husband had died two years before, my children were grown—and someone started to talk about travel and where would you go.</span> <span id="s2301">I have no desire to Vegas or Disneyland or any place like that.</span> <span id="s2302">I’ve been to Israel.</span> <span id="s2303">Where to go?</span> <span id="s2304">And I suddenly felt that since I left Europe under such circumstances, at this stage in my life (as I was becoming a senior citizen) I needed to complete my circle.</span> <span id="s2305">I signed up with a group out of Houston from a synagogue led by Rabbi David Rose.</span> <span id="s2306">He and his wife took this group on what was called the Jewish Heritage tour.</span> <span id="s2307">We were landing in Warsaw and we would be in Poland, Czechoslovakia, we would be in Hungary, we would be in Austria—eastern Europe—because this is where the huge Jewish communities were located.</span> <span id="s2308">It was a small group.</span> <span id="s2309">I called up some people that I knew and asked, ‘Do you think I would be welcome to tag along,’ because I was the only one from here.</span> <span id="s2310">And they said, ‘Sure, as long as you have the money, you go!’</span> <span id="s2311">So I signed up and I went.</span> <span id="s2312">I met the group in Houston—they all knew each other—we had mutual acquaintances but I didn’t know the individuals I was going with.</span> <span id="s2313">They were middle-aged people, senior people; there were two couples who had been academics and were retired.</span> <span id="s2314">It was a small enough group and we became like a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">All arrangements were made through a Houston travel agent, so I had nothing else to do but go.</span> <span id="s2316">We boarded the plane operated by Lufthansa airlines.</span> <span id="s2317">As in all overseas flights, when you are going to Europe you leave late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2318">That way you land in Europe early in the morning.</span> <span id="s2319">We got comfortable.</span> <span id="s2320">We were all scattered throughout the plane.</span> <span id="s2321">After we reached a certain altitude, we were approached by our flight attendant, a very beautiful young lady, blond, tall, Germanic.</span> <span id="s2322">She was taking our orders for dinner.</span> <span id="s2323">She had a clipboard and came down the aisle.</span> <span id="s2324">She said, ‘Mrs. Goltzman, I have you down for a kosher dinner.’</span> <span id="s2325">I said, ‘Fine.’</span> <span id="s2326">My seat-mate next to me was an elderly lady who was going to Rome to visit all the Catholic shrines, also on a religious tour.</span> <span id="s2327">When she heard that I was getting kosher, she said, ‘I want kosher.’</span> <span id="s2328">The attendant said, ‘We don’t have you down for kosher and we only ordered a certain number of plates.’</span> <span id="s2329">My food comes, my seat-mate’s food comes.</span> <span id="s2330">We compare; she loves my dinner.</span> <span id="s2331">And I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2332">I felt almost guilty because she was so envious of my plate.</span> <span id="s2333">It was a good meal—the transatlantic meals are good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">I ate, finished up, then the attendants came and took away the trays.</span> <span id="s2335">And in fact the attendant specifically asked me if my meal was satisfactory and was it tasty.</span> <span id="s2336">I said, ‘Yes it is.</span> <span id="s2337">It’s very good.</span> <span id="s2338">Kosher food is generally very good.’</span> <span id="s2339">She said, ‘Yes, I know, but this is the first time we have used this particular vendor for their kosher meals, and we want to make sure we’re giving our Jewish passengers the best that is available.’</span> <span id="s2340">And that’s why she was checking whether my meal was satisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">We started to get comfortable for the night.</span> <span id="s2342">And I sat there and I thought to myself: When I was a kid I had feelings of rage.</span> <span id="s2343">I wanted revenge.</span> <span id="s2344">I wanted somebody to pay for what we had gone through.</span> <span id="s2345">I was angry.</span> <span id="s2346">But I never heard from any rabbi or any teacher, from any person I considered a leader in Jewish life, say, ‘Strap on a bomb and kill your enemy and kill yourself.’</span> <span id="s2347">This is not the kind of revenge I wanted.</span> <span id="s2348">I suddenly realized that having a kosher meal on Lufthansa airlines was my revenge.</span> <span id="s2349">And it was sweet.</span> <span id="s2350">For the rest of the night I drifted in and out of sleep.</span> <span id="s2351">I’m not a good sleeper when I travel.</span> <span id="s2352">I’m too curious and want to see everything—the view and the clouds.</span> <span id="s2353">Throughout the night I thought to myself, ‘These people around me.</span> <span id="s2354">They don’t know who I am.</span> <span id="s2355">They don’t know my history.</span> <span id="s2356">Here I am, this older lady, this mature lady, a grandmother, who is an American citizen, who didn’t make these flight arrangements.</span> <span id="s2357">I have this history and now I am being served respectfully, graciously, on the Lufthansa airline a kosher dinner.’</span> <span id="s2358">It never ceases to amaze me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">I think that’s why people should always live with hope.</span> <span id="s2360">It’s not that I ever hoped or knew that the moment would come.</span> <span id="s2361">But I do remember that in the worst of times, my parents kept saying, ‘It will get better.</span> <span id="s2362">It has to get better.</span> <span id="s2363">The war will end.</span> <span id="s2364">Things will change.</span> <span id="s2365">Wait and see.</span> <span id="s2366">Don’t give up.</span> <span id="s2367">They said it to themselves, they said it to other people, they said it to me.</span> <span id="s2368">And I was raised on that kind of thinking.</span> <span id="s2369">And I had my kosher meal on Lufthansa.</span> <span id="s2370">Coming back (it was a two-week trip) it was the same.</span> <span id="s2371">Again it was a kosher meal.</span> <span id="s2372">No one raised an eyebrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">That was my focal point.</span> <span id="s2374">The trip itself had sad moments.</span> <span id="s2375">I visited cities that I was familiar with—Budapest was the only city I had never been to.</span> <span id="s2376">They are beautiful cities and they have much in architecture and much in history.</span> <span id="s2377">But the fact that all of these cities had huge Jewish populations and now do not—it was remarkable.</span> <span id="s2378">I was in one or two synagogues that are still functioning as synagogues for a few elderly people like the one in Budapest.</span> <span id="s2379">But most synagogues that have survived are buildings used for other purposes or are being displayed as museums for the tourists—museums of a by-gone culture of people like the ancient Mayans, a culture that is no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Today the largest Jewish community is in Germany.</span> <span id="s2381">Many Soviet Jews who were allowed to leave the U. S. S. R. chose to stay in Europe, especially in Germany, because many speak Yiddish so they are comfortable with German, so the transition is not that great.</span> <span id="s2382">In every Jewish periodical—the B’nai B’rith, the Hadassah magazine, any kind of publication—Germany runs big adds: please return to your homeland, because they are inviting back Jews that were Germans, or their descendents, to come and claim their German citizenship.</span> <span id="s2383">That’s how things have changed.</span> <span id="s2384">This is now a standard campaign.</span> <span id="s2385">They want the Jewish community to come back.</span> <span id="s2386">In recent years a Holocaust museum was opened in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2387">In fact the same architect that had been involved in the Ground Zero Memorial in New York—Daniel Libeskind—was the architect for the Berlin Holocaust Memorial.</span> <span id="s2388">Life is indeed a circle.</span> <span id="s2389">It comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">It’s ironic—I’m not saying this lightly, but it is the truth—most European countries, Germany, France, Italy, who had huge Jewish communities and destroyed them—now have huge Muslim communities that they find very troubling because Muslim groups tend to not assimilate or acculturate into the various countries where they have become citizens.</span> <span id="s2391">The Turks have a large population in Germany because they were invited workers in the 70s.</span> <span id="s2392">The German economy needed them.</span> <span id="s2393">Now they have children who grew up there, who speak German, who are German in every way.</span> <span id="s2394">But still and all, they do not acculturate as Germany would like.</span> <span id="s2395">It is a social problem, it is a political problem, because it’s like when we have groups of people in the United States, who choose not to learn English, who demand that they be able to conduct their daily lives in their own mother language, who wear a veil.</span> <span id="s2396">The headdress is a particular issue.</span> <span id="s2397">If some people only show their eyes, then normal identification in a busy, populated society, is impossible.</span> <span id="s2398">Wherever you go, for the sake of security, you have to have a picture identification.</span> <span id="s2399">It’s a security issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Jewish people are taught in the Talmud that not only do you observe Jewish traditions and laws, but you must be a good citizen, to pay your taxes, to not commit crimes, to not do anything against the society you live in.</span> <span id="s2401">Not every group has part of that built-in understanding.</span> <span id="s2402">Part of Judaism is that no matter where we live—and Jews are a very international people—we tend to rise because we always make sure our children get an education.</span> <span id="s2403">We try to better ourselves economically.</span> <span id="s2404">We try to help in the community that we live in.</span> <span id="s2405">You take Corpus Christi.</span> <span id="s2406">We have now only 300 families, more or less, and some of our families are not that involved in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2407">If you go to the police blotters, if you go to any legal entity, check tax records, Jewish people by and large have always been law-biding citizens and have been contributing members of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">I’m rather proud of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s2409">The evidence is there.</span> <span id="s2410">It can’t be refuted.</span> <span id="s2411">It can’t be watered down.</span> <span id="s2412">This is why I do what I do because history can get distorted and watered down.</span> <span id="s2413">And it is.</span> <span id="s2414">And knowledge can be skewed one way or another.</span> <span id="s2415">I heard an interesting talk on public radio the other day.</span> <span id="s2416">They were playing Gustav Mahler who was an Austrian Jew, a very fine composer.</span> <span id="s2417">The commentator was saying that in his music, Mahler was moved by Christianity.</span> <span id="s2418">Right there, I would have screamed at that man, ‘Know your history!’</span> <span id="s2419">Mahler was an assimilated Jew.</span> <span id="s2420">He was not involved in religious community affairs.</span> <span id="s2421">But when he wanted to become the director of the Vienna Symphony, he had to convert to Christianity and get a baptismal certificate before he got his job.</span> <span id="s2422">This is a matter of history.</span> <span id="s2423">But here on the radio, someone who expounds on Gustav Mahler is telling me a lie.</span> <span id="s2424">Call me crazy, but I tend to remember history.</span> <span id="s2425">And this person is just talking, but many people are listening.</span> <span id="s2426">They will say, ‘You know it’s true.</span> <span id="s2427">Listen to Gustav Mahler.</span> <span id="s2428">His lofty music was moved by his connection to Christianity.’</span> <span id="s2429">This is what Judaic studies are all about.</span> <span id="s2430">This is what Holocaust studies are all about.</span> <span id="s2431">It’s all about being an educated person.</span> <span id="s2432">Thankfully, Christian theologians and scholars now are coming to terms with the history of Christianity and its origins.</span> <span id="s2433">This is what my life is all about.</span> <span id="s2434">It feels good to be part of a community in Corpus and of the Jewish community, it feels great to be able to help.</span> <span id="s2435">I’ve only been able to do it because I was young enough when I came to America to get my education.</span> <span id="s2436">Deep down, I still have many European habits, I know this.</span> <span id="s2437">Otherwise, I’m an American.</span> <span id="s2438">Certainly when I travel and I show my American passport, I feel so special.</span> <span id="s2439">There are so many people, Americans, who should know better.</span> <span id="s2440">They slam America.</span> <span id="s2441">They criticize.</span> <span id="s2442">They are contemptuous of what is American.</span> <span id="s2443">I can’t even begin to understand why.</span> <span id="s2444">I guess you can’t learn about another kind of life by being a tourist.</span> <span id="s2445">You don’t live in a country or want to absorb what goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">I think that every person, every young person, has to understand that without an education, they will go nowhere.</span> <span id="s2447">Their outlook and their potential will always be limited.</span> <span id="s2448">The more industrial we become, the more the world changes, the more these limitations appear.</span> <span id="s2449">It used to be sufficient to get a high school diploma, and you could get employment for life.</span> <span id="s2450">It used to be sufficient to have a college degree and have some sort of position in life.</span> <span id="s2451">That is not enough anymore.</span> <span id="s2452">I’m not talking about just formal education.</span> <span id="s2453">In your own life, every person needs to be more informed, more educated, more curious about the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">For Americans, obviously the standard of living that has been enjoyed by a former generation is now shifting.</span> <span id="s2455">For the next few years, maybe for a whole generation, the standard of living for the average American will not be as high as it was in the last 30 or 40 years.</span> <span id="s2456">Work has changed and compensation has changed.</span> <span id="s2457">Notwithstanding all that, people still have to have an outlook—a spiritual posture.</span> <span id="s2458">People celebrate Christmas without stopping to think what the meaning of Christmas is.</span> <span id="s2459">If somebody is unemployed, are they going to be appreciated if they cannot give the gifts that they normally would have given?</span> <span id="s2460">Can they still see the world as a good place?</span> <span id="s2461">I’m not being a Pollyanna.</span> <span id="s2462">There is a deeper, spiritual satisfaction that I sense that many people don’t have.</span> <span id="s2463">They pay a lot of attention of things but are unaware of the world.</span> <span id="s2464">People like that are poor in their own ways.</span> <span id="s2465">Whatever they have, they can’t enjoy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">In addition to striving for a better education, for betting themselves, people need a spiritual center for themselves.</span> <span id="s2467">Whatever it be.</span> <span id="s2468">I’m not pinpointing any religion.</span> <span id="s2469">I’m not even pinpointing organized religion.</span> <span id="s2470">But people need a spiritual center.</span> <span id="s2471">It helped my family to get through a lot and all the people that were in our lives that we knew as fellow survivors.</span> <span id="s2472">I hope my children will have that spiritual center.</span> <span id="s2473">They are not orthodox but they certainly know they are Jews and are proud of it.</span> <span id="s2474">That’s all that matters to me.</span> <span id="s2475">It gives me piece of mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">All the time I’ve spent with young people, telling them of Holocaust history and my own history, I have never had the opportunity to sit down and tell my grandchildren about it.</span> <span id="s2477">Still they know my history; it’s no secret.</span> <span id="s2478">One of my granddaughter is named Shimona.</span> <span id="s2479">She is not called that in school because it is too exotic.</span> <span id="s2480">But Shimona is the female version of Shimon, my father’s name, Simon in English—her great grandfather.</span> <span id="s2481">The reason I named her after my father was because no one in his family survived.</span> <span id="s2482">So the only people who can honor his name is through me.</span> <span id="s2483">I’ve shown her pictures and said, ‘You may not use this name all the time, but this man was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s2484">He lived a good, moral life, and even in the worst of times he helped people as he could.</span> <span id="s2485">He went through a great deal of suffering so in his own way, he was a hero.’</span> <span id="s2486">To me, that’s heroism—it is standing up and surviving without a gun to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s2487">I’m hoping some of my history will filter down that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">I’m very grateful.</span> <span id="s2489">I am still having a satisfactory life.</span> <span id="s2490">How many years God will give me on this earth is up to him.</span> <span id="s2491">I visit my children, my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2492">Occasionally I travel as a tourist.</span> <span id="s2493">The fact that my husband shared his Corpus Christi town with me because I never felt I had a home town with my background.</span> <span id="s2494">This helps me, too.</span> <span id="s2495">If people complain—life isn’t perfect and they’re getting older—that is such nonsense.</span> <span id="s2496">Life is good.</span> <span id="s2497">Life is worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">But it can be very serious.</span> <span id="s2499">It is the greatest undertaking that happens to a human being.</span> <span id="s2500">When we are little and when we are children, we certainly don’t have any control over it.</span> <span id="s2501">Other people make our life, color our life.</span> <span id="s2502">Once you become an adult, the tone of your life, the outlook of your life, that’s up to the individual.</span> <span id="s2503">I’ve talked to younger people who find out about my background and are curious; I hope I give them that sense of optimism about the world that I have.</span> <span id="s2504">Like Anne Frank, I still have faith in human beings.</span> <span id="s2505">I’ve lived long enough to see a lot of bad things happen in the world.</span> <span id="s2506">But I continue to live and see a lot of good things happen.</span></p></body></html>
