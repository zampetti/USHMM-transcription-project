A: Ari.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Ari Fralik.</span> <span id="s5">And your address, Dr. Fralik?</span> <span id="s6">A: 1185 Park Avenue, New York, 10028.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Your involvement, Dr. Fralik, was as a liberator.</span> <span id="s8">In which Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: It started out with the Soviet Army, where I was inducted after running from Warsaw at the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s10">I was supposed to reach my unit in the Polish Army, but before I reached the unit, the unit was destroyed.</span> <span id="s11">We were running from the Germans towards the area where the Soviets were supposed to be.</span> <span id="s12">They had met us after a few days of running and being under constant fire of Messerschmits.</span> <span id="s13">We reached a little town called Kovel.</span> <span id="s14">When the Russians came and they saw us, they thought that we were spies and they kept us for a while under very strict, strict surveillance and I would call it "arrest".</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Who's "us"?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: There were many other people but there was one more physician who, unfortunately, died -- my colleague, who was on duty at the same night where I was in the University Hospital in Warsaw in the Gynecological Department.</span> <span id="s17">He was in the Urological Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: I am going to stop you for one moment, Doctor.</span> <span id="s19">Don't forget where you were.</span> <span id="s20">You were how old when you went into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well, I am now 72.</span> <span id="s22">How old was I in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: We have to go back since my math is very poor.</span> <span id="s24">You went into the service in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What was your title in the service?</span> <span id="s27">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I was a gynecologist.</span> <span id="s29">First, I was a so-called physician of third rank and gradually I grew from third to second, from second to first and I finished the service with a rank of a Colonel.</span> <span id="s30">In the Russian Army, we had Polish uniforms given to us before we entered Warsaw to make believe that the liberators of Warsaw are not the Russian soldiers but genuine Polish.</span> <span id="s31">As a group, they wore Polish uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: You entered the Army then after....</span> <span id="s33">A: I didn't enter.</span> <span id="s34">The took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: They took you.</span> <span id="s36">It wasn't voluntary.</span> <span id="s37">A: No, this wasn't voluntary.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And you had graduated medical school, obviously?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I graduated medical school in 1933.</span> <span id="s40">My diploma then made me eligible to practice in Poland, and I did it in 1934 and I was at the University of Warsaw after taking my oral exams again in Poland.</span> <span id="s41">I took my residency and during the beginning of the war, I was a so- called adjunct on the University Hospital in the Gynecological Department and started out as a Research Fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Where are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I was born in a little town in Galesia, called Brzezany.</span> <span id="s44">But I lived there a short while because I attended, after my 7th year of life, a very strict Orthodox rabbinical school, where I was supposed to graduate as a strict Orthodox rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: They were going to make a rabbi out of you?</span> <span id="s46">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: You are one of how many children?</span> <span id="s48">A: The youngest of 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: The only male?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Two males.</span> <span id="s51">One brother, two older sisters, a sister-in-law, two brothers-in-law, two nieces, two nephews and a mother who were all killed.</span> <span id="s52">My father died a normal death a year before the war.</span> <span id="s53">I was living in Warsaw, as I mentioned before, and I expected a career, if it would be possible for such a Jew as I. I not only did not deny my Jewishness, but I spoke with my patients in plain Jewish because this was my language in which....</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: "Plain Jewish."</span> <span id="s55">Are we talking about Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I am talking about Yiddish.</span> <span id="s57">Yes.</span> <span id="s58">I already spoke Hebrew too, at that time, because before I became a physician, I was involved in a [Hebrew word.]</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Oh, you were involved in the [Hebrew word].</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: And I had mastered the Hebrew language very well, coming over from the Talmud and Prophets into a daily language, with a Sephardic pronunciation which helped me a lot during my years of activity in the [Hebrew word].</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Your father was also a professional man?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My father was a business man, a very progressive Orthodox.</span> <span id="s63">My older sisters and my brother all went to professional schools.</span> <span id="s64">I was supposed to be devoted to a rabbinical career.</span> <span id="s65">I had not betrayed my father.</span> <span id="s66">I promised him that with my medical studies I would continue Talmudic studies, which I continued.</span> <span id="s67">When I graduated from medical school, I also finished the rabbinical school in Frankfurt am Main in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And that was Samson Rafael Hersh, of course?</span> <span id="s69">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So you have a very fine background.</span> <span id="s71">You had friends when you were forced to enter the armed services?</span> <span id="s72">Other Jewish friends who entered with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: One doctor.</span> <span id="s74">After we left Warsaw in 1946, I went to Germany and was there working for the Joint Distribution Committee for Relief and Rehabilitation as a Gynecological Consultant in DP camps, in Schlachtensee and Marienfeldt.</span> <span id="s75">He went to Israel and was a Chief Urologist in Israel and, unfortunately, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: I'd like to hear a little more about that experience in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: What you want to know about is before DP, because all experiences during the Army and the problems of seeing and helping as much as one could happened before I went to the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Let's start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s79">You got into the Army.</span> <span id="s80">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: You were obviously in a medical battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">I was first told by a Russian-Jewish physician not to give them my specialty and to "play it by ear” because he warned me that the lower position you will get, the safer is your life.</span> <span id="s84">The higher position you will get, the more you will be exposed to and the more your life will be in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: How did you react to that when you were told that?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: How I reacted to that?</span> <span id="s87">It was something very painful to hear.</span> <span id="s88">But I was very grateful to that physician because I found it later very helpful during my five years, nine months and six days in the service in the Army.</span> <span id="s89">But I couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s90">They had elevated me to position of a surgeon in front military units in the special sections of abdominal surgery.</span> <span id="s91">Since I was a gynecologist, they could only use me as an abdominal surgeon.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You used your knowledge with the men that were injured, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s93">A: I operated day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: These were front-line hospitals.</span> <span id="s95">A: Front-line hospitals.</span> <span id="s96">First-line.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did you get into any of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s99">First we were on defense, running away.</span> <span id="s100">Then we started our so-called offensive and then we crossed Eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s101">We entered first into Lublin, a Jewish town, which was a great experience because in no time a few hidden Jews appeared and somehow they found out that there was a Jewish surgeon.</span> <span id="s102">What they did is they asked me to circumcise their sons born in the forest.</span> <span id="s103">I took them to the Lublin Hospital and circumcised two boys who were born in hiding not far from Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did they come out of the forest to seek you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: To seek me out because they had heard that the Polish Army entered Lublin.</span> <span id="s106">We were not Polish; we were Russian wearing Polish uniforms.</span> <span id="s107">It spread over that there were some Jews around there and they found me.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: They risked their lives to find a doctor that would circumcise their sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: To circumcise their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And they were in hiding at that point?</span> <span id="s111">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: That really speaks for dedication for ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s114">I was, unfortunately, very short time with these few Jews that I met there, listening to their stories, because my unit was marching forward and I had to go and be sure that my whole hospital and the smaller units that were under my care and responsibility moved together with the forwarding armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What happened when you took these children to the Lublin Hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Was there a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: There was no problem.</span> <span id="s118">There was an old physician there who was actually a Jew who survived there.</span> <span id="s119">I did not have too much details about how he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: This was in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: This was in 1942 or 1943.</span> <span id="s122">1939 was the offensive years.</span> <span id="s123">Q: So you had no problem conducting the circumcision?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, I had no problems at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And you brought the child back to the forest or they took the child back to the forest after?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: They did not have to take him back to the forest any longer.</span> <span id="s127">They were looking for some places to live because we were the liberation army who liberated them from the Germans and they were all looking to find places.</span> <span id="s128">How they found them I don't know.</span> <span id="s129">I only know how other ones found places later.</span> <span id="s130">Unfortunately, they got very, very hostile greetings from the non-Jewish population and they had to overcome great difficulties to start a temporary life.</span> <span id="s131">I don't think they had been there for a long time since, as I now know, in retrospect, the situation was a very unfavorable one for Jewish survivors who settled back into their homes.</span> <span id="s132">It never happened.</span> <span id="s133">Almost never.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you actually get into any of the actual ghettoes or camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Not in Lublin.</span> <span id="s136">There was no time for me because we were marching forward and we had no time to go into any details at that time.</span> <span id="s137">I went in later but not at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Were you still in the army when you went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s140">I was in the Army until I came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s141">I was all the time in uniform in the Army.</span> <span id="s142">All the time.</span> <span id="s143">We marched all through Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s144">I was in the Army that took Berlin-- with the Russian-Polish Army-- from the east side.</span> <span id="s145">I was one of the few officers who were delegated to meet Petain's army who entered through the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What was the first camp that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: My first camp that I saw was a little town called Jastrun, in German territory.</span> <span id="s148">I will never forget.</span> <span id="s149">I was driven in a Russian Zues.</span> <span id="s150">They had given me all privileges of having a..</span> <span id="s151">.</span> <span id="s152">even a soldier-servant because they needed me very badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Is that a Russian tank, a Zues?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: A Zues is like a jeep in the American Army.</span> <span id="s155">It was a Russian jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">In Jastrun we had had very bitter fights, street fights.</span> <span id="s157">We were crossing the streets in the jeep and I saw from far away a burning shack.</span> <span id="s158">I made my driver stop and we opened that and there was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s159">There were many dead bodies around.</span> <span id="s160">It was a female camp.</span> <span id="s161">In the center there were a few young girls sitting and I didn't believe that somebody opened that wide the door.</span> <span id="s162">There were 4 or 5 girls which I immediately took out.</span> <span id="s163">I took them with us to the nearest town and made sure that they were fed.</span> <span id="s164">I was very, at this time, heart-broken because a short time earlier I found out from a mobilized Ukraine fellow about the death of part of my family.</span> <span id="s165">He gave me all the symptoms that he could be lying.</span> <span id="s166">I believe that he was, this Ukrainian fellow, so I did not have at that time the inclination to start writing about our experiences; I just had taken them.</span> <span id="s167">I don't remember how long they were huddled in our kitchen until I make sure they were sent behind the front lines.</span> <span id="s168">As a matter of fact, two of these girls found me just this year in New York.</span> <span id="s169">One of them came from Germany through Israel.</span> <span id="s170">She lives in Israel and she said she looked for me for forty years and she finally found me and she came and she started to cry and she thanked me.</span> <span id="s171">A week ago, I had another call from her sister, who came also from Israel, who went with her husband to Washington who told me she had to see me.</span> <span id="s172">Her sister told her that she saw me.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s174">That must have been an incredible experience, seeing these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s176">It was, among others, very traumatic, depressing, and horror producing.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Tell me a little bit about this place where you opened the door.</span> <span id="s178">What did you see?</span> <span id="s179">How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: By chance.</span> <span id="s181">Strictly by chance.</span> <span id="s182">Q: What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Like a stable.</span> <span id="s184">It was probably a labor camp where the Germans left and they [the women] starved for a while.</span> <span id="s185">I didn't see any signs of shooting, but just emaciated corpses, so I don't think they were killed.</span> <span id="s186">And, again, we were rushing forward.</span> <span id="s187">I took the live ones; the dead ones I left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Do you have a memory of approximately how many there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I can't tell you how many.</span> <span id="s190">I believe there were maybe 100 or many more.</span> <span id="s191">I can’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Crowded around the walls, lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s194">Q: Straw?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I don't think there was straw.</span> <span id="s196">Q: No evidence of burning?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No evidence of burning.</span> <span id="s198">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember seeing windows?</span> <span id="s200">A: No.</span> <span id="s201">I didn't see any windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How far away did the closest population live?</span> <span id="s203">The closest house?</span> <span id="s204">Do you remember seeing any type of citizenry?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: It was on the outskirts of Jastrun.</span> <span id="s206">I don’t remember how close the houses were, but I’m sure that the civilian population knew about that place, as they knew about all the places I had more experience with when I came to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: You didn't talk to anybody at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: At that point, I didn't talk.</span> <span id="s209">I didn't have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: These girls --women-- were how old at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I believe they were 16-, 17-, 18-year-old girls.</span> <span id="s212">Very young girls.</span> <span id="s213">This was a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: When you took them to safety, how did you manage to take them?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Where did you take them to?</span> <span id="s216">Was it your own Army unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I took them in my jeep.</span> <span id="s218">Q: Your own jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I brought them into the so-called quarters of the staff, the general’s staff, because they were my quarters, too.</span> <span id="s220">I asked first to bring the food immediately.</span> <span id="s221">I was the senior officer at that time.</span> <span id="s222">I ordered them to make sure that they are in a safe place.</span> <span id="s223">I saw these girls a few times later on because they were traveling not back, but sideways, into further places in Germany with our Army units.</span> <span id="s224">We didn't have a place to leave them behind.</span> <span id="s225">So when we stopped and I had located my hospitals, I would always make sure that they are somewhere with our units.</span> <span id="s226">I found them and I spoke to them and I was together trying to teach them some Jewish songs, some Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s227">And they were singing with me and they remember it, still.</span> <span id="s228">And I promised them that I would make sure that they will be located somewhere safe.</span> <span id="s229">They were sent to Lodz, in Poland, where I also had organized something else....</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: I want to hear that story.</span> <span id="s231">But I want to stay with those two young girls for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: There were about 4 or 5.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What did they tell you about their experience?</span> <span id="s234">Were they able to speak?</span> <span id="s235">Were they mentally alert enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: When I saw them again, about 3-4 days after the first time, they were absolutely normal in appearance and reacting normally, amazingly, and quickly recuperating from all traumas and getting back to their old selves.</span> <span id="s237">They were very much invigorated by the fact that they met friendly people and Jewish people, and I befriended them immediately.</span> <span id="s238">I was always used to dealing with youth as an organizer in the [Hebrew word] where I formed many units through singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Songs brought Jews together and they were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: The national language.</span> <span id="s241">When you first found them and you said "Come with me," you spoke in what language?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: The immediate bond, the love bond.</span> <span id="s244">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Did they want to touch you?</span> <span id="s246">Did they want to hug you?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">They hung around my neck.</span> <span id="s249">And this one girl [one who recently sought Mr. Fralik out in New York] was asking me if I remember how many kisses she gave me.</span> <span id="s250">I said I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s252">You don't have the score, but you could repeat it again so we could find out, right?</span> <span id="s253">They were not that emaciated that they couldn't walk, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: In the beginning, I was sure we would have difficulty in putting them on their feet.</span> <span id="s255">It is really a most wonderful experience to see how quickly they regained their physical fitness, in a sense.</span> <span id="s256">And, mentally, they were so young that these traumatic experiences went very fast and they were overwhelmed with the experience they had just gained, unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s257">And when they never hoped for that and suddenly this occurred, the happiness was so overwhelming that it probably had suppressed all physical and mental pain.</span> <span id="s258">We know that positive attitudes and a very great experience of happiness may cause you to forget pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Encapsulate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Encapsulate it for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: These girls were able to tell you about their families?</span> <span id="s262">Were they asked about their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I did not ask them.</span> <span id="s264">Q: You did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I did not ask them.</span> <span id="s266">I knew.</span> <span id="s267">Q: Consciously?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Consciously.</span> <span id="s269">Yes.</span> <span id="s270">I knew from before when we crossed and we knew from reports that we had listened to everyday from the Russian papers, reports by the famous Ilia Ehrenburg who was describing the atrocities of the people under the German yoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: This was a Russian reporter?</span> <span id="s272">Ilia Ehrenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Russian writer for the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s274">He was a controversial type of a Jew, although I always felt that he did a great service.</span> <span id="s275">Some Jewish poets and writers were against him because he survived experiences which others, his contemporaries, did not.</span> <span id="s276">So they had suspected that he must have been a collaborator.</span> <span id="s277">But I did not think so.</span> <span id="s278">Anyhow, we knew from that report.</span> <span id="s279">Also, by the time we reached Jastrun, we had already gone through Poland.</span> <span id="s280">In Poland I had horrible experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">One of the experiences was when we took Warsaw.</span> <span id="s282">We took Warsaw, where I lived, and I didn’t go into my apartment.</span> <span id="s283">I didn't want to see my apartment because it was everything burning.</span> <span id="s284">There were many episodes in Warsaw which were heart-breaking and today when I recall them, it is typically this one episode.</span> <span id="s285">We had to put on Polish uniforms and take off the Russian uniforms.</span> <span id="s286">The Russians wanted to make sure that the Polish population believed this was Polish units, so they attached priests and rabbis to the divisions.</span> <span id="s287">In my division, in my medical unit, there was a priest and a rabbi.</span> <span id="s288">The rabbi's name was Kahane.</span> <span id="s289">I entered with this Rabbi Kahane into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s290">We got very close.</span> <span id="s291">We felt each other, smelling each other, so to say.</span> <span id="s292">Certainly, we had both a very good common language.</span> <span id="s293">We entered Warsaw which was in flames.</span> <span id="s294">The first place we went to see was [unintelligible], an old temple of the famous singer Sirota.</span> <span id="s295">The temple was empty and burning.</span> <span id="s296">One corner was free and the Ark was there.</span> <span id="s297">But the Ark was empty.</span> <span id="s298">I entered with the rabbi into the [unintelligible] room.</span> <span id="s299">He was standing there in silence.</span> <span id="s300">Then in about half an hour maybe two or three dozen Jews came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Suddenly, from hiding.</span> <span id="s302">[It was as though] they smelled that the Russians are here and the Germans are out.</span> <span id="s303">They joined us and the laments and crying were undescribable.</span> <span id="s304">The rabbi stepped up.</span> <span id="s305">There was the Ark.</span> <span id="s306">He stepped up three steps higher and turned with his back to these gathered Jews and to me and he put on a tallith he had with him and said to the Ark, "God, all the years of my life I've asked you to forgive the sins of my community.</span> <span id="s307">Today, I stay in front of you and tell you I don't know if we will forgive you Your sins."</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You knew this man very well.</span> <span id="s309">Did you share the same feelings?</span> <span id="s310">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Do you still have the same feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s313">Yes.</span> <span id="s314">So this was before I met these girls.</span> <span id="s315">After that I did not personally open any camps any more.</span> <span id="s316">I was very much pushed forward with the offensive and the forward-marching armies.</span> <span id="s317">I was the responsible surgeon for the Polish divisions.</span> <span id="s318">When we entered Berlin -- I believe it was the 4th of May -- one thing I did was go see the office of Hitler in the Reichstag.</span> <span id="s319">There was a room with a very high roof, tremendously high.</span> <span id="s320">This was four hours after the Russian marching infantry entered, and a Russian soldier had already time enough to write down with charcoal on the ceiling "Ivan brought order into Europe."</span> <span id="s321">There was nothing left in this room, only an old desk, and from the desk I took a little book, a little book I have with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">This book was given by one of Hitler's girlfriends to the Fuhrer for his birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Signed?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Signed by "Eleanor [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s326">What is the book about?</span> <span id="s327">A: [Unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: What is [unintelligible]?</span> <span id="s329">Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s330">Sure.</span> <span id="s331">[Unintelligible].</span> <span id="s332">I didn't know what you were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: It was a revelation for somebody I showed it to that Hitler would indulge in that, but he did.</span> <span id="s334">This is my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You've got a valuable volume there.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Some professor from Cornell wanted to buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: I'm sure.</span> <span id="s338">You went into Berlin.</span> <span id="s339">Did you get any instructions as to how to handle starved people?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I was in Berlin twice.</span> <span id="s341">The first time I was in Berlin with the Army we met the Germans from the West and we came in from the East.</span> <span id="s342">I met an American rabbi, and we got very friendly and I was very happy to hear from him that he was having Friday night services, which I did not have for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: That was something that you were happy about.</span> <span id="s344">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: In spite of your feeling of God's denial for the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s347">Because I am very, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s348">I have a very deep sentiment for tradition, great nostalgia for many years spent in a deep belief, not so much in Yahweh, but in Eloihim, the God of mercy.</span> <span id="s349">I used to pray 3 times a day as a youngster.</span> <span id="s350">I used to be ecstatic in praying.</span> <span id="s351">Of course, I'm too old so I have to go through many stages, including atheistic propaganda among youth, then I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You were ecstatic in praying.</span> <span id="s353">What comes to my mind is a Hassidic orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s355">Yes.</span> <span id="s356">My father was not a Hassid; my father belonged rather to [unintelligible], but he had a great knowledge of Hassidism and I, myself, having been far from home from my early youth, had witnessed prayers in Hassidic, so-called [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s357">I was at that time a deep believer and I had the need to come together, the need to sing, and the need to reminisce.</span> <span id="s358">These prayers which I have joined the American rabbi in the evening with had convinced me about our immortality and about the link which this gives between yesterday and</span></p> <p><span id="s359">tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: The link.</span> <span id="s361">Your ecstatic experience in p rayer.</span> <span id="s362">How would you verbalize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was a total transfer into a deep, mystical belief in the supernatural and the guidance one reaches with himself by feeling that supernatural power.</span> <span id="s364">The deep belief in the existence of that supernatural power has very often helped me to overcome my great rebellion against the fact that I had to be in that rabbinical school [while] my brother and sisters and the other little boys from my home were going to the secular schools and wore nice uniforms.</span> <span id="s365">I wore a very Hassidic outfit.</span> <span id="s366">When I came home to visit my parents, I wasn't allowed to leave the street because I was injured by stones thrown by Gentile boys who had so willingly seen me as one of their God-killers, being I was in a very Jewish attire.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: That changed, that ecstatic.</span> <span id="s368">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When?</span> <span id="s370">During your Army... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s372">I was transformed a few times.</span> <span id="s373">This happened in the [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s374">It’s the year I started to dig more into sociology and philosophy and my whole way of thinking on the position of the human being in the universe.</span> <span id="s375">I tried to understand what it meant for me in the past and what it could mean to me in the present to continue to believe in that supernatural mystic power which I started doubting and further on harsh realism had helped me overcome that feeling of really being under a guiding power on which I might totally rely and put my faith in.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You substituted that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: With self-confidence and self-assurance and a certain feeling of ethics which have to be substituted for that supernatural power, without which I couldn't go the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: That's a very beautiful explanation.</span> <span id="s379">It really is.</span> <span id="s380">The orientation you had in your family, did you think of that at any point when your life may have been in jeopardy in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s382">I had envied my father, who was a deeply honest believer.</span> <span id="s383">I was with him at his death.</span> <span id="s384">I had an unusual relationship with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Although I lived in Warsaw and he lived in a little town, I used to come see him and before his death, a year before the war, I was with him for three weeks.</span> <span id="s386">I was with him when he died.</span> <span id="s387">I was observing his death.</span> <span id="s388">I was a young physician and I had envied his death, but with such a belief in... It is very funny.</span> <span id="s389">He was an Orthodox Jew, but very progressive in the sense that he had his daughters and his sons study.</span> <span id="s390">And in those days it was unusual, but I reminded myself that he had, for Sabbath day, a special tallith, a Turkish tallith, and I had to see to it.</span> <span id="s391">I was executor of his will, the youngest, but I was unmarried and supposed to be more objective and take care of my mother and so on.</span> <span id="s392">And he had been buried in his tallith.</span> <span id="s393">I have a tallith.</span> <span id="s394">I have a Turkish tallith and I have in my will that I be buried in my tallith.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Traditional.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Power of tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Power of tradition.</span> <span id="s398">You saw death.</span> <span id="s399">You saw death because of war.</span> <span id="s400">A: I saw death and I saw life because I am an obstetrician.</span> <span id="s401">I delivered more than 5,000 children in my life.</span> <span id="s402">I love life.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: In the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Not in the Army.</span> <span id="s405">Before the Army.</span> <span id="s406">In this United States of ours, I delivered thousands of children.</span> <span id="s407">I saw life coming and I considered myself for a long time a Partner to the Creator.</span> <span id="s408">Again there was a mixture of some kind of mystical feeling.</span> <span id="s409">It was, of course, never on a conscious level.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: But you saw death in the Army.</span> <span id="s411">A: And how did I see death!</span> <span id="s412">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: How did you see death in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I was in the first line of abdominal care hospital, where the soldier had to be operated on as soon as possible after being injured because we learned that the sooner the operation follows the injury, the greater the percentage of survival, because there is no infection.</span> <span id="s415">I have seen these people.</span> <span id="s416">We had very little medication, but a lot of blood.</span> <span id="s417">We transfused blood.</span> <span id="s418">I have seen a soldier who lost his upper and lower extremities and didn't want to die.</span> <span id="s419">I have seen people who were so injured that one could not imagine that one would want to live after that, but I have seen the power of preservation.</span> <span id="s420">I have also operated on a general of the German artillery where we were before we took the town called Sandomierz.</span> <span id="s421">We couldn't take the town because we had to cross the river, and every time our companies were trying to go, we were destroyed.</span> <span id="s422">One morning at 4:00 I was called by the General.</span> <span id="s423">"We have captured an important man; he has to live."</span> <span id="s424">I operated on him.</span> <span id="s425">It was my first operation on a German officer.</span> <span id="s426">I had, at that time, thought twice.</span> <span id="s427">Should I refuse to operate?</span> <span id="s428">Should I operate?</span> <span id="s429">At that moment, my medical profession prevailed.</span> <span id="s430">But I took revenge in a certain sense.</span> <span id="s431">He was a young, very handsome General.</span> <span id="s432">He was in shock; I gave him a transfusion.</span> <span id="s433">As he came out of shock, I told him, "You know what blood you got?</span> <span id="s434">From a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s435">You know who's going to operate on you?</span> <span id="s436">I. I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s437">This man was operated on.</span> <span id="s438">It was a very difficult operation.</span> <span id="s439">Four hours after that, our FBI took him away and about six hours later, we crossed the river and we took Sandomierz.</span> <span id="s440">He gave out all the secrets where the artillery is and I didn't see him or hear from him anymore.</span> <span id="s441">Episodes like that you could talk about until morning.</span> <span id="s442">I'm not going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: When you saw the emaciated bodies and death as a result, was that different for you than death on a battlefield?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Consciously different, if you can put yourself into that time?</span> <span id="s446">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: There was a great difference when I was aware that these were enemies, enemies of my people, enemies of my closest family.</span> <span id="s449">[The others] were innocent victims of cruelty and inhumanity and bestiality to the lowest degree.</span> <span id="s450">How could I not distinguish them?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Were you the only one or did you have anybody else that you talked to who felt the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I believe that every thinking person who was around me, if he was a Jew, felt that way.</span> <span id="s453">I think that we Jews had a greater reason to be very devoted to the work we did in every place we could -- to take revenge and help destroy the enemy.</span> <span id="s454">Therefore, I was operating day and night until one day in Kohlberg I was given a written order to sleep.</span> <span id="s455">[I had been operating day and night] because I felt this was the only activity [I could do].</span> <span id="s456">I couldn't shoot.</span> <span id="s457">I couldn't be on the front line -- they didn't let me -- so this was the only thing I could do somehow to have a part in destroying that Humankind's Hangman.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you talk to any German citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s460">I talked a lot.</span> <span id="s461">I was twice in Berlin.</span> <span id="s462">I was sent back to Lodz, to Poland, after we took Berlin in order to fight the Polish Army who was against the government, the so-called Polish government.</span> <span id="s463">There were two armies -- the People's Army, where I belonged to, and the [unintelligible] army to the Soviets, and we had to fight them and pacify them.</span> <span id="s464">Then I was made a commander of the big hospital unit in a district of [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s465">I was coming there on a Saturday evening, to take over the uniform.</span> <span id="s466">I called a meeting of the physicians, non-Jews who were there for a long time.</span> <span id="s467">There were no Jews in these military hospitals before the war.</span> <span id="s468">I called a meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">One occurred because my name was Leon Ari Fralik.</span> <span id="s470">The next morning I came back to Warsaw, reported to my general, whose name was Scharetsky, and told him that I am leaving Poland.</span> <span id="s471">He could not believe that.</span> <span id="s472">He told me, "You, who deserved everything from us, thankfulness.</span> <span id="s473">You get so many medals.</span> <span id="s474">How could you talk like that?"</span> <span id="s475">I told him the truth, that I was disappointed in the post-war, that anti-Semitism did not disappear but just the opposite.</span> <span id="s476">It was augmented.</span> <span id="s477">It was much worse than it was before the war.</span> <span id="s478">He called in a friend of mine, who studied with me in Prague.</span> <span id="s479">His name was General Somit, who had been fighting in the Spanish War because he was a real idealist Communist.</span> <span id="s480">Then he was taken somewhere to Africa into a prison, was freed, and became the political Commissar's position of that Polish general's position.</span> <span id="s481">And he called in that Somit, and he said: "Here is your colleague.</span> <span id="s482">He also wants to leave Poland."</span> <span id="s483">He tried to persuade me to stay and I said, "No.</span> <span id="s484">Under no circumstances."</span> <span id="s485">So they tried to find [a way to give me] a so-called honorable discharge; they put me in a hospital for three weeks and found something in my heart which permitted them to discharge me honorably.</span> <span id="s486">Then I came to Berlin as a civilian, and I took over a hospital on the west side of Berlin where I had all DP’s.</span> <span id="s487">I was the head of that department there for 2 years.</span> <span id="s488">I lived with a German family and I lived with the civilian people.</span> <span id="s489">It was an interesting transformation.</span> <span id="s490">When I was in uniform, I wouldn't mind shooting any German.</span> <span id="s491">When I took off my uniform and I [became a civilian] and I was a physician in the hospital, I couldn't kill anybody.</span> <span id="s492">I had disregard and disrespect for [the civilians].</span> <span id="s493">They were like worms crawling.</span> <span id="s494">They were begging forgiveness as if they knew nothing, but I didn't believe anybody, because I had proved that they had lied.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You had disregard.</span> <span id="s496">You had disrespect?</span> <span id="s497">No hate?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s499">At that time there was hate, too.</span> <span id="s500">Yes.</span> <span id="s501">Hate.</span> <span id="s502">But I wouldn't be able to do anything.</span> <span id="s503">I would help them if they would call for help.</span> <span id="s504">Yes, that was again a transformation for the same person, as if there would be a change in my whole attitude, because in the uniform I had to defend my life.</span> <span id="s505">In a civilian uniform, I had to help, be it the enemy or not.</span> <span id="s506">But I could not kill at that time, anymore.</span> <span id="s507">These people were always apologizing.</span> <span id="s508">[It was] nauseating.</span> <span id="s509">They "didn't know anything" and I had shown to them.</span> <span id="s510">I knew because I was in Lodz and I saw reports from German women who had been responsible for children’s camps.</span> <span id="s511">They had asked the German Army not to send the clothes filled with blood, but to clean the clothes first.</span> <span id="s512">And they wanted to tell me that the civilian people didn't know about what happened!?</span> <span id="s513">All the atrocities were unknown to them!?</span> <span id="s514">I threw it into their eyes.</span> <span id="s515">Yes, I did speak.</span> <span id="s516">I did do a lot of speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Would it be fair to say that you felt when you were wearing the uniform and you killed...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I didn't kill anybody.</span> <span id="s519">I could kill.</span> <span id="s520">I didn't kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Then it's your country.</span> <span id="s522">You killed for your country?</span> <span id="s523">You killed for your people?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I did not kill for my country.</span> <span id="s525">I was never a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s526">I killed for my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Certainly more accurate.</span> <span id="s528">When you were not in that uniform, then that was....</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Then I was a physician.</span> <span id="s530">It was then only me which I had cultivated all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And killing was not part of that.</span> <span id="s532">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: That's an interesting division.</span> <span id="s534">[Let’s talk again about] the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">I met Ben Gurion and LaGuardia there.</span> <span id="s537">I had a lot of discussions with them.</span> <span id="s538">I was very unhappy to see that at the DP camps the young survivors were given food and shelter [but not made] to rehabilitate themselves.</span> <span id="s539">[These camps] made them feel that the war had to feed them and give them everything ready and [turned them into] people who grew with a demand from the world to be paid for the fact that they survived.</span> <span id="s540">There was a Mr. Fischbein who was the head of the DP camps.</span> <span id="s541">I told them my opinion.</span> <span id="s542">They chose me to the Executive Committee there so it was my deepest belief that the DP camps were a big failure.</span> <span id="s543">They should not have given them food, shelter, and everything ready.</span> <span id="s544">They should have opened workshops, made them work and earn the money, and [helped them] regain their self-respect.</span> <span id="s545">Many of these people came to the United States and Israel with a demand from the surrounding world: "Pay us because we survived."</span> <span id="s546">This was not a logical and not a foresight attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You were dealing with people who were starved both emotionally and physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I was dealing with people who were almost degenerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Degeneration of self respect?</span> <span id="s550">That was your first concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes, feelings of respect, [having] a certain belief in themselves and [the ability to see] a normal way of life.</span> <span id="s552">Because they went from one abnormality to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: The DP camp was also an abnorma lity.</span> <span id="s554">A: Abnormality.</span> <span id="s555">Absolutely an abnormality.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And that had been the place to develop self-respect in such an abnormal situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s558">Yes.</span> <span id="s559">[There could have been] open schools, open work shops, everybody do something, earn that.</span> <span id="s560">After a day's work, you get your food, you get your shelter, you get your clothes.</span> <span id="s561">But don't stay a whole day and wait with your proportions.</span> <span id="s562">What happened was [some people] became black market racketeers who left the camp and went into the population and started doing many unpleasant things, but I'm not going to get into that.</span> <span id="s563">There were episodes which were heart- breaking.</span> <span id="s564">When a young man who had married a surviving Jewish- Russian girl brought in a German mistress, the neighbors brought him in to us.</span> <span id="s565">We asked him how can he do that?</span> <span id="s566">He said, "This is the way I take revenge on the Germans."</span> <span id="s567">I mean, it speaks to a total lack of any...they lost the moral basis, if they had it.</span> <span id="s568">But this was not the regaining, by giving them everything ready on a plate.</span> <span id="s569">You had to make them feel as human beings who must work for life.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Were you instrumental in organizing the mechanics of the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I was a consultant and a physician.</span> <span id="s572">I did not help in organizing the camp itself.</span> <span id="s573">I just raised my critical voice.</span> <span id="s574">But I couldn't do because I was very busy.</span> <span id="s575">There was enough work for me in two camps.</span> <span id="s576">There were 2,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Where were these camps?</span> <span id="s578">A: In west Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: You saw people come and go and they were for the most part single people.</span> <span id="s580">They were not families?</span> <span id="s581">They were isolated?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: They created peers.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: They developed their own support system.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: It was not something that was organized in a sense where a planned educational program was prepared for these people who had come out of the camps and who had seen cruelty and had lost faith in humanity [as a means of] rehabilitating them.</span> <span id="s585">[There was no] professional psychological attitude on how to rehabilitate them and not give them rides and, as I said, pay them for the fact that they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: How do you view, in those terms, the Vietnamese situation when they are collected into a camp situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: As a first stage of survival, you have to feed them.</span> <span id="s588">Once the stomach is full, we have to do something else.</span> <span id="s589">You cannot permit yourself to have the people, all alone, feel they are going to be supported by generosity of the surrounders.</span> <span id="s590">They have to be productive in a certain way.</span> <span id="s591">Productivity.</span> <span id="s592">To make a person feel he is productive is the first step [in making him] feel he is a person on his feet and is wanted, needed, and important.</span> <span id="s593">Not a parasite.</span> <span id="s594">A feeling of a parasite is a horrible deteriorating element.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Was this feeling ever shared with you by any of the DP's?</span> <span id="s596">Was there something that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Some, yes.</span> <span id="s598">But I would say it was only the small intellectual group.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">And a small handful of those were in the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So you are talking about a very small population that would have immediately benefited by that type of training whereas the majority really needed to be
