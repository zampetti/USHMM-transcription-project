I don’t remember exactly but I think I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What were the conditions in the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s23">Were they quite different from your way of life before?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Very, very, very bad.</span> <span id="s25">I don’t remember everything.</span> <span id="s26">But I remember the bad things.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: The selections...how they call this...like Germans came to and told everybody to go down to the yard...of... we lived in a big building...and everybody had to go down.</span> <span id="s29">And we lived with my mother’s parents and they were telling the old people to go down and to check the papers.</span> <span id="s30">And people that worked in Ghetto, they had preference to stay still in their apartments...they checked the papers, but old people they took first.</span> <span id="s31">And I remember one morning when we had selection and my grandparents...my mother’s parents, were taken one of the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: The selection was to simply move from the regular part of the city to the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: No!</span> <span id="s34">Selection was to go to the trains.</span> <span id="s35">To...they were telling they are taking this people away, nobody knew where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: When you had to move to the Ghetto, did all of you move to the Ghetto together?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">Yes, we moved with parents of my mother.</span> <span id="s39">They...I have to replay for myself.</span> <span id="s40">Later my mother stayed home and I was home, too.</span> <span id="s41">But my father worked.</span> <span id="s42">He worked for Germans in...as a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s43">They needed him...he got very good papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: He could go in and out of the Ghetto freely?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, he worked in Ghetto for Germans and he lived...he left the home every morning and we stayed at home with my mom.</span> <span id="s46">It was very...there was no food.</span> <span id="s47">The Polish people were bringing a little food to us.</span> <span id="s48">There was no food.</span> <span id="s49">And my mother was trying to send me to the other side, to the Polish side because I had my nanny that lived there and she wanted me there, and she wanted to hide me.</span> <span id="s50">But everybody knew I am Jewish girl in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Before you moved to the Ghetto, your family lived in a much larger place?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: We had a very nice house in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s53">And we had a nanny that worked for us.</span> <span id="s54">She was...I was only one daughter at home...and we had woman that was...when I was born and she worked for us many years.</span> <span id="s55">And she would...she loved me like her own child.</span> <span id="s56">And when we were moved to Ghetto, she wanted to help us, but she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s57">Then my mother found out somebody that brought food to the Ghetto because it was a very little food in the Ghetto and to send me to the Polish side.</span> <span id="s58">But that took time too.</span> <span id="s59">That was what she decided already to do everything possible to send me out of Ghetto.</span> <span id="s60">It was after one selection that we went downstairs - and it was...they were checking...it was on the street, it was not close to our house.</span> <span id="s61">Everybody was on the street in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s62">They were checking the papers.</span> <span id="s63">Even my father’s papers, the best papers - they needed him at work - they decided to tell us to go to the trains too...and it was just one moment of good thinking...my mother and father just pulled me to the side of people that would stay...and they just didn’t want to do second selection for one family.</span> <span id="s64">We just mixed with the people that would stay and after this is my mother saw that the good papers doesn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s65">She decided that they don’t protect you forever, that you’ll survive, she decided to do everything to send me out of Ghetto.</span> <span id="s66">And she paid the woman that brought butter and food to Ghetto people.</span> <span id="s67">And she promised her money, her jewelry, her...everything my mother had to bring me to the Polish side to my nanny.</span> <span id="s68">And that was exactly what my mother did.</span> <span id="s69">She promised and she did.</span> <span id="s70">She took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Can you remember that?</span> <span id="s72">Did you know you were being taken away from your parent?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s74">I just remember my staying with my nanny.</span> <span id="s75">That I had...that people didn’t like this little Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s76">I was...I spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s77">I didn’t know any other language, just Polish.</span> <span id="s78">I was brought up in a home that was only one language, Polish.</span> <span id="s79">But people knew that I am Jewish in this place that my nanny lived and they started to tell that if she will not (get) rid of this little Jewish girl they will tell the Germans.</span> <span id="s80">After that she was trying to find some place for me.</span> <span id="s81">And that was the place...a Catholic convent in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s82">But she had to tell and lie and to tell me the same lie.</span> <span id="s83">I had always to have father, and they were killed during the war.</span> <span id="s84">And she told (taught) me Polish prayers, Catholic prayers.</span> <span id="s85">I still think I was more genius than I am now.</span> <span id="s86">Because I learned I was very quick.</span> <span id="s87">I learned all the prayers.</span> <span id="s88">When I came to convent I knew to lie.</span> <span id="s89">I knew to tell the prayers.</span> <span id="s90">I was like any other Polish girl.</span> <span id="s91">I never could say I am Jewish, or my mother is in Ghetto or my father is in Ghetto or I have family here.</span> <span id="s92">Everything was a big lie.</span> <span id="s93">And I had to continue the same lie to tell.</span> <span id="s94">I was for two and a half years in this convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Were there other children in this convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: There was another girl for a short time because...it was good luck that these Catholic sisters accepted me.</span> <span id="s97">The first days I came I got measles.</span> <span id="s98">And with very high fever and I was in infirmary and even with this high fever I had always to remember, to lie.</span> <span id="s99">I am an orphan and to know all the prayers.</span> <span id="s100">And my mother, she came after she got notice that I am already in the convent and I am sick.</span> <span id="s101">She couldn’t come to visit me because she was so scared.</span> <span id="s102">She came to...she ran away from Ghetto too.</span> <span id="s103">Because she had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s104">Because one day, after I was already on Polish side, my father went to work and never came back.</span> <span id="s105">Like that she decided (she had) nothing to lose anymore.</span> <span id="s106">She has to get to Polish side.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: You were an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I was the only child.</span> <span id="s109">She came to my nanny too.</span> <span id="s110">It was...she had a little good luck somehow, she ran away.</span> <span id="s111">And she stayed with my nanny too.</span> <span id="s112">And my nanny told her that I have measles.</span> <span id="s113">She couldn’t come to visit me because she was scared when she comes after awhile I didn’t see her that I would say “Mama” and that would be normal to child, sick child.</span> <span id="s114">She never visited me during my sickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did she visit you afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No, she didn’t visit me.</span> <span id="s117">I had the day off once a month and my aunt, my mother’s sister would come to pick me up.</span> <span id="s118">And I remember to tell (call) her “lady with her name” and not my aunt.</span> <span id="s119">I really remember.</span> <span id="s120">I think that was the instinct of survival.</span> <span id="s121">The children were so smart.</span> <span id="s122">Because normally children forget all these little things.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What was your life like in the convent?</span> <span id="s124">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s126">The sisters weren’t so good because we didn’t have very good food.</span> <span id="s127">We had to go to prayer every morning at 6 o’clock, I was so little and...</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: You were six and a half by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Six and a half, seven.</span> <span id="s130">And it was tiring to get up at 6 o’clock to go to church every morning.</span> <span id="s131">But one thing was very good, I never miss school.</span> <span id="s132">I always went to school.</span> <span id="s133">And I don’t know...I don’t remember day by day how it was.</span> <span id="s134">But I went to school, we had food, not the best food.</span> <span id="s135">Very, bad food.</span> <span id="s136">I had to save pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s137">Because the oatmeal was so terrible it was cooked in a big pot and always a little burned.</span> <span id="s138">After the war I never ate oatmeal.</span> <span id="s139">One thing I can’t take to my mouth is oatmeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: That was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s142">They (the convent) had their own school, the sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: You were the only child staying there?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s145">There were a lot a children.</span> <span id="s146">That was orphanage.</span> <span id="s147">It was orphanage.</span> <span id="s148">Only I was the only one that (was a) Jewish child.</span> <span id="s149">It was a big orphanage.</span> <span id="s150">Big orphanage.</span> <span id="s151">There were older children, younger children...I remember another thing later when my mother was on the Polish side she couldn’t live with my nanny.</span> <span id="s152">She got other help.</span> <span id="s153">Because all her (the nanny’s) neighbors again knew she’s (the mother) Jewish.</span> <span id="s154">They didn’t want to see her.</span> <span id="s155">(She was helped by) her cousin.</span> <span id="s156">German origins.</span> <span id="s157">And she helped my mother to get away to another place.</span> <span id="s158">With her friend, a German, he came like he came to arrest her and he brought her another place.</span> <span id="s159">Later my mother had to color her hair blond, her eyebrows blond, her eye lashes blond to look different, (so that) no one in Warsaw would recognize her.</span> <span id="s160">And will tell this is a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s161">She got fatter and she went and she worked in a German restaurant in the kitchen, helping the cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: A restaurant would be good place to work in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yeah, because no one would never think that a Jewish woman would have guts to work in a German restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Not only that, she would have food.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: She had food and no one suspected that it was a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s166">She looked so different.</span> <span id="s167">If you change your color of your eye brows, eye lashes, it changes your face a lot.</span> <span id="s168">With blond hair, she was dark hair.</span> <span id="s169">And she got a little fatter too.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did she ever find out what became of her husband, your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: She never heard a word from him.</span> <span id="s172">I had later...after the war...I always believed...like I heard people are coming back that I would meet him.</span> <span id="s173">I was walking on the streets and looking at ll men’s faces.</span> <span id="s174">Maybe I would be the lucky one and my father would come from some concentration camp and I will meet him on the street.</span> <span id="s175">Like one year after the war I (still) believed I would be the lucky one.</span> <span id="s176">He never came.</span> <span id="s177">All these people from Ghetto Warsaw didn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: When you lived in the Ghetto and you talked before about the selection process, did your parents know what was happening to the people who were selected to go on the trains.</span> <span id="s179">Did they have any real information that people were being exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, they knew.</span> <span id="s181">But not in the beginning in Ghetto when the selections started.</span> <span id="s182">I think people believed that these people are taken to work like outside Warsaw.</span> <span id="s183">They didn’t know in the beginning.</span> <span id="s184">But later they knew already.</span> <span id="s185">My mother didn’t have this hopes like I had because I was more optimistic after the war.</span> <span id="s186">I read all the stories that some fathers are coming and some families are reunited.</span> <span id="s187">And I just thought I would be the lucky one.</span> <span id="s188">But my mother never had hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Can you remember your family telling you how they felt.</span> <span id="s190">Were they terrified?</span> <span id="s191">Were they angry?</span> <span id="s192">What kind of feelings did they have about this experience at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: My mother, during the war, never was terrified.</span> <span id="s194">I was too little to be terrified.</span> <span id="s195">My mother was very calm, very realistic.</span> <span id="s196">And I think she always talked about survival.</span> <span id="s197">And about having her child to survive.</span> <span id="s198">I don’t think even the loss of her husband was as bad as in our times now for a woman.</span> <span id="s199">She just...she lost so many people.</span> <span id="s200">She lost her whole family.</span> <span id="s201">Like...her husband really didn’t... She didn’t miss him.</span> <span id="s202">She had to work.</span> <span id="s203">She had to survive herself.</span> <span id="s204">She was very brave.</span> <span id="s205">I think no one in our times is as brave as people were in the time of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: I don’t think we can even understand how much bravery it took.</span> <span id="s207">Were you in the orphanage...the convent, and did your mother continue to work at the restaurant until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s209">I was in the convent in Warsaw only until the uprising in Warsaw, not Ghetto Warsaw.</span> <span id="s210">In Warsaw was uprising by Polish people, not by Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s212">I don’t think I know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I can’t tell you too much.</span> <span id="s214">Because I again was very lucky because it (the uprising) was in summer time and our orphanage went out of Warsaw to their place...like a suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s215">And we didn’t stay in the city.</span> <span id="s216">All the orphanage with the sisters, we survived because we weren’t in the town...in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Was it like a summer home, or a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: It was like camp, or like a summer vacation.</span> <span id="s219">All the orphanage went, because I was only one Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s220">It was in the beginning another Jewish girl, but I think she...they recognized that she was Jewish and they told her mother to take her away.</span> <span id="s221">I was the only one Jewish.</span> <span id="s222">I knew it wasn’t any other.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: What can you tell me about the Polish uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: About Polish uprising, I can’t tell you too much because I wasn’t (there) during this time, I was away.</span> <span id="s225">But my mother was in Warsaw... I think she ran away, I have to ask her, I never know exactly the times when...how she ran away.</span> <span id="s226">Because after...just before the end of war, my aunt came and stole me from this orphanage because if she wouldn’t come and take me just without asking she would have to go through courts and to prove that I am Jewish girl and I’m daughter of my mother.</span> <span id="s227">It would take too long.</span> <span id="s228">One day, just before the end, my aunt, my mother’s sister, came and just stole me.</span> <span id="s229">I went like I was in pair of underwear.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Just with the clothes on your back.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Just with the clothes on my back.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Where do you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: She brought me to my mother.</span> <span id="s234">That was maybe 20 kilometers from...it was close to Warsaw, suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s235">A little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Were you nervous about that?</span> <span id="s237">Were you excited?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I was very excited.</span> <span id="s239">I was very excited.</span> <span id="s240">Oh, I loved it.</span> <span id="s241">I remember my mother it was...I wasn’t a baby...I was just two and a half years there.</span> <span id="s242">It was such a good feeling.</span> <span id="s243">It wasn’t the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: About when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: It was in 1945.</span> <span id="s246">But it wasn’t...the war ended in May 1945.</span> <span id="s247">It was in spring, 1945.</span> <span id="s248">I don’t remember exactly the dates.</span> <span id="s249">I think my mother remembers so much better.</span> <span id="s250">She was grown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Then you and your mother lived together in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: We lived together in Poland.</span> <span id="s253">Later we moved to Lodz in Poland in 1945.</span> <span id="s254">And we stayed until 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Do you remember the day the war ended?</span> <span id="s256">How did people act?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I can’t really tell you.</span> <span id="s258">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s259">I just remember another very sad thing from Ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">Maybe I remember very sad things well and very good things well.</span> <span id="s261">That how child’s memory works.</span> <span id="s262">I remember in Ghetto little bodies of children in garbages.</span> <span id="s263">This I remember, you know, in like public garbages bodies of children.</span> <span id="s264">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: This was about when, before you went to the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Before in Ghetto, before I went to the convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Children who had starved?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Starved to death.</span> <span id="s269">And children begging for food on the streets.</span> <span id="s270">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Did you have enough to eat at the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I know only one word in Jewish from Ghetto, “rachmanus.”</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: What’s that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: That’s only one word I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I think help, or something (have pity).</span> <span id="s277">I remember this from Ghetto.</span> <span id="s278">I never spoke Jewish, I learned Hebrew in Israel.</span> <span id="s279">I remember little things like this that’s really funny.</span> <span id="s280">What I ate on day of selection that my grandparents were taken away.</span> <span id="s281">Because children have memory to little things.</span> <span id="s282">Like something stays in their memory.</span> <span id="s283">I didn’t like to remember the bad things.</span> <span id="s284">But they stayed with me, they stayed forever.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t remember a lot from the orphanage because they weren’t such a good things, it wasn’t something so good for me.</span> <span id="s286">I had always to remember to lie.</span> <span id="s287">There were a little things in orphanage that I went through that were hurting me.</span> <span id="s288">I had to go to First Communion.</span> <span id="s289">And I knew this is the biggest sin, to go to communion and not to have Christening.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: But it was a means of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: But I had to go.</span> <span id="s292">But I remember how the priests was telling...that the most...that this is a worst sin.</span> <span id="s293">And I was scared what I am doing.</span> <span id="s294">But I had to go.</span> <span id="s295">Because I had to lie.</span> <span id="s296">I had to lie.</span> <span id="s297">If I would tell now, I am Jewish, they would tell my nanny take me...take her.</span> <span id="s298">She can’t stay here, she’s Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s299">Because the sisters were scared too.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You said that you stayed in Poland from the end of the war, 1945, until 1950.</span> <span id="s301">Was that because you chose to stay or was it not possible to leave before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No, it was not possible to stay.</span> <span id="s303">My mother...the minute it was possible to go to Israel she decided we can’t stay one day longer.</span> <span id="s304">She just wanted to leave Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What was your life like during that five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: It was good.</span> <span id="s307">I lived with my mother and she worked.</span> <span id="s308">Wasn’t like the United States.</span> <span id="s309">It was

had to learn from the beginning.</span> <span id="s413">I didn’t know letters, the language was for me like Chinese.</span> <span id="s414">But in this age everything comes easy.</span> <span id="s415">I was falling asleep a little after four hours of work in the fields in the heat, but somehow I learned and I knew the language not too bad.</span> <span id="s416">And I decided that I have

id="s431">I finished my high school in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s432">The living place wasn’t as easy like United States but everything was working very good.</span> <span id="s433">Because I wasn’t yet as spoiled like I am now.</span> <span id="s434">I lived with my mother on fifth floor without elevator.</span> <span id="s435">I had in the morning to run to bring a big ice block to our ice box

child has to go to the army.</span> <span id="s446">I was already nineteen because I missed a little school.</span> <span id="s447">When you are eighteen, you have to go to the army.</span> <span id="s448">But all time you are in high school they postpone your service.</span> <span id="s449">I went at nineteen in 1954 and I stayed until 1956.</span> <span id="s450">I finished my army as a sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: What part of the army did you serve in?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I worked in computers.</span> <span id="s453">IBM computers in statistics.</span> <span id="s454">I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s455">I learned a lot too.</span> <span id="s456">Army was a great place to learn about life.</span> <span id="s457">And a good experience, because the training its only few weeks.</span> <span id="s458">The real training as a soldier.</span> <span id="s459">Later I worked with IBM as an operator.</span> <span id="s460">And I worked and learned during my army service.</span> <span id="s461">It was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Where did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I don’t regret a minute that I went for just two years.</span> <span id="s464">It was a good life...school of life.</span> <span id="s465">I wish my children would have this school of life I just don’t like when you have to go to army to fight.</span> <span id="s466">But if you are in a quiet time, it’s great for kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Good discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: It’s a good discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: They say that children who lived on kibbutz do very well in the army because they learn how to be cooperative and to work with other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: It’s easier...it’s easier for children from kibbutz, because they are not as spoiled.</span> <span id="s471">They have had a very hard life.</span> <span id="s472">I think any life in group with discipline is a good school of life.</span> <span id="s473">I wish many times my children will have a two years of discipline in the army.</span> <span id="s474">But not during war times.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Unfortunately we can’t pick and choose those times.</span> <span id="s476">How did you meet your husband?</span> <span id="s477">And how did you come to the United States.</span></p>

turn tape over) We came to United States.</span> <span id="s559">We didn’t have yet too much money.</span> <span id="s560">Like that we decided we will take Greyhound bus to see as much as we can.</span> <span id="s561">With mountains and highways.</span> <span id="s562">We went from San Francisco Greyhound.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: How long did you take to make this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Maybe ten months.</span> <span id="s565">I had some relatives in Los Angeles and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s566">He helped my husband...just one telephone call to get his first job later when he came back to New York City.</span> <span id="s567">He said he would just call some friends and my husband got in his profession as an engineer, civil engineer, his first job.</span> <span id="s568">We just start to...we could stay in United States.</span> <span id="s569">I went back to pick up the children and I stayed a few months in Israel.</span> <span id="s570">And he started to work.</span> <span id="s571">And my husband started like new life.</span> <span id="s572">I think America is really the land of opportunity and he always dream about it.</span> <span id="s573">He got opportunity and he started to work very hard.</span> <span id="s574">He had to start like from the beginning.</span> <span id="s575">All his experience from Africa, from Israel, from Poland was nothing.</span> <span id="s576">He had to start from beginning.</span> <span id="s577">He had to run forty floors up and down as superintendent of building in Newark, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s578">But he was happy, he liked it.</span> <span id="s579">And slowly he worked...he changed jobs and he opened his own company in New York City.</span> <span id="s580">He was very glad we made this move to the United States.</span> <span id="s581">We never complained, we were happy in Israel, we were happy in Africa, we were happy in Nepal, but I think America gives you opportunity more than any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: I have spoken to many people who were survivors of the Holocaust and almost everyone makes this comment somewhere along the line about the wonderful opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: My husband say it was maybe a little late.</span> <span id="s584">If he would came a little late that maybe like 40 years old he would have already a big experience and more behind him.</span> <span id="s585">But if you want you can always start a little later.</span> <span id="s586">It’s still time, it’s never too late.</span> <span id="s587">I think you can give to your children in America everything if you just want to work hard.</span> <span id="s588">The most important thing to give them is an education.</span> <span id="s589">And you really can give them here.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Before we stop the taping, I sort of directed what I wanted you to talk about.</span> <span id="s591">Are there things we would like to add or that you have remembered since we discussed other aspects of your earlier life that you would like to leave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I just would like to tell to other people, not to forget that it was Holocaust.</span> <span id="s593">And so many millions of Jewish people were murdered.</span> <span id="s594">And some people are hesitating and trying to say that it wasn’t...and it’s not true.</span> <span id="s595">It Holocaust that people went through.</span> <span id="s596">Terrible times and they lost families and I think they are very very brave...that they really could start their lives again and again even they lost so many close relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: That includes you.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, I was a child.</span> <span id="s599">I really didn’t start my life again.</span> <span id="s600">But like my mother went through her life alone from 1942.</span> <span id="s601">She never remarried.</span> <span id="s602">She gave me everything.</span> <span id="s603">I wish my children really remember what happened during this years of World War II.</span> <span id="s604">It’s hard to remind them because for them it is just history.</span> <span id="s605">But for me, it’s really my past and I think my life would be very different if I would have family, if I would have father.</span> <span id="s606">But children now take everything for granted.</span> <span id="s607">I think the most important things we have we take it for granted too.</span> <span id="s608">But I wish they will always have in their heart something... I don’t think they could have hatred toward German people because you can’t say...that’s a new generation now or toward Polish Catholic people, that’s a different generation.</span> <span id="s609">But I think people can’t forget what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s610">You have to read...it’s a history.</span> <span id="s611">But always remember not to let happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">WRAP-UP I think that’s an important message to conclude with.</span> <span id="s613">And it’s really the focus of our whole program.</span> <span id="s614">That you very much for allowing us to record your experiences.</span> <span id="s615">They’re really very valuable.</span></p></body></html>
