id="s11">01:01:02</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: So, let's begin with you introducing yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I'm Henry Cohen.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Manhattan, 73 years ago, I'll be 74 in June, and I think I was born on Henry Street in lower Manhattan, the lower East Side.</span> <span id="s15">And I don't know whether I was named after the street or whether the street was named after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell us about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My parents had a checkered career.</span> <span id="s18">They were both immigrants, they arrived from different communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907.</span> <span id="s19">My father was married at the time he arrived.</span> <span id="s20">And he and my mother met and they fell in love.</span> <span id="s21">And eventually they were married.</span> <span id="s22">But a lot of sturm und drang over many years.</span> <span id="s23">And so I, I, I was born in 1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What do you know about the towns – the villages where your parents came from and why did they want to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">01:03:08</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age.</span> <span id="s27">His mother died when he was very young.</span> <span id="s28">I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A Century of Time."</span> <span id="s29">And his father remarried a woman who had two small children.</span> <span id="s30">My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children.</span> <span id="s31">He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's bakery in the winter and putting it under his coat and running to the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese.</span> <span id="s32">So it was that kind of poverty.</span> <span id="s33">He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century.</span> <span id="s34">And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another town, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement – and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905.</span> <span id="s35">Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United States, leaving behind a wife and one or two children.</span> <span id="s36">My mother came from another town, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of.</span> <span id="s37">I picked this up at the Museum of the Diaspora in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:06:10 The population of the town declined by half – 25, 3,000 people.</span> <span id="s39">And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages.</span> <span id="s40">So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65.</span> <span id="s41">And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers.</span> <span id="s42">And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age.</span> <span id="s43">And the son-in-law, husband of sis– my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15.</span> <span id="s44">So she was sent to America.</span> <span id="s45">So, it's a story of great poverty, the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Can you tell us both of their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Can you tell us both of their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the family name.</span> <span id="s50">And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out the grandparent's names.</span> <span id="s51">Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died.</span> <span id="s52">His father's name was Israel Feivel.</span> <span id="s53">My mother’s father’s name was, I had it and I lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: You'll remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And the names of the towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My mother came from Ivye and my father came from Drozgenik which was a sort of a small spa.</span> <span id="s58">Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:09:05 And I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to trace through Lithuanian sources.</span> <span id="s60">Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What did your parents do here?</span> <span id="s62">When you were little, how did they make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, my father became a baker.</span> <span id="s64">My mother became a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s65">They happened to meet in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s66">My father's older brother lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother’s, but older than my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little baby at the time.</span> <span id="s67">And to keep things going they had boarders.</span> <span id="s68">So, there was a group of male boarders in one room where my father stayed.</span> <span id="s69">And my mother stayed with two or three female boarders in the kitchen on the floor.</span> <span id="s70">And that's how they met and shacked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think.</span> <span id="s73">They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it.</span> <span id="s74">Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way.</span> <span id="s75">And – but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, we grew up in a secular household.</span> <span id="s76">I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s77">We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle schools.</span> <span id="s78">And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward and reads that.</span> <span id="s79">And I went through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, high school, and even into their sem– the seminary for several years.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Tell us what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Well, the elementary school was somewhere in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">01:12:01</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: No, I mean the Workman's Circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist movement, the Bund.</span> <span id="s85">And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars.</span> <span id="s86">It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers.</span> <span id="s87">Mendele, Peretz, Sholom Aleichem, Ash, poets, but not taught Hebrew.</span> <span id="s88">And it was an anti-Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists.</span> <span id="s89">Anti-stateism, stateists.</span> <span id="s90">And I – when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign.</span> <span id="s91">After the war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about it.</span> <span id="s92">And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war.</span> <span id="s93">And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again.</span> <span id="s94">Because I felt I had been misguided, politically.</span> <span id="s95">And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky, who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">01:15:19 So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you.</span> <span id="s97">And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion and Labor and Mapai and kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s98">So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism – Zionist Poison."</span> <span id="s99">So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What, in what way had they misguided you?</span> <span id="s101">What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education.</span> <span id="s103">They were anti-stateist.</span> <span id="s104">They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl and Weizman and that group also.</span> <span id="s105">So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine.</span> <span id="s106">They were the ones who were organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring them to ships and sneaking them into Palestine.</span> <span id="s107">America was not open, the anti– there were no anti– there were no refugee immigration laws at the time.</span> <span id="s108">So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">01:18:00 I could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated.</span> <span id="s110">And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military.</span> <span id="s112">How did you go into it?</span> <span id="s113">Where did you go at first?</span> <span id="s114">What did you see and how did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s116">There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two.</span> <span id="s117">But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in.</span> <span id="s118">And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say.</span> <span id="s119">And the fellow across the desk is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight?"</span> <span id="s120">And we're; "uh, huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks, you know, to run the boats.</span> <span id="s121">And we leave the building and one of us says to the other, "You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better."</span> <span id="s122">So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in Europe.</span> <span id="s123">I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium.</span> <span id="s124">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: The year?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: 1944, then, September.</span> <span id="s127">And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder – Hürtgen Forest.</span> <span id="s128">And overnight the Hürtgen Forest had some very special qualities; it was a tall forest and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">01:21:06 And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded.</span> <span id="s130">So, that was my initiation into combat.</span> <span id="s131">But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against Germany.</span> <span id="s132">And I was with the ninth Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s133">Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the DP camp I went later, was in.</span> <span id="s134">My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries.</span> <span id="s135">And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways.</span> <span id="s136">Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen, Germany which is closest to the French border.</span> <span id="s137">I crossed the Ruhr River, Düren.</span> <span id="s138">I was in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s139">We then moved into the Rhine when that was over.</span> <span id="s140">And we were in Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn.</span> <span id="s141">Home to many governmental, German governmental offices.</span> <span id="s142">And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the Remagen bridge and they have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the site and we're crossing the bridge under direct fire from the other hills.</span> <span id="s143">Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge.</span> <span id="s144">And we establish a beach head on the other side.</span> <span id="s145">Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in New York, was in the public relations unit of the division that took the bridge originally.</span> <span id="s146">And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces.</span> <span id="s147">By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">01:24:04 In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American divisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the heights there above the river, they look out and they see the bridge is still standing.</span> <span id="s149">It was the only bridge still standing.</span> <span id="s150">And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley , General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, "Shall – which battle plan – shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the bridge standing?"</span> <span id="s151">And Ike says, "Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across."</span> <span id="s152">Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people.</span> <span id="s153">And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, get” – he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on."</span> <span id="s154">And that shortened the war by two or three months.</span> <span id="s155">And so – and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest – basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders.</span> <span id="s156">I adored Bradley.</span> <span id="s157">I adored Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s158">I thought they were the greatest in the world.</span> <span id="s159">And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig.</span> <span id="s160">We could have moved on to Berlin.</span> <span id="s161">But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't.</span> <span id="s162">And I, I feel great about having been a soldier.</span> <span id="s163">I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:27:01 It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier.</span> <span id="s165">I been, you know, battle after battle.</span> <span id="s166">I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the Ruhr Valley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s167">That was part of the rotation scheme.</span> <span id="s168">Letting different soldiers take a few days from the front line.</span> <span id="s169">And I went to Paris in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended.</span> <span id="s170">And I'm walking – I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story – I'm walking along the Champs-Élysées, and word spread that Roosevelt had died.</span> <span id="s171">Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he died.</span> <span id="s172">And then two days later I was back at the front.</span> <span id="s173">Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">Anyway, then because of my prior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself transferred to military government.</span> <span id="s175">There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade.</span> <span id="s176">And I had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who.</span> <span id="s177">We were in, in a county, incidentally, Landkreis, at Günzburg, which was between Ulm and Augsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn’t notice at the, time, from which the Mengele family comes.</span> <span id="s178">I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s179">And as part of my duties for a few months, I set up a hospital for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">01:30:02 And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular encounter.</span> <span id="s181">And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one.</span> <span id="s182">I set up the hospital and then I would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman.</span> <span id="s183">I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever, "Who's Daisy around here?"</span> <span id="s184">And I'd bring her in.</span> <span id="s185">And all the way she would complain, she's “eine anständige Frau,” she's a respectable woman, and so on.</span> <span id="s186">And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward.</span> <span id="s187">We had a group of nuns taking care of them.</span> <span id="s188">They were tested.</span> <span id="s189">Then by three days later they weren’t giving me any argument that they were respectable women.</span> <span id="s190">And, I remember once, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the group, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the Luftwaffe, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that.</span> <span id="s191">And the major, colonel, calls me in and tells me about it and I says, "Look, all you can do is give her a letter."</span> <span id="s192">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s194">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Just finish that last story about the hospital with the German woman, the one, what your supervisor said about the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s197">Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word.</span> <span id="s198">Which is my inspecting a – some hospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish displaced persons.</span> <span id="s199">I have absolutely no recall about it.</span> <span id="s200">If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP’s, I would have said "no."</span> <span id="s201">Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this hospital.</span> <span id="s202">And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem hospital in 1961.</span> <span id="s203">It's a subliminal yearning I have.</span> <span id="s204">Anyway, so, anyway, that county experience was a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s205">And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I was called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government.</span> <span id="s206">They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to Frankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish – two years of German in college, and Yiddish – I was used as a translator of German documents into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">02:03:16 And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar north of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant.</span> <span id="s208">That was printing military government documents.</span> <span id="s209">It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it.</span> <span id="s210">And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while going to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich.</span> <span id="s211">So, occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I was to Munich, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him.</span> <span id="s212">And then, in November, I learned that he was leaving Germany for, the States.</span> <span id="s213">He was going into the State Department Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in Wiesbaden one weekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and his name is Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow.</span> <span id="s214">He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right after it was formed.</span> <span id="s215">A very able fellow.</span> <span id="s216">Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and your interests?"</span></p> <p><span id="s217">02:06:03 You see, at the settlement house.</span> <span id="s218">my, one of my major assignments during the year and a half I was there, you had to do something in exchange for room and board, it was the South End House, was the second oldest settlement house in the country.</span> <span id="s219">It had been founded in 19 –1892 or 1893.</span> <span id="s220">He had to prepare a 50th annual report.</span> <span id="s221">He turned that assignment over to me.</span> <span id="s222">I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this and everything.</span> <span id="s223">I did the draft of the 50th annual report.</span> <span id="s224">This is how he and I became so close.</span> <span id="s225">Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed.</span> <span id="s226">And then I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my master's program on city planning, on the South End planning board.</span> <span id="s227">A history of that and what it did.</span> <span id="s228">So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests of experience and then the following morning he brought me into zone headquarters and Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from the Eastern Division.</span> <span id="s229">A marvelous woman, she just died about two years ago in Santa Barbara.</span> <span id="s230">She later became Chief Public Welfare Officer in Washington, D.C. And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind for me to go to Föhrenwald because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine woman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP’s.</span> <span id="s231">She seemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks as her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become the director.</span> <span id="s232">Anyway, then–</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Just before we get into that, I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was your feeling, when you were in the infantry, about the war?</span> <span id="s234">What did you think you were fighting against, your contact with Germans?</span> <span id="s235">And then as the information came out about the Holocaust, did you have any contact with it in anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, I guess I completely identified with the war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">02:09:05</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: I mean, you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt, that I had absolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war.</span> <span id="s239">I had, I – because of my German Yiddish, even in doing combat periods, I was always being used as an interpreter whenever we'd capture German prisoners.</span> <span id="s240">So, I had a lot of contact with German prisoners of war, army, whatever branch they were from.</span> <span id="s241">I had a lot of contact with the German civilians.</span> <span id="s242">I didn’t trust Germans.</span> <span id="s243">Didn't matter what they said to me.</span> <span id="s244">I was always doing my job.</span> <span id="s245">You know.</span> <span id="s246">In some ways, I have a one track mind and in the sense of being focused.</span> <span id="s247">And – then when we ended the war in Leipzig, I don't remember what date we arrived there, April 29th, 28th – May first – a week or two – week before the end of the war, they started – the commander started sending us across the river which is at Leipzig to a little peninsula there that's formed by another river and we were casing the joint before the Russians arrived and after a few days, there were tens of thousands of German troops running away from the Russians to the American zone.</span> <span id="s248">And we're just a few soldiers, and they're armed and we've got one rifle on our shoulder.</span> <span id="s249">We were marching thousands of German soldiers westward across the river.</span> <span id="s250">And I don't even remember how we got across the river.</span> <span id="s251">And so, I had a lot of contact.</span> <span id="s252">And down in the military government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans.</span> <span id="s253">Remember, I was having contacts with the Bürgermeisters and the chiefs of police and the health officials and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s254">But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the power.</span> <span id="s255">And it's interesting to me, Katie, and I don't understand it considering my background, but you've seen some of the pictures.</span> <span id="s256">I was, here I was a private and a corporal, but in the pictures that I have of UNRRA, you see the qualities with which I express, I visually express authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">02:12:03 So, you know, speaking to the DP’s, you can see, I don't know where it comes from.</span> <span id="s258">And, so, in my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, matter of factly, I'm never hemming or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and I'm, I, not making any judgments about them.</span> <span id="s259">This individual, that individual.</span> <span id="s260">A woman has venereal disease, we deal with that.</span> <span id="s261">I was not with any group that was opening concentration camps, I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the political dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur.</span> <span id="s262">I was not in that.</span> <span id="s263">Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's Stars and Stripes, whether American Armed Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s264">I don't think anybody was sending me the New York Times or the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune, but somehow I was in gathering.</span> <span id="s265">And it was obvious from what I did with regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system.</span> <span id="s266">And that I had strong feelings about it.</span> <span id="s267">Oh, powerful feelings about it.</span> <span id="s268">And when one thinks later about my last encounter in Germany with Dick Winslow and a colleague who was leaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump at it.</span> <span id="s269">I asked a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s270">It was a gradual, two day, weekend process.</span> <span id="s271">I was doing a lot of soul searching, incidentally.</span> <span id="s272">.</span> <span id="s273">Now that I think about it.</span> <span id="s274">Doing a lot of soul searching that weekend on other matters.</span> <span id="s275">I was soul searching about what I felt was the inanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into.</span> <span id="s276">I – at – I mean, remember, I was an educated young kid, a City College graduate and proud of that, MIT graduate and proud of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">02:15:04 And I was dealing with very – I was a private, I wasn't an officer – and dealing with these people in various situations.</span> <span id="s278">And that was not what was giving me my love for America.</span> <span id="s279">When I was running the printing plant I lived with some local group of soldiers.</span> <span id="s280">I was not, I was attached to them for room and board.</span> <span id="s281">My unit was in Frankfurt and I could see some of these guys were wheelers, dealers, black market.</span> <span id="s282">We were eating venison – where were they getting the fresh deer from?</span> <span id="s283">So, here were very close friends, spirits, over that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude.</span> <span id="s284">And I was just getting out all the pain of that experience to them.</span> <span id="s285">And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my Jewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Elaborate a little bit on that.</span> <span id="s287">You say your Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s288">Do you remember how that came into play?</span> <span id="s289">Or anything you thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh, well it's hard.</span> <span id="s291">It's my second nature.</span> <span id="s292">You know it's – people can't understand this about me, because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s293">I never touched foot in a synagogue, literally, until maybe 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s294">It was just not part of my background.</span> <span id="s295">Now, I do different things that bring me into that, even though I can’t believe what they're talking about.</span> <span id="s296">For me, it's history, not religion.</span> <span id="s297">And I can identify with the history, I can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief.</span> <span id="s298">And be proud of that and share the pain.</span> <span id="s299">No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate contribution to the world and to world civilization.</span> <span id="s300">For a variety of reasons and so on.</span> <span id="s301">You know, when I was a junior at college, sociology major, I was declared, whatever, an honor student.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">02:18:06 An honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit.</span> <span id="s303">But, in exchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project.</span> <span id="s304">And submit it and that would complete the terms of the thing.</span> <span id="s305">And I did a paper on the Jewish ghetto as a form of either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment.</span> <span id="s306">Remember, I was an urbanist.</span> <span id="s307">And I spent a good deal of those two years in the library studying Jewish history.</span> <span id="s308">Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of Venice and Prague and other places.</span> <span id="s309">And up to Louie Wirth's book on the ghetto, he is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s310">I – in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the incidents of different social economic indicators and medical indicators of Jews compared to other immigrant groups.</span> <span id="s311">I immersed myself in that material.</span> <span id="s312">It was really in a sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa.</span> <span id="s313">It was this feeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and changes, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other groups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that would improve the urban environment.</span> <span id="s314">And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were masters degrees in city planning at the time.</span> <span id="s315">I hardly, barely knew that there was a city planning commission in New York.</span> <span id="s316">I began putting it together in my own head.</span> <span id="s317">I went out, I found that the University of Iowa was virtually the only university in the country that had two summer sessions back to back.</span> <span id="s318">So, I applied and I went out to Iowa and I started taking courses in what I thought were – one would want me to know in order to put these things together.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">02:21:10 I took a course in surveying.</span> <span id="s320">I took a course in civil engineering.</span> <span id="s321">I took courses in calculus.</span> <span id="s322">I took courses in spherical trigonometry.</span> <span id="s323">In order, back then, sometime in early August, I'm in the library and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Times and somewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass – MIT is going to start offering a bachelors degree in city planning.</span> <span id="s324">So, I write the chairman of the program a letter saying, "I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this program if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate," and I get a letter back from him saying oh, they already have a masters program.</span> <span id="s325">I wouldn't have to take the baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters program.</span> <span id="s326">And he was then the one, he gave me a scholarship, and he was then the one who guided me to the settlement house for, so I could live cheaply.</span> <span id="s327">My parents or I, we'd survive with food on the table during the depression, but that's how I got to the settlement house.</span> <span id="s328">And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program, Fred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had done the major New York regional plan of 1929, 1930.</span> <span id="s329">And, so it was, again, it was in that Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you.</span> <span id="s330">I didn't have to go to shul or synagogue–</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Do you remember when you decided to take the job what you're thoughts were?</span> <span id="s332">Perhaps some of this was in your mind about, "I do know these things, maybe I could run a camp because I know about city and–"</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: You know, the only part of – I say the only part of the experience that I didn't have, the content was no problem.</span> <span id="s334">The human relationships were no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">02:24:03 The analytic component was no problem.</span> <span id="s336">The listing of tasks to be taken care of was no problem.</span> <span id="s337">I come across three pages of notes in my background stuff outlining all the, tasks to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s338">That was no problem.</span> <span id="s339">The only part of the experience that I didn't have was supervising other people.</span> <span id="s340">And – but I should add a thought here – which was, I just think of it, I never, I have not made this connection before, Katie.</span> <span id="s341">You have to understand, Sept – September, 1942, I'm coming from the ghetto in East New York, Brooklyn, from the entire ghetto of my life, and I'm moving into Boston, into a settlement house, with a group, not only with the staff, that has no Jews on it, but, but a group of residents who are also living there, none of, no one else of whom is Jewish.</span> <span id="s342">I'm the kid on the block.</span> <span id="s343">And I make a terrific adaptation.</span> <span id="s344">They loved me.</span> <span id="s345">I was getting such love back from this diversified group of people – all of whom were older than me.</span> <span id="s346">It's like what I'm telling you, what I told you earlier, about my mentors.</span> <span id="s347">I don't know how they, why, how they attached to me.</span> <span id="s348">They saw something in me.</span> <span id="s349">I never set out to get them as it were.</span> <span id="s350">And here the, we had, there was a Peruvian couple, or Chile, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s351">Chile.</span> <span id="s352">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s353">There was a Chilean couple, a Peruvian guy, two women musical students, one from Kentucky and one from somewhere else.</span> <span id="s354">People from Illinois and this and that.</span> <span id="s355">And they loved me.</span> <span id="s356">It was a supportive environment.</span> <span id="s357">So, I guess that experience of who I was in some way played into my ability to move into this international staff and manage with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">02:27:03 Because you see, in a certain sense, intellectually, intellectually I was their equal.</span> <span id="s359">Analytically, I was probably ahead of most of them.</span> <span id="s360">Even in my ability to size up political situations.</span> <span id="s361">I was probably pretty good.</span> <span id="s362">Given, you know, given my military government experience of working, again, with the military.</span> <span id="s363">I haven't mentioned that the military government team must have included 15, 20 other people with whom I was relating all the time.</span> <span id="s364">Or when I was going into Frankfurt, into SHAEF and related, so I had a lot of relationship experience.</span> <span id="s365">So, I guess I overcame the lack of administrative, working with older people, administrative experience.</span> <span id="s366">And I must have had some charismatic quality that I don't, still don't quite recognize, 'cause I'm insecure, Katie.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Okay, now–</span></p> <p><span id="s368">02:28:26 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s370">03:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Paint us a picture, then, of that first day you were taken to the camp, were you in uniform – remind us how old you were, what did it look like to you – at first I presume someone might have taken you around – what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, the camp, I came in the middle of January.</span> <span id="s373">I was wearing a new uniform.</span> <span id="s374">An officer style, you know.</span> <span id="s375">The camp consisted of about 280 buildings.</span> <span id="s376">It was built by the I.G. Farben Company to house slave labor that they were employing in a munitions factory in the woods to the south.</span> <span id="s377">The buildings, because it was for slave labor, were not typical detached, semi– detached buildings.</span> <span id="s378">They, they had no kitchen facilities, no cooking facilities.</span> <span id="s379">The only communal facility in each building was a toilet or two.</span> <span id="s380">They, the buildings consisted of one large room on the top floor, second floor, and one small room on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s381">Food was dispensed in a kitchen area.</span> <span id="s382">People would go, wait on line, get food, either eat it there or come back to the room and eat it.</span> <span id="s383">Having gotten rid of the slave labor, the Army took over this village for DP’s and it gradually became a Jewish camp before I got there.</span> <span id="s384">It was also cold.</span> <span id="s385">Bavarian winter is awful.</span> <span id="s386">I had spent the previous winter in the Black Forest – parts of the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s387">It – we slept outdoors, in, in fox holes.</span> <span id="s388">There was a constant flow of soldiers who, what did they call it, black, not black foot, black something or other, they's lose their digits, their toes, their feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Frostbite?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, there was another name for it.</span> <span id="s391">I was cold, but I never suffered from that.</span> <span id="s392">But anyway, these winters are very cold.</span> <span id="s393">Anyway, I went around camp, I met the staff.</span> <span id="s394">I don't have much recall of that the first few days in that sense.</span> <span id="s395">I was absorbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">03:04:51 Visiting the kitchen, seeing how they cooked.</span> <span id="s397">Visiting the hospital.</span> <span id="s398">We had two hospital buildings.</span> <span id="s399">And I don't remember now exactly, but within a week or two of my arrival, the, the, the cold was so substantial that it froze the pipes leading to the toilets.</span> <span id="s400">Four hundred out of 600 toilets were out of commission.</span> <span id="s401">The area of the toilets became like a cow barn, like cow barns.</span> <span id="s402">It was awful.</span> <span id="s403">It was awful.</span> <span id="s404">It took several weeks to deal with the pipe problem.</span> <span id="s405">As someone said it, "gets worse until it gets better."</span> <span id="s406">But, you have to remember, and I'll, I'll, I'll be making notes on this along with, that that was happening to them eight and a half months after liberation.</span> <span id="s407">They were living under conditions like that, And, anyway, it was during that period that Jean Henshaw, the former director left.</span> <span id="s408">I assumed the directorship.</span> <span id="s409">And I should tell you, just somewhere in here, because I can't remember which comes first and which comes second.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">03:07:08 There was a subsidiary group attached to the team, we had a few people from Joint Distribution Committee attached to us, we had a group of three, four, five people from the Jewish Agency for Palestine.</span> <span id="s411">Remember, this is two years before the creation of the state.</span> <span id="s412">We're now into February of '46, and, and also because of my background, I'd never dealt with Zionists before.</span> <span id="s413">The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist organizations, but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before.</span> <span id="s414">But, nevertheless, there's this group.</span> <span id="s415">And they, after, we had a large house for the team, over 20 members of the team.</span> <span id="s416">They came from Australia, Norway, England, France, U.S., elsewhere, I don't, and Israel, and Palestine.</span> <span id="s417">And we had billets.</span> <span id="s418">We were billeted in a large house at the edge of the German town, which was called Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s419">And, and so, and we'd have breakfast there, sometimes lunch, and usually dinner.</span> <span id="s420">After dinner they invite me to one of their rooms for a drink or whatever.</span> <span id="s421">And it was in the course of that, that I established with them and they established with me, very close relationships.</span> <span id="s422">But they, being sophisticated undergrounders, which I was not, at that time, start asking, you know, warmly asking me questions like you are asking the questions.</span> <span id="s423">"Where did your mother come from?</span> <span id="s424">Where did your father?"</span> <span id="s425">But that's all preliminary.</span> <span id="s426">They're sizing me up, could they trust me or not trust me?</span> <span id="s427">You're not asking me questions like that in order to ascertain whether you can trust me or not, you're asking me questions for oral history.</span> <span id="s428">They're asking me the questions to ascertain, can they trust me?</span> <span id="s429">And after several weeks of this process, it basically boils down to they trust me.</span> <span id="s430">They trust me.</span> <span id="s431">Okay.</span> <span id="s432">However, in underground activity, there's another rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">03:10:05 And that is, you never share with anyone anything more than that person has to know.</span> <span id="s434">So, the person has deniability.</span> <span id="s435">Okay?</span> <span id="s436">So, I am not curious and they are not volunteering information.</span> <span id="s437">I notice things from time to time around the edges.</span> <span id="s438">Okay?</span> <span id="s439">For example, one of them says to me one, "I don't know, Friday or whatever, would you like to go to Salzburg for the weekend and hear some music?"</span> <span id="s440">And I say, "Sure, but I don't have any – the appropriate papers."</span> <span id="s441">He says, "Don't worry about it."</span> <span id="s442">And, en route, we drive north, which was not the right direction, to Munich, and we stop in front of a building and they go inside, I'm in the car.</span> <span id="s443">I've given them some of my papers.</span> <span id="s444">They come out with appropriate visa papers and all of that to cross over and come back to the American zone.</span> <span id="s445">We go to Salzburg, we drive to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s446">And we had a wonderful weekend.</span> <span id="s447">A month later, whatever, one of them says, "How would you like to go to Switzerland?"</span> <span id="s448">So, they were organizing my leisure time for me with false papers.</span> <span id="s449">I don't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s450">I just go along for the ride.</span> <span id="s451">These are the Jewish Agency for Palestine.</span> <span id="s452">The, Ben Gurion, at that time, was the chief executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.</span> <span id="s453">I get to know the zone chief of this group in Munich who years later, almost 30 years later, 25 to 30 years later, becomes, what do they call it, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</span> <span id="s454">And, incidentally, and that's like 19– that was in '64, but then I discovered a few years later that he lost a son, in the '67 war.</span> <span id="s455">So, it brings these things close to home.</span> <span id="s456">Anyway, that was the group.</span> <span id="s457">But I developed a closeness to the Joint staff, Stanley Abramovitch was a rabbi from England, Becky Althoff was a social worker from New York, and we had a marvelous woman from Norway, Astrid Oksny.</span> <span id="s458">I tried to trace her some years ago and I found out she had passed away prematurely.</span> <span id="s459">Then in early March, the Americans are blowing up things in the I.G. Farben plant.</span> <span id="s460">And in the process, they destroy the water main that is carrying water to the camp.</span> <span id="s461">And I start calling desperately for the Army to get water tanks in and do something.</span> <span id="s462">We get a few tanks, the few tanks that come in we turn over to the hospital facility.</span> <span id="s463">But there's no cooking that takes place during that, toilets again.</span> <span id="s464">Then by the fourth or fifth day, I am out of my mind, and I start calling my headquarters and so on.</span> <span id="s465">Finally, a general appears and that leads to, but it shows also how in a period of crises, how hard it was to get the U.S. Army to pay attention to a real problem.</span> <span id="s466">And now, throughout all of this, these trials and tribulations, we also have a lot of very positive things going on.</span> <span id="s467">We organize a theater.</span> <span id="s468">We organize schools for the children.</span> <span id="s469">There's a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s470">We have hospital going, children are being, babies are being born, at an enormous clip for that size population.</span> <span id="s471">We – We're running an agricultural training center to the south.</span> <span id="s472">Where they're learning how to work on a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s473">Now there's little, probably a little military activity on the side, but I don't know about it.</span> <span id="s474">But it's a positive education of these people who until the previous May, have lived under the most forlorn situations.</span> <span id="s475">The children are giving performances.</span> <span id="s476">The adults are putting on plays and they're starting to publish a camp newspaper in Yiddish, and a magazine.</span> <span id="s477">And we – there's established a camp committee for self governance and there's, there are elections for membership on the camp committee and 1,000 to 2,000 people are voting in the elections in order to make the camp committee representative.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">03:16:22 And I'm dealing with them.</span> <span id="s479">And we have over 1,000 people employed in tasks in the kitchen, in the warehouse, in the transportation unit, in the hospital.</span> <span id="s480">We're employing people.</span> <span id="s481">We have vocational training activity.</span> <span id="s482">Machinery and other things; sewing, that's going on.</span> <span id="s483">There are a lot of positive emotional rebuilding efforts here.</span> <span id="s484">But, the food is basically GI issue.</span> <span id="s485">It's canned.</span> <span id="s486">It's not fresh.</span> <span id="s487">They, the Army, doesn't want to take it out of the German economy.</span> <span id="s488">There's three ounces of protein a day.</span> <span id="s489">Whether a piece of canned fish or canned chicken or this or that.</span> <span id="s490">You have it at one meal, you don't have it at any of the others.</span> <span id="s491">So, a black market in food develops.</span> <span id="s492">And the Army is beside itself as if its going to destroy the German economy.</span> <span id="s493">But who's selling to them?</span> <span id="s494">The German farmers.</span> <span id="s495">They're probably selling to some of the military government units to, so, but in order to prove myself, my– and, basically, I don't like black marketing.</span> <span id="s496">I was telling you earlier how I was reacting moralistically to black marketing among the soldiers.</span> <span id="s497">I didn't want Jews to be involved in the black market, it offends me, it's a backwards step in community building.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">03:18:14 So, I have to do something.</span> <span id="s499">Now, it occurs to me when I read all this stuff that, "How did they get the cows into the camp?"</span> <span id="s500">They were probably leading them past our DP police group that was on duty in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s501">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s502">But, at least once a month, I would get up in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s503">All by myself.</span> <span id="s504">I'd drive into the camp alone.</span> <span id="s505">I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around the camp, looking for lights in the basement.</span> <span id="s506">If there were a light in the basement, it meant, usually, that a butcher was killing a cow.</span> <span id="s507">And on the 29 days of the month that I didn't come around, word would spread in the morning, "there's meat in 'x' building, 'x' street," and people would start flowing and buying meat.</span> <span id="s508">I don't know where they got the money, whatever.</span> <span id="s509">So, I'd come in and I'd confiscate the meat and I'd, we'd bury it.</span> <span id="s510">We didn't throw it into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s511">And I'd put the butchers into the brig. And during the day I'd visit them and I remember one of them saying, "Herr Cohen, you don't understand us butchers.</span> <span id="s512">For us blood means nothing.</span> <span id="s513">The cows are yours."</span> <span id="s514">I'd say to the police, "Give them an extra day."</span> <span id="s515">I didn’t turn them over to the Army, I didn't turn them over to the German police.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: How did you feel, though, about taking food away which you, yourself, just said was needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I felt awful.</span> <span id="s518">I was, but, but, I want to tell you something, Katie, as I read these various memos and records, and having been in, in government for the years – I was, nine years in Mayor Wagner's cabinet – governance is constantly involving you in dilemmas and difficult choices.</span> <span id="s519">Impossible choices, hair-raising choices.</span> <span id="s520">And it's happening all the time.</span> <span id="s521">And if you can't make choices, you got to get out of there.</span> <span id="s522">You know, this antigovernment stuff, for me, is in some ways, a lot of nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">03:21:04 Because a democratic society has to have a system where, without killing, you make choices.</span> <span id="s524">And, so, in a DP camp, the director has to make difficult, impossible choices.</span> <span id="s525">And, so, but, I don't want to get to this too soon in the interview, but, on something like April 12th of that year, a week before Pesach, I went to the Munich railroad station and I sent off a couple of cables to the – to friends in the States.</span> <span id="s526">I sent one cable to Dick Winslow in the State Department and another cable to William Wurster a prominent architect at that time, in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s527">And I tell them about the food situation.</span> <span id="s528">The impossibility of it – no fresh food for Pesach – we got a little bit from the Joint.</span> <span id="s529">And the end, the end of my sentence is, "stir up the bees."</span> <span id="s530">And I get replies from both of them.</span> <span id="s531">But, I hadn't given it a thought at the time, but it's clear to me in – then and in retrospect, that Army Intelligence picked up the cables.</span> <span id="s532">And I'll come back to that later.</span> <span id="s533">Just on a personal note, during the period we were without water, when the pipe had burst, which was exhausting period for me, I came back to my office one day to take care of some matters, and a few minutes later, my English secretary, Rose Hafkin, comes in, she says, "Henry, there's a woman outside who says she thinks she's your cousin."</span> <span id="s534">And I say, "Well, have her wait few minutes, I've got to take care of this or that," and then a few minutes later I call her in.</span> <span id="s535">And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not.</span> <span id="s536">It would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin.</span> <span id="s537">So, I start interrogating her.</span> <span id="s538">Anyway, I don't know whether she found out about me through the grapevine, because people are always asking, "Where did your parents come from?"</span> <span id="s539">and then when they hear someone comes from that town, well, "Oh, the director at Camp Föhrenwald, his mother comes from there, his father comes from there."</span></p> <p><span id="s540">03:24:00 Well, whether there had been some correspondence between her and family in New York, I don't know.</span> <span id="s541">She's my cousin.</span> <span id="s542">And, she comes from the Sheftel branch of the family tree, my mother’s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side.</span> <span id="s543">It turns out she has a brother in the camp to whom she doesn't talk, he's a butcher.</span> <span id="s544">He's probably one of my black marketers.</span> <span id="s545">I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat.</span> <span id="s546">It's a small world.</span> <span id="s547">But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living in, just north of Munich and the sister has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight, nine, 10.</span> <span id="s548">And, I ask her, "How did you survive?"</span> <span id="s549">Well, what happened was, the Germans had occupied the town Ivye, and at a certain point they told – word spread, everybody had to come out to the village square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the metal.</span> <span id="s550">My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the woods and lived the rest of the war with the partisans.</span> <span id="s551">And her older sister must have left sometime earlier and gone into Siberia with her little girl and spent the war in Siberia.</span> <span id="s552">And, so it was a very moving experience.</span> <span id="s553">And, she has since, they migrated many years ago to Canada, Toronto, and became very wealthy.</span> <span id="s554">Now, another thing involving the black market, the so called black market–</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: The people who went to the town square, were they deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No, they were shot, I'm sorry, they were shot.</span> <span id="s557">I'm very sorry.</span> <span id="s558">Very few survivors from Ivye.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Your mother’s town?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And the, how about the brother that she didn't speak with?</span> <span id="s562">How had he survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I don't recall.</span> <span id="s564">There was other family of theirs in South Africa, Rhodesia.</span> <span id="s565">Other brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, here you were, the director of the Displaced Person's camp, you’re dealing with everything, fought in a war, you have family here.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No.</span> <span id="s568">At the end of the interview, I'll give you another find.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Okay</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: That's not in any of the material that you've read.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">End of tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s573">04:01:06</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, her name was Malka and the second names mean nothing because – her sister had an assumed name, Bashke – they were both Sheftels.</span> <span id="s575">Now, Malka, somewhere in this process, maybe in the woods or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of her life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband.</span> <span id="s576">And – but, but it's hard to recall now.</span> <span id="s577">Malka was probably born after my mother left, and Bashke was probably born after my mother left Ivye, so there was no contact on that score.</span> <span id="s578">By the time they would have had any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had any memory about my mother’s mother, no longer lived in Ivye.</span> <span id="s579">She went, they took her to some town, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s580">So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't really remember much of that.</span> <span id="s581">That is – the critical thing was, they were family, they were survivors, they had been through hell, and I didn't really find out too much about their day to day lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">04:03:15 I have the impression about the older sister in Siberia.</span> <span id="s583">She'd be groveling in the soil, planting, picking, whatever.</span> <span id="s584">I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way, what I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who survived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories.</span> <span id="s585">So, in a certain sense there are 100 to 200,000,00 stories.</span> <span id="s586">And we know only a few of them.</span> <span id="s587">And that was not an age for me when I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it – the – it – my focus on what I'm about, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time.</span> <span id="s588">When people want to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three on the list, see?</span> <span id="s589">So, I don't really remember that much about that.</span> <span id="s590">In any event, the passage of time also dims recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Was there ever a time when you were focused on solving a problem, perhaps a broken water pipe or something, and just somehow the fact that someone was a survivor, sort of caught you by surprise?</span> <span id="s592">Perhaps something they said, or the way they looked, facial expressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: You know – the – a couple of stories sometimes.</span> <span id="s594">I don't know if you have that picture in your group.</span> <span id="s595">There are four little girls, they're all dressed in costumes.</span> <span id="s596">It's clear they've just been in some performance.</span> <span id="s597">And two of the four girls, the two little ones on the, each side, left and right, have faces that are so gaunt and with that smile on their face, the visage.</span> <span id="s598">The two older ones are smiling.</span> <span id="s599">The two little ones, here it is, you know, close to a year after the war, and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them, hasn't yet enabled them to blossom out.</span> <span id="s600">The other, I don’t know whether this answers – deals with your question, Katie, but, again, it's an encounter, a very severe encounter.</span> <span id="s601">We had, in our camp, a Rabbi Halberstam.</span> <span id="s602">He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi.</span> <span id="s603">He was a, from a line of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s604">I'm gonna, I'll come back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two.</span> <span id="s605">I've been trying to find out his first name.</span> <span id="s606">I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't locate the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s607">So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and look up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi.</span> <span id="s608">And what was his first name.</span> <span id="s609">Okay?</span> <span id="s610">So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992 Brooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s611">Okay?</span> <span id="s612">And I see Halberstam, it's almost a column long.</span> <span id="s613">And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how many have attached to their name, "Rabbi."</span> <span id="s614">So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count.</span> <span id="s615">Forty-three percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names.</span> <span id="s616">That's the Halberstam lineage, okay?</span> <span id="s617">I use statistics to illuminate, not lie.</span> <span id="s618">I mean that is such a powerful fact, okay?</span> <span id="s619">So, anyway, we're back.</span> <span id="s620">So, now, he had lost his wife in the Holocaust, and maybe 10 children.</span> <span id="s621">This man had suffered.</span> <span id="s622">Deeply is not an expression for the suffering that must have been inside this man.</span> <span id="s623">And he was in touch with his confreres in New York, and they raised money.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">04:10:01 And they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing, religious articles, books on a boat that came, arrived in Bremen.</span> <span id="s625">And the Army would not release the material to Rabbi Halberstam.</span> <span id="s626">And the cables must have flown between Bremen and Munich and New York and New York and Washington and political pressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally after a week or two, a compromise is reached.</span> <span id="s627">They will release his – that material to the director of the camp.</span> <span id="s628">So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do I do with that material?</span> <span id="s629">Can I – considering the pressure I am under from the Army on the black market, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam?</span> <span id="s630">So, I am summoned to his room.</span> <span id="s631">He was one of the very few people in the camp who had a room of his own.</span> <span id="s632">Somewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot.</span> <span id="s633">And I'm sitting across him, across the table from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big black beard, yarmulke hat, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">04:12:18 Black piercing eyes.</span> <span id="s635">And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a synagogue in my life to that point – nor for two or three decades later – and here I am confronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king – I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat.</span> <span id="s636">And we exchanged perfunctory greetings.</span> <span id="s637">And then in effect he says, "Nu?"</span> <span id="s638">I say, "Nu, what?"</span> <span id="s639">He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him.</span> <span id="s640">I say, "But Rabbi, if the Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you directly.</span> <span id="s641">But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you."</span> <span id="s642">He says, "That's not fair."</span> <span id="s643">I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come for 15 years later, "life is unfair."</span> <span id="s644">I said, "I can't.</span> <span id="s645">It would create so much trouble, I can't tell you."</span> <span id="s646">He says, "It belongs to me."</span> <span id="s647">I say, "I know it belongs to you, but I can't.</span> <span id="s648">I will distribute it among the people of the camp.</span> <span id="s649">You will get a good share of it, but you will not get all of it."</span> <span id="s650">He is so upset.</span> <span id="s651">His eyes are piercing through me.</span> <span id="s652">I finally say to him, "But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered."</span> <span id="s653">He basically, didn't give a damn.</span> <span id="s654">I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before.</span> <span id="s655">Here I am, an all inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with unbridgeable attitudes or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">04:15:05 The meeting broke up and I left.</span> <span id="s657">And I knew it wasn't fair.</span> <span id="s658">I knew, to this day, I know it wasn't fair.</span> <span id="s659">The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position.</span> <span id="s660">But, again, I had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s661">I had to choose.</span> <span id="s662">And, and, I made that choice.</span> <span id="s663">I mean, I don't recall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but it was that incident, you see.</span> <span id="s664">Constantly.</span> <span id="s665">Now, let me just say, not only was the black market, this problem.</span> <span id="s666">You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it.</span> <span id="s667">But, the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem.</span> <span id="s668">The British clearly didn't want more Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s669">And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the National Archives and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the National Archives, trying to get some better understanding of the context.</span> <span id="s670">And, incidentally, you find some very interesting material there on that.</span> <span id="s671">I mean, for example, you come across cables, in late '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every country in the world, asking on a top secret basis, "Is there any room in your – in the country you are designated to, is there any room for Jews?"</span> <span id="s672">And then you see cables coming back – I don't think I've read all the cables coming back – but substantially, the answer is "no."</span> <span id="s673">But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department, under pressure from the British with regard to Palestine, want to explore what are the options?</span> <span id="s674">Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the Eastern countries, Poland, Sweden, Copenhagen, relating to the Zionist plot to move people into the U.S. zone of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">04:18:51 And.</span> <span id="s676">some rabbi whose been to Poland, meets with the American Ambassador in Stockholm and he's telling him about what he found.</span> <span id="s677">Anyway, you come across all this stuff.</span> <span id="s678">And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy.</span> <span id="s679">I've been exploring this in order to understand what I was in the middle of, you see?</span> <span id="s680">Finally, I don't remember the date now, there's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy, whose the chief political officer at the office of military government, he was Ike's chief political officer in Tunisia, North Africa, and he's basically saying, "You're not dealing basically with a conspiracy.</span> <span id="s681">You're dealing – what you’re dealing with is the fact that the Jews don't want to live in a country that was a cemetery to their people, their relatives.</span> <span id="s682">They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are killings.</span> <span id="s683">They know that the country is going Communist, they don't want to live under a Communist government.</span> <span id="s684">It's in this atmosphere – to get out of this that the Zionists are enabling.</span> <span id="s685">It's not a conspiracy, okay?"</span> <span id="s686">So, that's at the highest level of military government.</span> <span id="s687">You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for the battalion leaders, is the infiltration.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">04:21:00 So, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had prior food cards.</span> <span id="s689">We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity cards.</span> <span id="s690">How do you think we feel if, if in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this team, you're there for social humanitarian purposes.</span> <span id="s691">How do you feel being told you can't give out these cards to people who are infiltrating?</span> <span id="s692">Okay?</span> <span id="s693">Now, I should point out–</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: How do you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: You feel awful.</span> <span id="s696">And rebellious.</span> <span id="s697">And you're gonna bootleg cards somehow.</span> <span id="s698">And, and, I should tell you this anecdote.</span> <span id="s699">Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at midnight, you can ask – start asking, "When did I get some sleep?"</span> <span id="s700">I would go to the camp, pick up a few cops, maybe this time I've had a staff or two with me, and we would start going into every building and every room and taking a count of who is there – name, and who is there.</span> <span id="s701">We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people in the camp.</span> <span id="s702">The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check.</span> <span id="s703">A thousand or more people from all over Germany would suddenly descend on you.</span> <span id="s704">They were in Munich to see a relative.</span> <span id="s705">They were in Munich to check on their papers.</span> <span id="s706">They were here because of that, they were – you don't know which of them are telling the truth and who, and who is lying.</span> <span id="s707">So, some end up with duplicate cards.</span> <span id="s708">Okay?</span> <span id="s709">You're making difficult decisions, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So, you're trying to control who's in the camp, but what you're saying said, people are coming in, maybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't want them to, or UNRRA doesn't want them to–</span></p> <p><span id="s711">04:23:44</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s713">I'm making two – I'm really talking about two categories.</span> <span id="s714">I'm talking about the people who are already in Germany and who are, who are exploiting the system by getting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the black market and get a little cash.</span> <span id="s715">Okay?</span> <span id="s716">And the other is the fresh arrivals.</span> <span id="s717">Okay?</span> <span id="s718">And the Army is against the fresh arrivals.</span> <span id="s719">They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they don't want any more.</span> <span id="s720">Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says – remember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's going on in the States, so they – their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's different at the ground.</span> <span id="s721">Well, let me just state something else, Katie.</span> <span id="s722">You're too young – You have to understand that in the 1930s – I didn’t experience the 1920s, I was a child – but in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the United States.</span> <span id="s723">A lot of ordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings.</span> <span id="s724">They're your troops.</span> <span id="s725">It's reflected – if you ask doctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, "What was it like getting into medical school in the 1930s?"</span> <span id="s726">You'll hear stories.</span> <span id="s727">My brother – I spoke to a fellow up on the vineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at Johns Hopkins, he graduated as an undergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at Johns Hopkins, was not admitted to the medical school.</span> <span id="s728">Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime in the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns – of medicine at Johns Hopkins.</span> <span id="s729">There was antisemitism, this is the – people don't speak about it now.</span> <span id="s730">I mean, it wasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various places, Germany, certainly Poland.</span> <span id="s731">But, there was lots.</span> <span id="s732">So when you – when, at the ground floor level they, the infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience.</span> <span id="s733">It upsets the system.</span> <span id="s734">They want discipline – order, that's all an occupation force understands.</span> <span id="s735">I, I, I, I came across a letter someone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training program in the States as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this.</span> <span id="s736">So, you come into here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash.</span> <span id="s737">Okay?</span> <span id="s738">It–</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: What did you want though?</span> <span id="s740">As you're running the camp, but you're also, you're Jewish, and as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a place like Poland.</span> <span id="s741">So, what do you want?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Well, I want more camps.</span> <span id="s743">I mean it's no, no big deal.</span> <span id="s744">Okay?</span> <span id="s745">Let me, I want to address this.</span> <span id="s746">In Germany, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were between 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons.</span> <span id="s747">Of these, about 65,000 lived in camps and 25,000 lived outside of camps.</span> <span id="s748">In June of '46, which is towards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the infiltrees, don't give any – incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting these things.</span> <span id="s749">The, the UNRRA people in other places were also, we used to get together and organize group protests against some of this – but, in the middle of June, there's a pogrom in Poland, in Kielce – 40 Jews are killed.</span> <span id="s750">I think in the next year, after I left, another 100,000 came.</span> <span id="s751">These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're talking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in Germany.</span> <span id="s752">Equivalent to one and a half percent.</span> <span id="s753">And if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the, no, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent.</span> <span id="s754">I mean – the proportion between what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the – you should want more survivors rather than less.</span> <span id="s755">And the political system worldwide has to adjust to that reality.</span> <span id="s756">And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people are still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my memos an indication of some officer in some group situation, in a court or something, suddenly arrests a Jew who's there.</span> <span id="s757">And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">04:30:34</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: We need to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s762">05:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Okay, I can't find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it.</span> <span id="s764">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: What we were just talking about, obviously, there's frustration in your voice about the situation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year after the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped quarters, that had echoes of concentration camps – obviously they were worse.</span> <span id="s766">Could you just talk a little more about that frustration.</span> <span id="s767">What would you have liked to have seen happening that you could not provide?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Well, you see, given the camp itself, which did not have individual kitchens – though gradually, people got cookers and things like that – I would have wanted them to move into the German market and get fresh food a year after the end, the war’s ended.</span> <span id="s769">What are we getting GI issue for?</span> <span id="s770">I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing facilities.</span> <span id="s771">So, in a room, in the large room, of the houses, of the houses, which could be the equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as many as 15 to 20 people living.</span> <span id="s772">Four or five families in double-decker cots.</span> <span id="s773">Families separating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling – including some single individuals living in the middle of family – and people, and so on, and children and so on.</span> <span id="s774">They should have gotten more housing.</span> <span id="s775">Reduced the population of the camp to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say.</span> <span id="s776">And the food was a problem.</span> <span id="s777">But they, basically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word.</span> <span id="s778">And it's a completely, it was a completely different outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">05:04:24 You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI’s were fraternizing with German girls and German women – widespread, extensive.</span> <span id="s780">The German types were more gemütlich to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern European.</span> <span id="s781">So, during the day you're out in the field and at night you're with a German Fräulein.</span> <span id="s782">I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so engaged.</span> <span id="s783">But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running – when I was in military government, organizing and running that venereal disease hospital, a couple of officers from some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain woman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s784">And I had to stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he – turns out he was a really wonderful guy, a lawyer from Florida and say, "We can't do it.</span> <span id="s785">She's got to stay inside the hospital."</span> <span id="s786">But, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal disease because she's one of their girlfriends.</span> <span id="s787">So, this was very extensive.</span> <span id="s788">And, I guess, the way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what do you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don’t suffer fools easily or kindly.</span> <span id="s789">I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations.</span> <span id="s790">I know, I have confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as anyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me, and I know them.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">05:07:22 And so, when I get this kind of stuff – as my own confidence builds – I get more and more indignant.</span> <span id="s792">Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though, I don't think it was too much.</span> <span id="s793">There was one incidence described in the charges against me that I – that this officer says to me, something that they can’t do better on housing for the DP’s than they do for the GI’s.</span> <span id="s794">And his – and I did this – the, the charges in front of a few enlisted men – and the claim is that I said to him, "Fuck the GI’s, I'm only worried about the DP’s" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the situation with him.</span> <span id="s795">And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our vicinity when we had that conversation.</span> <span id="s796">And he also agrees that the essence of our conversation was that the GI’s are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult and trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have quite appropriate housing for them.</span> <span id="s797">But, here you're dealing with survivors from concentration camps that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who are families, children, wives.</span> <span id="s798">You can’t make a comparison between what you do for the GI’s and what you do for the DP’s.</span> <span id="s799">So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as a charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to describe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI’s that they essentially sympathized, I think this is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with the people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person coming from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">05:10:10</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Katie, in the – in some of the material you have, I have, I have, I have inserted certain quotations from official documents that I have found in the Holo – in the National Archives.</span> <span id="s803">Which is critical of the Jewish DP’s.</span> <span id="s804">"They flaunt themselves in front of the German police who they know can’t do anything about them.</span> <span id="s805">And they do various things which will incur the wrath of the German population and which will encourage them to feel that Hitler after all was right."</span> <span id="s806">Now, that's an American officer writing that sentence in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Do you remember hearing things that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: I, I, well...</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Do you remember hearing things like that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Well, I'm not sure that I heard those words, but I'm sure I heard things like it, and I've witnessed various....</span> <span id="s811">Look, look at the other thing that – another, another – we haven't covered the famous riot.</span> <span id="s812">Well, I should precede this – though I'll come back to it – with a little bit of an outline, just so it's put into time context.</span> <span id="s813">I send the cable to the U.S. on the food situation, "stir up the bees," April 12th.</span> <span id="s814">Within one week to the day after that, the battalion commander arrives for a five day intensive inspection.</span> <span id="s815">There has never been a five day intensive inspection.</span> <span id="s816">They come for a few hours here, here they drop in, send someone else.</span> <span id="s817">Five days of inspection.</span> <span id="s818">That's undertaken on the 19th of April.</span> <span id="s819">And, let's say it.</span> <span id="s820">goes 'til the 24th of April.</span> <span id="s821">From my memorandum, I can see, tell, that there's a very active period from about May the ninth to May the 14th in which the Army is asking for my head.</span> <span id="s822">With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">05:13:03 I should add, unrelated to me and unrelated to Föhrenwald, on about May the ninth, there's riot in the camp at Landsberg.</span> <span id="s824">There's also a riot in another place, I think, Starnberg or something.</span> <span id="s825">Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most – I and most of my team at our billets in Wolfratshausen the weekend is beginning.</span> <span id="s826">And, after dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble this, someone is reported hurt at the German movie theater in Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s827">We send someone out to look at it, no trouble at the movie theater at Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s828">Then, at some point, I see somebody in the car area of the house, gesticulating and so on.</span> <span id="s829">And, he says there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all is, but what I do at that juncture – is I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are anymore phone calls – I take two people with me.</span> <span id="s830">I'm going to the German police station to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s831">I send the rest of the staff to the camp to see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s832">OK?</span> <span id="s833">And here is what we discovered – and I'll tell you what this is, what this brief summary is based on – the following morning I instructed every staff member, let's say 20, 22, to prepare for me a chronological report of the night before, where they were a certain hour, give me a half hour later, half hour later, and tell me what was going on.</span> <span id="s834">Wherever they were.</span> <span id="s835">So I have a series of these memos which give me a panoramic view of the situation.</span> <span id="s836">And here is what happened – the sense of what happened.</span> <span id="s837">The essence of what happened.</span> <span id="s838">It's a Friday night, a couple of drunken American soldiers are going up the stairs of a building in the German village.</span> <span id="s839">They're going to the third floor where they've got a couple of girlfriends.</span> <span id="s840">On the second floor is a Jewish family that's living outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s841">They have some friends who are visiting them from the camp, there may have been four or five people there, I don't know, remember.</span> <span id="s842">The American soldiers stop off at the second floor.</span> <span id="s843">And they start coercing the people, they move around with their knives or bayonets.</span> <span id="s844">They have their guns out.</span> <span id="s845">They're telling one guy to play his harmonica.</span> <span id="s846">They're asking, "Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s847">Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s848">I don't like Jews," he says, and he rams one guy in the chin with the butt of a gun.</span> <span id="s849">Hits another guy in the head.</span> <span id="s850">One or two of these people got out of the apartment and got back to the camp.</span> <span id="s851">There are some 1,000 or more people in the camp theater watching a movie in the blackness, in the darkness.</span> <span id="s852">And one of them runs into the back of the theater, into the darkness, and he starts yelling, “A shchita!”</span> <span id="s853">“slaughter” – this is the classic phrase – “Me harget yiddin in Wolfratshausen!"</span> <span id="s854">slaughter, they're killing Jews in Wolfratshausen."</span> <span id="s855">And the group gets up.</span> <span id="s856">Now, then other rumors start.</span> <span id="s857">As people are moving towards the exit, that a Jew was seen kidnapped by Germans in a truck travelling south.</span> <span id="s858">So, people commandeer trucks and they start chasing something.</span> <span id="s859">They start stopping vehicles, passing and taking Germans out and beating them up.</span> <span id="s860">Some start moving north.</span> <span id="s861">I go to the German police station and I meet an Army officer there, and I tell him, we start piecing it together.</span> <span id="s862">I tell him, "Look, you put your soldiers a mile or three-quarters of a mile north of the camp.</span> <span id="s863">Give me a chance to contain whatever is going on."</span> <span id="s864">And, at that point, I get back to the camp, and by that point, my staff and the DP, the DP police are, have a cordon and are getting them back.</span> <span id="s865">And then we have a midnight curfew, everybody off the streets.</span> <span id="s866">The official report on this incident, which I find in the National Archives, I didn’t know that this existed at that time, describes the riot and indicates that there is evidence to indicate that this riot was generated by, or in behalf of, Mr. Cohen the camp director.</span> <span id="s867">And there is no reference in his report to the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s868">Okay?</span> <span id="s869">So, what am I supposed to do?</span> <span id="s870">Passive, "bleh, bleh."</span> <span id="s871">But, but, this riot, you see, follows by 12 to 15 days, the Army effort to get rid of me.</span> <span id="s872">So, when the riot occurs, this officer who's writing the report, is linking it to the Army strategy to get rid of this uncooperative son-of-a-bitch, Henry Cohen.</span> <span id="s873">Now, from my point of view, the riot and the story, you know, some of it, beating up the innocent Germans.</span> <span id="s874">I cry inside, but for me it's a symptom of how close to the edge the pain still is, a year after liberation.</span> <span id="s875">Remember, May 22nd, the war ended May eighth a year earlier.</span> <span id="s876">For me it's a sign of how close to the edge.</span> <span id="s877">The riot in Landsberg, the riot here, the riot there.</span> <span id="s878">Our people are suffering.</span> <span id="s879">Look where they're living, look what they're eating.</span> <span id="s880">Look how they're being treated.</span> <span id="s881">And they're living among Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">05:21:02 And the Army, at that level, has absolutely no grasp, no empathy, no understanding of this.</span> <span id="s883">It's, it's, it's unbelievable, I can't, I indicated in that memo, here we are 50 years later, and I can't comprehend of that Army attitude.</span> <span id="s884">I can't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s885">I mean, I, I, I'm a soldier, I understand law and order, I understand discipline, I understand all those things.</span> <span id="s886">But, for such stupid, biased, inadequate people to be running the occupation.</span> <span id="s887">One worries about, one has to worry about a lot of other things that happen under their tutelage.</span> <span id="s888">See, it's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything, I feel proud to have been a combat soldier.</span> <span id="s889">Fifty years later I am proud that I was able to do that, that I fought in the war.</span> <span id="s890">What makes me sink into the ground is the American soldier at peace.</span> <span id="s891">And lacking, it's, it's quite possible it's different in today's Army than it was then, I don't know enough about what – how they handle Haiti or Somalia, not Somalia, at Somalia wasn't that great.</span> <span id="s892">There's no seykhel, intelligence, subtlety at work, you see.</span> <span id="s893">You see, in some of the stuff you've read where Margaret Gerber is talking about my personal qualities, one of the things that she's saying is that the DP's trust him even when he comes down on them, they know what's at his soul level.</span> <span id="s894">And they will take it when he's harsh with them.</span> <span id="s895">And these guys don't have it at the soul level.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: So many questions.</span> <span id="s897">Let me ask, we're talking about a year after liberation, and, and certainly memories often surface around anniversaries.</span> <span id="s898">I wonder what kind of airing did those emotions ever get?</span> <span id="s899">Any kind of formal way?</span> <span id="s900">Was there counseling?</span> <span id="s901">Were there some kind of communal sessions where people were able to pray about the end of the war?</span> <span id="s902">What did go on in terms of letting people get some of this out?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Well, I don’t – yeah, I don't know to what extent, we had a lot of social workers on the staff.</span> <span id="s904">And, so, I don't know to what extent.</span> <span id="s905">You know, now we make much more to do about group therapy and group process and all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">05:29:30 But, but, I don't have any easy visualization of it, Katie.</span> <span id="s907">I keep struggling with my writing class as I did in certain respects with Lustig or with you, you'll see that, the writing part is what I'm saying.</span> <span id="s908">I want more than the facts, Ma’am, and I stay with the facts.</span> <span id="s909">You see, where I can't tell you anything from memory, I won't, I won't speak on it.</span> <span id="s910">I can only speak on that which I can draw.</span> <span id="s911">If I don't remember, then I can only speak on that which I can draw from my quote, unquote, "factual materials".</span> <span id="s912">And I, I, I frustrate people like you no end.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: I'm not frustrated.</span> <span id="s914">Actually, you've intrigued and tantalized, that's all.</span> <span id="s915">One story I'd like you to tell us, and perhaps it actually in some way, does answer my question for one person, is the story of the young girl who insisted on singing to a group of your visitors.</span> <span id="s916">I wonder if you could tell us–</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Well, one of the therapeutic things that was happening all the time were visitors.</span> <span id="s918">Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Palestine.</span> <span id="s919">Writers, singers, the Anglo-American Commission, they come and they spend a day and they're giving people some hope that maybe they can have an impact on something.</span> <span id="s920">If LaGuardia sends Ira A. Hirschmann as an emissary to look over things, people get hope from that.</span> <span id="s921">So there was a lot, a constant stream of visitors.</span> <span id="s922">On this particular occasion, we were visited by H. Leivik, a writer-poet, and Emma Schaver who is a singer from Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">05:27:10 And we put on a concert, a program for a couple of evenings, and that also is lovely.</span> <span id="s924">Anyway, following the – at the end of the visit, the morning that they were leaving, Leivik and Schaver are having breakfast and a young girl comes in.</span> <span id="s925">And she walks over to their table and she says, "I want to sing to you."</span> <span id="s926">And Leivik says, "What do you mean sing?</span> <span id="s927">Do you write songs?"</span> <span id="s928">And she says, "No, I sing."</span> <span id="s929">He says, "You know we are in a hurry, we are doing another camp."</span> <span id="s930">She says, "Well, you'll come a little later."</span> <span id="s931">And Leivik says to her, “Who are you, where are you from?</span> <span id="s932">Are you alone?</span> <span id="s933">Is anyone here with you?"</span> <span id="s934">She gave up on him, she goes against the wall, and she introduces the song she's going to sing, the Shavler, the song of the Shavler ghetto.</span> <span id="s935">And it's a song about a mother who has to give her child away in order to save the child.</span> <span id="s936">It's a very sad song.</span> <span id="s937">And then she sings other songs.</span> <span id="s938">And then she's asked – then they do ask her some questions about herself, and she says where she's from, she lost her whole family, she's all alone, she's now 15, 16, she's been to 17 concentration camps, when she was released she went to a city, she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way west to camp Föhrenwald, and then she sings some more.</span> <span id="s939">And Leivik danced, Schaver – you know, and this is one of the experiences of their lives.</span> <span id="s940">For them to unanticipatedly come across this.</span> <span id="s941">Then they come in – they're leaving – they come into my office, there are two women sitting in front of my desk complaining about the food, and I say to them, "Look, I'm trying whatever I can do to make it better," and they say good-bye.</span> <span id="s942">Leivik, in leaving, says to Emma Schaver, "He's telling them he's trying to make it better, but he probably doesn't believe that himself, that he'll be able to."</span> <span id="s943">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s945">06:01:01</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: The young girl who sang to the visitors, tell us little bit more about her song she sang.</span> <span id="s947">Did you ever hear her sing it afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Did you ever meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s951">Probably did, but I don't really remember.</span> <span id="s952">The – [interviewee reads from notes] "it's the song of a Jewish, the pain of a Jewish child whose mother has to give her away to non-Jews in order to save her from the fire.</span> <span id="s953">The song is full of endless pain."</span> <span id="s954">And the – let me – on a side thing just, you know, sort of an interesting difference in perspective, while I take in things largely macro with incidents satisfying my macro I don't focus on macro, micra.</span> <span id="s955">I focus on macra – the task at hand, one way or another.</span> <span id="s956">And, what was I coming to?</span> <span id="s957">It slips me.</span> <span id="s958">I wanted to say something to you about that....</span> <span id="s959">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s960">When I was leaving the camp, I let word out that if anybody wanted to write letters to relatives in the United States, I would take them with me and I would stamp them in New York.</span> <span id="s961">So, I had, I came back with hundreds of letters and many of them were not sealed, so I took the liberty of reading some of these letters.</span> <span id="s962">Not a single letter, that I read, was talking about me or camp administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">06:04:30 Every letter was micro; what was happening to me, family, who’s this, that, so on.</span> <span id="s964">Completely different perspective.</span> <span id="s965">So, I recognized all these years that often, what I may do, what I think is for the public good, the people for whose good it is are oblivious to what I am doing.</span> <span id="s966">They live in their own little worlds.</span> <span id="s967">In my career as a university dean and students, the same thing applies.</span> <span id="s968">The students are in their little thing.</span> <span id="s969">They're not concerned with the dean, if they happen to be somewhere where the dean shows up, they get up and they'll shake hands with him.</span> <span id="s970">Or if I phone somebody and he knows it's me, its a respectful response, but basically, those are different worlds.</span> <span id="s971">And I'm aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Tell us what it was like on your level, on the macro level, on a day-to-day basis.</span> <span id="s973">What would happen in that camp?</span> <span id="s974">When would you get to work?</span> <span id="s975">What was the rhythm about that camp which sounds like it was some sort of small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s977">Well, for one thing, one of the things in the memos that I get, is, and the district director refers to this at considerable length, how we were probably the most visited Jewish DP camp in the zone.</span> <span id="s978">He was using that as an argument to tell the military about how much distraction I had to cope with from task.</span> <span id="s979">But we were getting, we were getting visitors – I don’t know if every day, I can't remember, I have no calendars from that period of time, but an awful, a tremendous flow of people coming in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">06:07:11 Military, one sort or another, the medical officer of the battalion going to visit the hospital, or this guy coming.</span> <span id="s981">Jewish leaders coming; rabbi, other rabbis coming, so, a lot of the pictures of that – I should say this, a lot of the pictures that you see at the Holocaust Museum and the ones that I have, are not really pictures of every day life or, and/or suffering, they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi games, the theatre performances, the visit of the General, the visit of Rabbi Herzog, that is, they're, they are the pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp.</span> <span id="s982">But, basically, I don't know what time I got there, you know, eight-thirty or nine o'clock, presumably, we had breakfast at our billet.</span> <span id="s983">Could have been one or another staff meeting, meeting with different people, you know, you're supervising 20 people, you have the hospital, you're having group meetings, you're going out to look at this or that.</span> <span id="s984">Occasionally, you have to go to Munich to check in or to district headquarters.</span> <span id="s985">I used to on occasion, visit the house where the district staff lived and have dinner there.</span> <span id="s986">It was an easy way, or an easy evening to compare notes on one thing or another.</span> <span id="s987">Also, there's a constant flow of administrative directives that are coming in.</span> <span id="s988">Food, clothing, transportation.</span> <span id="s989">There's a lot of bread and butter stuff that goes on.</span> <span id="s990">And, incidentally, there are times when, among visitors of the camp, I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and food.</span> <span id="s991">So, they were also helping out.</span> <span id="s992">And then there are celebratory events.</span> <span id="s993">Pesach comes, you have to organize a Seder and there's a flag raising ceremony at Hochlandslager, and who should be invited and meetings with the camp committee, in groups or individually, the chairman of the camp committee who, incidentally, was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s994">I used to always see him when I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s995">He passed away prematurely.</span> <span id="s996">He was, he became a high school principal in Israel.</span> <span id="s997">And I still see, incidentally, the two surviving members of the Jewish Agency staff in Israel when I go.</span> <span id="s998">And they're now in their 80s.</span> <span id="s999">And there's Amram who lives in New York, he's in the travel business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: His name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: His name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Amram Zur, Z-U-R and–</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Can you tell us about–</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Let me, I want to tell you just as a by, something happened a year, two years?</span> <span id="s1006">Two years ago.</span> <span id="s1007">The two survivors in Israel, Zviah Lahar, who is a nurse, and she became the chief of nursing for the – one of the major kibbutz movements.</span> <span id="s1008">She's now retired.</span> <span id="s1009">And she lost her first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war.</span> <span id="s1010">And then she married a man, I forget his first name, Lahar and they live in Kibbutz Givat Brenner in Israel.</span> <span id="s1011">And the other person is Liowa Lak who is really the chief of the team and a very wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">06:12:27 And he, along the way, worked with Goldie, Golda Meir when she was in Russia and he was helping develop contacts with the surviving Jewish community in Russia.</span> <span id="s1013">Then he worked with some agricultural technical agency and so on.</span> <span id="s1014">Two years ago, following the Hebron Massacre, there's a message on my telephone from Zviah, I get back to her, and Zviah is in tears about what happened.</span> <span id="s1015">And she's calling me incoherently, "Henry, come help."</span> <span id="s1016">I mean, there was no logic to it.</span> <span id="s1017">But it says something about our relationship.</span> <span id="s1018">“Come help, help."</span> <span id="s1019">That says was that something about the sense of suffering she was experiencing as a result of that massacre.</span> <span id="s1020">And these are people who were lost in the war and on.</span> <span id="s1021">And, you know, you experience what we – i.e. what Israel is now Lebanon – and most of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here, in terms of – but I also, while I'm on that, let me before we were on camera, about Lustig saying to me, in an interview 15 years ago, “You know, Jews live in a camp.</span> <span id="s1022">They go from concentration camp or a, a camp in Germany, and then en route to Palestine, the British get them into camps in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1023">From camp to camp to camp."</span> <span id="s1024">And I was thinking about it last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres and Netanyahu – Likud Labor – that if the Israelis elect Peres, they will be electing a leader who because they, if they agree with him, will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">06:15:22 And if they elect Netanyahu, they will elect a leader who builds the walls of the camp.</span> <span id="s1026">So we are still struggling with the camp metaphor, from camp to camp to camp.</span> <span id="s1027">And I. think you know where my feelings are.</span> <span id="s1028">But, I've got to be non-political, 'cause I'm not a member of any Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: What was your feeling when you were managing that camp?</span> <span id="s1030">Did you have liked it to essentially disappear as you managed it?</span> <span id="s1031">Or did you see it as a kind of, still a very necessary refuge?</span> <span id="s1032">Even though it had all these problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1034">Well, of course, simply put, for me, the solution was that, hopefully, there would be developed a state in Israel.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn't know by what name.</span> <span id="s1036">That all the refugees and DP’s would go there and the camps would dissolve.</span> <span id="s1037">I, you know, I saw some going to America, some going to Australia, where there were relatives, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1038">But, to me, the bulk would be going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1039">There was a poll taken in the Spring of 1946 by the Anglo-American Committee, this is from their report, they – I think this is part of the poll, [interviewee reads from notes] "In our camp the vote for going to Israel was about 90 percent or more.</span> <span id="s1040">Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to Palestine."</span> <span id="s1041">So, that was the overwhelming desire at that time.</span> <span id="s1042">I should add that Föhrenwald was actually the last camp closed in Germany in about 1954.</span> <span id="s1043">At some point in the process, I didn't keep up with it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee Organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">06:18:11 But, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they closed other centers, they brought surplus into Föhrenwald.</span> <span id="s1045">And then it was closed, finally, in something like 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Did you ever get the sense that people got attached to it, even with its problems, because, after all, it was a sort of safe haven?</span> <span id="s1047">It was home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: I don't, no, I never, never got that feeling.</span> <span id="s1049">I think people felt some element of safety there because on UNRRA, because of the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s1050">There were also occasionally people around from the Jewish Brigade – which is a separate, I don't have much on it, because I didn't know much about it – but, remember, they were being organized in kibbutzim, there was Hochlandslager, so there were, there were organizational structures that were providing some protection for people there that – and to that extent, it probably had a wholesome effect.</span> <span id="s1051">I mean, if, you've seen the picture from the Maccabi games, have you?</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, God, this is a year after the war, and you see these young people doing these acrobatics and exercises, it's nothing short of amazing.</span> <span id="s1053">Well that's morale building activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the camp?</span> <span id="s1055">Were they recreating their lives in their previous homes and villages?</span> <span id="s1056">Or were they creating some new type of life that they hoped would be their life in the future and in a future state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: I think that Föhrenwald was a completely interim matter.</span> <span id="s1058">I know this from my own relatives.</span> <span id="s1059">I know this from other people whom I've known.</span> <span id="s1060">They came to Israel, they became part of that country and either went to kibbutzims, stayed in Tel Aviv, went to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1061">If they were religious, they went to Bené Beraq you know?</span> <span id="s1062">They were like immigrants in any country, there was a period of adaptation and absorption.</span> <span id="s1063">And Föhrenwald is a passing experience, about which they may have some benign remembrance or not.</span> <span id="s1064">Like this young woman, it, for some reason it – in her life it figures very importantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">06:21:26</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: The young woman you've been writing to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: On the computer, yeah.</span> <span id="s1068">The man who's in Los Angeles, I've had one or two exchanges with him, but he hasn't felt the need to go further, so, you know, it's a very variable thing.</span> <span id="s1069">I should also say that I and others who returned were writing articles about this experience for three or four years after we returned.</span> <span id="s1070">And giving speeches at different Jewish, or other, organizations, so we were sharing our experiences then in different ways.</span> <span id="s1071">What’s, what I find interesting now from a few friends, and I don't know to what extent it's reflective, but a few friend whom – to whom I've sent the speech I gave a year ago in Great Neck, have written me saying they've shared it with their children.</span> <span id="s1072">That is, people in my age group have a strong need to share these experiences with our children.</span> <span id="s1073">So, they used my experience which is reflective of their life to a certain extent, to share it with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Have you shared this with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1076">And, I haven't had much feedback from them.</span> <span id="s1077">They, they haven't verbalized feedback.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Tell us about the first Seder at the camp when you were in charge.</span> <span id="s1079">It might have been the first Seder after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Would you tell us about that – what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Well, we had, I don't remember the dining room area, but we had long tables all decked out.</span> <span id="s1083">I don't remember who led the service.</span> <span id="s1084">I have pictures of me with different people there, including members of the team; Chaim Hoffman, who was the head of the Jewish Agency in Munich, was at our Seder.</span> <span id="s1085">And, we fed them gefilte fish as far as I can recall.</span> <span id="s1086">Where we got some of the food to feed them, I don't know, I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s1087">And there were Army people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating, so they probably thought it was GI food also.</span> <span id="s1088">That is, a piece of gefilte fish to them was like a can of K-rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">06:24:22 They'd never had it before, it was from some other can.</span> <span id="s1090">Maybe they were even happy to have never have had it before.</span> <span id="s1091">But it was a very buoyant, very friendly, very lively occasion.</span> <span id="s1092">And I don't remember who had the afikomen, I don't know who stole it or found it, I don't remember any of that.</span> <span id="s1093">But, we, you know, I see pictures which show these group dinners, different celebratory dinners.</span> <span id="s1094">And though, that is, our commitment was to do positive things to raise morale.</span> <span id="s1095">And we did a lot of it.</span> <span id="s1096">You know, I don't like these traumatic stories – to, to bury, the fact is we had hundreds of children in schools and teachers teaching children.</span> <span id="s1097">We had a Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s1098">Oh, and I came across an article, where – of Leivik's – where he devotes a piece of it to going into the Yeshiva in Föhrenwald and it reminds him of his childhood.</span> <span id="s1099">So, we had that going here.</span> <span id="s1100">So, there was a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: A question that I didn't get to ask about just day-to-day living and you were describing the rooms being so small and privacy.</span> <span id="s1102">How were married couples able to be intimate?</span> <span id="s1103">I mean, how, what, do you know anything about that?</span> <span id="s1104">Or how did people make do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I have deniability.</span> <span id="s1106">No, but look, let's face it, Katie, I told you the story about my father as a six year old boy.</span> <span id="s1107">His mother has died, his father is remarried, he has a stepmother who has two young children and he's occasionally awakened by some noise in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1108">And in the candle light he sees this stepmother feeding her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">06:27:04 Now, that's a guess to me, that he lived in very close quarters.</span> <span id="s1110">So, he was experiencing in 1897, sex among adults at night.</span> <span id="s1111">So, I think that a lot of these people who came from shtetlach, really had that as part of their background.</span> <span id="s1112">I, I've never talked to any of them about it.</span> <span id="s1113">But, it's an interesting question and it’s an interesting issue.</span> <span id="s1114">But, I think it was probably going on all the time and, not only with the children hearing it, but unrelated people were hearing it.</span> <span id="s1115">For us in America, it's quite a strange kind of experience, but, when you live – what do you think Indians did in a teepee, or Italians in their little hovels?</span> <span id="s1116">I think that was the world before we began building houses with more than 1,500 square feet.</span> <span id="s1117">And apartments with more, with four rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">06:28:32 End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">07:01:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Now, give me a minute.</span> <span id="s1122">Hi.</span> <span id="s1123">This is a list from – of the camp that I have which lists all the aspects of the camp and in some, in the top group, next to each, almost every line, I have the staff assignments.</span> <span id="s1124">So, [interviewee reads from notes] "Number one, overall, administration.</span> <span id="s1125">Coordination of staff, Cohen.</span> <span id="s1126">Personnel actions for staff, including voluntary agencies, Gerber and Hafkin."</span> <span id="s1127">Hafkin was my secretary, Gerber was assistant director.</span>

of street officers, registration, administrative information, delegated to welfare, reports and statistics."</span> <span id="s1133">Then next major heading, "Physical plant; equipment, water, sewage, electrical facilities, heating, building, equipment maintenance, road repair, radio, telephones, sign painting, etc. gardens."</span> <span id="s1134">Once you read it, you realize what goes into this.</span> <span id="s1135">Even, even I'm impressed.</span> <span id="s1136">"Welfare, information and tracing, group work, recreation, cultural activities, education, adult, children, library, religions, newspaper and radio, vocational training, religious affairs, child welfare, family welfare, case work including psychological, home visiting, hospital welfare inch, including occupied

securing requirements from staff, uncover new sources of supply, supplies, report on incoming supplies, recreation, requisitions submitted, items surplus materials, suggest possible uses, wooden

bulk only, determine method and timing of distribution, periodic listing of inventories, no responsible for Joint unless submitted to common pool, Joint Distribution Committee, health, sanitation, hospital, Dorfen, " which is a sanitarium.</span> <span id="s1141">"Hochlandslager, dispensary, sanitary inspections of kitchens, general kosher kibbutz, homes, food magazines."</span> <span

committee, gardens, parent counseling on rearing babies, sex education, health education.</span> <span id="s1145">Messing foods; planning means preparation of food, serving of food, cleanliness of

id="s1150">Incidentally, I have other handwritten notes.</span> <span id="s1151">"Food; conditions under which served, no fresh food, compare to Germans.</span> <span id="s1152">Black market; Hochlandslager cigarettes what roll do they play in the black market?</span> <span id="s1153">Engineering supplies; brushes, roof paper, nails, toilets."</span> <span id="s1154">This is a little more detail than there.</span> <span id="s1155">"Medical supplies;" I think it says "hormones, amenity supplies, obstetrical, requisitioning procedures, teeth."</span> <span id="s1156">We'd have problems with dentists.</span> <span id="s1157">"Sanitation supplies, housing, density, morality."</span> <span id="s1158">You see?</span> <span id="s1159">That means it went through my head.</span> <span id="s1160">"Lack of community space, Landkreis responsibilities," that's the county burden, "no clear cut definition.</span> <span id="s1161">Clothing; sizes, U.S. clothing.</span> <span

and natural clash of interests and resent it.</span> <span id="s1168">Riot, their demand for my removal, transportation, encourage a system of scrounging."</span> <span id="s1169">[interviewee ceases reading] So there are these recurrent things, Katie.</span> <span id="s1170">I, I wanted to mention something, when all of this trouble was developing, a number of us began to become concerned with one of the members of the team, a Dutch woman.</span> <span id="s1171">Her name was Maria Van Bimbergen.</span> <span id="s1172">She was supposedly the daughter of the chief justice of Holland before the war.</span> <span id="s1173">She had – as far as I know, was the only one, one the team among the women, who had an Army officer friend, boyfriend fraternizing.</span> <span id="s1174">And, as the charges kept flowing, particularly on some of the more confidential issues, we began worrying about her reliability.</span> <span id="s1175">And we began complaining to Headquarters about her.</span> <span id="s1176">And I notice in the memos that it's in my memo, and I think reference to her is also in Margaret Gerber's memo to the District director.</span> <span id="s1177">And I came across something which refers to her at a certain date, seeing her walking in Wolfratshausen with this Army lieutenant or colonel or whatever.</span> <span id="s1178">So, we, this was a great source of concern to us.</span> <span id="s1179">And UNRRA didn't act on it, and that was a source of concern to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you, I know I'd hear about what this situation camp was – but I guess I didn’t really anticipate hearing that you would have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people.</span> <span id="s1181">In other words, that you had to become, or you did become, an advocate.</span> <span id="s1182">You had to choose sides in a way.</span> <span id="s1183">Do you agree with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides.</span> <span id="s1185">I mean, some of the things that I was doing was almost measured choices, if you want to say down the middle.</span> <span id="s1186">Like, my mid– like my midnight checks.</span> <span id="s1187">Or the – three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher, once a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">07:11:23 Or my encounter with Rabbi Halberstam in down the middle.</span> <span id="s1189">That is, I – even with those things – the Army was complaining like crazy about me.</span> <span id="s1190">But I think, incidentally, if you were – which you are not going to do really, but historians will, look at the files on some of the other camps.</span> <span id="s1191">Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not.</span> <span id="s1192">You'll see similar themes being played out.</span> <span id="s1193">Because I have folders based on meetings we were having at headquarters where we were being briefed about not handing out cards and new cards.</span> <span id="s1194">On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on.</span> <span id="s1195">So, I wasn't the only one.</span> <span id="s1196">And there was, for example, at Landsberg, you had older, older people in charge with more experience, like Lee Srole who was chief welfare officer.</span> <span id="s1197">And they would get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name, the head of the camp, so this was going on different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Did you ever feel torn between your allegiance to the U.S. military and your allegiance to being a Jew – and the Jews in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I never had that conflict.</span> <span id="s1200">I just, it wasn't my allegiance to America that was at issue, it was my refusal to deal with stupid people.</span> <span id="s1201">Who happened to be American.</span> <span id="s1202">I mean that was never a problem for me.</span> <span id="s1203">If I'm dealing with a – if you’re dealing with one of these gun groups out in the west who raise the American flag and you protest against it, it isn't that you’re anti-American, you're against that mentality.</span> <span id="s1204">So, I've never had that problem.</span> <span id="s1205">And I'm not a radical, politically.</span> <span id="s1206">I'm a centrist.</span> <span id="s1207">So, I don't have any problem with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: What was the most difficult thing about your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I think when, when one comes down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing with the U.S. Army of occupation.</span> <span id="s1210">Dealing with the DP’s wasn't as difficult.</span> <span id="s1211">Dealing with Rabbi Halberstam wasn't that difficult.</span> <span id="s1212">I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but it wasn't – I could understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">07:14:50 And, I remember once, I don't know for what reason, the DP’s went on a hunger strike protesting something.</span> <span id="s1214">I convened a big meeting in the auditorium, hundreds of people there, and I, I set out to break the strike.</span> <span id="s1215">And I say to them, "Listen, I would rather be a teacher in Brooklyn than director of this camp."</span> <span id="s1216">And they laugh and that breaks the strike.</span> <span id="s1217">That was the relationship I had with them.</span> <span id="s1218">That was not difficult.</span> <span id="s1219">I had, I had confidence in my ability to deal with that.</span> <span id="s1220">And they had confidence in me.</span> <span id="s1221">I notice in the stuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff who worked – there were two memos from Becky – she worked for the Joint, attached to the team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in Germany, to alert him to what was going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army.</span> <span id="s1222">And the second, was talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about retaining me and protecting me.</span> <span id="s1223">And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency people and one or two other staff people.</span> <span id="s1224">And then they had a large staff meeting the following morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are like 18 signatures on the petition.</span> <span id="s1225">So, that was not my difficulty.</span> <span id="s1226">My difficulty was this anomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem with those schmucks who have no understanding.</span> <span id="s1227">I mean, look, one of these guys comes on an inspection during Pesach.</span> <span id="s1228">I guess it must have been that guy who came for five days.</span> <span id="s1229">And we walk into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1230">Now, the kitchen is closed for Pesach.</span> <span id="s1231">They've been giving rations in one way or another.</span> <span id="s1232">And, I walk with him into the middle of the floor in the kitchen it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the floor.</span> <span id="s1233">And he, for him, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary control.</span> <span id="s1234">We walk to the johns and there's defecation in the john on the floor, maybe on the toilet seat, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">07:17:48 We go outside and behind there against the wall, there's some defecation.</span> <span id="s1236">The stupid guy, how does he think I feel about that?</span> <span id="s1237">I understand how he's feeling about it.</span> <span id="s1238">But he's not giving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if I had my way, if I had found it two hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up.</span> <span id="s1239">But the place was out of use for two or three days at the time.</span> <span id="s1240">So, it happened.</span> <span id="s1241">Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it.</span> <span id="s1242">You know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in – I'm working with my Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and I'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on.</span> <span id="s1243">The Deputy Mayor calls me up – I won't give you the whole story – gives me something, "Take care of this."</span> <span id="s1244">It's about Harlem hospital, conditions in the emergency room.</span> <span id="s1245">I've been in the mayor's office then five to six years, so I know what weight I have, okay?</span> <span id="s1246">And I've been heavily involved for two years in dealing with various problems of hospital administration.</span> <span id="s1247">I call the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two years, and I say, "Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the emergency room at Harlem hospital."</span> <span id="s1248">We go there, I won't detail what we find.</span> <span id="s1249">At the end of the evening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at his home in Staten Island, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am doing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately.</span> <span id="s1250">And he raises his voice, "What the hell are you doing there?</span> <span id="s1251">You're not Commissioner of Hospitals, etc., etc." I just say back to him, "What the hell have you known about this?</span> <span id="s1252">Have you acted on it?</span> <span id="s1253">I'm acting because of dereliction."</span> <span id="s1254">Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and [inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -"All taken care of."</span> <span id="s1255">On Wednesday, the Amsterdam News 60 comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper, okay?</span> <span id="s1256">Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City Administrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals has resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as Commissioner, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">07:21:20 So, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, is.</span> <span id="s1258">I didn't know it all in 1946 in the camp.</span> <span id="s1259">But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me, not that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it.</span> <span id="s1260">And that was what was involved here.</span> <span id="s1261">Maybe I was too – whatever.</span> <span id="s1262">But they were too – worse, you see.</span> <span id="s1263">And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the camp, there was another riot situation, a march on the town, and one or two Jews were killed by the soldiers because they wouldn't retreat.</span> <span id="s1264">That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not backwards and we knew that.</span> <span id="s1265">And we knew that we had to deal with them within the family so they didn't see us with guns.</span> <span id="s1266">And they didn't see the Army with guns.</span> <span id="s1267">And when they saw the guns, they got hurt.</span> <span id="s1268">And I have newspaper clippings on that incident.</span> <span id="s1269">So, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter.</span> <span id="s1270">Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann, who was LaGuardia’s emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in department stores in the '30s.</span> <span id="s1271">He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they became very close.</span> <span id="s1272">During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special Ambassadorial rank to be stationed in Turkey, and Hirschmann was arranging for the escape of Jews from Hungary and Bulgaria into Turkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">07:24:05 So, he was, in his own way, an old hand.</span> <span id="s1274">And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get rid of General Morgan because of the British influence on the European operation.</span> <span id="s1275">And he spent the day with me.</span> <span id="s1276">And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get – put it all out to him.</span> <span id="s1277">And in his memo, which is in June, "the Army is out to get Henry Cohen."</span> <span id="s1278">He starts out, "Henry Cohen" – this is something I didn't get until he came across it 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it – "Henry Cohen, director, who appears to have done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army.</span> <span id="s1279">They made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is correct, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much, was neglecting the other side for the rehabilitation of the people.</span> <span id="s1280">A devastating report has been sent to Headquarters by General McBride, Ninth Division Commander, and they have asked for Mr. Cohen's removal.</span> <span id="s1281">The staff has protested and the entire community had a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his understanding of the problem.</span> <span id="s1282">Not like the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s1283">It was two days after this mass meeting that a riot occurred at this camp.</span> <span id="s1284">This is a concrete example of the Army bucking the job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of the problem to function'.</span> <span id="s1285">The people in the camp chose to go on a complete hunger strike unless Mr. Cohen was retained.</span> <span id="s1286">He will probably be removed by the Army."</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Ultimately, what did happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I don't know the answer to that, Katie.</span> <span id="s1289">What I find in my material, is a letter of resignation dated sometime in May, and it's a two or three page letter, and on top of it, it's marked "void."</span> <span id="s1290">Then, I also note, these cables the, I mentioned to you, from Samuel, Professor Samuel Joseph, Chairman of the Sociology Department, at City College, offering me a teaching post in September – "Reply in by Wednesday."</span> <span id="s1291">I don't remember, I have no indication of how I handled that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">08:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: ...very little in my records during the month of June, all the action seems to have been in May.</span> <span id="s1294">Very little in my records – yeah, all '46.</span> <span id="s1295">Very little in my records, other than the Hirschmann memo, which is something like June 10th, but then, I notice a cable dated June 26th from Professor Samuel Joseph, City College.</span> <span id="s1296">"Are you planning to return shortly?</span> <span id="s1297">Have two or three courses open.</span> <span id="s1298">Will hold up until you cable me."</span> <span id="s1299">Then, in a more detailed cable without a date that I can't recognize – I have the real cable, but I can't read the date he sent to my brother who was in Munich, nearby.</span> <span id="s1300">In which he actually outlines which courses and where and what days, "must have your answer by Wednesday morning for program printing, regards."</span> <span id="s1301">Alright.</span> <span id="s1302">Let's say it's the same day, June 26th.</span> <span id="s1303">June has 30 days, 44 days.</span> <span id="s1304">Then, I have July 10th – sorry, July 2nd, six days later, resignation from UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1305">Now–</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Your resignation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: My resignation.</span> <span id="s1308">A very brief memo.</span> <span id="s1309">"I should like to inform you of my decision to resign from UNRRA, and am herewith giving one month's notice.</span> <span id="s1310">According to our discussion today, this decision is a tentative one."</span> <span id="s1311">And I don’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1312">"However, I want all steps to be taken so that in case I finally and definitely do decide to resign after a short," something or other, "there will be no delay in departure."</span> <span id="s1313">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Sir, we need you to sit up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Yeah, on July 15th, which is roughly two weeks later, there's a memo which indicates that I've left the camp and I'm now reporting directly at Headquarters.</span> <span id="s1316">And on that same day, July 15th, I go off for seven days of annual leave to Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s1317">And I had a marvelous time.</span> <span id="s1318">And in Stockholm, I visited relatives of one of my father’s closest friends.</span> <span id="s1319">It was marvelous.</span> <span id="s1320">I'd never been to Scandinavia before.</span> <span id="s1321">Anyway, so I'm back roughly the 22nd, 23rd.</span> <span id="s1322">My resignation is effective on August fourth.</span> <span id="s1323">And on August fourth I am issued, and I think I initiate, travel authorization from Munich to Washington via London.</span> <span id="s1324">But now I'm going to give you a treat that you weren't expecting.</span> <span id="s1325">In Paris, I arrived for a few days en route, and, and aunt of mine had sent me the name and address of a cousin in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">08:04:56 So, I go to this address and I find this Sheftel cousin running a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s1329">And, oh, was that a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1330">And she has three chil– young children.</span> <span id="s1331">They survived the war in the Alps, but her husband was taken and killed.</span> <span id="s1332">And I see these, her children – she died about eight or nine years ago – I see her children to this day whenever I go to Paris.</span> <span id="s1333">And they're a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s1334">So, the Sheftels are really something, aren't they?</span> <span id="s1335">So, that's the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1336">I got back, presumably, I don't know, went by boat from, I think, from Liverpool, to Canada, then back to the States, so I must have arrived the third week of August or so.</span> <span id="s1337">I must have gone down to Washington, back to New York, and I started teaching in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Any sort of debriefing or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: I, there must have been something in Washington, but once back in New York, I kind of, I was in touch with a number of Jewish organizations and have different speeches I gave on different occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: How did it change you?</span> <span id="s1341">How do you think it Shaped you, rather than changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Well, I don't really know.</span> <span id="s1343">I – you know, it probably strengthened me.</span> <span id="s1344">I don't recall – and I, I'm a person who can do a lot of soul searching – I don't recall ever really soul searching about the circumstances of the departure.</span> <span id="s1345">Incidentally, I, I, my supervisor, Helen Matousek, I – she was in New York for many years before moving out to Seattle.</span> <span id="s1346">So, I used to see her frequently.</span> <span id="s1347">And we rarely talked about the old days, specifically.</span> <span id="s1348">She'd been through it all with me.</span> <span id="s1349">I should tell you, there is one little story on one of the meetings out in their headquarters.</span> <span id="s1350">After dinner, she and I would sit aside, and she said to me, "Henry, most people live their lives with the glass half full.</span> <span id="s1351">You live your life and may always lived your life with the glass overflowing."</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">08:08:09 So, she had my number.</span> <span id="s1353">Sam Zisman, was a city planning consultant, it turned out.</span> <span id="s1354">So I used to run into him, he was from Texas, I used to run into him at Planning – National Planning meetings and we had a good relationship.</span> <span id="s1355">I used to see Richard Winslow.</span> <span id="s1356">I don’t know if I told you this story.</span> <span id="s1357">There was the summer of '67 – '47, by then he was the Secretary General of the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York, and I still hadn't resolved my housing.</span> <span id="s1358">I'd float from one rental to another, sub-rental to another.</span> <span id="s1359">And I was subletting an apartment on East 94th Street, way east, which is those days was really old, old tenement.</span> <span id="s1360">And I had a four story walk-up.</span> <span id="s1361">And his family used to go to the Cape for the summer, so anyway, somehow or other, he decided to move in with me.</span> <span id="s1362">It was next door to a laundry that was spewing out a lot of smoke.</span> <span id="s1363">And every morning we'd be leaving this slum building in our seersucker suits, going to our respective jobs.</span> <span id="s1364">Roger Masteude, I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until he divorced and went west and his wife went west.</span> <span id="s1365">But, I'm still in touch with him within the last month on the phone or by letter.</span> <span id="s1366">So, I'm in touch, I've been in touch with a number of these people and, how did it shape me?</span> <span id="s1367">I don't know, it probably added something to the experience and so on.</span> <span id="s1368">Added to my heft in certain ways as an administrator and experience and politically.</span> <span id="s1369">What's interesting, basically, is in my younger years in New York City, I really wasn't close to the mayors, with O'Dwyer and Impellitteri, but with Wagner I was.</span> <span id="s1370">And with Lindsay I was.</span> <span id="s1371">I wasn't the closest confidante, but I had a personal relationship with them.</span> <span id="s1372">And, in each of these relationships, I was able at different times to talk – what I regarded as turkey – to them.</span> <span id="s1373">If I felt it needed to be, certain things needed to be said, I would say them.</span> <span id="s1374">And, I remember one meeting with Lindsay, had some problem, and when he left the room, my then boss, said to me, "I don't think you made yourself very popular."</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">08:11:28 But, to me it didn't matter, I had to say what I had to say.</span> <span id="s1376">And, with Wagner, the interesting thing, we used to have lunch every year or two until his death, and in 1986, I think, I had, I had read a book, I had read a book about his father, the senator, and I, I realized for the first time as a result of reading it, that they were an immigrant family.</span> <span id="s1377">You know, for me, he was Yale and Catholic, upper scale, and all that, I'm still the ghetto boy, and – but I suddenly realized that his father was an immigrant, too.</span> <span id="s1378">And I learned about the family' And it – I'd never heard him speak about it.</span> <span id="s1379">So, I had lunch with him in '86, and I took this up with him.</span> <span id="s1380">And I said, "Bob, this is the year of the immigrant, I think you ought to found – find an occasion where you can speak on the subject."</span> <span id="s1381">And he did.</span> <span id="s1382">He got an award that year from CUNY, and the first paragraph of his speech was on his immigrant background.</span> <span id="s1383">So, I've been able to do, to be direct.</span> <span id="s1384">And Koch I had never worked for Koch, but if I see him on something, not recently, but I, I might say to him – I did at dinner one night, in his third year – "Don’t you have anybody on your staff who knows how to let people you're firing off easy?</span> <span id="s1385">Do you have to always get PR to let someone go?</span> <span id="s1386">What about getting it once every other time, or once every third time, do you need it every time?"</span> <span id="s1387">Then I took up some cases with him.</span> <span id="s1388">"They were nice people.</span> <span id="s1389">Why did you have to do it?"</span> <span id="s1390">So, you know, in the old days they used to talk about, they used to divide people into people who have the gyro– their inner gyroscope?</span> <span id="s1391">And I happen to be a person like that.</span> <span id="s1392">And, if you want to deal with me, you've got to – and it's uncomfortable – you have to put up with that part of me if you want to get something out of me.</span> <span id="s1393">And I can do a lot of good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: I wonder when you think about the experience in terms of, we just talked about how it shaped you, but what it did to your personal perception of being a Jew?</span> <span id="s1395">Working with the displaced people and, you've written about the stories, etched faces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">08:14:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yeah, you know, I was so formed in that way, that it's hard for me to see other, the other increments which, I'm sure there are.</span> <span id="s1398">But, in 1949, when I was in England teaching, I ran into some of my Israeli friends, either in London or Paris or whatever.</span> <span id="s1399">So, they arr– like they arranged my trip to Salzburg and Switzerland, so they arranged, on the next holiday at the University – they used to run six week, trimester, six weeks in between – They arranged for me to go on an immigrant boat from Marseilles to Israel – and Evelyn, along with me.</span> <span id="s1400">And then, not all the time, but half the time, they were putting us up in different places and so, I had the experience then of coming in on the Kedmah.</span> <span id="s1401">Into the Haifa harbor early in the morning and seeing that Haifa amphitheater.</span> <span id="s1402">Few people see it these days because no one comes in by boat, but come in by airplane.</span> <span id="s1403">What an experience.</span> <span id="s1404">So, I was in Haifa on the first anniversary of establishment of the state.</span> <span id="s1405">I stood on a roof watching the parade and I lectured city planning at the Technion and one or two other places.</span> <span id="s1406">And, went to kibbutzim and they arranged for a Föhrenwald reunion at WIZO, the Woman’s Zionist Organization.</span> <span id="s1407">They got announcements out in the press and radio.</span> <span id="s1408">Three hundred people turned out' So, there are these different increments and I don't, I haven't subaggregated it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Do you remember anything about that reunion?</span> <span id="s1410">What someone said to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: No, you know, so overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1412">You know, I remember on that particular visit, I was riding on a bus and suddenly a man turns at me, extends his hand, and says, "Herr Direktor.”</span> <span id="s1413">You know, that's a pretty heady experience.</span> <span id="s1414">You know, you need some compensation for all the "sturm und drang."</span> <span id="s1415">So, I've demonstrated I can take the "sturm und drang" and I'm entitled to some of the things that come with it.</span> <span id="s1416">You know, it's like combat, hat – I don't get much out of that, I didn't get anything out of Ninth Division – but what I got out of it was my own sense of inner satisfaction at having served.</span> <span id="s1417">And, but it's, it's an interesting part of history because there were really so few people around and it tells one so much about institutions – good and bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">08:18:15 And, but I'm sure most of the people, whether they came to the United States, I ran across one fellow for many years, who went into the engineering area.</span> <span id="s1419">Another fellow was a dermatologist.</span> <span id="s1420">I came across a letter just yesterday and I went to the phone book to see if he was still around and I didn't see his name.</span> <span id="s1421">I saw his second name, but not his first name.</span> <span id="s1422">I may call some of the relatives.</span> <span id="s1423">But, in that sense, you can't recreate it, you can't remember.</span> <span id="s1424">And yet, it has to be an important part of the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Do you know anything about what it is now?</span> <span id="s1426">Has it been razed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Oh, I'll tell you, no, it still, it's been reconstructed as a, as a, some kind of community.</span> <span id="s1428">Because Susan Levin – who was born in the camp in about 1948 – visited it about three years ago.</span> <span id="s1429">I ran into her, she told me.</span> <span id="s1430">But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most urban areas, is that the city has spread.</span> <span id="s1431">The urbanization has spread.</span> <span id="s1432">The suburbanization is part of the urbanization, so I have an impression that today it, that area, is simply a stop on whatever rapid transit system Munich has.</span> <span id="s1433">So, she – yeah, anyway, she went there, I don't know if she knocked on a door or not.</span> <span id="s1434">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Just a couple–</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yeah, but I've been back to Munich, I had no interest in going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: You mentioned there being a lack of community space at the camp.</span> <span id="s1438">Therefore, what, what did people do?</span> <span id="s1439">Where did they congregate?</span> <span id="s1440">Where did they sit around and gossip?</span> <span id="s1441">I mean – or did that not happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Yeah, well, there was a big community center.</span> <span id="s1443">There was a big kitchen facility.</span> <span id="s1444">I don't remember now what the lateral space around the community center was.</span> <span id="s1445">So I mean – so people are talking when they're standing in line waiting for food. "</span> <span id="s1446">There were programs in the community center and the theater – I don't know whether every night, I don't remember that – but, they must have been fairly frequent.</span> <span id="s1447">On the other hand, there is also evidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing.</span> <span id="s1448">They went to the cinema in the town.</span> <span id="s1449">Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to me at the time, on the – at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that there would be Jewish DP’s in the cinema.</span> <span id="s1450">By the time the movie was over, they would, word would be getting around.</span> <span id="s1451">I didn't know what would be happening to them when the movie let out.</span> <span id="s1452">So, we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station, en route to the camp, and we stopped off at the cinema and, during a break in – when they were changing the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and take them back.</span> <span id="s1453">Most of them left then and there, they didn’t wait for the end of the cinema.</span> <span id="s1454">So, anyway, people did different things.</span> <span id="s1455">They went to Munich, that is, they – you know, I'm not – there were–</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: They could come and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: They could come and go, they, they were, they had friends or relatives in other places.</span> <span id="s1458">So, there, there was no computer, so people learned to be in touch with one another by conversation.</span> <span id="s1459">I noticed in the camp newspaper there are several pages of listings of people looking for people from different places.</span> <span id="s1460">So, that was another communication system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: What else took up their time?</span> <span id="s1462">I mean, did people get work during the day?</span> <span id="s1463">Or, you said at one point – I'll just ask it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Well, most people were working.</span> <span id="s1465">Or they were in classes.</span> <span id="s1466">The only ones, other than the black marketers, but they were working, too.</span> <span id="s1467">They were outside handlin.</span> <span id="s1468">Just as a word, I came across in my notes, reference to the chief of police, allegations with regard to him and the black market came to me and I let it go.</span> <span id="s1469">That was a big one, whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">08:24:07</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: The DP police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah, I let him go.</span> <span id="s1473">And there were some charges about the chairman of the camp committee.</span> <span id="s1474">And I went to the camp committee and I discussed it and they suspended him.</span> <span id="s1475">I don't have any further record of what happened.</span> <span id="s1476">So, people were engaged, remember food took time.</span> <span id="s1477">You had to wait on line three times a day.</span> <span id="s1478">Not everyone was waiting, people would come back to the families.</span> <span id="s1479">Now, there were the women and the pregnant women, and they had children.</span> <span id="s1480">They were taking care of children.</span> <span id="s1481">So, there were some, we had, we didn't have space for a mikvah, you know that’s a ritual bath.</span> <span id="s1482">So, you know, there were problems, but it isn't as if people were locked in space.</span> <span id="s1483">See, that was a big difference between this and the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1484">They had a little money, they – you know, however they got it, could move somewhere or other.</span> <span id="s1485">I don't remember how we dealt with the money problem.</span> <span id="s1486">We may even have had a truck that went into Munich twice a week or – for some hours.</span> <span id="s1487">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: You told a story earlier when the man came from the Army, when he went into the kitchen and somebody had defecated in there.</span> <span id="s1489">Why would they do that?</span> <span id="s1490">Why wouldn't they go to the toilet?</span> <span id="s1491">Is that something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: I guess, I guess that's part a function of the breakdown of the inner self.</span> <span id="s1493">Now, I know no one in this room has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the bathroom, to urinate or to defecate.</span> <span id="s1494">I know that no one in this room has ever had the experience of letting a little go in the underwear.</span> <span id="s1495">But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner discipline, shoot desperately to a place where they can let go.</span> <span id="s1496">Alright?</span> <span id="s1497">So, one has to assume in these cases – not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation, I – but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain impulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate place to discharge.</span> <span id="s1498">That's my, how else can I explain it?</span> <span id="s1499">Can you think of another explanation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">08:27:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Very long line to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: That they had gone to the regular toilet and might have to wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: No.</span> <span id="s1505">By the law of averages, no, in a normal situation, by the law of averages, there are two or three bathrooms per building, the buildings are very close, so if this is lined up, it wouldn't have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: So, you’re saying that somewhere in that person's experience, perhaps, you know, whatever that experience was, before liberation, that they just kind of lost some of their–</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yeah, the starch, in the system.</span> <span id="s1508">They were beaten down so much.</span> <span id="s1509">They had to lose some of the starch.</span> <span id="s1510">But what's interesting is on certain things they had starch and other things they didn't have starch.</span> <span id="s1511">On certain things they had stubborn resistance capability and on other things, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1512">It takes awhile to reform the personality.</span> <span id="s1513">And–</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: You saw that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Yeah, but yet again, my vantage point doesn't enable me to see it person by person.</span> <span id="s1516">It isn't the matter of it disable – doesn't enable me, my attention wasn't drawn to it person by person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">08:29:10 End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">09:00:54</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: What did you learn from the experience?</span> <span id="s1521">Running the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before.</span> <span id="s1523">See, I'm, I'm an amalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist.</span> <span id="s1524">And, I believe very strongly in this.</span> <span id="s1525">But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the existence, and probably the necessity, for the "we/they" relationships.</span> <span id="s1526">So, when I think about the "we/they" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it means to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification, values.</span> <span id="s1527">But, in a certain sense, as "we," we shouldn't kill them.</span> <span id="s1528">We should find a way of relating to the "they."</span> <span id="s1529">All "they's" should find ways of relating to the "we's."</span> <span id="s1530">So, in a certain sense in the camp, the "we" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for balance in the "we/they" phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">09:03:20 And the Army that I was dealing with – which I don't generalize to the whole Army, became the they, more than the Germans – became the they, in a sense – and that probably does make me feel a little uncomfortable – because for me, I strong – I believe strongly that all people need to have a "we" relationship, but they shouldn’t convert that "we" relationship into a hostile, hostility to "they."</span> <span id="s1532">You see?</span> <span id="s1533">I mean, if you take for example, that thing I went through quickly with you, about Harlem hospital, where I was going in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days later, five days later was from their "we" into an act of aggression against the "they."</span> <span id="s1534">And it was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for.</span> <span id="s1535">And, so you get this all the time, and, and because, sometimes it’s because of the way in which they act.</span> <span id="s1536">That is the Katyúsha rockets make our we act in certain ways.</span> <span id="s1537">And that distresses me, even though I accept the counteraction.</span> <span id="s1538">But, I basically prefer for the walls to come down a little bit more among people.</span> <span id="s1539">Even though they need for their well-being, a "we" relationship.</span> <span id="s1540">So, in, in – at UNRRA, because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were building up some of the walls in me that I feel uncomfortable with.</span> <span id="s1541">But, hell, even Rabbi Halberstam had a little bit of that, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">09:06:03 So, I – but I've learned – what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the “we/they" relationships.</span> <span id="s1543">I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million things, focus on Sri Lanka.</span> <span id="s1544">I've been watching the Sri Lanka phenomenon for 20 years, now.</span> <span id="s1545">I always find these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me, but show how difficult it is to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: I'd like ask you to show us this picture that hangs in your hall, and–</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: This picture is me speaking to the hundreds upon hundreds of people collected for the Maccabi games.</span> <span id="s1548">Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because the weather was fine.</span> <span id="s1549">It could have been June.</span> <span id="s1550">And, we had hundreds of younger people engaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day.</span> <span id="s1551">[technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: This is me pointing something out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of UNRRA in Europe.</span> <span id="s1553">He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Commander during the European invasion.</span> <span id="s1554">He was the highest British military officer.</span> <span id="s1555">And, and I took him to the hospital, there are other pictures of him in the hospital and the vocational training facilities and in different parts of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi of Palestine.</span> <span id="s1557">He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us.</span> <span id="s1558">And, the camp was just in a state of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the camp, this was a new beginning, new life.</span> <span id="s1559">Now, I just want to point out, at his right shoulder, is an American by the name of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">09:08:48 I've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all the time.</span> <span id="s1561">Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his hat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s1562">He was a marvelous human being.</span> <span id="s1563">We used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi Halberstam, who had black hair.</span> <span id="s1564">Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav Lachman, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s1565">He became a high school principal in Israel.</span> <span id="s1566">And then beyond his left shoulder is me in Army dress, or UNRRA dress.</span> <span id="s1567">I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who was the President of Israel.</span> <span id="s1568">And, some years ago when I went to Israel, I put together an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the President.</span> <span id="s1569">And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approximately my age, he was in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to Germany.</span> <span id="s1570">So, we had a wonderful 15, 20 minutes together reminiscing.</span> <span id="s1571">This is a picture of a flag raising ceremony in Hochlandslager.</span> <span id="s1572">Where we were training some three to 400 young people as agricultural workers in kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s1573">Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency team.</span> <span id="s1574">To the right as you look at the picture, Sarah Entin passed away, unfortunately, early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">09:11:12 Next to her is Liowa Lak, whom I've spoken about before.</span> <span id="s1576">And next to him is Zviah Lahar, whom I also spoke about before.</span> <span id="s1577">She was the one who called me after the Hebron massacre.</span> <span id="s1578">This was around Passover time.</span> <span id="s1579">And again, a lovely occasion.</span> <span id="s1580">What can I say about this picture?</span> <span id="s1581">The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is how much eagerness and smiles are on the faces.</span> <span id="s1582">Because that's the thing that I most want to see.</span> <span id="s1583">And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so he'll get into the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">09:12:11 End of Tape #9</span></p> <p><span
