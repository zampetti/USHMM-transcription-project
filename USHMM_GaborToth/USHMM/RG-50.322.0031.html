January 28, 1980 Tape 1, Side 1</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: This is Tuesday, January 9, 1979, and I am in the living room of the apartment of Mr. Henry Steeber for the first of several interview sessions with him.</span> <span id="s3">Mr. Steeber, how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I’m 59.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: What was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: October 31, 1919</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And you grew up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s10">You spent your early years…</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Yes, I lived in Vienna until I was 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Does your family go far back?</span> <span id="s13">Were they always Austrians or do you know when they came to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I don’t know -- well my mother’s family was half German.</span> <span id="s15">My mother’s mother came from Berlin and my mother’s father was Viennese, and his family went…we followed it up until…about in 1799 in Vienna.</span> <span id="s16">We can’t do it very much further for, you know, under Empress Maria Theresa the Jews were thrown out of Austria.</span> <span id="s17">So it had to be after that time that they started again.</span> <span id="s18">My father’s mother came from Vienna.</span> <span id="s19">My father and mother were first cousins.</span> <span id="s20">My mother’s father and my father’s mother were brother and sister.</span> <span id="s21">So of course it’s the same background then for half of it, the same background as for my mother.</span> <span id="s22">My grandfather came from Moravia, my father’s father.</span> <span id="s23">I never knew him.</span> <span id="s24">I knew all the other grandparents and I knew my great grandmother.</span> <span id="s25">She was from Berlin.</span> <span id="s26">She was a Berliner, but I never knew my grandfather on my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Was your name Steeber or did you change your name when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, it was always Steeber, but it was spelled differently.</span> <span id="s29">It was S-t-i-e-b-e-r.</span> <span id="s30">My name was Heinz, Heinz Stieber.</span> <span id="s31">But when I came here everyone pronounced it “Styber” and I hated Styber, so I made it Steeber.</span> <span id="s32">Now nobody understands it at all anymore.</span> <span id="s33">It was somewhat of a mistake.</span> <span id="s34">And Heinz was always a little too German for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Were you the only child or did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s37">I was the only child of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did other family members other than you and your parents live in your household, such as grandparents?</span> <span id="s39">Did they live with you for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My grandparents lived for a while with us, yes.</span> <span id="s41">Actually we lived with my grandparents for a while.</span> <span id="s42">My father was a vice-president of a bank in Vienna and there was a big crash of banks; when the Bankverein crashed in Vienna, a lot of other banks followed and he lost his job and he went to Bucharest for a while.</span> <span id="s43">Father was in Bucharest, Romania, for a while, he had something to do with oil.</span> <span id="s44">What it really was I never found out.</span> <span id="s45">It never was quite clear what he did in Bucharest and my mother and I moved in with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s46">They had a very large apartment in Vienna.</span> <span id="s47">We lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Now, these were her parents, or your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Her parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Her parents.</span> <span id="s51">What was their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Jaff.</span> <span id="s53">(Spelled by HS)</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And you say your father was the vice-president of a bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">Of a bank in Vienna, until 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: The great worldwide crash.</span> <span id="s58">Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What was the education of your parents?</span> <span id="s61">Had they gone to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s63">High school as was normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes, gymnasium, that was the normal education.</span> <span id="s66">They received Matura--a diploma-- considerably more difficult, of course, than anything which has been invented here yet, (as High School graduation) but I really have no idea.</span> <span id="s67">It never came to my mind, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s70">They were very -- in one word, no.</span> <span id="s71">Not even my grandparents were particularly religious.</span> <span id="s72">I know I went with my grandfather once or twice to a synagogue, but I don’t really know why we went.</span> <span id="s73">I took religious instruction.</span> <span id="s74">You see, in Vienna, Catholicism is the state religion, of course, and the religious instruction is compulsory in school.</span> <span id="s75">Now in school itself you get Catholic instruction.</span> <span id="s76">For the Jews, it was given at other times, and in other places.</span> <span id="s77">You received time off during the religious instruction in school and had to take it at some other time, somewhere else.</span> <span id="s78">Everybody had to take these instructions, so I took them, too.</span> <span id="s79">Like in many cases is true today, unfortunately, this instruction is strictly one of observance, not of background, not of any knowledge.</span> <span id="s80">No knowledge whatsoever was imparted in it.</span> <span id="s81">We did learn how to pray and print in Hebrew, you learn how to be able to read a prayer book, but nobody told you what it meant at all.</span> <span id="s82">You had no idea what it meant.</span> <span id="s83">You were told, “Don’t ask questions, just read, read”.</span> <span id="s84">I had no religious upbringing at all.</span> <span id="s85">I would say that the little observance I developed was much later.</span> <span id="s86">My parents were as assimilated as you can become assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So you seldom attended synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Seldom.</span> <span id="s89">Very seldom, in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Not even on the High Holy Days?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span> <span id="s92">I just stayed home from school because it would not look nice if you would have gone to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Were you Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes, by my own request.</span> <span id="s95">That was in Berlin and my parents thought it was very cute.</span> <span id="s96">But my Bar Mitzvah was not a Bar Mitzvah as you would think, here of Bar Mitzvah in the United States.</span> <span id="s97">I didn’t even read from the Torah, the Haftorah.</span> <span id="s98">All it was --I went up and I sort of said the blessing before and afterwards, the readings that was it.</span> <span id="s99">(The usual practice in the United States is for the 13 year old to conduct a full service as his Bar Mitzvah.)</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So would you say that this Bar Mitzvah was more of a coming of age exercise?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I would think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: It was a celebration rather than a religious event?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No, it was a religious event -- you see the synagogues were a little bit different there.</span> <span id="s104">It was what you would call a liberal synagogue there which was the closest you could come to a conservative synagogue here, probably.</span> <span id="s105">In Berlin there was a time I went to the synagogue pretty regularly on holidays and so on.</span> <span id="s106">I went a lot on High Holidays and regular holidays, other holidays.</span> <span id="s107">For Pesach (Passover) or Shavuous, I would go to the synagogue and I went there quite comparatively frequently.</span> <span id="s108">More than once a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: With friends or with family?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No!</span> <span id="s111">Alone.</span> <span id="s112">Alone.</span> <span id="s113">Alone, as far as I can remember, I don’t think I went with friends.</span> <span id="s114">You know it is a funny thing because, uh, memory is so very selective.</span> <span id="s115">There are periods which are extremely clear and periods which are very hazy and it has nothing necessarily to do with time.</span> <span id="s116">Something which happened much earlier can be much clearer than something which happened later.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What was the principal language spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: German.</span> <span id="s120">Did your parents speak, or your grandparents speak any other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: My parents spoke both English and French and we spoke English.</span> <span id="s122">My mother liked to speak English.</span> <span id="s123">My father was not good in languages.</span> <span id="s124">He spoke, but very, very, very little really.</span> <span id="s125">My mother spoke well, English and French, but she liked to speak English, so we spoke English quite a bit at home and so it was always easy for me.</span> <span id="s126">Actually I think that when I came to the States, I spoke English better than I speak it now.</span> <span id="s127">But…I also had a French, uh, English, sometimes a French, sometimes an English tutor, “Hofmeister”.</span> <span id="s128">I don’t know whether you have heard the expression “Hofmeister”.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And I assume you studied English in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Formally.</span> <span id="s132">But when you say you spoke, your mother liked to speak English at home, was this common or was it a rather infrequent thing?</span> <span id="s133">Did you, for example, say, “Now this evening during supper we’re going to carry on our conversation in English,” and you would do that, oh, every evening, or was it just something?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No.</span> <span id="s135">We would talk once in a while in English.</span> <span id="s136">No it was not a regular occurrence, but we talked for ten minutes maybe in English, then we’d go right back to German.</span> <span id="s137">For both of us of course it was easier at the time to speak German, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: When you were living with your mother’s parents was your grandfather retired at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What occupation had he been in?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: He was a merchant.</span> <span id="s142">He had an import and export firm for mother-of-pearl buttons etc. uh…here, I give you a little idea how he looked.</span> <span id="s143">Say something nice while I’m away.</span> <span id="s144">It’s the only picture actually which I have left.</span> <span id="s145">So it gives you a little idea.</span> <span id="s146">It’s easier to talk about people once you see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: This is a family group.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes, this is my great grandmother, my grandmother, my grandfather, my mother and my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: It’s a lovely picture.</span> <span id="s150">I love the collars on the dresses and the fabric and length, both at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: It was taken in about 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Very nice.</span> <span id="s153">What about your father’s father, what occupation did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: He was a manufacturer of colored paper, “Buntpapier”.</span> <span id="s155">You know, you used to take to cut out things.</span> <span id="s156">They got them in books.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: It was construction paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, but glossy, it was glossy and thinner.</span> <span id="s159">It was like construction paper, but glossy surface and they had them in books in different colors for children mostly, also I guess for wrappings, etc.</span> <span id="s160">He was dead by the time I was around.</span> <span id="s161">I only knew he was a manufacturer of colored paper.</span> <span id="s162">What exactly he did, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did you travel very much as a youth, on vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Into other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No.</span> <span id="s167">Other countries -- we went to Italy, once in a while to the former Austrian province of “Sudtirol” to the Dolomite Mountains.</span> <span id="s168">It was then Italy at that time after WWI.</span> <span id="s169">We thought we would spend some time there.</span> <span id="s170">We had a summer apartment in Bad Ischl which is a very nice spa and was made famous by Emperor Francis Joseph.</span> <span id="s171">We went there during the summer.</span> <span id="s172">So it was a place to go, I suppose.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s174">But we had an apartment there and we went for a number of summers.</span> <span id="s175">Most of our summers we were stationary and in Austria, you know, various places in Austria.</span> <span id="s176">But at that time, you know, especially in the early time, until ’29, we traveled, I think.</span> <span id="s177">In summer, you know, you went to the country and you took the help along.</span> <span id="s178">We always had three people that was normal.</span> <span id="s179">There was nothing particular about that you know.</span> <span id="s180">Sounds fantastic today, but there was nothing particular at the time there were no electric appliances.</span> <span id="s181">My parents took the help over from my father’s parents, so they, of course, they ruled the place.</span> <span id="s182">These were people of course, who made a great impression on me in my youth.</span> <span id="s183">You know, I remember every detail about them.</span> <span id="s184">Marie Sudooda was the cook, and Lena Mayer was the maid, and Fraulein Paula was my nurse and was with me for a long time, for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Were these Jewish women?</span> <span id="s186">Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Oh, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s190">Very gentile, sure.</span> <span id="s191">There was no Jewish help.</span> <span id="s192">It didn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: I take it then that you were more or less upper middle class, manufacturing-commercial roots and backgrounds and so forth, and you thought of yourself as being rather comfortably off, possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: You say that your parents were very assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Do you recall that in their activities -- recreational, cultural, social -- they associated primarily with gentiles or with Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: There was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: No distinction at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s201">You know this is a strange thing, as anti-Semitic as Austria was, nobody asked; nobody ever asked whether you were a Jew or not when you were in a social situation.</span> <span id="s202">This came only much later, and only thinking back you think whether these were Jews or not, but at the time you did not really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Raise the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">Raise the question whether they were Jews or not.</span> <span id="s206">Again I guess this is one part of being assimilated, I suppose.</span> <span id="s207">I just read a book about Gustav Mahler, who was not a friend of my parents, but my parents knew him, my father knew him.</span> <span id="s208">My father was interested in music.</span> <span id="s209">I come across names, you know, names in the book which I knew from our family.</span> <span id="s210">Names which are friends of the family, I think, are mentioned in the book here, and only now when I think about it -- sure he must have been a Jew.</span> <span id="s211">But I don’t think ever anybody thought about it whether he was a Jew or not.</span> <span id="s212">Of course you couldn’t get certain jobs if you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s213">Anti-Semitism was strong, but there was a certain social intercourse where really it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s214">That was very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Am I wrong?</span> <span id="s216">Did not (Mahler) have to convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s218">To become director of the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: To become director of the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Oh, sure!</span> <span id="s221">He could not have been director of the opera.</span> <span id="s222">I heard a lot of things; we had a lot of relatives and friends I remember very well.</span> <span id="s223">Dr. Burger was a cousin of my mother and probably was the leading gynecologist in Vienna.</span> <span id="s224">And he never was able to get a professorship at the University because he refused to convert.</span> <span id="s225">He was a Jew and he couldn’t get a professorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Within your circle of friends, acquaintances, your family’s business connections and so forth; among that group, that larger group, which was Jewish, to what extent was the synagogue the center of their activities?</span> <span id="s227">Were they totally assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No.</span> <span id="s229">Jews at this time, assimilated Jews of this time were quite anti-Semitic themselves and there was a great urge to be just like the non-Jews, just like the Christians, just a little bit more so.</span> <span id="s230">It may sound a little bitter.</span> <span id="s231">It was so for a long time, but you’re in a situation and you do not notice what you do to yourself, what you do to others, but in retrospect and with 20/20 hindsight you see what you did.</span> <span id="s232">And I think it was quite vicious what many of our people did.</span> <span id="s233">And there was of course a great animosity against Eastern Jews, which was heartily reciprocated, naturally, but that was a thing that was done.</span> <span id="s234">You would not possibly have social contact with an Eastern Jew; you would have social contact with a non-Jew, but not with an Eastern Jew.</span> <span id="s235">There was much more there.</span> <span id="s236">I remember that my grandfather, who would write humorous verses at some appropriate or inappropriate occasions, wrote about a friend of his, a friend who was acceptable by that time.</span> <span id="s237">He had some kind of anniversary or whatever, a doctor Kolischer.</span> <span id="s238">My grandfather wrote one of the things that remained for posterity, one of the verses, and which translates quite easily “and though he is a Polisher, long live Dr. Kolischer”.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: What kinds of activities or associations did your family engage in or belong to?</span> <span id="s240">I’m thinking, for example, in terms of theater.</span> <span id="s241">Did they subscribe to the theater?</span> <span id="s242">Did they have seats, what we would call season tickets to the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s245">Don’t forget there was a break in ’29, number one, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: And then there was another one in ’31 when things were not good.</span> <span id="s248">So much of the time I remember is not even in Vienna, it is in Berlin.</span> <span id="s249">I remember more about life in Berlin, than I remember about life in Vienna.</span> <span id="s250">We went to the theater.</span> <span id="s251">They went to the theater and opera.</span> <span id="s252">There was a lot of music.</span> <span id="s253">Both of them liked music.</span> <span id="s254">We had house music.</span> <span id="s255">My father played the viola and, uh, this I remember, see how ridiculous it is that I remember the man who played the cello, Dr. Kimous.</span> <span id="s256">Now why would I remember him?</span> <span id="s257">I have no idea who played the violins.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: What about politics?</span> <span id="s259">Did your family, in Vienna or in Berlin participate?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No, no, not really.</span> <span id="s261">Just strictly, I will say strictly bourgeois politics, I will call it that.</span> <span id="s262">My grandfather, he liked the Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s263">He was a semi-Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s264">It was quite daring at the time to be a Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s265">He liked to shock people.</span> <span id="s266">I think that was his aim more than anything else.</span> <span id="s267">I think they were completely politically rather naïve, as most people were.</span> <span id="s268">There was really no participation in politics!</span> <span id="s269">As long as you had plenty to eat and everything was nice and comfortable, why, why rock the boat?</span> <span id="s270">If they were anything my parents were Monarchists.</span> <span id="s271">The good days, you know, the good times were when the Hapsburgs were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Now, these, what, ten years that you lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s273">Your first ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Twelve years.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Twelve years, 1919 to 1931.</span> <span id="s276">As you look back and remember them, even though your memory is not going to be very sharp because you were just a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah, well, I remember a lot of it, rather well.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Do you think of them with warm feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Of happiness and comfort?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: And security?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A; Yes, yes, generally, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: And the reason I ask that is that I grew up in a small town in East Texas where there was a very small Jewish community, maybe ten families at the most, and one of the Jews in the community, a very good friend of ours, was from Vienna and she had left Vienna in 1919 or 1920, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s285">She frequently spoke about how bad things were in Vienna right at the tail end of World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Terrible, terrible!</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: The shortage of food!</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Terrible, terrible!</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Happy if you could find a rat to bake.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Terrible, terrible!</span> <span id="s291">That was again a matter where the people with money had it a little bit easier, a little bit better.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And I assume she probably came from the lower class, but you don’t remember those kinds of shortages.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Only from tales do I know that.</span> <span id="s294">The greatest hardship for my parents was, and I don’t want to sound cynical and don’t want to sound glib, but looking back at some of the things or of you see it in a movie or think about it, how superficial people were these days, but it was a life then.</span> <span id="s295">There was a lot of superficiality to it, but I remember that my parents had to go to Budapest to go to a confectioner because they didn’t get stuff in Vienna.</span> <span id="s296">At Damels (probably the name of a confectionary store), they didn’t have anything, so they went to a store in Budapest which was a very big, very beautiful confectionary store.</span> <span id="s297">They went to Budapest to eat, uh, to get enough whipped cream.</span> <span id="s298">It was, you see, this was the difference.</span> <span id="s299">Now I was very badly nourished as a child.</span> <span id="s300">I had, I don’t know that I really had it, but I was told, I had rickets as a child because of the lack of proper nourishment.</span> <span id="s301">You could not get food it was terrible in Vienna, there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s302">But again I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s303">What I remember when I start remembering, was when I was about five or six years old, was when I went to school first.</span> <span id="s304">I remember very well, but then there was enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did the onset of the Depression and the crash and the closing of the bank in 1929?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: That didn’t make any impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Did it not drastically change your lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Other than moving in with grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s311">There was a lack of money, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s312">I think I really was a problem child, for a while.</span> <span id="s313">I was sick a lot and what it was nobody ever knew.</span> <span id="s314">I really don’t know for sure whether I faked it or whether I was really sick.</span> <span id="s315">I was a bad student for my first year of what was high school in Austria which was fifth grade.</span> <span id="s316">I really was very bad then.</span> <span id="s317">They sent me to another school.</span> <span id="s318">My mother sent me to another school in Grinzig, a kind of private school.</span> <span id="s319">Whether it was easier or whether they were just bored with me, I don’t know, but I went there until I went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s320">Then in Berlin the schools were much easier I think than in Vienna.</span> <span id="s321">It was not hard as the Austrian schools.</span> <span id="s322">Austrian schools were very, very hard, very difficult.</span> <span id="s323">Then I did all right, but I think I had problems at this time.</span> <span id="s324">Exactly what it was I don’t know but I know that my mother was unhappy and that other people were unhappy and there were councils about “What to do with Heinzle?”</span> <span id="s325">There must have been problems, you know?</span> <span id="s326">Maybe it would come back to me, but I don’t even really try, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: When your father went to Budapest (the capital of Hungary).</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Bucharest.</span> <span id="s329">(The capital of Romania)</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I’m sorry, Bucharest!</span> <span id="s331">What job did he hold?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: He was in oil, with an oil company.</span> <span id="s333">What he did with the oil company I never really found out.</span> <span id="s334">He had something to do with petroleum.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And how long was he in Bucharest, two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: He came back in ’31.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: He came back and went to Berlin in ’31.</span> <span id="s339">Whatever he did didn’t work out very well in Bucharest, quite obviously.</span> <span id="s340">He came back in I think ’30.</span> <span id="s341">In the beginning of ’31, I think.</span> <span id="s342">He came in the spring of ’31 and then my mother followed him in the summer.</span> <span id="s343">She left Berlin in the summer and I stayed for a couple of months with my grandparents and then I left sometime in the fall of ’31 from Berlin.</span> <span id="s344">It was my first train trip, solo train trip.</span> <span id="s345">It made a great impression on me and I hoped it would never end.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: You were in Berlin until ’36 or ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: In ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: In ’36, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And that would have made you 17 years old, then.</span> <span id="s351">Seventeen or eighteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Thirty-six would make me 16 or 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yes, 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s354">Now, the schools that you went to both in Vienna and you mentioned another name a little while ago Gastein (Gastein was the name of a place famous for its water cures).</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, Grinzig.</span> <span id="s356">That was just a suburb of Vienna, you know, a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: And in Berlin, were they private schools or public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Public schools except for this one school, this one year in Grinzig.</span> <span id="s359">It was one year, two years?</span> <span id="s360">It was two years, but the second year I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Now back to languages again.</span> <span id="s362">Of course you were native speaking German?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: German.</span> <span id="s365">And you spoke English at home.</span> <span id="s366">What about your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Well, my first language was English, my second language was French and my third language was Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: All right, in French, were you as fluent as you were in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, I never was as fluent as in English.</span> <span id="s370">I was much more fluent than I am now because I had a lot more practice, but I never did as well and I never spoke as well as I spoke English and Latin was a completely lost cause with me, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Now, in Berlin during your school days beginning in 1931.</span> <span id="s372">Hitler comes to power in ‘33, late January of ’33?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: The 30th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So that ’33, ’34, ’35, 36 -- that means four years you would have been in school in Berlin after Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s375">Do you recall being increasingly aware of anti-Semitism in the school system?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Could you give me any examples of how this was manifested?</span> <span id="s378">Teachers discriminating against you or harassment by fellow students?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I really don’t think that in Berlin it was really not as bad as elsewhere.</span> <span id="s380">There was always a difference between Berlin and the rest of the country, I think.</span> <span id="s381">Berlin was always not quite as bad as the rest of Germany.</span> <span id="s382">There were teachers, though, most teachers I think were Nazis, were National Socialists.</span> <span id="s383">Some were not.</span> <span id="s384">The discrimination, there was some, the trend of the teaching was completely nationalistic, of course.</span> <span id="s385">As far as the teachers were concerned I really, I cannot say, except for remarks from one or two, that I suffered from the teachers.</span> <span id="s386">I think it was more certain people, certain school friends, I’ll call them friends.</span> <span id="s387">Especially I had one friend who was, of all people an Armenian.</span> <span id="s388">It wasn’t in ’33, but I was thinking in ’35 or so, he cut me dead.</span> <span id="s389">He didn’t want to have anything to do with me anymore and this was one thing which hurt me very much.</span> <span id="s390">I know that his father was violently anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s391">Well, it was just the peer influence and I guess he couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s392">But I would think it was the contrary many times as far as the teachers were concerned.</span> <span id="s393">We went to a camp, the school went to a camp once a year.</span> <span id="s394">I don’t remember the details why or how, I don’t remember anymore, but my parents were doubtful whether I should go and they talked with one or two of the teachers.</span> <span id="s395">They said, “Oh, definitely he should go.</span> <span id="s396">It would be a mistake if he wouldn’t.”</span> <span id="s397">I was only a teenager.</span> <span id="s398">“It would be a mistake if you wouldn’t go.”</span> <span id="s399">So I went.</span> <span id="s400">So the first day, the first morning, every morning they put up the flag and saluted the flag and had some kind of a little speech and a little saying and the first saying, the first morning it was a quote -- maybe it was the second morning -- a quote from Dr. Joseph Goebbels (the Minister of Propaganda) said, “The Jew has no place in our Folksgemeinschaft” which means in our folk community.</span> <span id="s401">So after I heard this I went to whoever was in charge and I said, “If he hasn’t what am I doing here?”</span> <span id="s402">He said, “Well, I think you’re right, it’s better that you leave.”</span> <span id="s403">And I think that was just about the end of my German school experience in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How old were you at that time?</span> <span id="s405">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: That must have been ’36.</span> <span id="s407">That’s when I left the school in Berlin.</span> <span id="s408">I went to Austria.</span> <span id="s409">My parents sent me to Austria to friends who had a house in Macha on the Danube and so I stayed there for the summer and I was interested in photography at that time and they had a very good -- of course Austria was still Austria you know, at that time (before the “Anschluss” between Germany and Austria of April 1938) -- school in Vienna: the “Graphische Lehr und Versuchsanstalt”, which taught, among other things, photography, but also various other arts and graphic techniques.</span> <span id="s410">I enrolled.</span> <span id="s411">I was able to enroll in that school.</span> <span id="s412">So I stayed in Vienna and I stayed with some people.</span> <span id="s413">I had a room with some people and friends, acquaintances, and stayed there from 1936 until 1938.</span> <span id="s414">Until Hitler came into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Now let me back up and before we get into your Vienna photography school there are still other questions I would like to pose about your years in Berlin.</span> <span id="s416">What impact did the coming to power of Hitler have on your family and their activities and their outlooks and religion?</span> <span id="s417">Did they begin to become more religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No!</span> <span id="s419">I don’t think there was any in the beginning at all.</span> <span id="s420">I mean there were just a somewhat, uh… somewhat detached from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s421">“It’s not going to last!”</span> <span id="s422">First that it’s not going to last, number two that it is not directed at us and after all we are Austrians, we are not disturbing the peace.</span> <span id="s423">We felt that it is not going to last!</span> <span id="s424">Besides my parents at that time, we were Austrians in Germany.</span> <span id="s425">We were foreigners!</span> <span id="s426">So again that attitude -- detached point of view.</span> <span id="s427">Also being Austrian my father had no problem with his job.</span> <span id="s428">He was at that time representative of a Danish vacuum cleaner service in Berlin, in Germany, of the Niefisk Co.</span> <span id="s429">So again they felt that it’s not going to concern them.</span> <span id="s430">Also you could see in Berlin the trend was -- the trend, of the Berliners too -- somehow was not to take these things quite seriously.</span> <span id="s431">I remember the beginning of ’33, I think it was ’33.</span> <span id="s432">It was the first boycott of Jewish shops in Berlin.</span> <span id="s433">Wasn’t it ’33?</span> <span id="s434">It was April or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: March.</span> <span id="s436">(The boycott was actually on April 1, 1933)</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: March of ’33!</span> <span id="s438">Well, there was some unpleasantness now and then, but generally it was very much disregarded and ignored by the people.</span> <span id="s439">They would -- the SA (Hitler’s Brown Shirt uniformed storm troopers) would go around in the trucks with the loudspeakers -- they said in German “Don’t buy from Jews” and “The Jews are our misfortune,” I don’t think it was taken seriously by many people.</span> <span id="s440">I remember very well standing there and watching people going in and out of stores and being badgered by SA people, and SA troopers.</span> <span id="s441">They would laugh and some wouldn’t go and some would go and there was no unpleasantness --I didn’t see any of it.</span> <span id="s442">It was easy to ignore it, somehow, the whole situation, at least in the beginning</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Did that pertain up to 1936, you saw no unpleasantness?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Well, I think we had unpleasantness.</span> <span id="s445">Oh, there were signs of course.</span> <span id="s446">Signs appeared, reading in German “Jews are not wanted.”</span> <span id="s447">In Berlin they had a habit of putting these signs right in the back of cafes or restaurants right in the back where nobody could see them, you know.</span> <span id="s448">Some didn’t of course.</span> <span id="s449">I cannot, I don’t remember any unpleasant incident in Berlin, actually, anything unpleasant until 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you witness any of these mass spectacles, parades, assemblies?</span> <span id="s451">Did you ever see Hitler, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I never saw Hitler until Vienna.</span> <span id="s453">In Vienna I saw Hitler.</span> <span id="s454">I never saw him before.</span> <span id="s455">Oh, I saw him on the first of May we would see the May Day parade, etc.</span> <span id="s456">Again you see we could watch it in the beginning in 1933 or 1934.</span> <span id="s457">You could watch a May Day parade with the swastikas going by without stretching out your arm.</span> <span id="s458">Nobody was hitting you if you didn’t do it, if you didn’t extend your sincere German greeting.</span> <span id="s459">No, I think the first was in 1938, in November 1938.</span> <span id="s460">Except that you didn’t go to a place where you saw a sign “Jews are not wanted” and of course it sort of got tighter and tighter and in “38 one tried very much to get out of the country already, but one was not able to anymore, you know, in many cases.</span> <span id="s461">So in the beginning I do not think really, except for my school experience, that it was really not possible for me or at least very unpleasant for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s462">I don’t remember how long it was possible to go to school, really, until they threw out all the Jews from the schools.</span> <span id="s463">I just don’t remember it, but I really don’t remember any unpleasantness.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you and your family have many friends who were leaving in that period of ’35, ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s468">Yes.</span> <span id="s469">Yes, a number of them, yah.</span> <span id="s470">You see again my parents were not ready.</span> <span id="s471">I was young enough and I guess I was rather immature even for my age, protected and immature for my age, but I remember that I was the first one in the…(tape runs out on tape 1 side 1) Tape 1, Side 2</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: This is the second side of the tape for the first session with Mr. Steeber.</span> <span id="s473">Now, Mr. Steeber you were saying that you were the first one in your family to say that you wanted to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: My parents still had a certain feeling of security.</span> <span id="s475">Again assimilated people, people who lived in Germany and Austria for so long just could not understand that, did not think it possible, that any of this anti-Semitism could be really directed against them.</span> <span id="s476">It was just an aberration which had to stop at any moment now.</span> <span id="s477">I didn’t really think do and I wanted to get out I started to look myself, very late; we couldn’t get an affidavit.</span> <span id="s478">Well this comes later, I mean my search for exit but I think my parents recognized the danger, the real danger too late, too late!</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: What month did you leave Berlin for Vienna?</span> <span id="s480">When you went to the photography school?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well I didn’t go to the photography school immediately.</span> <span id="s482">I went to uh to stay with some friends in Austria; it must have been in June 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Do you recall the Nuremburg Laws in 1936?</span> <span id="s484">Were you in Germany when they were passed?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s486">They were passed while I was still in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: I think that the spring, late winter or early spring of ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: It was ’35 wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s489">(Actually it was on September 15, 1935).</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Well it may have been ’35 I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I think it was ’35, yes!</span> <span id="s492">Again, many of them were taken somewhat as a joke.</span> <span id="s493">Some of them were quite funny, you know.</span> <span id="s494">Especially that they can’t take a maid who is younger than forty years old.</span> <span id="s495">I remember thinking wait, wait.</span> <span id="s496">Some of it was hideous, some of them were absurd even then these laws were taken much lighter than they should have been.</span> <span id="s497">We did not have maids of any kind anymore so it did not make any difference.</span> <span id="s498">But it was not as bad as the laws which were passed after 1938 when you had to wear the star and take Israel and Sarah as middle name.</span> <span id="s499">These things were personal, which affected everybody personally you know.</span> <span id="s500">But these (the so-called Nuremburg Laws) in a way they were ridiculous.</span> <span id="s501">Unfortunately, the great tragedy was that so many people who should have known better did regard many of these things as ridiculous, didn’t take Hitler seriously, never read “Mein Kampf” (the book of Hitler’s aims).</span> <span id="s502">If they had read it they never would have believed it, it was just another book by a crazy guy.</span> <span id="s503">Nobody thought it would last!</span> <span id="s504">In 1934 when the Rhein putsch (the remilitarization of the Rhein Valley) was.</span> <span id="s505">Then everybody thought it would be over quickly.</span> <span id="s506">They said see it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s507">(France, Britain and Belgium were displeased, so it was believed that at least one of them would throw Hitler out).</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Were you very athletic?</span> <span id="s509">Were inclined to be athletic or interested in athletics?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No!</span> <span id="s511">No!</span> <span id="s512">Absolutely not!</span> <span id="s513">I am unfortunately very un-athletic.</span> <span id="s514">I think that I have two left feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: I ask this because of what you told me before we turned on the tape about your escapes which we will go into later on in some detail.</span> <span id="s516">They made me think that you must have developed a certain agility.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Not at all!</span> <span id="s518">Not at all.</span> <span id="s519">It was strictly what it came to do when you are frightened to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Were you more interested as you reached your teens, 14, 15, 16 years old so forth, were you more interested in business and commerce or in art, music, painting and culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: The latter?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s524">No, I never was interested in business and commercial subjects, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s525">I was much more practical.</span> <span id="s526">Being a photographer I was interested in photography, you know.</span> <span id="s527">I liked museums I saw a lot of pictures and listened to a lot of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: You say that you came from a home that was very appreciative of music.</span> <span id="s529">That your father had contact with Mahler.</span> <span id="s530">Do you remember any other musical figures of the era either in Austria or Germany, major or minor with whom your family had contact or that you met personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I know Lotte Lehmann.</span> <span id="s532">She was a singer she was a friend (she was a soprano born in 1888).</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Kurt Weill’s wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s535">Elisabeth Schumann.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Elisabeth Schumann!</span> <span id="s537">I knew Lotte Lehmann a little, but Elisabeth Schumann she was a friend of the family.</span> <span id="s538">There was a story that she sang for me.</span> <span id="s539">I have no idea anymore what it was.</span> <span id="s540">Some critics such as Richard Speckter.</span> <span id="s541">I read about him.</span> <span id="s542">(Transcriber is not certain of the spelling, it may be Specht).</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: He’s quite famous!</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: What?</span> <span id="s545">Oh, he is?</span> <span id="s546">Well actually I never knew him.</span> <span id="s547">I knew his wife, he died before my time.</span> <span id="s548">There must have been some others.</span> <span id="s549">It was really before the age when I would have appreciated these things.</span> <span id="s550">Today I am sorry it was before my reaching such an age.</span> <span id="s551">I would have had fun if I would have been more aware of it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: When you started the photography school in Vienna, and you say that you studied that for two years before you were kicked out, expelled because of your being a Jew, were you more oriented toward commercial photography, or artistic photography?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Commercial photography, advertising photography.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: You were training for a career in commercial photography?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Well at that time, you see it was a three year course and I only could take two so I didn’t do everything that they taught.</span> <span id="s556">I did portraits and commercial and so on.</span> <span id="s557">However later, after this, I did work in commercial photography, also in early color photography.</span> <span id="s558">If I talk to today’s photographers they will say “these old fogies?</span> <span id="s559">What do they know -- what stories they are telling?</span> <span id="s560">All these lies!”</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did you have contact with any Austrian photographers?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: German photographers, if any.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: German photographers who might have some reputation in the development of photography or have become famous as artistic photographers, landscape photographers?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: I don’t think anybody with a reputation.</span> <span id="s565">I was connected with some, but I can’t remember the names right.</span> <span id="s566">There was nobody really whom made any mark who has name recognition.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: None of your teachers were famous?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Well there was one teacher, I think that she did nice things and became famous after the war.</span> <span id="s569">I can’t think of her name right now, that is a strange thing.</span> <span id="s570">And I know her very well, she was a strange woman she was an early Nazi an illegal Nazi.</span> <span id="s571">Before 1938 the Nazi party was not legal in Austria but she was about the only decent person n the whole school.</span> <span id="s572">It was a horribly terribly Nazi-ist school.</span> <span id="s573">The school became a hotbed of Naziism but she was really decent.</span> <span id="s574">She behaved very, very decently, Lucca Chmel was her name (spelled by HS).</span> <span id="s575">She became I guess, semi-famous after the war.</span> <span id="s576">She was the only person really I looked up after the war when I came back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s577">I said “Listen if you have any problems if you need anybody to vouch for you, or such a thing come to me.”</span> <span id="s578">She was very decent, she was a decent soul.</span> <span id="s579">She was just about the only one.</span> <span id="s580">Otherwise professor Madensky, he was the department head, I think that he is a well- known photographer, but I think that he was an out and out Nazi.</span> <span id="s581">After the war I came back and I saw him and he said the only thing he regretted was that I was still alive.</span> <span id="s582">So this was the faculty.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Well I have kept you know about an hour and I think I will terminate this session and we will take it up at that point next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">End of the first session.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: This is the second interview session with Mr. Henry Steeber.</span> <span id="s586">It is Tuesday February the 6th 1979 and we are in the living room of his apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Mr. Steeber, when did you get to Vienna to enter the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: In 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: In June or February?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: No I left Berlin to stay with friends in the Vachau which is an area not far from Vienna for the summer and then I went in the early fall, I suppose, I went to Vienna and took a test, an entrance exam for the school and was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Now that was the fall of ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Of ’38.</span> <span id="s593">No, I am sorry, I am wrong, what are we talking about, it was in ’36.</span> <span id="s594">(This was stated earlier)</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Fall of ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: In ’36.</span> <span id="s597">In ’38 I didn’t get anywhere anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: So you had been in Vienna a year and a half then, before the Anschluss?</span> <span id="s599">From the fall of ’36 to the early spring of ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Correct!</span> <span id="s601">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Now we talked about the photography school last time so I am not going to ask you questions about that today but I would like to get your analysis and comments on the politics of Austria in this sort of touch and go period when Schuschnigg (Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg) was the prime minister and trying to hold off the Germans and at the same time satisfy the Nationalists in Austria and how that had an impact on the Jewish population in Vienna.</span> <span id="s603">.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: The Jews, of course, at least the Jews I came in contact with, again I cannot talk for the masses, you know I had quite a number of friends.</span> <span id="s605">Some relatives in Vienna and they were of course, much by necessity, all the Jews were pro-Schuschnigg there was no other way.</span> <span id="s606">Schuschnigg was not considered ideal, but it was only the least evil choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: The best choice available?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: The least evil!</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: The least evil, leaving much to be desired?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s611">By that time there was a great amount of anti-Semitism and that became more.</span> <span id="s612">There always was a lot of anti-Semitism you know, in Vienna of course but it became more and more into the open at that time.</span> <span id="s613">In school, the Nazi party was still illegal for a good part of the time until Schuschnigg went to Berchdesgaden (Hitler’s residence in the Alps).</span> <span id="s614">I would say that among the teachers about 80% were illegal Nazis.</span> <span id="s615">This was not necessarily expressed in their attitudes towards Jews.</span> <span id="s616">There were very few Jews in that school, very few.</span> <span id="s617">Our department head (Madensky) was a Nazi and an anti-Semite and as unpleasant as a person can be.</span> <span id="s618">He had an assistant, a woman, Lucca Chmel, she became quite a well -known photographer, who was an illegal party member.</span> <span id="s619">I don’t know what Madensky even was, but she was an illegal party member.</span> <span id="s620">She did everything possible to soften the blows.</span> <span id="s621">She was a very very sensitive and decent woman.</span> <span id="s622">She was the only person I remember when I came back to Vienna after the war I looked up and told her that anything I can do for her to let me know and that I would be very happy to do it.</span> <span id="s623">Yes that woman, C-h-m-e-l, a rather difficult name, was the only person where I went after the war and asked if she needed any references I’d be happy to provide them.</span> <span id="s624">She had trouble of course having been an illegal party member.</span> <span id="s625">She was very very decent, but the student body and the teachers were rather unpleasant.</span> <span id="s626">It got more and more unpleasant as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did that take the form of acts of violence or was it just merely slurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Slurs.</span> <span id="s629">There were fights.</span> <span id="s630">I had one fight that I remember, physical fight with a chap from Switzerland of all places, a Swiss who was very smitten with the ideology.</span> <span id="s631">There were not constant fights of course, but it was verbal Of course usually.</span> <span id="s632">Outside of the school, really life went on as usual and Jews still went to the café house and talked and nobody really believed it would happen.</span> <span id="s633">At that time I must say truthfully it did not seem that there was an imminent danger of a Nazi takeover.</span> <span id="s634">We didn’t see very much!</span> <span id="s635">You know that it’s very easy with hindsight to see that it was inevitable that Hitler would take over.</span> <span id="s636">However at that time you lived in a small country, you still had all the foreign papers you could talk whatever you wanted as long as it was to the right, left (Communist and Socialist) talk was not taken so easily.</span> <span id="s637">You had a certain feeling of safety there you know.</span> <span id="s638">You saw what was going on in Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s639">Even when Schuschnigg went to Berchdesgaden and came back you still thought: “Oh he made an excellent speech!”</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Was there any tendency to deny Jews entry into shops?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No!</span> <span id="s642">Before Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Before the Anschluss, in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No!</span> <span id="s645">Absolutely not, a lot of shops.</span> <span id="s646">A great many shops were owned by Jews including larger ones, the department stores.</span> <span id="s647">No, absolutely not!</span> <span id="s648">There was no overt anti-Semitism, even in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s649">There really was not anymore than there always was.</span> <span id="s650">Again, naturally, I did not mingle with the frantic Nazis.</span> <span id="s651">The frantic Nazis of course they were there and they were much more of course in the provinces such as in Graz there were nothing but.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: That was my next question was Vienna a center of Naziism or was it more in the other towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: More in the other towns and villages.</span> <span id="s654">Even in Vienna there was enough but it’s a matter of degrees.</span> <span id="s655">You know if somebody bashes in your head I don’t know whether everybody agrees or of only 50% of the people agree, the result is the same.</span> <span id="s656">There were more incidents I think that was the crux of the matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: When would you say the real crisis developed?</span> <span id="s658">As far as German-Austrian relations were concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: With the meeting in Berchdesgaden (at that meeting on Feb 12, 1938 Hitler had a temper tantrum against Schuschnigg who then gave into Hitler’s demands)</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: In February?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Whenever it was, it was February wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s662">I think the 25th of February or something like that because then Schuschnigg went to Berchdesgaden and came back but then he made a tremendous speech before the Bundestag before the Austrian Parliament.</span> <span id="s663">Schuschnigg and everyone was elated that he had stood his ground against Hitler.</span> <span id="s664">Schuschnigg made the speech kind of kidding Hitler and ridiculing him.</span> <span id="s665">It was very uplifting.</span> <span id="s666">But of course immediately he had to legalize the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s667">He had to take Nazis into the government (Reischenau and Seyss-Inquart).</span> <span id="s668">Even then it was ridiculous that one didn’t see the handwriting on the wall for the plebiscite.</span> <span id="s669">At the same time he let loose his drive, Schuschnigg as suddenly found his love for the Socialists again.</span> <span id="s670">He let them loose you know but of course it was much too late.</span> <span id="s671">I think if he would have done this two years earlier, let the socialists back in maybe it could have been worked, I don’t know!</span> <span id="s672">Schuschnigg was rather unfortunately extremely unpopular.</span> <span id="s673">He would probably have won the plebiscite somehow but with the pressure (from the Nazis) and so on but he was forced to call it off.</span> <span id="s674">With all due respect if there is a typical Jesuit he was a typical Jesuit.</span> <span id="s675">He was very intellectual which is already a sin to start with to be an intellectual.</span> <span id="s676">He was very intellectual, very clerical in his whole approach.</span> <span id="s677">He was a little bit too much holier than thou in many respects.</span> <span id="s678">Anyhow once the outbursts started then already I would say; it was in the beginning of March during the first week of March, you should have seen where things were leading.</span> <span id="s679">There was a German travel bureau near the opera in Vienna.</span> <span id="s680">There was suddenly a big picture of Hitler in the window and the swastika and flowers all over.</span> <span id="s681">It was overflowing with glowers in front of Hitler’s picture, well, then we came to the 11th of March (actually the Anschluss was on March 14, 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: March!</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: The 11th of March and the abdication of Schuschnigg and the entering of the Germans and you should have seen Vienna after he abdicated.</span> <span id="s684">That was full of people rejoicing.</span> <span id="s685">All the police immediately with the swastika on the sleeves and everybody sporting a swastika.</span> <span id="s686">You could be sure that anybody who didn’t have a swastika was a Jew.</span> <span id="s687">Even the people who were not pro Nazi at that time wore the swastika just because it was the thing of the hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Did you feel any panic?</span> <span id="s689">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I don’t think so!</span> <span id="s691">Don’t forget I came from Germany where they had had it for five years already, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s692">So I had it in Germany for so many years!</span> <span id="s693">It was a great disappointment, it was a great letdown.</span> <span id="s694">I felt very badly about it.</span> <span id="s695">I thought that I knew what was in the offing, because I had the experience before, it was really not too new to me.</span> <span id="s696">There was a lot of panic of course.</span> <span id="s697">There were a lot of suicides there were a lot of people running around like a chicken with the head cut off.</span> <span id="s698">The jubilation of the Viennese and contentment of the Viennese was there.</span> <span id="s699">It was enormous, just enormous, just unbelievable!</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Did you begin to make any plans about what to do?</span> <span id="s701">In your circle of friends, for example, was there talk about what action you could take?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: It was kind of falling apart, the whole thing was; it was everybody for himself.</span> <span id="s703">You know I really have no recollection of any discussions on these things.</span> <span id="s704">I left very shortly after that.</span> <span id="s705">I think I stayed until the end of the school year in Vienna.</span> <span id="s706">It was very unpleasant but they didn’t throw me out until I finished the second year.</span> <span id="s707">I think I stayed until June.</span> <span id="s708">Truthfully, I don’t have many recollections of that time.</span> <span id="s709">I know what went on in Vienna.</span> <span id="s710">I know that again, the young punks went into the coffee houses and restaurants and so on and tried to collect Jews and take them out and have them scrub streets and other unpleasantness so it was a very rough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Were you able to avoid all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: I was able to avoid all that, by stealth and just being as careful as possible.</span> <span id="s713">I don’t know, but I don’t look, you know, like the Nazis stereotype picture of Jews which they had in Der Stuermer, the anti-Semitic paper.</span> <span id="s714">I didn’t look like this, that was one thing.</span> <span id="s715">Of course I didn’t wear a swastika, that was the sign that something was wrong with me you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: How quickly were the anti-Semitic decrees of Germany enforced in Austria?</span> <span id="s717">For example using the name Abraham and Sarah and wearing the yellow star (the wearing of that sign was not required until later)?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Israel, it was Israel (that was the required name for male Jews)!</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Israel and Sarah, wearing the yellow star, having to get rid of maids who were under a specific age.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: You did not have the yellow star at that time.</span> <span id="s721">The yellow star came later.</span> <span id="s722">The yellow star came after Kristallancht (That was the night of November 9-10, 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: What about such things as the Nuremburg Laws were they immediately enforced in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, as soon as the Anschluss with Germany took place, you know, as soon as the Anschluss was there on the 14th of March immediately there were the same laws.</span> <span id="s725">Now when you were expelled from school, do you recall that incident, were you called into the principal’s or headmaster’s office?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No!</span> <span id="s727">No!</span> <span id="s728">I mean that it was quite impossible to continue to go.</span> <span id="s729">I don’t think there was such an expulsion.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: No official act of expulsion?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: An official act of expulsion?</span> <span id="s732">I don’t think so!</span> <span id="s733">As I say I really have very little recollection of this last month in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I was living with friends with a family across from the opera.</span> <span id="s736">It was a big building behind the opera.</span> <span id="s737">I had a room there.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Was it a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Half Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Do you recall the reaction that they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Oh they were very much disgusted, very much against it.</span> <span id="s742">They were able to leave pretty soon I remember that.</span> <span id="s743">One of the sons got out of Austria very early.</span> <span id="s744">I think I remember that he went to Australia very very early in the game.</span> <span id="s745">I think that it was before the Anschluss there were some people I think were a little bit more foresighted.</span> <span id="s746">They all got out.</span> <span id="s747">I remember, they all got out I think just about the same time I left, but even that I am not sure.</span> <span id="s748">I know that one daughter, Venka, she was a pianist.</span> <span id="s749">She went to South America and I think the mother went to England.</span> <span id="s750">They got out but how and why I absolutely do not remember because I think there are certain holes in my memories.</span> <span id="s751">It’s strange to think but there are holes in the strangest places.</span> <span id="s752">Certain things I remember very vividly and certain things that I do not remember at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: How closely in contact were you with your family, your parents in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Constantly, by letter, constantly, probably, although I never was a great letter writer.</span> <span id="s755">I would say that a couple of times a week!</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: When did you lose contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: With my parents?</span> <span id="s758">Oh, I went back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: After you left Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: In the summer of ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: In the summer of ’38, I went back to Berlin and my parents were deported in January 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So there was about three more years?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: What made you decide to go back to Berlin?</span> <span id="s766">The urging of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s768">Well the senselessness I suppose of staying in Vienna became apparent.</span> <span id="s769">I mean Vienna was worse than Berlin.</span> <span id="s770">Going back to Berlin was going to a free country at least compared to what happen in Vienna.</span> <span id="s771">You see in Berlin things only became very difficult after November 1938 (Kristallnacht).</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: How long did you remain in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I remained until the summer of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: I am trying to get a framework now.</span> <span id="s775">So you were in Berlin from the summer of ’38 until the end of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, December of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: December of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, the summer, the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Summer of ’42?</span> <span id="s780">So it was four years ’38 to ’42.</span> <span id="s781">Did you find employment when you got back to Berlin?</span> <span id="s782">Was your father still employed?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: My father was employed I think until Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s784">You see before he was Austrian you know and then I think that he was fired, he worked for a Danish company.</span> <span id="s785">The law was I think at that time if a company employs a Jewish executive the company will be considered Jewish.</span> <span id="s786">I think that was the reason why he was fired.</span> <span id="s787">I don’t remember exactly when it was but it was around that time but I think that it was after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s788">Yes.</span> <span id="s789">I worked in Berlin, for a studio, for Kaminsky.</span> <span id="s790">They trained people, you know people were very much training for new jobs for overseas you know all the people were shopkeepers were lawyers were editors uh writers, all occupations which were notoriously useless when you got overseas.</span> <span id="s791">Photography for some reason or other was a desirable occupation.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t really know why, but it was considered a desirable occupation.</span> <span id="s793">We trained people, we had to give classes to people who wanted to go overseas it was necessary.</span> <span id="s794">I worked there and then I worked some other places too and did some commercial photography and that all ended I would say when the war started.</span> <span id="s795">When the war started I joined for a short time a Jewish organization a Betar.</span> <span id="s796">This was the party of Jabotinsky an ultra-nationalistic party (for settlement in Palestine) with Menachen Begin.</span> <span id="s797">They had courses to train people for Palestine.</span> <span id="s798">As this developed I went along.</span> <span id="s799">I was sent out to a farm and we dug potatoes and took care of cows and did other useful things, but I developed an allergy for some reason or other, I think it was against straw or something that was on the farm.</span> <span id="s800">I was swelling up and my ears were swelling up and I was full of blisters.</span> <span id="s801">It was terrible!</span> <span id="s802">Straw was the likely thing.</span> <span id="s803">You know you slept on straw, you worked with straw.</span> <span id="s804">So they send me home.</span> <span id="s805">Then I went to another place taking a gardening course, also a Jewish thing at a Jewish cemetery and I stayed there for about a year.</span> <span id="s806">I did that for a year, I worked there.</span> <span id="s807">I did some gardening and I guess there was no straw.</span> <span id="s808">It was all right you know and I kind of enjoyed this.</span> <span id="s809">My father had to work,.</span> <span id="s810">Of course they took him into a factory.</span> <span id="s811">He had to work in a rubber factory.</span> <span id="s812">There, to his great embarrassment, they made prophylactics.</span> <span id="s813">I worked in whole lot of places starting with a textile factory where they made material.</span> <span id="s814">It was the beginning of the synthetics and it was all very unpleasant work.</span> <span id="s815">There was hardly anything which was pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: It was forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: It was forced labor!</span> <span id="s818">We had big spools of the yarn which were raw.</span> <span id="s819">It had to be washed.</span> <span id="s820">We had to put them in the washers.</span> <span id="s821">I don’t know the details anymore.</span> <span id="s822">Then they sent me to Siemens Schugert and I was winding wire on rolls.</span> <span id="s823">I had to solder it, you measured it and then you soldered it.</span> <span id="s824">That was the time when my parents were deported.</span> <span id="s825">I worked there.</span> <span id="s826">I wanted to go with them!</span> <span id="s827">At that time we still believed that this so called “umsietlung”, German for relocation, meant that people are relocated to the East and that they would be able to live there.</span> <span id="s828">You see they are very good, the Nazis, with propaganda.</span> <span id="s829">I remember postcards which came from Lvov and that was called Litzmanstadt at that time, with the German name.</span> <span id="s830">People wrote that they were able to live.</span> <span id="s831">Of course all that were lies.</span> <span id="s832">I wanted to go with them and they wouldn’t let me go because I did some “War Important” work rolling wires on whatever you roll wires on.</span> <span id="s833">Then I was transferred from there.</span> <span id="s834">It was in January.</span> <span id="s835">It was very shortly after this, I think, that I was transferred to a paint factory.</span> <span id="s836">Something else very important, I am sure.</span> <span id="s837">There I stayed until June when life did not agree with me in Berlin, anymore.</span> <span id="s838">I thought that I would have a little bit of fun before I left.</span> <span id="s839">They had large vats where they mixed the paint.</span> <span id="s840">The color of the paint came in 25 pound bags, that was the pigment which was put into the vats.</span> <span id="s841">There was no automation then.</span> <span id="s842">All the things there were done by hand.</span> <span id="s843">The cans were brought in and everything was done by hand.</span> <span id="s844">I took one of these bags of red pigment, you walked up a catwalk which led to the upper level, I took the bag and I threw it on the edge of the stairs and the thing burst.</span> <span id="s845">The upper level was the level of the mixers where you threw the stuff in.</span> <span id="s846">The pigment went all over the place!</span> <span id="s847">It was beautiful!</span> <span id="s848">I don’t know whether they could use anything at all in the whole place because everything was red.</span> <span id="s849">It was fine stuff.</span> <span id="s850">It was like powder dust.</span> <span id="s851">It settled!</span> <span id="s852">It was beautiful!</span> <span id="s853">I left!</span> <span id="s854">I just went out, you know.</span> <span id="s855">I just walked out!</span> <span id="s856">I didn’t bother to punch the timecard anymore.</span> <span id="s857">I didn’t intend to collect the rest of my salary.</span> <span id="s858">I went home.</span> <span id="s859">At that time I lived again with a family.</span> <span id="s860">A lot of people lived together in large apartments which were all like rooming houses.</span> <span id="s861">It was a family Friedlander whom I lived with.</span> <span id="s862">They were very nice people, she was an aunt of Lieberman, who was a painter, an impressionist painter, and it was a big apartment.</span> <span id="s863">There were a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s864">I got home the next day, I think.</span> <span id="s865">I had a friend, a Dr. Husserl, a lawyer who had good connections with the Gestapo (the German Secret State police, the initials stand for Geheime Staat’s Polizei).</span> <span id="s866">He called me and said; “Heinz, get out!”</span> <span id="s867">I said “Why?”</span> <span id="s868">he said: “just don’t ask any questions, get out now!”</span> <span id="s869">“Now?”</span> <span id="s870">“Now!”</span> <span id="s871">So I packed a suitcase and I went out.</span> <span id="s872">To be on the safe side I went out the back way.</span> <span id="s873">Later I heard…(the tape ends here, however HS later explains how this departure “out the back” Side 3 (Tape 2 –Side 1)</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: This is a continuation of the second interview session with Mr. Steeber.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">You finished the interview with “You walked out the back door…”</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I walked out the back door and later, of all places, in Theresienstadt I met somebody – friends from Berlin.</span> <span id="s877">They were mutual friends also of Dr. Husserl and they told me that five minutes after I walked out the back.</span> <span id="s878">I don’t even remember how they knew this -- the Gestapo walked in by the front door looking for me.</span> <span id="s879">So then I was standing in the street.</span> <span id="s880">I had some money, but not very much.</span> <span id="s881">And I stood there with my suitcase, and I really didn’t know what I was going to do.</span> <span id="s882">I thought, “I’ll go to Vienna.”</span> <span id="s883">Of course that was during the war and the trains were all checked constantly by military police.</span> <span id="s884">They were looking mostly for deserters, people overstaying their leaves or whatever, and for undesirables.</span> <span id="s885">I thought that in local trains, there would not be so much checking as in the through trains, so I went from Berlin to Vienna in local trains -- always riding a little bit and getting out again and taking another local train, criss-crossing Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: What we call the milk runs?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: The milk runs – correct.</span> <span id="s888">It took me I think forty-eight hours or something, at least, to get from Berlin to Vienna, which was slow.</span> <span id="s889">Of course, I was not in a rush.</span> <span id="s890">Now in Vienna again, uh, sorry…</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Now.</span> <span id="s892">Before you start talking about Vienna in 1942, may I back up and ask you some questions about these four years in Berlin that have come to mind as you’ve talked?</span> <span id="s893">(CB is apparently referring to an “off-tape” conversation.)</span> <span id="s894">Let’s go back to Kristallnacht (that is the night of November 9th or 10th of 1938, when synagogues were torched and Jewish owned stores, businesses, and some homes were ransacked).</span> <span id="s895">Where were you?</span> <span id="s896">Were you at home with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: I was at home, I think.</span> <span id="s898">I think that I went down to the door at night, later in the evening, and I saw on the other side of the --we lived not far from the Kurfuerstendamm (one of the best known streets in Berlin) -- not right in town, but this is a long street.</span> <span id="s899">We lived farther out of town.</span> <span id="s900">There was, I think it was a tailor shop on the other side of Kurfuerstendamm.</span> <span id="s901">Their windows were smashed.</span> <span id="s902">That was the only thing I knew about at that time, until the next morning.</span> <span id="s903">The next morning, I walked down the Kurfuerstendamm.</span> <span id="s904">I usually walked down there -- it was maybe a twenty minute walk to the place where I worked, to that Kaminsky studio.</span> <span id="s905">I walked down there and saw all the businesses shut and every other window smashed and the people milling around.</span> <span id="s906">The synagogue was still burning.</span> <span id="s907">I think we only heard late at night that the synagogues were burning.</span> <span id="s908">We heard it somehow, but I don’t really know exactly how.</span> <span id="s909">Then I only found out really what had happened during the night, and saw the reaction of the people, which I will say, to the credit of the Berliners, was rather mixed.</span> <span id="s910">I remember walking by a smashed store window where the store had been looted and a couple was standing there and looking in and turning to each other saying, “This is our German culture, you know!”</span> <span id="s911">So there was a lot of sorrow about it, but there wasn’t enough to do any good.</span> <span id="s912">That, of course, (Kristallnacht) aggravated the situation tremendously, plus that was the time Jews were completely excluded, as you know, from the theaters or sitting on the park bench, or all the other idiocies they could think of --such as the “stars”.</span> <span id="s913">No, the star came later.</span> <span id="s914">(That is the “Star of David” which all Jews had to wear.)</span> <span id="s915">I think that the star came during the war.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t remember exactly when it was, but I think it came during the war that they had to wear it.</span> <span id="s917">I remember that I wore the star when I worked for another outfit.</span> <span id="s918">I was unloading bags from railroad cars.</span> <span id="s919">I got on the Staatbahn, the “S” Bahn, (the state railroad) for the first time, with a star.</span> <span id="s920">Of course, I didn’t feel so secure with it -- you can imagine.</span> <span id="s921">It was early morning --six o’clock in the morning -- and there were only workers there.</span> <span id="s922">They got up and said, “You sit down.</span> <span id="s923">It won’t last long” (meaning the wearing of the star).</span> <span id="s924">That was the reaction of the workers.</span> <span id="s925">Now, Berlin, in my opinion, maybe Hamburg, also, but Berlin was the place where they had the least overt signs of all these harassments.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I used to think that the Berliners didn’t have this anti-Semitic background like some other people.</span> <span id="s928">First of all, they were not Catholic.</span> <span id="s929">Let’s face it, the Catholic Church was anti-Semitic for a long time.</span> <span id="s930">In the Catholic parts of Germany they had much more overt anti-Semitism than the Protestant ones -- not that the Protestants didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s931">I mean Luther was second to none in anti-Semitism after he found out that the Jews wouldn’t convert to Protestantism.</span> <span id="s932">He was quite outspoken.</span> <span id="s933">But I think that it was already during a time of increased senility on his part.</span> <span id="s934">But the Berliners?</span> <span id="s935">Berlin was a very cosmopolitan city.</span> <span id="s936">Vienna was much more anti-Semitic with all the influx from the Balkans and so on.</span> <span id="s937">Vienna always was more parochial --was always more provincial, really than Berlin was.</span> <span id="s938">But all the vaunted culture and music in Vienna…it was more ossified in music, theater, and so on.</span> <span id="s939">The new things, the avant-garde, thrived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s940">In Vienna, they would have thrown you out with some of the plays.</span> <span id="s941">If the “Drei Kroschen Oper” (the “Three Penny Opera”) had been performed first in Vienna, it would never have had a second performance.</span> <span id="s942">So it was a much, much more lively city where the living standard was much higher, that is, in Berlin than in Vienna.</span> <span id="s943">I, personally, was always much fonder of Berlin than I was of Vienna.</span> <span id="s944">Somehow, you know, when they had the signs: “Jews not wanted”, it was like this -- it was the first thing you saw!</span> <span id="s945">.</span> <span id="s946">In Berlin, in many places, you had to go to the toilet to see a sign, “Jews not wanted”.</span> <span id="s947">Somewhere in the dark corner over a toilet there was the sign, “Jews not wanted”.</span> <span id="s948">It was a difference!</span> <span id="s949">But then we were excluded from any cultural life whatever.</span> <span id="s950">There was not much cultural life left then, after 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Were all the synagogues burned during Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: All except the one on Levitsorstrasse.</span> <span id="s953">I think that that one was not but that all the others were.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Up to that time, were you aware of the synagogue becoming increasingly important in a cultural sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: No!</span> <span id="s956">You mean as a center?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: I mean as a center of Jewish cultural activity because Jewish performing artists, musicians and so forth weren’t allowed to perform elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: We had our own “Kulturbund” -- our own cultural activity in Berlin.</span> <span id="s959">We had our own plays, music, concerts, etc.</span> <span id="s960">That was not connected with a synagogue.</span> <span id="s961">It was connected with the Jewish community -- with the “Judische Kulturgemeinde”, with a Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s962">It was quite lively, I would say, for a while – the Jewish culture was.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Did that cease after Kristallnacht, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No, I don’t think so!</span> <span id="s965">It ceased with the war, of course!</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Now there was never any attempt in Berlin to “ghettoize’ the Jews?</span> <span id="s967">(i.e., force them to live in one section, possibly a walled section?)</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Not even after Ktistallnacht?</span> <span id="s970">So your family did not have to give up its apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: We didn’t have an apartment anymore.</span> <span id="s972">We gave up our apartment, I think, when my father lost his job.</span> <span id="s973">My parents lived with one family.</span> <span id="s974">Again, with apartments, you had a choice.</span> <span id="s975">There were other people living there.</span> <span id="s976">Apartments were there.</span> <span id="s977">They threw you out of apartments.</span> <span id="s978">They repossessed a lot of apartments.</span> <span id="s979">If you had an apartment you took other people in.</span> <span id="s980">There was nothing anymore like privacy!</span> <span id="s981">I stayed with other people again, with Friedlender.</span> <span id="s982">After 1938 there was no way to buy an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: The Kaminsky firm was allowed to continue to operate after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: I think they left.</span> <span id="s985">The Kaminskys left.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were they Polish, by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I don’t think so!</span> <span id="s988">They must have been originally.</span> <span id="s989">I know she was not.</span> <span id="s990">I don’t think that they were Polish.</span> <span id="s991">No, they were not thrown out with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s992">No, they left.</span> <span id="s993">I think they went to the ‘States.</span> <span id="s994">They emigrated normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Were a lot of your friends in Berlin emigrating -- that is, in your particular circle -- not casual acquaintances but within your circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s997">Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Did the thought ever cross your mind?</span> <span id="s999">(the thought of emigrating?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: On, very much so!</span> <span id="s1001">Extremely!</span> <span id="s1002">Much more so than it did to my parents.</span> <span id="s1003">You see, when my parents started to find out that things were going from bad to worse, it was really too late for them.</span> <span id="s1004">We had visas for Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1005">We had booked passage already -- and very shortly before we were to go, maybe a month or so, they cancelled all the visas for Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: The Ecuadorian Government cancelled the visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I suppose so!</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t know whether these visas were on the up an up or whether somebody in the Ecuadorian consulate made a little baksheesh with the visas (was bribed to give them).</span> <span id="s1009">Truthfully I don’t know exactly how it was.</span> <span id="s1010">I know that we took Spanish lessons.</span> <span id="s1011">I just can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1012">I really don’t know whether it was in ’38, ’39, ’37 -- most of it was in ’38.</span> <span id="s1013">Most of these things took place between ’38 and the onset of the war.</span> <span id="s1014">It was around ’39.</span> <span id="s1015">I know that I made the rounds of the consulates and that I didn’t get anywhere, of course.</span> <span id="s1016">Then, I wanted to go to Shanghai (China).</span> <span id="s1017">You know, there was the overland route.</span> <span id="s1018">You could go on the overland route through Russia and the Siberian Express to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1019">After the war started in 1939, I wanted to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1020">(Visas to China were being sold).</span> <span id="s1021">We had a relative who was once there.</span> <span id="s1022">Again, it’s unbelievable how stupid we really were.</span> <span id="s1023">I was very inexperienced.</span> <span id="s1024">I had led a very sheltered life -- to a certain degree, and I was woefully unprepared, normally, for life.</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, I had to find a way only because I was thrown out into it, and it was sink or swim.</span> <span id="s1026">We had a relative who was once a German Consul in Tientsin, of all places, and we met with him and he told us all the horrible difficulties we would face going to Shanghai -- mostly that it’s hot and people are poor, and there is no money, and all these things.</span> <span id="s1027">I don’t know if my going to Shanghai would have been a very ideal solution because the Japanese came in after a very short time, but it would probably have been better than what happened.</span> <span id="s1028">I had an uncle in London.</span> <span id="s1029">Now, he, unfortunately, never became a British subject (that was not easy to do in post WWI), because at that time, he was traveling a lot for his business and the tax situation was better for him.</span> <span id="s1030">He did not become a British subject.</span> <span id="s1031">He never became one.</span> <span id="s1032">So, the first thing, when the war started, he was interned in England.</span> <span id="s1033">They didn’t care if he was a Jew or not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1034">All the Germans went into the camps.</span> <span id="s1035">Anyway, he was able to arrange something for me.</span> <span id="s1036">I think that I paid 200 pounds.</span> <span id="s1037">At that time, we didn’t have very much money left.</span> <span id="s1038">There wasn’t much money around the place, really none, but for the 200 pounds which I could get and go to England and become a cook’s apprentice.</span> <span id="s1039">For 200 pounds I could become a cook’s apprentice at the College Kitchen in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s1040">Somehow we were able to manage it.</span> <span id="s1041">The 200 pounds was a lot of money then!</span> <span id="s1042">200 pounds --when you don’t have any money!</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: A thousand dollars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: A thousand dollars!</span> <span id="s1045">A thousand dollars in 1939 -- it just didn’t lie around.</span> <span id="s1046">Somehow we figured out that we had some things to sell.</span> <span id="s1047">Somehow we made it possible, and I applied for it and I was accepted, but this was in the late summer of 1939, and then the war came.</span> <span id="s1048">In September, the war came and there I was.</span> <span id="s1049">We tried the ‘States and everybody we wrote to -- and we had relatives here in those days -- they said they gave so many affidavits already, it’s impossible -- “Love to help, but we just can’t do it”, they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: It sounds as if you left no stone unturned in trying to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, I would have done more if I had known what I know today.</span> <span id="s1052">Another thing, just shortly before we left, somebody -- it was Dr. Husserl again, discovered a man who should have been able to get us over the border to Switzerland -- illegally to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1053">The only trouble was that we started to pay something – I guess the 200 pounds we didn’t have to pay for England.</span> <span id="s1054">After we paid him, he disappeared -- he was a swindler.</span> <span id="s1055">So, we did try.</span> <span id="s1056">I guess.</span> <span id="s1057">It was just too damn late.</span> <span id="s1058">It was too late and too little!</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Approximately how long after Kristallnacht did you affiliate with Jabotinsky (Vladimar Jabotinsky, born in Russia in 1880, died in Palestine in 1940 and started a group dedicated to terrorism by the assassination of British in Palestine)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Kaminsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: No, not the firm -- the Jewish leader, Jabotinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Jabotinsky?</span> <span id="s1063">No, he was not alive anymore at that time.</span> <span id="s1064">The organization he founded was Betar, spelled “B-e-t-a-r”.</span> <span id="s1065">The Betar was a Nationalistic -- Jewish Nationalistic Youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: How long after Kristallnacht did you affiliate with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I have no knowledge of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Who was Jabotinsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Jabotinsky was a leader -- he was a Jewish leader -- a Nationalistic-Jewish leader in Palestine, who wanted a Jewish State.</span> <span id="s1070">We did not look for a Jewish homeland, but he was the one who wanted the Jewish State.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Was he associated with Betar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: He was the founder of it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Had he come back to Germany to organize Betar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Betar?</span> <span id="s1075">No!</span> <span id="s1076">No!</span> <span id="s1077">He was dead by then (that information was wrong).</span> <span id="s1078">There were other organizers.</span> <span id="s1079">But the Betar was a party.</span> <span id="s1080">Look, you know, if you get three Jews together you’ll have four parties.</span> <span id="s1081">They are very politicized.</span> <span id="s1082">Jews are very politicized.</span> <span id="s1083">This was just a party -- it was a movement.</span> <span id="s1084">I was completely ignorant, as far as politics go.</span> <span id="s1085">How I got in there I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1086">I was a complete idiot.</span> <span id="s1087">I had not the remotest idea of Zionist politics, party politics, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: But it was Betar which sponsored the farm work…</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1090">(Actually, many Zionist organizations, other than Betar did the same -- it was the Zionist dream).</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: All right!</span> <span id="s1092">Now, where was the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Oh, around the land somewhere.</span> <span id="s1094">In the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Owned by Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No!</span> <span id="s1097">Not necessarily!</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Gentiles, sympathetic to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: I don’t know whether they were sympathetic, but if they found people who were working for nothing -- willing to work for nothing while they learned…</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Oh, I see!</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: It’s easy to be sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: I thought from the way you had mentioned it before…I thought maybe it was some experimental farming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: It might have been.</span> <span id="s1104">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1105">I really do not remember.</span> <span id="s1106">This is another very hazy area for recollections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: When was it, approximately, that you started being impressed into the various work gangs to work at this factory, or at that shop, or in the railway yards, or such?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: At the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Would you say that was the same for your father, too -- about the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1111">I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Now, let me ask you a question about these work gangs that has somewhat intrigued me, as I’ve read about them and heard other people talk about them.</span> <span id="s1113">Was there any sort of logic in where you were placed and when and why you were moved from one factory to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: None whatsoever!</span> <span id="s1115">Not any more than when linguists are sent to mechanic school in the Army.</span> <span id="s1116">Not any more than that.</span> <span id="s1117">There was absolutely none!</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Was your whole gang -- your whole group moved -- or were individuals pulled out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: There were no “gangs”.</span> <span id="s1120">This was strictly individual -- on an individual basis that you were assigned!</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: How were these orders transmitted?</span> <span id="s1122">You would just show up at work at the railway yards to unload?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I think that’s right!</span> <span id="s1124">They would just give you a slip, I suppose, and they’d send you back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Telling you to go someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Telling you to go to a labor exchange.</span> <span id="s1127">From there, they would send you to another place.</span> <span id="s1128">There weren’t any exchanges.</span> <span id="s1129">You see, there was one thing --everything was legal -- everything was organized -- there was nothing left to chance.</span> <span id="s1130">It was ill-organized many times and it was crazy how things were done, but everything went according to the letter of the law -- according to organization.</span> <span id="s1131">I was not treated in any other way than other occasional laborers would be treated, I think.</span> <span id="s1132">It wasn’t a particular thing for Jews to go to be transferred.</span> <span id="s1133">There was one labor exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Oh, I see!</span> <span id="s1135">So it was not just Jews with whom you were working who would go from one place to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: It was the German Proletariat -- the German work force and you were just forced to mingle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1139">Of course there were a lot of Jews in certain places.</span> <span id="s1140">They sent a lot of Jews to these places, and I think that there were mostly Jews, as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Are you saying that you were never mistreated in these work gangs -- in these work places -- because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: I would say that.</span> <span id="s1143">Yes, I would say that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: You never worked under a rabid anti-Semite who was out to harass and mistreat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No, I have no recollection of it!</span> <span id="s1146">Let’s put it this way -- I have no recollection of it.</span> <span id="s1147">I did not enjoy the work per se, I mean, it was pretty damn hard work many times.</span> <span id="s1148">We had a very hard winter.</span> <span id="s1149">I think it was the winter of 1940 -- or was it 1941?</span> <span id="s1150">I think it was ’41.</span> <span id="s1151">Yes, it was the winter of 1941.</span> <span id="s1152">It was during the Russian counter-offensive.</span> <span id="s1153">It was an extremely hard winter.</span> <span id="s1154">We had 40 degrees below zero in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1155">This was the only time I remember “40 degrees below zero”.</span> <span id="s1156">It was something quite extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1157">I worked outside.</span> <span id="s1158">I did some yard work with other people.</span> <span id="s1159">I think that they were Jews mostly, but it was very cold, and I remember we worked for ten minutes and then we would sit for half an hour inside a hut, around a stove.</span> <span id="s1160">Nobody really bothered you.</span> <span id="s1161">They didn’t chase you out with a whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Moving out in society and on the streets, did you ever feel frightened?</span> <span id="s1163">Insecure?</span> <span id="s1164">Did you ever have any run-ins with the Gestapo in this period?</span> <span id="s1165">(Gestapo stands for “Geheime Staats Polizei” translated into Secret State police).</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: No, No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Did you always carry your papers with you?</span> <span id="s1168">(In Europe people carried identity papers).</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s1170">You have a sort Kennkarte, which is the identification card with a “J” on it and “Heinz Israel Stieber” so there was no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1171">You carry it with you always.</span> <span id="s1172">Everybody had to carry identity papers anyhow.</span> <span id="s1173">Insecure?</span> <span id="s1174">Of course I felt insecure, but in the street you had to be careful when you carried a book.</span> <span id="s1175">You had to be careful not to carry a book this way, for then they would think it was to cover the star!</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: You were never stopped and submitted to insults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: No!</span> <span id="s1178">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Marched in the streets or such?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No!</span> <span id="s1181">No, no, never.</span> <span id="s1182">To tell you the truth, I have still a certain amount of respect for the Berliners.</span> <span id="s1183">They were the only people -- later wherever I was in Vienna, in Hungary, wherever I was -- I found much more anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: What about food during this period?</span> <span id="s1185">How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: That was difficult.</span> <span id="s1187">Food was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1188">You had to have (ration) coupons, of course.</span> <span id="s1189">I suppose I got some coupons on the black market at times or there were certain places -- there were certain restaurants -- where you could go in and eat without them -- without coupons.</span> <span id="s1190">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s1191">I mean it took quite a bit of doing -- of thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1192">Of course there were still things to buy, such as fruit and certain things.</span> <span id="s1193">You couldn’t buy meat or bread.</span> <span id="s1194">There were certain things you could buy, at times, but rarely.</span> <span id="s1195">You had to have coupons for really everything.</span> <span id="s1196">Again, this is a strange thing, as I am thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1197">I know you had to have coupons and I know I couldn’t get coupons and I know I had them.</span> <span id="s1198">I don’t know how I got them.</span> <span id="s1199">I just got them.</span> <span id="s1200">I don’t remember that I was ever satisfied as far as eating was concerned, but I don’t think I ever suffered malnutrition -- at least not that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: By this time, had you lost contact with your gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Was that simply because of the schedules you were following or where you lived?</span> <span id="s1204">Or because they were beginning to shun you or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: They shunned me!</span> <span id="s1206">Oh, yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1207">I remember especially one of all persons -- an Armenian.</span> <span id="s1208">His parents were refugees from the Turks!</span> <span id="s1209">In Berlin they had a wholesale drug business, that is, his father did.</span> <span id="s1210">I was very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1211">He was a nice young fellow.</span> <span id="s1212">He was very popular with my parents, I remember, and we were together quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1213">One day he called me and he said, “Please don’t call me anymore” or something like that.</span> <span id="s1214">You see, these were people who had similar experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: It taught them no sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I only hope I never find a Jew who would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1217">I’m afraid there were (Jews who did the same thing).</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: What about pay for the work you were doing?</span> <span id="s1219">Was there any discrimination in pay?</span> <span id="s1220">Did you get paid the same as anybody -- a gentile -- in the work force?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1222">I’m not sure, but I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Do you have any idea what it was -- what rate?</span> <span id="s1224">I am sure it depended on the job, but was it so low that it was ridiculous, or was it adequate for your situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: I think it was adequate.</span> <span id="s1226">I think it was the regular pay which they paid for a worker in those days.</span> <span id="s1227">It was not the very best, anyhow, wherever you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Now you were living separately from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: How often did you see them?</span> <span id="s1231">Once -- twice -- three times a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Were you living close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: You could walk it.</span> <span id="s1235">It was maybe a twenty minutes walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Did you perceive that they were suffering greatly, mentally, as well as physically, or were they in a sense, taking it in stride and trying to adapt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No.</span> <span id="s1238">I think that they were suffering quite considerably.</span> <span id="s1239">I don’t think they were taking it in stride at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Some of these questions are painful for me to ask and it may sound ridiculous the way I am asking them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No!</span> <span id="s1242">No.</span> <span id="s1243">They’re not ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1244">It is just that they are difficult to answer at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: See, what I had in mind was, was your father able to adapt more readily than your mother or was it your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Oh, my mother was really the more adaptable of the two, I would think.</span> <span id="s1247">Of course, my mother was quite a bit…she, my mother, was 16 years younger than my father.</span> <span id="s1248">That, I think, makes quite a difference.</span> <span id="s1249">My father, in 1942, was 64 years old, so that’s quite a difference.</span> <span id="s1250">And my mother was 48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Was your mother sent into the work force?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: No.</span> <span id="s1253">Women were not -- that was a general rule, at that time.</span> <span id="s1254">But, at that time, Germany was still winning the war, you know.</span> <span id="s1255">(Other survivors from Berlin experienced women in the work force).</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Could you say approximately how long you would last on one job before you would move, on the average?</span> <span id="s1257">Would it be a week at this job and a week at another job?</span> <span id="s1258">Or would it be two, three, or four months at one job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I tell you that I would stay the shortest time possible.</span> <span id="s1260">I never put myself out, particularly, you know.</span> <span id="s1261">It depended.</span> <span id="s1262">A couple of months or so, I think.</span> <span id="s1263">They usually got tired of me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Could you be sick and lay-off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: You had some sick time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: This is one thing I worked out quite a bit: sickness, in order to get off.</span> <span id="s1268">You had to go to a company doctor.</span> <span id="s1269">He would give you a certificate and you could stay home for three days or a week or whatever, and I worked this to the hilt -- the sickness bit, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: But were you in fairly good health or were you indeed OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: I was in fairly good health.</span> <span id="s1272">I think that I had a little bit of trouble with my gall bladder at that time.</span> <span id="s1273">That wasn’t very much, but with it, I think that I did as much with it as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s1274">No, I was in fairly good health, but I tried everything possible.</span> <span id="s1275">Oh, yes, I remember that I was at the doctor every time I could.</span> <span id="s1276">You even got paid something when you were sick, I remember.</span> <span id="s1277">Everything was completely legal, but the time that you were in the work force you were working and you were like any other worker.</span> <span id="s1278">You were treated like any other worker.</span> <span id="s1279">I mean, of course, you had the lousiest jobs which were available, but you still, as far as I remember, were paid the same way and you were treated the same way and you could get sick the same way and I don’t think there was a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Were you dating a girl at this time?</span> <span id="s1281">Was there any time left for that kind of thing?</span> <span id="s1282">Was there any place to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: There was for a very short time, I would say.</span> <span id="s1284">Then she left, too.</span> <span id="s1285">She left.</span> <span id="s1286">She went to the States and I don’t, I just don’t think that my interest was at all with female companionship at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: The day that you decided to leave the paint factory, you just simply walked off the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Just walked off the job and walked straight out the gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Who was this Dr. Husserl?</span> <span id="s1290">Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Dr. Husserl?</span> <span id="s1292">Yes, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1293">He went to Switzerland eventually.</span> <span id="s1294">He got out of Switzerland and he died in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Do you have any idea how he had a connection with the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: He had very good connections!</span> <span id="s1297">He was a prominent lawyer and he had a great amount of connections.</span> <span id="s1298">He knew everybody in the city, and he knew a lot of Gestapo people, too.</span> <span id="s1299">There were a lot of lawyers, a lot of intellectuals who went into the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1300">They couldn’t make a go in private practice.</span> <span id="s1301">This was a godsend opportunity -- to sit in an office -- for many of these people that was just it.</span> <span id="s1302">They just wanted to sit in an office, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did you ever have contact with him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1305">I met him again in Vienna after the war and in Switzerland, too.</span> <span id="s1306">First, I met him in Switzerland, then in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: And did you ever inquire how he knew at that moment that you were perhaps on the verge of being arrested?</span> <span id="s1308">Did you ever probe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1310">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1311">Somehow, immediately after the war, I think that your interest and my interest in these things was much less than it became later.</span> <span id="s1312">Right after the war and for quite a while, all one’s thinking really was taken up with a tremendous feeling that “I can get off a chair and walk out the door and nobody is going to stop me and I can do what I want.”</span> <span id="s1313">This was the greatest thing after the war – for a long time, there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s1314">Just that you could get up and leave whenever you wanted.</span> <span id="s1315">It took a long time to get used to that and that you don’t have to look right or left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Worry about who’s hiding in the doorway or lurking in the shadows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: I think that I’ve kept you overly long today, and I’ll terminate it here.</span> <span id="s1319">This is a convenient stopping place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">(end of second interview)</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: This is the third interview session with Mr. Henry Steeber in the living room of his home, and it is February 15, 1979.</span> <span id="s1322">Mr. Steeber, at the end of the last interview, we were talking about your leaving Berlin in the summer of ’42 and going to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1323">I don’t think we really dealt with the reasons why you did decide.</span> <span id="s1324">You had left Berlin very hurriedly on the advice of the lawyer, Husserl and took a train to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1325">You took a local that took about 48 hours to get to Vienna; but I don’t think you mentioned the reason why you chose Vienna.</span> <span id="s1326">I am sure your choices were limited in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Well, this was the only place -- the only area where I knew people, besides Berlin.</span> <span id="s1328">You know, I was still a little bit naïve, maybe, and during that time, considered it possible that some people would help me.</span> <span id="s1329">I could not really do it -- survive -- without other people -- without other people’s help.</span> <span id="s1330">I had no identification.</span> <span id="s1331">I had none of these little things which were necessary to prove that you existed at that time, and so, you know, it was a logical choice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What did you do when you got into Vienna by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: You know it’s a funny thing, because I was thinking about it the other day, and I am not completely clear anymore exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s1334">I have no recollection of even arriving in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1335">I don’t remember where, which station of the various railroad stations -- I have no idea anymore.</span> <span id="s1336">I think, and it seems to me I really would not know why, but of course I had known them for a while -- I went to one of the people who worked in my parent’s home, when we lived in Vienna, before we moved to Berlin, my parents had a cook and a chambermaid, both of whom were taken over from my grandparents, you know -- they worked for my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1337">The chambermaid had a sister who came in from time to time as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s1338">They lived together, but I don’t know, I think the maid part of that sister team was dead by that time, if I’m not mistaken.</span> <span id="s1339">I think that I went there.</span> <span id="s1340">They were close, really, very close people to me, really.</span> <span id="s1341">I went to see them.</span> <span id="s1342">They had a little apartment in a very working class district, and I think I spent a night there.</span> <span id="s1343">I don’t think that they encouraged me to stay.</span> <span id="s1344">It was very dangerous to have a Jew staying.</span> <span id="s1345">I mean this was not a laughing matter, at that time.</span> <span id="s1346">I was the enemy.</span> <span id="s1347">The next stop I remember was that I went to the “Burgenland” to Parendorf, where my uncle’s family had a farm.</span> <span id="s1348">My uncle (my mother’s brother) lived in London and he married, after the First World War, a girl from Parendorf.</span> <span id="s1349">She was, of course, not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1350">She had been his nurse.</span> <span id="s1351">He was wounded during the war -- during WWI, or maybe he was sick or something and she nursed him.</span> <span id="s1352">She was the nurse at the army hospital.</span> <span id="s1353">For some reason or another, some good reason or no good reason, I don’t know, he married her and she had her family living in Parendorf.</span> <span id="s1354">So this was the closest thing I had to family.</span> <span id="s1355">I went down to Parendorf.</span> <span id="s1356">They had a very big family.</span> <span id="s1357">The farm was close to the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s1358">The reception I got there was not particularly cordial.</span> <span id="s1359">As a matter of fact, but I only learned that later, after the war, I heard that there were discussions whether they should call the police or not.</span> <span id="s1360">This was the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Your aunt was not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: My aunt was not there.</span> <span id="s1363">She was in London!</span> <span id="s1364">She got herself interned in London and then she got out</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So this was a gentile family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1367">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1368">Then I went back to Vienna and I looked up friends with whom I stayed the first summer I came from Berlin in 1936, in Weitenerke, you know?</span> <span id="s1369">(The earlier reference was to Vachau, but many towns had more than one name due to boundary changes).</span> <span id="s1370">That was when I went to school.</span> <span id="s1371">I told you I stayed with some friends.</span> <span id="s1372">I looked them up.</span> <span id="s1373">Somehow, again, I got to a family where the wife was the concierge, the porter, the Hausmeister, of a building in Vienna in the seventh district.</span> <span id="s1374">That was a mixed marriage, too.</span> <span id="s1375">The husband was a Jew and he didn’t even live in the building.</span> <span id="s1376">He lived somewhere else, but they were still married.</span> <span id="s1377">It was not that they had split up, but for safety’s sake he moved to another place.</span> <span id="s1378">She worked there.</span> <span id="s1379">She had a job there as a concierge and they had a son, too.</span> <span id="s1380">They had, besides their place in front of the building, the housemaster’s apartment, which you have as you come into the front door of the house -- they had another room in the back part of the house.</span> <span id="s1381">You went through a courtyard and there was another part of the house -- of the apartment building.</span> <span id="s1382">They had a very large room in the back.</span> <span id="s1383">That’s where I stayed.</span> <span id="s1384">People didn’t know that it belonged to them, or probably even that it was there.</span> <span id="s1385">That’s where I stayed from, I would say it was February or March, something like that, I guess.</span> <span id="s1386">What am I talking about -- February or March?</span> <span id="s1387">It was 1942.</span> <span id="s1388">It was June 1942, that I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1389">I’m thinking about when I went to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1390">It was from June of 1942 until January or February of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: In essence you were in hiding then?</span> <span id="s1392">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Did you go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1396">I went out!</span> <span id="s1397">Through the son we had a fairly safe circle of people.</span> <span id="s1398">We saw each other and we had some visits.</span> <span id="s1399">We had no “underground” as such in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1400">Nobody can tell you that there was one.</span> <span id="s1401">Not in 1940, not in 1942, was there an “underground”.</span> <span id="s1402">There was nothing!</span> <span id="s1403">But there were some people who had a certain connection with the service, with the supposedly British secret service and there was a chain of information.</span> <span id="s1404">Even though it was very loose, it existed.</span> <span id="s1405">That the people didn’t get caught was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1406">It shows how inept the police or the Gestapo in Vienna really was.</span> <span id="s1407">But we did it (exchange information) in coffee houses and we didn’t really think about it!</span> <span id="s1408">I did various jobs.</span> <span id="s1409">I remember that there was one chap who had a studio.</span> <span id="s1410">There was not very much to be had.</span> <span id="s1411">You couldn’t buy very much in Vienna during the war, but one thing we could get was ceramic.</span> <span id="s1412">Ceramic!</span> <span id="s1413">They always found ceramic earth and they could always make plates and urns and such things; so this was a going concern there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">(Tape 2, Side 2)</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: It was one of the few things people could spend money on.</span> <span id="s1416">I was sitting there, I remember.</span> <span id="s1417">In the studio where we made plates -- ceramic plates.</span> <span id="s1418">They had to be decorated.</span> <span id="s1419">Little flowers had to be painted on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: This is the second part of the third interview.</span> <span id="s1421">You were sitting there with your friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Yes, and I was painting little flowers on plates, and when they had a big order, I was sitting there, thirty-six hours in a row, painting little flowers on plates.</span> <span id="s1423">And we would go with a little handcart and deliver them to whatever dealer or whoever ordered them.</span> <span id="s1424">As you see, I moved fairly freely in the city.</span> <span id="s1425">By that time people really had other worries.</span> <span id="s1426">The first bloom of the joy of the Anschluss was over and many people had second and third thoughts in Vienna, especially.</span> <span id="s1427">They were not quite that eager anymore to sniffle around (meaning investigate on their own) too much.</span> <span id="s1428">I sold cigarettes on the black market and saccharine in the black market and wine in the black market and everything which could be obtained, which could be smuggled in or out.</span> <span id="s1429">This is what we did to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Was that dangerous?</span> <span id="s1431">Was the black market operated sort of openly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: No.</span> <span id="s1433">There was a little, maybe, added danger, but the added danger was really very minimal.</span> <span id="s1434">My main danger was to be around.</span> <span id="s1435">I think the added danger as to be more visible, maybe -- to be more exposed, but to tell you the truth, it was fairly easy to move around if you had the nerve to do it.</span> <span id="s1436">I had some narrow escapes.</span> <span id="s1437">Fortunately, as a student of the school about which I told you, the “Graphische Lehr and Versuchsanstalt”, I had an identification card, a Kenn Karte, on which is stamped the year, etc. during which you enrolled.</span> <span id="s1438">Everybody had to have identification and everything, of course.</span> <span id="s1439">It was not valid anymore in 1942, since I got thrown out in 1938.</span> <span id="s1440">That friend again I told you about, his name was Gustav Frei, the fellow from Weiteneck, he was a very good artist.</span> <span id="s1441">He was an amateur, but a very good artist, a very good craftsman, a good painter, a collector.</span> <span id="s1442">I bought two things from him, this card, plus, I had another one which I acquired from somebody and an identification card, a Kenn Karte which was the main identification which everybody had to carry.</span> <span id="s1443">Now, of course, I couldn’t carry one.</span> <span id="s1444">Living underground, I didn’t have one, but I acquired one from the son of the people I lived with.</span> <span id="s1445">And it so happened they were not Austrians, they were Czechs originally and so his identification card was with -- what was it in Czech?</span> <span id="s1446">Yes, the name which was the official title then, so that was a little advantage already, you know, because we were conspicuous already in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1447">So he gave me his and he said he had lost his.</span> <span id="s1448">Now, I took both of them at different times because I gave the one to this Gustav Frei and he forged both of the cards.</span> <span id="s1449">He painted stamps on them and he extended the validity of the school identification until ’42, I think, so I had something in my hand.</span> <span id="s1450">Later he replaced the picture of the original owner with my picture.</span> <span id="s1451">He did it very well and painted a stamp and everything.</span> <span id="s1452">He painted the stamp in blue ink and it looked good, if you didn’t look too closely it was a very good -- it was a very good job.</span> <span id="s1453">So once again, I think I was fortunate -- you will laugh if I tell you that I met up with somebody else, an old family friend.</span> <span id="s1454">I met her in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1455">She, a woman, she also lived underground.</span> <span id="s1456">Both of us, we knew the former wife of Richard Spescht, Wanda Spescht.</span> <span id="s1457">I told you about Richard Spescht?</span> <span id="s1458">I mentioned him once.</span> <span id="s1459">We visited with her sometimes.</span> <span id="s1460">She was a very strange woman, a very strange woman.</span> <span id="s1461">I think she “flipped her wig” or whatever and I think that she denounced us to the Gestapo one day.</span> <span id="s1462">I know that we met in a certain place, in a little coffee shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: You and the old family friend and…this lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s1465">The old family friend.</span> <span id="s1466">We got out of the shop at different times and she got arrested.</span> <span id="s1467">I got out and I got around the corner and I was stopped.</span> <span id="s1468">I wasn’t together with her.</span> <span id="s1469">I was stopped by a young fellow, a young punk.</span> <span id="s1470">Young punks, at that time, would stop you for nothing, so I had to think fast.</span> <span id="s1471">At that time I got my school card out.</span> <span id="s1472">At that time I could speak very nice Viennese dialect.</span> <span id="s1473">They let me go and I got on a streetcar and I got away.</span> <span id="s1474">I thought about it hard and I don’t know what story I told them.</span> <span id="s1475">There were other fairly narrow escapes.</span> <span id="s1476">The one I mentioned before which really made me decide to leave Germany was that the Gestapo was right in the building where I lived, looking for me.</span> <span id="s1477">I came down from my room.</span> <span id="s1478">They could have had a big sign around their necks reading “Gestapo!”</span> <span id="s1479">They dressed in long leather coats -- long, black leather coats.</span> <span id="s1480">If you saw them, there was no doubt who they were!</span> <span id="s1481">It was a mixed house, offices and apartments with a sign there with the names of the tenants on it, the commercial tenants on it, and I went up to one of these people and said, “Could you tell me whether Schmeiker-Uber has a pottery factory here?”</span> <span id="s1482">He growled at me, “Look up there!”</span> <span id="s1483">So I looked up there and said, “Doesn’t live here!”</span> <span id="s1484">and walked off.</span> <span id="s1485">That was a close call.</span> <span id="s1486">If I wouldn’t have come down out of the room just in time, I don’t know what would have happened, so I decided that the better part of valor and all that would be to try to get out and make contact with some people who took people over the border to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Now before we go into that story, may I ask you a few questions about Vienna?</span> <span id="s1488">Do you know whatever happened to the concierge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1490">She got to Buchenwald, rather, to Bergen-Belsen, eventually.</span> <span id="s1491">She got arrested eventually.</span> <span id="s1492">The son got out of it.</span> <span id="s1493">Nothing happened to the son, but she got to Bergen-Belsen (both Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen were German concentration camps).</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: She was a gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: What about her husband?</span> <span id="s1497">Do you know about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Her husband…I heard he died naturally.</span> <span id="s1499">He was a very sick man to start with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Did she survive Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No!</span> <span id="s1502">She did not.</span> <span id="s1503">She had somebody else.</span> <span id="s1504">It’s a complicated story.</span> <span id="s1505">Her son had a girlfriend from Poland, a non-Jewish girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1506">She always came with the son.</span> <span id="s1507">She was a good bit older than he was and she, in turn, had a friend, the son of a friend or something, a young man, a Jew from Poland.</span> <span id="s1508">She brought him in sometimes and he stayed.</span> <span id="s1509">I guess that something went wrong with him -- things went sour with him.</span> <span id="s1510">Then things exploded.</span> <span id="s1511">It was very hard, after the war, to find out exactly what happened to people.</span> <span id="s1512">There were too many different stories.</span> <span id="s1513">The only fact I could find out was that one day she was arrested, but why and how, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1514">What I heard was that it was a neighbor who denounced her to the Gestapo and I know who it was.</span> <span id="s1515">All I could do was that I went to the police later and told them what I knew about this.</span> <span id="s1516">A fellow, to the best of my knowledge, was the one who was instrumental in getting her arrested.</span> <span id="s1517">That is all that I or anyone really could do.</span> <span id="s1518">Now there was not a great rush after the war to do anything.</span> <span id="s1519">You couldn’t depend on anything.</span> <span id="s1520">Of course, much of the police was Communist.</span> <span id="s1521">They would want to show their mettle, and they would rush out and do silly things, but on the other hand, let’s face it.</span> <span id="s1522">Much of the police was in the same boat.</span> <span id="s1523">They were the same Nazis that the others were.</span> <span id="s1524">Of course, nobody was a Nazi after the war, but that’s beside the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Why did you make the contact with Wanda Spescht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Yes, she was gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Did you think she was a trusted friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1531">More of my friend, truly a trusted friend of my friend, than of my own.</span> <span id="s1532">Of course, I knew her.</span> <span id="s1533">She was a friend of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Whatever happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1536">I will tell you the truth -- I really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1537">I didn’t go out for vengeance--for looking up people.</span> <span id="s1538">I just didn’t care enough, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: This year-and-a-half that you were in Vienna, did you range rather widely through the city or did you stick very closely to your neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No, I don’t think that I restricted myself in any way.</span> <span id="s1541">Naturally, there were certain areas which I frequented more than others.</span> <span id="s1542">I was mostly in the seventh district and the eighth district (talking about residential parts of Vienna) and the center of the city (the inner Stadt) rather than other parts of city.</span> <span id="s1543">I would normally do this in any city.</span> <span id="s1544">There were many parts I never got to.</span> <span id="s1545">But I normally would have never gotten to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Well, I was thinking about your black market activities.</span> <span id="s1547">Did that require you to travel around the city considerably?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1549">No!</span> <span id="s1550">That was mostly like broker stuff, you know, you bought it from one and you sold it to another.</span> <span id="s1551">It was a middleman type of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1552">The cigarettes were smuggled in from Bulgaria -- mainly from Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s1553">There were a lot of Bulgarian cigarettes -- some were also from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1554">The saccharine went out the same way -- most to Yugoslavia and to the Balkan countries.</span> <span id="s1555">The trading went to the Balkan countries and from the Balkans.</span> <span id="s1556">It was the easiest way.</span> <span id="s1557">(The Nazi occupation of Bulgaria was accepted on February 14, 1941.</span> <span id="s1558">Yugoslavia was conquered by the Nazis on March 27, 1941 to April 17, 1941).</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: You may not think that this is terribly important, but I’m curious about the black market.</span> <span id="s1560">I’ve heard several people say that for a time or for a while they survived by engaging in black market activities.</span> <span id="s1561">Can you elaborate a little bit about how you made the contacts and some of the kinds of business dealings you made?</span> <span id="s1562">I’m thinking of a hundred years from now, when someone might listen to this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: I appreciate this.</span> <span id="s1564">Unfortunately again, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1565">I think that I would make a lousy witness, for I think my memory is really too selective.</span> <span id="s1566">Now, I remember the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1567">I remember the packages they came in.</span> <span id="s1568">I remember how we prepared the saccharine, which was quite dishonest, but we got away with it.</span> <span id="s1569">You see saccharine is cut with bicarbonate of soda -- the pure saccharine is.</span> <span id="s1570">What we did was what they did with gold files; you know we put a little bit on top to hide the saccharine.</span> <span id="s1571">There was a lot of bicarbonate of soda and very little saccharine.</span> <span id="s1572">I mean, it was mixed, but the top layer was the real thing -- but the deeper down you got, the worse it got.</span> <span id="s1573">There were no ethics in this thing, in this business.</span> <span id="s1574">If you got away with it, you got away with it.</span> <span id="s1575">We sold wine which we brought in from I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1576">I guess also from Yugoslavia and little Dalmatia.</span> <span id="s1577">We had a good business with bordellos in town.</span> <span id="s1578">We sold them wine.</span> <span id="s1579">Bordellos were legal at that time.</span> <span id="s1580">It was a business where everybody cut himself in, if possible.</span> <span id="s1581">You heard something, such as these people want a hundred thousand cigarettes, so you found somebody and sometimes they would go through a couple of middlemen until you got the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1582">Sometimes you didn’t ever see the cigarettes when they were delivered, you got a cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: It sounds as if you were working in a team arrangement, not that you were an independent agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: I was an independent agent.</span> <span id="s1585">I mean that everyone was relying on other people also.</span> <span id="s1586">I mean, I did not go to Bulgaria to pick up cigarettes and bring them to Vienna, of course.</span> <span id="s1587">You bought them together at times or I would sometimes have some stock in cigarettes or in saccharine and so on.</span> <span id="s1588">Of course, the less stock the better and to hold it as short as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: You didn’t want a big inventory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A; I liked no inventory.</span> <span id="s1591">I didn’t want any inventory.</span> <span id="s1592">I didn’t have the space for inventory.</span> <span id="s1593">It was impossible to store.</span> <span id="s1594">I would think that it was done in a small way -- on the same basis as any mob would do business here in drugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: What about income derived from the black market?</span> <span id="s1596">Was it adequate for subsistence or did you go for periods without funds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: I was never very flush, but again, I don’t think that money, at that time, was crucial.</span> <span id="s1598">There was a lot of money around to be had, but you could not buy anything, so money was not of great importance.</span> <span id="s1599">The important stuff was food.</span> <span id="s1600">Where do you get food?</span> <span id="s1601">Strangely enough, I don’t know, but I must have had a source.</span> <span id="s1602">Again, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1603">I must have had a source for food.</span> <span id="s1604">I probably bought it for money with coupons.</span> <span id="s1605">I went to restaurants.</span> <span id="s1606">There were some restaurants that would give you something without coupons, but in most of them you needed some food coupons.</span> <span id="s1607">There was a vegetarian restaurant where I ate a lot of times and there were other places also.</span> <span id="s1608">I went to some fairly good restaurants regularly, so I must have had some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Would you say that the black market was appealing mostly to Jews who were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Oh, no!</span> <span id="s1611">No!</span> <span id="s1612">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: A lot of people, gentiles also, were engaged in the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: But of course!</span> <span id="s1615">But of course!</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: I didn’t mean that in any derogatory way.</span> <span id="s1617">I wondered if some Jews in Vienna had particularly gone into black market operations as a means of livelihood simply because there was nothing else left to earn their living with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: I didn’t know any other Jews.</span> <span id="s1619">I didn’t know any Jews.</span> <span id="s1620">There were some half Jews in the group, you know, “Mischlinge?”</span> <span id="s1621">They were still in Vienna legally.</span> <span id="s1622">I was the only one I knew, except for this other chap, the one I talked about who was in that situation.</span> <span id="s1623">Oh, there was nobody else around.</span> <span id="s1624">This was not a group of people living underground who got involved in the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: You never had a second thought about maybe flirting with the devil because the black market activity would force you out into the open?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: What was the alternative?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: You were in hiding and being totally reliant on other people, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1629">Who’s going to feed you?</span> <span id="s1630">Nobody was interested in feeding you.</span> <span id="s1631">I wouldn’t have gotten away -- I wouldn’t have gotten a bite to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Now that’s another question I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s1633">What sort of arrangement did you have with the Concierge?</span> <span id="s1634">Did you pay any sort of rent?</span> <span id="s1635">Did she at times supply you with food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Yes, Yes!</span> <span id="s1637">She was very good, very decent, very, very decent.</span> <span id="s1638">There was no question about it -- yes.</span> <span id="s1639">She was not at all mercenary.</span> <span id="s1640">She didn’t do it at all from mercenary considerations.</span> <span id="s1641">I suppose I paid her when I could.</span> <span id="s1642">If I didn’t have money, I’m quite sure I ate there without any money.</span> <span id="s1643">If there was any food, or whatever there was I shared with them.</span> <span id="s1644">There was no commercial feeling involved.</span> <span id="s1645">They were strictly humanitarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Let me ask you another very broad question.</span> <span id="s1647">You may not see the reason for it, but I do have a reason.</span> <span id="s1648">Would you say, since you mentioned commercial considerations, that commercial considerations generally dominated people’s motives in a situation like this?</span> <span id="s1649">Or did you see human kindness and moral considerations keep coming through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Yes, I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1651">Nobody could have paid for the risk people took.</span> <span id="s1652">How much can you pay somebody if you said, “Hide me!”</span> <span id="s1653">and if they found out, the person is fairly certain to get killed?</span> <span id="s1654">How much do you want to pay for that, or can you pay for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: It’s frequently said, and I’m sure you’ve heard it and I’m sure you’ve seen it in print, “In tense situations like this, if you’ve got the money and if the deal can be made and if the price is right, you can find a place for hiding!</span> <span id="s1656">You can find somebody who will look after you, but only if you have the money!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: May I tell you something, I don’t know of any case that people were hidden during the war only for money.</span> <span id="s1658">I don’t know of any case.</span> <span id="s1659">I don’t say that there might not have been any…</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: But you have seen that in print?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: I have not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: I have not!</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Yes, I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: I’m sure you have.</span> <span id="s1666">I have no personal knowledge of it.</span> <span id="s1667">I will say that my feeling today is, for there is no knowledge involved, really based on what I heard and what I observed, if somebody was hidden, he/she was hidden in most cases due to the conviction of the hider (person providing the concealment) and because of the convictions only!</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: I’m going to switch sides of the tape again.</span> <span id="s1669">Now, the summer or early 1944, when you decided to leave; you say that there was a close call that made you come to the conviction that you had to get out of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Let me go back for a moment about how people risked their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Yes, I think that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: It is like today-- if you tell people that they are going to die the day after tomorrow if they don’t stop smoking, they’ll still smoke.</span> <span id="s1673">Am I right?</span> <span id="s1674">So it was the same way then, in a way.</span> <span id="s1675">If somebody was convinced of what they are doing, they would do it.</span> <span id="s1676">It was a capital offense to listen to foreign broadcasts.</span> <span id="s1677">Still, people.</span> <span id="s1678">And I among them, were sitting every night and waiting for the “ta-ta-ta-tum” and the “this is London” and the whole thing, and they all would listen to the whole thing on BBC (the British Broadcasting Corporation) every night.</span> <span id="s1679">So you can see that the threat of being made a head shorter didn’t keep anyone from it.</span> <span id="s1680">Anybody who wanted to “listen to England” -- you needed these things!</span> <span id="s1681">If you were anti-Nazi, anti-German, you needed these broadcasts to keep going.</span> <span id="s1682">This was more necessary than bread or potatoes.</span> <span id="s1683">The daily doses of BBC were what you needed to keep up your morale.</span> <span id="s1684">It was completely demoralizing -- the newspapers, the constantly repeated claims, the repeating of everything you despised until you started to believe it yourself.</span> <span id="s1685">So the BBC was a very, very important antidote.</span> <span id="s1686">This is the same way if somebody was convinced that what they were doing was right, they will do it.</span> <span id="s1687">I don’t think that today, even today, the death penalty keeps anyone from doing what they really want.</span> <span id="s1688">It’s the same thing, you know, the same thing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: You said that you made contact with some people or some agencies that would get refugees into Hungary.</span> <span id="s1690">What made you decide to go to Hungary in the first place?</span> <span id="s1691">Was it the only option?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: There were no options, really.</span> <span id="s1693">What was there?</span> <span id="s1694">Hungary was the only country which was not occupied by the Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s1695">it was pro-fascist, but it wasn’t pro-Nazi anyway.</span> <span id="s1696">So it was not occupied.</span> <span id="s1697">It was the only country.</span> <span id="s1698">(On April 12, 1941, Hungary entered the war, but the Jews from Hungary were not sent to Auschwitz until November 19, 1944).</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Did you realize that up to that point, the Jews in Hungary had not been greatly persecuted in comparison to elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s1702">Through BBC broadcasts?</span> <span id="s1703">Through people traveling back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yes, I would think so.</span> <span id="s1705">There was contact, I didn’t live in a vacuum.</span> <span id="s1706">I knew a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1707">You had contact with people and people traveled.</span> <span id="s1708">We were in the black market.</span> <span id="s1709">Probably the black market broadens.</span> <span id="s1710">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: How did you make contact with the people who were going to get you into Hungary once the decision was made for you to go to Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Through somebody else again -- through the son of the Concierge, the one I lived with.</span> <span id="s1713">I think he brought me together with them for some consideration.</span> <span id="s1714">I don’t remember what it was.</span> <span id="s1715">They would take you to a jump-off point somewhere in the Burgenland, which is at the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s1716">Then they take you over the fields and they pick you up on the other side and take you to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1717">Another reason I wanted to go, but again it was just an added advantage because I would have gone anyway, was that I had, again, friends of my parents in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1718">Burbash was their name.</span> <span id="s1719">They had a store -- a little general clothing store or department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Were they Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: They were Jews, yes, Jews!</span> <span id="s1722">Modernized Jews.</span> <span id="s1723">They had a little department store -- you know, like we were discussing.</span> <span id="s1724">So, at least there was somebody again to talk to at the time.</span> <span id="s1725">I had a suitcase which was stolen on the way from Vienna to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1726">It was a rather arduous walk, across the fields during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Was part of the trip by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1729">It was the train to the place where the jump off point was.</span> <span id="s1730">Then we went across and stayed overnight, and as I remember in some barn.</span> <span id="s1731">There I lost the suitcase and acquired lice.</span> <span id="s1732">Then they picked us up -- I think with horse drawn wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Were you alone or were there several of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: There were several.</span> <span id="s1735">There were a lot of people along.</span> <span id="s1736">There were several -- how many, I don’t remember -- anybody from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: They weren’t friends of yours?</span> <span id="s1738">They were not in your circle of acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: No, I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s1740">It was a very foggy experience for me again -- very, very foggy.</span> <span id="s1741">But, I remember that it was in the winter.</span> <span id="s1742">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1743">I remember the train -- they kept us in a compartment somewhere, but I don’t remember where.</span> <span id="s1744">There was something where we had to stay in one place for a while and eventually they got us out and we started walking, and I remember very, very little about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: This was in January or February of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: I think it was February, if I’m not mistaken.</span> <span id="s1747">Oh, I said February, so it must have been February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Your destination was Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1750">I got to Budapest all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Then what?</span> <span id="s1752">You looked up your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1754">I looked up my friends.</span> <span id="s1755">They said, “Look there’s only one way in which we can help you.</span> <span id="s1756">You cannot live here illegally.</span> <span id="s1757">It is too difficult and much too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1758">If they find you, they will send you back.</span> <span id="s1759">It’s no good!</span> <span id="s1760">If you go to the KAOP (the KAOP was the police for foreigners) and let yourself be known and tell them that you just came in illegally, they will intern you).</span> <span id="s1761">There were a number of camps in Budapest, Hungary (two or three at that time), for the people who came from Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1762">There were a lot of people coming in and Hungary was relatively free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: At the moment, it seemed to be a haven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: I remember Burbash sent me with one of his people to walk over to the police.</span> <span id="s1765">During that walk, I saw that they had so many things which I hadn’t seen in the stores in years.</span> <span id="s1766">They had all the food you wanted and most of the goods you wanted.</span> <span id="s1767">The confectionaries!</span> <span id="s1768">It was just a miracle for me to walk through it.</span> <span id="s1769">We stopped somewhere just to eat something.</span> <span id="s1770">This was the biggest experience up to that time.</span> <span id="s1771">So, I went to the police and I was interned and everything seemed to be all right.</span> <span id="s1772">These camps were not particularly a pleasure, but not too bad.</span> <span id="s1773">Burbash sent me packages, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1774">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s1775">They sent me packages with some clothing and some food, so I didn’t do too badly for the first couple of weeks I was there.</span> <span id="s1776">I got rid of my lice.</span> <span id="s1777">I think this was a most frustrating experience.</span> <span id="s1778">They said, “You have to get deloused,” I said, “Lice?</span> <span id="s1779">I don’t have lice,” but they said, “What do you mean you don’t have lice?</span> <span id="s1780">They’re crawling all over you!”</span> <span id="s1781">It really became one of daily chores to sit and you look in the seams -- you look for lice in every crack.</span> <span id="s1782">The camp was in the Jewish section of Budapest.</span> <span id="s1783">You couldn’t get out, at least I don’t think you could get out.</span> <span id="s1784">Maybe once in a while there was somebody who could go somewhere, but I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Were the Hungarian police courteous or rough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: The first contact I had when I went there, they were very courteous.</span> <span id="s1787">They must have been courteous, for they didn’t have any inclination to do anything.</span> <span id="s1788">Now these camps were actually run by the Jewish community under the auspices of the government, that is, these internment camps, so there was no pressure there, of course.</span> <span id="s1789">You could send out for things if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1790">If you wanted something else to eat, you could send out for it.</span> <span id="s1791">It was really as loosely run as they could possibly get away with.</span> <span id="s1792">But after I was there, for about two weeks or so, I was transferred to a camp which was not run by the Jewish community anymore, but the Hungarian government -- the Hungarian police, in Csorgo.</span> <span id="s1793">Csorgo is a small place which was in Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s1794">Before that it was Czechoslovakia and now I guess its Czechoslovakia again.</span> <span id="s1795">It is near Satoraljaujhely -- don’t try to spell it, for heaven’s sake.</span> <span id="s1796">Satoraljaujhely is a district town in North East Hungry.</span> <span id="s1797">Csorgo was again a camp which was surrounded by nothing and run by the police, but not in a sadistic way in any way.</span> <span id="s1798">Actually, the only bad thing was there was nothing to do -- there was absolutely nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1799">You could buy some additional foods, I remember, if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1800">Food was at a minimum, but there were some people who got food in, even a lot of people from, the border areas from Yugoslavia and the border areas from Romania -- these areas which changed hands after every war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: What was the normal diet, soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: There was much soup -- soup…potatoes, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1803">I don’t know what potatoes you had.</span> <span id="s1804">On the one hand, I don’t have any memory of being particularly hungry there.</span> <span id="s1805">On the other hand, I remember that onions were a favorite thing, as a supplemental diet.</span> <span id="s1806">It was one of the things you could buy there: onions.</span> <span id="s1807">So there couldn’t have been too much to eat.</span> <span id="s1808">But I don’t think that it could have been too bad, for you could get packages in, and a lot of people got packages in, and everything was clearly bearable until the Germans came, which was in the beginning of May, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: it’s precisely in March of ’44 when you are transferred to Csorgo that the pressure begins to step up considerably with Admiral Horthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Then he begins to appoint the Nidash people, but I mean that was under the pressure of Germany.</span> <span id="s1811">That’s because the Germans came in and, whatever his name, the son-of-a-bitch, I forget the name…</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Imradi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: imradi!</span> <span id="s1814">Yes.</span> <span id="s1815">Then all these Nidash people came to power and things became very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1816">They were worse than the Germans were, if that was possible, and it became bad in Csorgo, too, immediately.</span> <span id="s1817">They had one, a Number 1, I remember, one kind of a NCO or something like that.</span> <span id="s1818">The camp was run by the equivalent of marshals here, maybe, or to the what-do-you-call-it in this country?</span> <span id="s1819">...the Sheriff’s department here, but it was a more military operation: the Zenda.</span> <span id="s1820">They were people with a feather in the hat.</span> <span id="s1821">It was something between military and police.</span> <span id="s1822">They were very bad.</span> <span id="s1823">There was one, I remember him particularly -- Holbaut was his name.</span> <span id="s1824">I still remember him, the son-of-a-bitch.</span> <span id="s1825">He came and gave us a very hard time.</span> <span id="s1826">Constantly, every moment he would order us out and back in and hopping around and things like this -- just for meanness, you know, just for meanness.</span> <span id="s1827">But it didn’t last very long, since this area was one of the first which was evacuated from Jews.</span> <span id="s1828">Now what the Hungarians did -- they took the Jews from the countryside and put them into ghettos in certain towns, you know, in district towns and the nearest town to where we were was Satoraljaujhely.</span> <span id="s1829">I was on one of the first transports to the district.</span> <span id="s1830">The whole camp finally drove down to Satoraljaujhely.</span> <span id="s1831">They dropped us at a station and that was it.</span> <span id="s1832">It was, I think, on the tenth of May, if I’m not mistaken that we were transferred.</span> <span id="s1833">We must have been one of the first transports which left Hungary.</span> <span id="s1834">It started in this area and then it continued with the Ukraine to send the Jewish people away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You left Satoraljaujhely for Auschwitz, is that what you mean?</span> <span id="s1836">Or is it that you left Csorgo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: It was the same day.</span> <span id="s1838">This was the same day.</span> <span id="s1839">It was all done in one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Oh, you didn’t stop then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: No!</span> <span id="s1842">It took an hour ride on the train.</span> <span id="s1843">It was not far -- just a few miles from Satoraljaujhely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Did you know the destination of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Yes, I think that we did.</span> <span id="s1846">I know we knew the destination and we knew, too, what we could expect on the other end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: You knew the reputation of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Oh, yes!!</span> <span id="s1849">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1850">It was 1944!</span> <span id="s1851">By then, everybody knew it by then and we talked about it.</span> <span id="s1852">We even discussed what kind of soap we, each one of us, would be, and we all decided that I would be a shaving stick because of my shape.</span> <span id="s1853">I was thin, you know, like a shaving stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Yes, long and thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: I would be a shaving stick!</span> <span id="s1856">Don’t be shocked, I mean.</span> <span id="s1857">This kind of humor was rampant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: No, this kind of humor, in the face of what was going to happen, sort of intrigues me -- that people could still be humorous and laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: It was kind of subdued.</span> <span id="s1860">Well, it was not really a ha-ha-ha laugh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: No, I know, it was the cynical kind.</span> <span id="s1862">I don’t really want to go into the story of your trip to Auschwitz today, but there are one or two other questions that I’d like to ask about up to this point.</span> <span id="s1863">What about language difficulties?</span> <span id="s1864">You did not speak Hungarian, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: If I would have spoken Hungarian…I would have tried either Hungarian or Czech -- I spoke Hungarian!</span> <span id="s1866">I could make myself understood, but not enough to go out on my own, you know, not enough to go out on my own and survive.</span> <span id="s1867">I could go later -- later, after the war, I went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1868">I could go and buy a pack of cigarettes in a store or go to a restaurant, you know.</span> <span id="s1869">I spoke enough Hungarian for that, but not to survive.</span> <span id="s1870">We were very close to the Slovak border, the Slovakian border.</span> <span id="s1871">If I would have found a group to try to get out and get over into Slovakia, I probably would have done that.</span> <span id="s1872">There were too many “buts” and “ifs” and it’s always easier to do nothing than to do something.</span> <span id="s1873">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1874">Maybe I should have tried.</span> <span id="s1875">You know I was very adventurous at this stage, so maybe I should have tried, but speaking neither Hungarian not a word of Czech or Slovak, I didn’t stand a chance.</span> <span id="s1876">You could get away with Hungarian in Bavaria, but I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Now what about papers?</span> <span id="s1878">When you registered with the police in Budapest, did they give you any sort of papers?</span> <span id="s1879">(HS apparently made a negative response).</span> <span id="s1880">So, from the time you left Vienna, you were without identification except your expired school card.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: I had a paper from the “General Gouvernement” of the Protectorat.</span> <span id="s1882">Yes, I was always without identification papers.</span> <span id="s1883">It wouldn’t have done anything for me.</span> <span id="s1884">Even if I had them, I had no use for them!</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: At the camp in Csorgo, did you run into friends and acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: You were totally alone then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: I was not alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q; Alone as far as anybody from the past was concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: I didn’t know anybody, but, of course, I made a lot of friends there and one of my sad things is that I think that I’m the only one that is alive from the whole camp.</span> <span id="s1891">I heard of one person, but I never made contact with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Was Csorgo segregated according to sex -- men in one section…women in another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: There were only men!</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: It was only a camp for men.</span> <span id="s1895">So the transport to Auschwitz was only men at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: I think that even in the car there were only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">(Tape 3, Side 1) This is the fourth interview with Mr. Steeber.</span> <span id="s1898">It is February 22, 1979.</span> <span id="s1899">We are in the living room of his home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: When we last talked, Mr. Steeber, you had been put, or you were about to be put, on a train bound for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1901">You had left Csorgo, gone to the town that I can’t pronounce…</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Satoraljaujhely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1904">How long did you stay there in Satoraljaujhely at the rail station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Oh, just transit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: From one train to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: No, we were taken down by truck to the station and the train was there, so…right into the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Heavily guarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: By Germans or Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: By both.</span> <span id="s1912">The train itself was guarded by Germans and the Hungarians took us down to the station, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s1913">But the train itself was guarded by Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Do you have any way of estimating approximately how many men were in the convoy as prisoners on that particular train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: Oh, no!</span> <span id="s1916">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1917">I couldn’t possibly estimate it.</span> <span id="s1918">You see, it was not only from Csorgo, which was completely small -- I think a small outfit -- it was from the whole countryside.</span> <span id="s1919">They brought the people together from the whole countryside, concentrated them in Satoraljaujhely (one of the towns where they ghettoized the people) where they put the people in groups and then took them from there and put them on the train, and as for the whole train, I really have no idea.</span> <span id="s1920">I could not tell you how long the train was -- I could not tell you how many people there were.</span> <span id="s1921">It is something where I, again, remember certain things very clearly and other things I do not remember at all.</span> <span id="s1922">I remember one thing -- I still see this one fellow from our truck who tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1923">He jumped off the truck and ran over a field.</span> <span id="s1924">It was all flat there.</span> <span id="s1925">He ran across a field and somebody shot him.</span> <span id="s1926">I think that he fell, so I guess he was hit.</span> <span id="s1927">But when we got to the train, the people were just put into these freight wagons and the wagons all had a little window on all four sides, close under the roof.</span> <span id="s1928">We had little windows, horizontal windows, which were about maybe three feet long and a couple of feet high, maybe -- maybe a little bigger.</span> <span id="s1929">In future trains, they had barbed wire over these windows, but this was one of the very first trains -- maybe it was…maybe the first train, I don’t know, from our area, and they were open.</span> <span id="s1930">They were all open -- these windows.</span> <span id="s1931">When they put us into these cars, they made an announcement that anybody who tries to escape would be shot and also that if somebody escaped, one person who was designated the car leader or whatever you want to call him -- the car foreman or wagon master -- would be shot, too, if somebody from his car escaped.</span> <span id="s1932">If the wagon master escapes everybody will be shot.</span> <span id="s1933">They had the little brake houses at the end of each car --- kind of a little caboose.</span> <span id="s1934">I don’t think they have it here.</span> <span id="s1935">I never saw it here.</span> <span id="s1936">It had stairs going up to it.</span> <span id="s1937">They had SS, or SD really, people sitting in there.</span> <span id="s1938">(The SS or Schutz Staffel were the black shirted Nazi elite guards who were in charge of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1939">Schutz Staffel meant Protective Group).</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: On each car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: On each car.</span> <span id="s1942">Then they were, when we got there, they were on the roofs, too.</span> <span id="s1943">I don’t think they stayed on the roofs later when the train moved, probably, but they were sitting on the roofs, too.</span> <span id="s1944">We were, I think, eighty some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: In your car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: In that car!</span> <span id="s1947">(The sign posted on the doors of the car stated that their capacity was for 40 people or for 8 horses, lengthwise -- that was standard in Europe from the time of WWI).</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: I am trying to picture all this.</span> <span id="s1949">Was the loading done quickly, or did it take quite a bit of time?</span> <span id="s1950">I mean, for example, the process of getting to the station, getting on the train, getting the train moving…was that hours and hours or was it done very precisely?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: I think fairly efficiently.</span> <span id="s1952">It was done quite efficiently.</span> <span id="s1953">I don’t think that there were great delays.</span> <span id="s1954">Again, I could not give you exact times.</span> <span id="s1955">It would be impossible to say now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Do you recall whether it was done in great confusion, with a lot of noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: It was noisy, but not great confusion.</span> <span id="s1958">You see they were pretty well trained, these people, and I think it was done amazingly efficiently -- I mean, there was no question about what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Were people whipped into the cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: No!</span> <span id="s1961">I didn’t see anyone being whipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Were there dogs, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Dogs!</span> <span id="s1964">I don’t recall any.</span> <span id="s1965">I don’t recall any dogs, but then I can’t tell you that there were no dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: With eighty people in one car, was that so crowded that you could not sit down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: You could sit down.</span> <span id="s1968">It was extremely crowded, but you could sit down, there was very little space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Was the floor of the car covered with straw and then lime?</span> <span id="s1970">I’ve read accounts of such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: I didn’t see any lime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: There were accounts of lime burning people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: No!</span> <span id="s1974">I think that there was straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s1975">I don’t think there was lime.</span> <span id="s1976">I don’t even know if there was straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s1977">I don’t even remember straw.</span> <span id="s1978">That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1979">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1980">However, there was no lime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: These aren’t important details, but I think that they help to form a visual picture.</span> <span id="s1982">Was there a bucket to serve as a latrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: There was a bucket for a latrine -- yes.</span> <span id="s1984">I know that somebody died very shortly after we got on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: In the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: In the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Of what -- heart trouble?</span> <span id="s1988">I mean, was it just sudden?</span> <span id="s1989">Did the person appear ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: He died a natural death, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1991">He was not beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1992">He just died.</span> <span id="s1993">I couldn’t even tell you who it was and what it was all about.</span> <span id="s1994">We put him in the corner.</span> <span id="s1995">He started to smell eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Did you take luggage with you?</span> <span id="s1997">Did you have anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Nothing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Did other people have luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Well, some people had -- you know -- some people had…not really bundles.</span> <span id="s2001">There were people that had a few things, maybe.</span> <span id="s2002">I had nothing except what I was wearing.</span> <span id="s2003">Some people had some food, I remember.</span> <span id="s2004">They got some food sent in.</span> <span id="s2005">Most of these people in the camp -- I was the only person from Vienna, I guess, really as far as I can remember -- most of them were from Romania and Slovakia and that area and from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Do you remember: -- does anyone in your car stand out in your memory.</span> <span id="s2007">Do you know any names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: I know the name of a pair of brothers.</span> <span id="s2009">This is the only thing I remember: Pereck.</span> <span id="s2010">Of course I was with them in the same room, at the same place, we slept together in Csorgo, that is why I remember them.</span> <span id="s2011">They tried to teach me Hungarian!</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Did the ages vary widely?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: No, well, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Teenagers or children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: There were some.</span> <span id="s2016">It was mixed.</span> <span id="s2017">There was a big group from Csorgo in that car.</span> <span id="s2018">Most of these people were from Csorgo and most of these people were young -- youngish people.</span> <span id="s2019">They were teenagers to their twenties.</span> <span id="s2020">I don’t think there was anybody older than thirty.</span> <span id="s2021">I’m sure that there was no one older.</span> <span id="s2022">We had talked already about it, but, I don’t know -- I don’t know whether we decided to get out of the car.</span> <span id="s2023">I think it was on the way down to the station, in the truck, that we talked about it or maybe it was while we were waiting.</span> <span id="s2024">There was quite a long wait.</span> <span id="s2025">I remember we were sitting around in Csorgo before we got on the truck.</span> <span id="s2026">We knew already that we would be on a train for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2027">There really was no question in our mind.</span> <span id="s2028">Maybe not to Auschwitz, but a train to somewhere.</span> <span id="s2029">Yes, we knew that it was to Auschwitz, sure!</span> <span id="s2030">We decided -- as I said, we were all young people -- we decided to jump if possible; to get out of the train, if possible.</span> <span id="s2031">Now, after this announcement had been made, of course, people were a little bit reluctant about these things, some of the people were not too happy to jump.</span> <span id="s2032">The train left.</span> <span id="s2033">It was not a particularly long wait.</span> <span id="s2034">I think it must have been in the early evening…maybe the whole thing, I think, maybe from departure from Csorgo to the time the train left was maybe from morning to late afternoon.</span> <span id="s2035">I can only think back approximately to what I can remember of the train leaving.</span> <span id="s2036">It must have been in the afternoon, for the night came fairly fast.</span> <span id="s2037">The night came fairly soon, so we decided to jump.</span> <span id="s2038">Now, again, there were, of course, some people who were afraid of somebody else jumping, because if somebody else jumps and they don’t jump, they were afraid they’re getting killed, but if you are in a situation like this, you do not particularly think -- unfortunately -- of somebody else’s life -- you think of your own life first.</span> <span id="s2039">So, the people started to jump in the night.</span> <span id="s2040">I remember that they got out.</span> <span id="s2041">Now I do not know exactly who got away -- I wouldn’t know!</span> <span id="s2042">What I heard after the war, and I only met one person who survived --I don’t even know how I met him and how I talked to him -- it was a very strange thing -- I have absolutely no recollection of it -- I know that he was the only one except me.</span> <span id="s2043">He told me that he got away and that all the others were dead.</span> <span id="s2044">Now, I know that a number of people -- there are telegraph wires along the right of way -- they were low!</span> <span id="s2045">-- A number of people jumped against the wire and fell back against the train.</span> <span id="s2046">They fell under the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: The telegraph wires were lower than the top of the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Oh, yes, they were the signal wires, not telegraph wires -- a whole bunch of wires.</span> <span id="s2049">People jumped against (them) and were thrown back under the train and none of (the) people were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">I know that I wanted to jump in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s2051">Slovakia is the country between Hungary and Poland.</span> <span id="s2052">I thought there was a little more possibility to get lost -- not quite as much pressure on everybody as in other places.</span> <span id="s2053">Of course, we didn’t know where we were, exactly.</span> <span id="s2054">I could have figured it out.</span> <span id="s2055">I didn’t want to jump when the daylight started, but I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2056">I was pretty exhausted, I suppose, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2057">I woke up when it was pretty light already and so I thought, “I’ve lost this time!</span> <span id="s2058">Let me get out of here!”</span> <span id="s2059">I really had to fight my way to the window and to get through it.</span> <span id="s2060">The only thing I remember was that I was hanging outside the window and I pushed myself away so that I didn’t get caught by the wires.</span> <span id="s2061">The next thing I know -- I saw the train leaving -- the end of the train going on -- the end of the train moving away.</span> <span id="s2062">I was lying on a grassland, on a meadow.</span> <span id="s2063">I was a couple hundred -- I don’t know, maybe just a hundred yards from a stone wall, a rough stone wall, and behind it, a short piece of a stone wall if I remember.</span> <span id="s2064">Behind that were the mountains and woods and I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s2065">It turned out that I missed Slovakia -- just -- and I jumped in Poland in what was then called the “Generalgouvernement” zone.</span> <span id="s2066">I wanted to get up and go behind that wall, and I got up and I fell down and then I found out that I was bloody all over the leg and the pain started.</span> <span id="s2067">I couldn’t move my arm.</span> <span id="s2068">Later I found out that I had a bullet in my leg, through my leg, and one across my shin and that I broke my hip and I broke my shoulder.</span> <span id="s2069">Somehow I got behind.</span> <span id="s2070">I dragged myself on my side, on my right side.</span> <span id="s2071">I dragged myself behind the wall so there must have been an end to it, for I got behind it.</span> <span id="s2072">I think that some women saw me.</span> <span id="s2073">Anyhow, a short time after -- a short time afterwards -- four people stood around me with guns.</span> <span id="s2074">They were the S.D.</span> <span id="s2075">You know the S.D. was the security service of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2076">They were active in the Generalgouvernement -- they were in charge in that area of Poland.</span> <span id="s2077">By that time, I didn’t particularly care.</span> <span id="s2078">I think I remember that it was not of great importance whether they would shoot me or not.</span> <span id="s2079">I guess it didn’t make much difference; but, on the other hand, it must have made some difference to be because I told them that I got into this train only by mistake -- that my name is Henry Brook -- that I am an English citizen.</span> <span id="s2080">They looked at me and they didn’t know what to do with me and they walked away and came back again.</span> <span id="s2081">I really have no idea of the length of time or anything.</span> <span id="s2082">I was not with it!</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Well, you were probably in and out of consciousness -- passing out and coming to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: I don’t know -- I guess so.</span> <span id="s2085">I don’t know, really.</span> <span id="s2086">This came later.</span> <span id="s2087">I remember they put me on a wagon.</span> <span id="s2088">They took me to a station.</span> <span id="s2089">I know there was a station which, I know from what I saw on pictures, was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2090">I was lying on the ground and a few people came over and looked at me.</span> <span id="s2091">Suddenly they decided, I guess, that they didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2092">They decided to take me back and make the decision later.</span> <span id="s2093">They picked me up and put me into an empty freight car.</span> <span id="s2094">How they put me in there I remember very vividly!</span> <span id="s2095">They took the litter and turned it over!</span> <span id="s2096">I remember that very vividly.</span> <span id="s2097">Somebody, I guess, gave me some straw, I remember, and some water -- a bowl of water.</span> <span id="s2098">Then we went on a trip again and then I was delirious -- this -- again I remember -- my delirium during much of the way.</span> <span id="s2099">It appeared to me that the doors opened and all the people who were in the car suddenly came back into the car.</span> <span id="s2100">They walked back into the car and things like this.</span> <span id="s2101">One thing that I remember very vividly was the doors opening and the people coming in.</span> <span id="s2102">I must have screamed or whatever -- I don’t know what I did -- for somebody stuck his head in, at one point, and said, “Don’t worry, you will be there soon.”</span> <span id="s2103">They took me back to Kosice -- (otherwise said very close to Csorgo).</span> <span id="s2104">At some times it was Hungarian and at other times it was Czech.</span> <span id="s2105">So I was not far from where I started.</span> <span id="s2106">Kosice is now in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2107">It was not Czech at that time -- it was Hungarian and known as Kassa.</span> <span id="s2108">They put me into a military hospital and treated me quite well.</span> <span id="s2109">I was in room with a lot of other people, of course, in a ward -- in a big ward.</span> <span id="s2110">But they took care of my hip.</span> <span id="s2111">It was a miserable thing.</span> <span id="s2112">Of course, it got very, very painful, but they rearranged my hip and nailed it, I guess.</span> <span id="s2113">I don’t know exactly what they did with it.</span> <span id="s2114">And they also took care of my shoulder and gave me food.</span> <span id="s2115">Food was fairly decent.</span> <span id="s2116">They treated me fairly decently.</span> <span id="s2117">The people were Hungarians, of course -- all of them were Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2118">Of course, they did not think there that I was a Jew -- don’t forget, I was Henry Brook.</span> <span id="s2119">I don’t know how they would have treated me if they would have known I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2120">Of course, I wouldn’t have had the same treatment.</span> <span id="s2121">I was kind if a curiosity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: May I interrupt you?</span> <span id="s2123">But maybe you would rather continue, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: No, no, no…go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: You told me when I first met you, and we weren’t taping at that time, that before this ever happened you had already figured out that in case something like this did happen, that you were going to use the alias.</span> <span id="s2126">When did that actually take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Before I left Csorgo, I think.</span> <span id="s2128">I talked to some people about it, even.</span> <span id="s2129">I don’t know how it was received.</span> <span id="s2130">But, yes, I talked to them about it already -- I mean I started it, in a way.</span> <span id="s2131">I was kind of mysterious about it.</span> <span id="s2132">I remember that I said that it might be a surprise or something like this.</span> <span id="s2133">I mean that it didn’t help me to get away from Csorgo, so nobody took it as being very serious I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Why the name, Henry Brook?</span> <span id="s2135">Does that have any significance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Absolutely not!</span> <span id="s2137">Absolutely no significance.</span> <span id="s2138">“Henry” --you see I figured out that it was something I could remember easily.</span> <span id="s2139">Heinz translates as Henry, right?</span> <span id="s2140">“Brook” -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2141">Not even Brooks or anything which is much more common than Brook.</span> <span id="s2142">I also had to have a birth date.</span> <span id="s2143">My parents’ wedding day was the twelfth of December, so I made my birthday the 12th of December, 1922, because it’s easy to remember, right?</span> <span id="s2144">12-12-22 is easy to remember.</span> <span id="s2145">I did all this because, as you know, it is very easy to trip yourself up with these things.</span> <span id="s2146">For my birthday -- it was the 12th of December, 1922.</span> <span id="s2147">The funny thing is that, just as an aside, later, after the war, when I got to England, under also odd circumstances, I found out that there was a Henry Brook in England with a birth date on the 12th of December, 1922.</span> <span id="s2148">That was the funniest thing because it’s a rare name, Brook, without an “e’ at the end or without an “s’ at the end -- just BROOK – with the same birthday which I had imagined.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: In England, I wasn’t free.</span> <span id="s2151">The English police had gotten me.</span> <span id="s2152">I got in illegally, into England, and I got into a camp in Wimbledon in England.</span> <span id="s2153">They came and they interrogated me in Wimbledon and one of the questions was “How do you know Henry Brook?”</span> <span id="s2154">I said, “I don’t.”</span> <span id="s2155">After that all I was Henry Steeber and I repeated who I was.</span> <span id="s2156">I said, “I don’t know Henry Brook!”</span> <span id="s2157">They said, “Of course you know Henry Brook!”</span> <span id="s2158">I said, “No!</span> <span id="s2159">Who is Henry Brook?”</span> <span id="s2160">I said, “I don’t know him.</span> <span id="s2161">I invented him.”</span> <span id="s2162">Back came, “How can you say you invented him.”</span> <span id="s2163">Henry Brook was born there and there on the 12th of December, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: Quite a coincidence!</span> <span id="s2165">When you jumped off the train and were found by these two women, after you crawled behind the wall and the SD guards came up, what language did you speak to them in?</span> <span id="s2166">English?</span> <span id="s2167">German?</span> <span id="s2168">Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Not in Polish.</span> <span id="s2170">I don’t speak a word of Polish!</span> <span id="s2171">To the guards?</span> <span id="s2172">In German, I guess.</span> <span id="s2173">I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s2174">I guess in German.</span> <span id="s2175">English…I only acquired an English accent later.</span> <span id="s2176">When I spoke German I acquired an English accent.</span> <span id="s2177">I think, to make it more authentic -- it was a slight English accent.</span> <span id="s2178">I spoke German with a slight English accent, but I don’t think I had it then.</span> <span id="s2179">I spoke German to them, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: You spoke English with a heavy German accent, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Much less than I do now --much less of an accent than I have now.</span> <span id="s2182">I spoke better English then than I speak English now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: So you felt that by adopting this alias and saying that you were an Englishman that you were so secure in the language that you could see it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s2185">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s2186">I spoke English quite fluently -- especially for Germans, I mean.</span> <span id="s2187">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s2188">I spoke English quite fluently and I did not have probably the vocabulary I’ve acquired since then, but I spoke it, and let’s face it, most people get away with what I had.</span> <span id="s2189">Most English speaking people get away with a vocabulary of five hundred words.</span> <span id="s2190">And the funny thing was that I had a pair of shoes, high shoes, which had very high, high toes.</span> <span id="s2191">They were round, high toes and somehow they looked like parachute boots, uh....paratrooper boots.</span> <span id="s2192">I think this was the reason that they thought they’d made a catch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Well, one other question before we get to the hospital and recuperation and so forth: You must have jumped fairly close to Auschwitz, if that’s where you ended up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2195">I don’t know how close I was -- if they took me to Auschwitz, as a matter of course, that was the terminal: Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2196">Where should they have taken me?</span> <span id="s2197">I mean, anybody who could make a decision about me would have been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2198">Whether it was Dr. Mengele or somebody else -- I don’t know who it might have been -- who might have decided.</span> <span id="s2199">They were all in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: As far as you know, you weren’t inside Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2201">You were at the railroad in the cars.</span> <span id="s2202">(In Auschwitz there were railroad tracks all over.</span> <span id="s2203">See history of Dr. Murray Weisman).</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: No!</span> <span id="s2205">I remember a long building -- a long shed-like building with a platform in front.</span> <span id="s2206">There was a fairly wide platform in front, next to the tracks.</span> <span id="s2207">I only mean I never saw the name “Auschwitz” anywhere or whatever derivation they had.</span> <span id="s2208">All I can surmise is that it was Auschwitz, because I saw pictures and there were a great number of people around -- a great number of SS and SD around, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s2209">It seems logical that it was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: How long were you in the hospital, recuperating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: For two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: This would, then, have been July -- mid-July?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Right!</span> <span id="s2214">They took me from the hospital when there was the assassination attempt on Hitler.</span> <span id="s2215">On the 20th of July, right?</span> <span id="s2216">So, I left on the tenth of July or something like that.</span> <span id="s2217">I think on the tenth of July -- just about two months.</span> <span id="s2218">For I think I got there on the tenth of May.</span> <span id="s2219">They took me out of the hospital and took me to a prison in Kassa.</span> <span id="s2220">In that prison, I stayed for, it must have been about ten days.</span> <span id="s2221">It was a place that was held together by cockroaches -- not by cockroaches, but by bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2222">That was worse -- they were bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2223">Yes, I never saw anything like this.</span> <span id="s2224">If you didn’t fall asleep while the light was on, you had no -- absolutely no-- chance of falling asleep later.</span> <span id="s2225">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2226">We didn’t have any mattresses or anything -- just boards.</span> <span id="s2227">What do you call it -- pallets?</span> <span id="s2228">What do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Mattresses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: No, not mattresses.</span> <span id="s2231">No.</span> <span id="s2232">What do you call a wooden board?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: The frames -- the bed frame?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: No, not that!</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Slats?</span> <span id="s2236">(HS probably means wooden bed boards).</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Not slats.</span> <span id="s2238">They were long things like slats.</span> <span id="s2239">We took them up.</span> <span id="s2240">We unscrewed them and took them up and took some newspaper and lit it and burned the bugs.</span> <span id="s2241">Burned them out.</span> <span id="s2242">It helped a little bit once in a while, but there were millions and millions of bugs!</span> <span id="s2243">I never saw anything like it!</span> <span id="s2244">They fell in the food and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Was the hospital a civilian or military hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Military.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: And so many soldiers were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: German or Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: Next to me was a Yugoslav I guess.</span> <span id="s2253">I think that he was a Yugoslav fellow.</span> <span id="s2254">There were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2255">I don’t think there was another German -- Hungarian and the allies, if you excuse the expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Were you interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: Frequently and consistently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: A number of times by Gestapo and I had to tell them a story.</span> <span id="s2260">Again, I had plenty of time to think about stories.</span> <span id="s2261">I had a story which I still can’t believe it that I ever got away with it for one second.</span> <span id="s2262">The story was that my mother was married the first time -- that there was a first marriage -- you see, I couldn’t get away from “Stieber” -- that was one thing.</span> <span id="s2263">I had to give somehow some connection to her first marriage that she had been married to an Englishman named “Brook” and that I was the issue of that marriage.</span> <span id="s2264">Now that Heinz Stieber -- that would make him my half brother, right?</span> <span id="s2265">But they never questioned why the son of the first marriage was three years younger than the son of the second marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: You had no papers with you at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: You had lost those?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Oh, I abandoned them.</span> <span id="s2270">I threw them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: I threw them all away.</span> <span id="s2273">I threw everything I had away.</span> <span id="s2274">I didn’t want any identification.</span> <span id="s2275">I had a different name, too.</span> <span id="s2276">I had the identification about which I already told you, on which my friend painted the stamps, you know, the Kenn Karte from Czechoslovakia, in a different name, and I didn’t want to jeopardize these people, so I destroyed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: What was your story about having no papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Oh, that was nothing.</span> <span id="s2279">It was natural to have no papers.</span> <span id="s2280">Having been through these camps, you wouldn’t have any papers anymore.</span> <span id="s2281">If you didn’t have any, that was that.</span> <span id="s2282">Nobody had papers!</span> <span id="s2283">I had been at the K.E.O.K.H. (the Hungarian police) so they took my papers.</span> <span id="s2284">That was natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: One reads fantastic stories like this, that almost are so wild they seem unreal, and one always has the opinion, at least I do, that the Gestapo was very efficient and had all sorts of contacts in England.</span> <span id="s2286">They could have checked English birth records and found who Henry Brook was.</span> <span id="s2287">Is that kind of efficiency a myth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: I think it is a myth.</span> <span id="s2289">I think they were stupid.</span> <span id="s2290">They were organized to destroy.</span> <span id="s2291">For that, they were extremely well organized.</span> <span id="s2292">There were trains there, come hell or high water, come defeat,.</span> <span id="s2293">Starving or drought, and people starving on the front, but they had the trains to deport Jews.</span> <span id="s2294">But that was just about all.</span> <span id="s2295">They developed a very efficient system to hoodwink the people, a fairly good system to blind the people, to get them on these trains, to get them to the camps without great fights.</span> <span id="s2296">They were organized, but that’s all.</span> <span id="s2297">But as soon as something got a little, a little bit out of the guidelines, I don’t think that they did anything.</span> <span id="s2298">I don’t think it was in their system -- there was too much of a mixture of people -- too many poles attracting power and too many counter-poles there, too, in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2299">Look, you dealt with an overgrown bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s2300">Did you ever see anywhere an overgrown bureaucracy which is efficient?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2302">You also dealt with very brutish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s2304">Not all of them.</span> <span id="s2305">There were a lot of intellectuals there -- a lot of failed intellectuals in the Gestapo: lawyers, doctors, scientists -- usually people who couldn’t make it anywhere else -- who didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s2306">A number of such people!</span> <span id="s2307">The main thing is that it was a tremendous bureaucracy which was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2308">Now the Central European systems always tended toward bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s2309">They had the “Beamte”, the Mister Official who always had something to achieve in the “Petit Bourgeoisie”, the middle class people.</span> <span id="s2310">Sometimes he wore a uniform and had a title and had a pension when he retired.</span> <span id="s2311">So there was always something to achieve!</span> <span id="s2312">Everybody had a title!</span> <span id="s2313">Everybody was important and everybody would propagate his little circle.</span> <span id="s2314">This was the most important thing in the world!</span> <span id="s2315">So, efficiency was not possible.</span> <span id="s2316">They couldn’t be efficient.</span> <span id="s2317">Impossible.</span> <span id="s2318">Of course, they would not have wasted time to check in England.</span> <span id="s2319">I don’t know whether really they could have.</span> <span id="s2320">Maybe they could have -- I don’t know, but I think that by that time, in 1944, I think the German intelligence apparatus in England was no more.</span> <span id="s2321">They did a fairly thorough job in England to get rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: In these interrogations, was there ever any rough treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Never any threat of rough treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: That, yes.</span> <span id="s2326">However, nothing really was done.</span> <span id="s2327">Strangely enough, somehow, some of these threats sounded hollow.</span> <span id="s2328">They sounded more ridiculous even at that time, more ridiculous than real.</span> <span id="s2329">Maybe I just didn’t take them seriously.</span> <span id="s2330">I am, by birth, a Viennese, and we have one watchword: “The situation is hopeless, but not serious.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: I haven’t heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: OK, so you heard it now!</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Well, I am sorry to interrupt you with these kinds of questions, because it does interrupt your flow.</span> <span id="s2334">You had gotten into the prison.</span> <span id="s2335">Now what prison was it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: Just a prison.</span> <span id="s2337">I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2338">Some kind of a prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: In the same town -- Csorgo.</span> <span id="s2341">(It is suspected that he means Kassa, rather than Csorgo).</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: Were you in a cell that had a number of people in it, or were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: Yes, with a number of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: What kind of people?</span> <span id="s2345">Were they prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: No, they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Were they civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: They were civilians.</span> <span id="s2349">I guess there were some prominent people.</span> <span id="s2350">A couple of them were Jews, I remember.</span> <span id="s2351">They kept them on ice, for some particular reason, there.</span> <span id="s2352">There were a couple of very nice people there in the cell.</span> <span id="s2353">We had a good time.</span> <span id="s2354">Just before I got to the prison I had developed a boil behind my ear which was extremely painful.</span> <span id="s2355">It had just started.</span> <span id="s2356">I couldn’t move my head, and I went to the doctor at the prison -- that was actually a treatment staff.</span> <span id="s2357">He looked at it and said, “Just a moment” and took a pair of scissors and stuck them in a couple of times and squeezed and said, “It’s all right.”</span> <span id="s2358">It was all right!</span> <span id="s2359">It didn’t bother me anymore.</span> <span id="s2360">I stayed in that prison, I mean this is all I can remember about it -- that it was not very memorable -- the boil -- except for the bedbugs -- until the twentieth of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">On the 20th of July they rounded up, I think, anybody they could, for a trip.</span> <span id="s2362">I went on the trip; it was an interesting trip with two Gestapo agents and a couple of other people.</span> <span id="s2363">I think they were, but I am not sure, two young people, I think they were Czech.</span> <span id="s2364">I remember that they were in handcuffs all the time.</span> <span id="s2365">They never put a handcuff on me.</span> <span id="s2366">I didn’t walk very well.</span> <span id="s2367">I had a stick or something.</span> <span id="s2368">It was still very hard for me to walk.</span> <span id="s2369">I didn’t walk well at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">We went with a car, I remember, to Budapest.</span> <span id="s2371">In Budapest we got on a train and got to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2372">In Vienna, I had a slight intention, again, to get away.</span> <span id="s2373">I could have gotten away at that time, but I couldn’t walk, it was very dark, there was a blackout -- I could have gotten away pretty easily just then.</span> <span id="s2374">We went from one railroad station to another.</span> <span id="s2375">That’s what we did…so it would have been comparatively easy for me to get away.</span> <span id="s2376">However, I wasn’t able to move much -- it was still hard for me to walk.</span> <span id="s2377">It had been only two months since I had broken my hip…my arm and everything was still hurting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">From Vienna, we went to Prague.</span> <span id="s2379">In Prague they put me into another prison.</span> <span id="s2380">Uh…that was Pankraz prison.</span> <span id="s2381">It was a very famous prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: I’ve heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: I stayed in Pankraz from July for six to eight weeks.</span> <span id="s2384">Then, again, I was picked up and put on the prisoner transport to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2385">it took quite a while to get there and I was with Russian prisoners and political prisoners, mostly Russian -- a lot of Russians and a lot of political prisoners, too.</span> <span id="s2386">It took us, I am sure, five or six days at least, maybe more.</span> <span id="s2387">I think we stayed somewhere for a few days -- I think in Leipzig…I think…or Dresden.</span> <span id="s2388">I don’t know where it really was -- I don’t remember where, but it took about a week, maybe, to get to Berlin, from Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: This tape has ended.</span> <span id="s2390">Do you want to stop here or do you want to go on for a bit longer?</span> <span id="s2391">It’s 4:20.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">(Tape 3, Side 2) This is part of the fourth interview with Mr. Steeber.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Were you still interrogated frequently on this long trip and in Pankraz prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: The interrogation ceased.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: Yes, it had ceased.</span> <span id="s2397">There wasn’t any at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: Was it another boxcar trip from Vienna to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: No, not from Vienna to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2400">It was, as far as I can remember, from Budapest to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2401">And from Vienna to Prague, it was just by regular passenger car.</span> <span id="s2402">From Prague to Berlin there were prison cars most of the time.</span> <span id="s2403">These were cars with a corridor and cages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: Again, do you remember anyone who was with you by name, by impression, or by face?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: Just one fellow.</span> <span id="s2406">He was, I am quite sure, gay -- as gay as they come.</span> <span id="s2407">He wrote me after the war a letter how much he admired me.</span> <span id="s2408">I don’t know where it is -- maybe I still have it somewhere.</span> <span id="s2409">I didn’t see it for a long time.</span> <span id="s2410">Maybe I threw it away.</span> <span id="s2411">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2412">He wrote how much he admired me on this trip in all that company, in all that rough company, how I kept my stiff upper lip, considering that I was going towards a fairly certain execution of some kind or other, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s2413">Finally, he survived it, too.</span> <span id="s2414">I don’t know why he was in.</span> <span id="s2415">He was a double or triple agent for somebody, I think.</span> <span id="s2416">He was that type.</span> <span id="s2417">He survived it, also.</span> <span id="s2418">They all survived -- these people.</span> <span id="s2419">And I saw him again after the war and he turned out, I think, to be the most repulsive person I ever met in my life -- at least one of the most repulsive persons.</span> <span id="s2420">And I think that he fell on hard times later.</span> <span id="s2421">There was nobody anymore who wanted his services, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: It’s intriguing to me how you encounter these passing acquaintances after the war is over with.</span> <span id="s2423">I want to talk to you about that later on.</span> <span id="s2424">I’m going to make a note now to remember that.</span> <span id="s2425">Whether it was just chance encounters or whether people began to seek out people that they had known by signs on bulletin boards and letters or such.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: I don’t think so, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Just chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: I never made an effort.</span> <span id="s2429">I made an effort to meet people I knew before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: For example, this fellow who was on the train with you to Auschwitz -- you said that you later saw him and he told you that all had perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: I met him absolutely by accident.</span> <span id="s2432">He might have looked me up or I might have heard that he was around and I might have made a slight effort.</span> <span id="s2433">Truthfully, I don’t remember, but it was nothing well planned so that I got to see him.</span> <span id="s2434">I know that I met somebody and this is something I’ve tried to remember many times -- not only now, but many times.</span> <span id="s2435">It was the only person, after all, whom I saw.</span> <span id="s2436">I’ve tried to remember more details about him many times, but I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2437">I absolutely cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: What happened when you got to Berlin with the other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: In Berlin, they put me into a Gestapo prison.</span> <span id="s2440">That was a part of a former Jewish hospital which was taken over by the Gestapo, and its commander was Hauftstaffelfuhrer Dobberke.</span> <span id="s2441">I remember him very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Cruelty?</span> <span id="s2443">Or arrogance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s2445">You can tell me, maybe.</span> <span id="s2446">He was average.</span> <span id="s2447">He was rough.</span> <span id="s2448">He was mean.</span> <span id="s2449">He would constantly threaten people with what he would do to them.</span> <span id="s2450">I guess he, maybe, hit some people.</span> <span id="s2451">He never hit me.</span> <span id="s2452">I wouldn’t have done anything.</span> <span id="s2453">I just remember him in front of me.</span> <span id="s2454">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Were you again in a cell with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: Well first they put me down into what was known as the bunker.</span> <span id="s2457">It was the former morgue of the hospital.</span> <span id="s2458">They took the bodies out before they put us in.</span> <span id="s2459">These were the desperate cases which they had put down there -- those who presented a danger of escaping.</span> <span id="s2460">They locked us in the cave.</span> <span id="s2461">Again, comparatively speaking, it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s2462">Everybody had a little thing -- a little cubicle, all tiled, I guess, with a sink -- a little sink.</span> <span id="s2463">Then there was a room outside the cubicle where there were some bunks, also, I remember.</span> <span id="s2464">I got one of these bunks and that was already a step forward -- if you were not locked in anymore -- into these cells.</span> <span id="s2465">I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s2466">I am trying to remember people.</span> <span id="s2467">They were not necessarily only Jews in there.</span> <span id="s2468">There were people who had run afoul of the Gestapo for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s2469">Some were quite unsavory characters, really.</span> <span id="s2470">Quite a number of these tried to play all sides.</span> <span id="s2471">There was one in there whom I remember -- he was working for the Mufti (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem had started the anti-Jewish riots in Palestine in 1936 as help to the Nazis) and he was working for some allies, too.</span> <span id="s2472">Rather unsavory characters were there.</span> <span id="s2473">Later, I think it was in November or December, I was put again in a cell, then they took quite a number of people and formed what was probably, at that time, one of the last transports to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2474">We knew that we were going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2475">I don’t think that they made a secret of it -- that it was going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2476">I think that I was still going around with my cane -- my big stick.</span> <span id="s2477">Somehow I got to Dobberke.</span> <span id="s2478">I still see him.</span> <span id="s2479">He had big blue eyes -- very much thyroid eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q: Bulging eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: Yes, bulging eyes.</span> <span id="s2482">You know, I never checked what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2483">He never did much to me.</span> <span id="s2484">I got to see him and I told him, “Listen, you can’t send me to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2485">I am a British citizen and I have notified” (how I could have done it, I really don’t know -- I repeated, as I must have thought of a way then -- I can’t think of one now) “I have notified the Swiss embassy that I am here and you can’t send me to Auschwitz!”</span> <span id="s2486">I remember that he looked at me and stared strangely, and he just turned and walked away.</span> <span id="s2487">I thought, “Well, I tried.”</span> <span id="s2488">Five minutes before the transport left, they said, “Brook, you stay -- you stay behind!”</span> <span id="s2489">How and why I don’t know up to today.</span> <span id="s2490">I don’t know what the reason was.</span> <span id="s2491">They even took me out of the bunker and they took me upstairs somewhere.</span> <span id="s2492">They had a number of rooms upstairs and they put me in a room -- alone in a room -- I remember.</span> <span id="s2493">For a while I had a room all to myself.</span> <span id="s2494">All around me there were people.</span> <span id="s2495">They had a lot of prominent Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2496">As far as I remember, there was a Kaester -- I’m not sure of the name, but he was one of the Hungarian Jewish delegates who tried to sell some Jews for trucks.</span> <span id="s2497">(Reference is made here to an attempt to ransom some Jews for army trucks which the Allies refused).</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: I know about that incident, but I don’t know the names involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: They had people like this.</span> <span id="s2500">Then I was in a large room with quite a lot of people in it.</span> <span id="s2501">There were again a great lot of Jews there.</span> <span id="s2502">He came one day and told people something we had never heard before about Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2503">He said that certain people are going to be sent to Bergen-Belsen and he assured us that Bergen-Belsen is very nice.</span> <span id="s2504">He told us, “Nothing will happen to you in Bergen-Belsen.”</span> <span id="s2505">This was a typical approach.</span> <span id="s2506">There were men and women together up there in that large room.</span> <span id="s2507">Again, I remember much less about this than I remember from downstairs in the bunker.</span> <span id="s2508">It was called the bunker.</span> <span id="s2509">I remember much more about this.</span> <span id="s2510">I don’t remember much about the big room!</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Let’s stop and I’ll pick it up at that point in our next interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">This is the fifth interview with Mr. Henry Steeber.</span> <span id="s2513">It is Tuesday, March 13th and we are in the living room of his apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: Where did you stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: At the end of the interview you had gotten to Berlin and were in a Gestapo prison.</span> <span id="s2516">It was approximately December of 1944.</span> <span id="s2517">You had talked about being in the bunker of the prison for a number of months, then a transport going to Auschwitz -- you were almost put on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: That name is spelled wrong, by the way.</span> <span id="s2519">I don’t think you will ever have the opportunity to spell Dobberke’s name, but it’s D_O_B_B_E_R_K_E, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s2520">That would be the logical German way to spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: I would spell it just the same.</span> <span id="s2522">I meant to ask you later about the correct spelling -- thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2524">Anyhow, that is the logical way to spell it in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: So, would you, in chronological order, take your experiences on down to the end of the war, the late spring, early summer of 1945, and then stop and let me ask you some questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Well, eventually, I was put on another transport from Berlin.</span> <span id="s2527">I found out that it was going to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2528">I did not object to it, since I figured that it would be the best thing which could happen to me at that time.</span> <span id="s2529">I went on the transport to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2530">I think it was in…I probably could find the exact date…January or February of 1945.</span> <span id="s2531">In Theresienstadt I managed to get myself a comfortable job, if you call it this, and even accommodations to sleep, which were comparatively not too bad for the circumstances.</span> <span id="s2532">Theresienstadt, at that time, was in a state of turmoil; very soon after I came there, it was really in a state of partial dissolution.</span> <span id="s2533">The Germans didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s2534">There were some plans to gas people in the so-called ghetto, and then there was a plan in which I was included, to take certain people which might have some value as hostages -- take them and put them somewhere in the Alps, where they wanted to make a last stand and keep them there for possible exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: Bargaining purposes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2537">There was a representative of the Red Cross who came to the camp a couple of times, Mr. Dunant (D-u-n-a-n-t).</span> <span id="s2538">He was there once, I remember, with Eichmann (that would be Adolf Eichmann) and then I saw Mueller with him once.</span> <span id="s2539">Then the time came when you really didn’t know were the SS still there or were they gone?</span> <span id="s2540">Whether the Czechs took over the camp?</span> <span id="s2541">There were a great amount of rumors.</span> <span id="s2542">Before the Russians actually came, the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s2543">What I remember was that we had a ceremony -- the raising of the Czech flag in the camp.</span> <span id="s2544">Then some of the Germans who went by shot into the ghetto -- I don’t know whether it was intentionally, but they shot into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2545">I remember that I was standing with a friend, the fellow from Chicago I was telling you about, Dr. Neuhaus.</span> <span id="s2546">We were standing, talking.</span> <span id="s2547">There were very old houses with courtyards and a lot of walls.</span> <span id="s2548">Right next to the wall, but behind it, a grenade hit -- right behind that wall where we were.</span> <span id="s2549">It was a very confusing time.</span> <span id="s2550">Also, in April, I think a great many transports arrived from outside camps (camps located further East) -- also transports of people who were picked up, maybe on marches (the forced marches to evacuation camps), but I think it was mostly from outside camps -- various camps.</span> <span id="s2551">They were brought to Theresienstadt from various camps (further East which the Russian troops were threatening).</span> <span id="s2552">There were a great number of trains coming in.</span> <span id="s2553">They contained people in very, very bad shape.</span> <span id="s2554">There were quite a few people who were dead on the trains and quite a number had to be put in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2555">Actually we had to quarantine the whole area for typhus -- an outbreak of typhus.</span> <span id="s2556">But I never knew the difference in English between typhoid fever and typhus; what is what!</span> <span id="s2557">One is from lice and the other is not from lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: I confess that I don’t know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2560">So one is transmitted by lice (that would be typhus)!</span> <span id="s2561">I guess it was the one which was transmitted by lice, for, of course, they were rampant on these people.</span> <span id="s2562">We helped out at the rail station to unload people and other tasks.</span> <span id="s2563">It was still an unpleasant time!</span> <span id="s2564">Then, one day, the last day, we were standing by the road -- there was an entrance gate and a wall around the whole thing -- it was an old garrison town with the wall -- as I said, we were standing by the gate and looking out down the road.</span> <span id="s2565">A road went right by the wall.</span> <span id="s2566">There were Germans driving down the road, I think, and maybe a hundred yards further back, the Russians came right on their heels.</span> <span id="s2567">I remember their faces when they drove by.</span> <span id="s2568">Suddenly there was cheering and jubilation.</span> <span id="s2569">They didn’t know what had happened to them, for this was all a German area.</span> <span id="s2570">It was formerly Czechoslovakia, but it was mostly the Sudeten area -- a lot of Sudeten people were still around.</span> <span id="s2571">(The Sudeten people dismembered Czechoslovakia in 1938 to “rejoin” their German land).</span> <span id="s2572">Theresienstadt was close to the border.</span> <span id="s2573">Then we were taken over by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: What date was it, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: No.</span> <span id="s2576">You will have to look it up.</span> <span id="s2577">I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2578">It was in May, some date in May.</span> <span id="s2579">I tried to get out as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s2580">First of all, I didn’t want the Russian liberation or occupation -- whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s2581">They had a strange way of showing their sympathies, as a group.</span> <span id="s2582">The Russians did all right, but you had a feeling that the whole thing was a nuisance to them.</span> <span id="s2583">That was, at best, a nuisance.</span> <span id="s2584">It was a “go away, don’t bother me” type of attitude.</span> <span id="s2585">So, I tried to get out as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s2586">I was out of Theresienstadt about two days after the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: Now let me stop there and back up and ask you some questions…</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: Theresienstadt has always intrigued me because of what seems to me, contradictions in the writing, descriptions of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2590">In many accounts, it appears, as well, not at all a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2591">You get the accounts talking about the Jewish professionals and the intellectuals, the artists who were sent to Theresienstadt and comparatively speaking, compared to those who were in Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz, Dachau, they were rather well off.</span> <span id="s2592">I hate to use that term!</span> <span id="s2593">Comparatively speaking they were rather well off.</span> <span id="s2594">Then, on the other hand, you get these sad, sad stories about the children of Theresienstadt!</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: Not only the children -- the old people, too!</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Yes, the old people of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2597">So could you cut through all of that, those contradictions and give me a really accurate description of that place!</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: No, because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2599">When I was in Theresienstadt, don’t forget, Theresienstadt was, compared to other times, half empty.</span> <span id="s2600">There was no overcrowding there anymore -- no serious overcrowding.</span> <span id="s2601">One of the terrible things in Theresienstadt, as I understand from people when I was there, was that, before I came, you had twenty people in a space for five.</span> <span id="s2602">The space which was barely enough for five people had twenty people crowded in.</span> <span id="s2603">Now, when I came to Theresienstadt, there were still a lot of places where it was too crowded.</span> <span id="s2604">They then had barracks.</span> <span id="s2605">They had built some Quonset huts -- some barrack type things in the middle of a square -- two big barracks with rows of cots, three stories high or two stories high.</span> <span id="s2606">I slept there one night and the bugs, the bedbugs were just crawling over you there.</span> <span id="s2607">It was impossible to sleep.</span> <span id="s2608">I said, “It’s not for me!</span> <span id="s2609">I don’t think I’m going to stay here.</span> <span id="s2610">If there’s any other place I’ll look around.”</span> <span id="s2611">I saw that it was a place where you could try to make changes.</span> <span id="s2612">You didn’t have this terrible regimentation, as in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2613">It’s quite true -- you didn’t!</span> <span id="s2614">It’s one thing you didn’t have (at least not then).</span> <span id="s2615">Anyhow, they put you in your “Ubikation”, as it was called -- your quarters, and then you had to go and look for work and get work and get registered at 692 stations.</span> <span id="s2616">(The term “Ubikation” cannot be verified in a German dictionary.)</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: But it was up to you to do all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2619">It was up to me to do all this.</span> <span id="s2620">But I had to do it -- but it was up to me.</span> <span id="s2621">So, there was a certain non-regimentation which you wouldn’t have had in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2622">I was able, as I mentioned some time ago, to have a fast look around and I decided that the hospital is always the most comfortable place in an area like this -- you never went wrong in a hospital.</span> <span id="s2623">If there was anything to be had at all, it was to be had at the hospital.</span> <span id="s2624">So I tried to get into the hospital.</span> <span id="s2625">I had absolutely no background for this.</span> <span id="s2626">Somehow, I don’t remember how exactly, I got into the laboratory -- the medical laboratory.</span> <span id="s2627">It was kind of a congenial place.</span> <span id="s2628">There were some nice people there.</span> <span id="s2629">I really don’t remember exactly why the laboratory and how I got there -- whether I was told to go there or not.</span> <span id="s2630">Anyway, I got there and I told them that I know something about laboratory work, which I did not.</span> <span id="s2631">I was hired -- I mean I was put there to work -- not hired.</span> <span id="s2632">The chief of the laboratory, who is the father of my friend in Chicago, I think, he knew quite well that I didn’t know the first thing.</span> <span id="s2633">He put me to do easy things, you know, urine analysis and these things which anyone can do.</span> <span id="s2634">So I learned while I went along and I was able to get out of this bug place and I had a cot or bed somewhere in the hospital, not far from the laboratory -- in a hallway, I think.</span> <span id="s2635">It may have been an extra room.</span> <span id="s2636">I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s2637">I was sleeping there.</span> <span id="s2638">It was (not) the worst!</span> <span id="s2639">I could even shower.</span> <span id="s2640">I could use the hospital shower!</span> <span id="s2641">That was something which was quite a luxury.</span> <span id="s2642">One thing, of course, you forget about it -- is the lack of food.</span> <span id="s2643">We were just about constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s2644">You never had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s2645">It was, of course, out of the question, to have enough to eat.</span> <span id="s2646">(The entire German nation was on very short rations in 1944 and 1945).</span> <span id="s2647">I managed to get some extra rations somehow.</span> <span id="s2648">I got a little bit of margarine and a little sugar, and I had a friend -- a girl friend at that time -- someone who worked in the laboratory, too.</span> <span id="s2649">The young woman -- I think she was Czech -- I don’t remember her name even (that’s terrible!)</span> <span id="s2650">-- we saved a whole week and she got something, we saved this for a whole week, and once a week, it sounds terrible, really -- we had bread -- a piece of bread with margarine and sugar on it.</span> <span id="s2651">That was the greatest delicacy for the week.</span> <span id="s2652">It was once a week.</span> <span id="s2653">Most of the time, the food was terrible.</span> <span id="s2654">We ate turnips, turnips, turnips, turnips -- that was the main (stay) -- turnips and…</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Soup?</span> <span id="s2656">Cabbage?</span> <span id="s2657">Potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: No -- not even cabbage!</span> <span id="s2659">Cabbage was good already, cabbage and potatoes -- That was a holiday meal -- cabbage and potatoes.</span> <span id="s2660">No, mostly…uh pumpkins!</span> <span id="s2661">Some type of pumpkin which was scraped.</span> <span id="s2662">I don’t know how they were prepared but they were very watery -- very watery.</span> <span id="s2663">It was feed stuff!</span> <span id="s2664">It was not fit for human consumption.</span> <span id="s2665">That was, I think one of the main problems, I think.</span> <span id="s2666">Of course, for everything you had to line up -- to stand in line for a long time -- that was unavoidable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Most of the children were gone by that time?</span> <span id="s2668">All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: The children?</span> <span id="s2671">All of the old people had been transported out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: The children and the old people?</span> <span id="s2673">There were no old people -- there were some old people, but I mean very, very few.</span> <span id="s2674">Most of them either died there or they were transported away.</span> <span id="s2675">The children?</span> <span id="s2676">There were no children.</span> <span id="s2677">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s2678">Of course you’ve read a lot about Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2679">You read that they had some rather tough times there, too; that they had some people hanged.</span> <span id="s2680">The hangings and all of this, but just Theresienstadt itself, would have been a rather bearable place if it wouldn’t have been for the transports -- especially for the overcrowding to start with, then if it wouldn’t have been for the transports later to empty the place.</span> <span id="s2681">If you were in Theresienstadt at a time when it was not overcrowded and if you didn’t leave on the transports, you had a very good chance to survive -- if you wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s2682">I still think that the wanting to survive was the most important point -- the most important criteria for survival.</span> <span id="s2683">There were too many people who just let themselves go.</span> <span id="s2684">Now there were other camps where the will for survival was not enough.</span> <span id="s2685">If you got hit on the head enough times, you’re not going to survive if you want to or not.</span> <span id="s2686">So in that way, Theresienstadt, I suppose, was preferable to any other place.</span> <span id="s2687">I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: Did you run into many old acquaintances in Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s2689">Did you contact anyone from the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: One, yes, yes…again, I know that it must have been just at the time.</span> <span id="s2691">Still in Theresienstadt -- this is interesting -- I was thinking one day something was said about Roosevelt who was still alive.</span> <span id="s2692">He had spoken in Yalta or some place and I remember thinking, “Well, he is going to see the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2693">I’m not.</span> <span id="s2694">I don’t think I’m going to see it!”</span> <span id="s2695">Well, two days later, he was dead --he was dead and I did see the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2696">Just around this time, I met a fellow from Berlin, I knew.</span> <span id="s2697">He was the brother of a friend of our family.</span> <span id="s2698">Our friend was a Dr. Eisenberg and this was his brother, which we did not know all that well.</span> <span id="s2699">He is the one who told me, but I don’t know how he knew it, that I was lucky that I got out in time from Berlin when I did, for the Gestapo looked very actively for me later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: The administration of the camp at this period -- you said it was in somewhat of a disarray or chaos</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: I don’t think the administration was so much.</span> <span id="s2702">You see, there were two administrations.</span> <span id="s2703">One was the Jewish administration and one was the German one.</span> <span id="s2704">But the Germans didn’t know really whether they were coming of going.</span> <span id="s2705">They started to have mixed feelings quite early during my stay there.</span> <span id="s2706">I would think that the Jewish administration really functioned to the end.</span> <span id="s2707">(The Germans knew that they were losing the war and that they would be personally held responsible for atrocities – but they received messages telling them to finish off all the Jews).</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: That was what I was going to get around to asking you.</span> <span id="s2709">Did you mean also that the Jewish administration was in disarray?</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2711">I think they functioned quite well to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: Did you, outside of the hospital, did you have any contact with the higher Jewish officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: No.</span> <span id="s2714">Absolutely, no.</span> <span id="s2715">I didn’t meet anybody.</span> <span id="s2716">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s2717">I had really no interest in it whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2718">All I was interested in was getting out of it as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s2719">No, I wasn’t interested in getting to meet anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Now, there’s a large question I want to ask you and I hope you won’t take this in a way that I don’t mean it.</span> <span id="s2721">I would like to ask it before we go on, because, in effect now, with May of 1945, you have survived.</span> <span id="s2722">Now all through these interviews you’ve told me in a very effective way the chronology of what’s happened, but I have the feeling that you really haven’t revealed very much about your attitudes, your emotions, the impact that these events had on you.</span> <span id="s2723">You never have told me that you had moments of despair.</span> <span id="s2724">Did you have moments when you thought all was lost?</span> <span id="s2725">When you thought perhaps it wasn’t worth making an effort to go on?</span> <span id="s2726">Did you have moments of great fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2728">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s2729">Fear was there.</span> <span id="s2730">I would lie to you if I would say that I can recall all the emotions I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: I understand that you cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: I cannot!</span> <span id="s2733">Fear was very strong.</span> <span id="s2734">Of course, it was endemic.</span> <span id="s2735">It was always there.</span> <span id="s2736">Despair?</span> <span id="s2737">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2738">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2739">It’s very hard for me to recall my emotions today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Now, I understand – I realize it’s a difficult question, but I am just wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: But, of course, there was fear.</span> <span id="s2742">Of course, there was fear constantly.</span> <span id="s2743">Do you think that when I jumped out of the train, I wasn’t afraid?</span> <span id="s2744">Of course, I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Well, you were a very brave person.</span> <span id="s2746">Sometimes brave people don’t have fear -- sometimes they live with it constantly.</span> <span id="s2747">I just wondered which it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">A: I think I am a person and I think I was a person.</span> <span id="s2749">I will put it in the past.</span> <span id="s2750">I was a person who had many fears and didn’t let the fears interfere with what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2751">I think I overcame many of the fears.</span> <span id="s2752">Maybe I peed in my pants doing it (laughing), but I did it!</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Also, there’s an aspect to this risk taking: the willingness to take risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: There is no risk!</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Well, there are risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: There is no risk!</span> <span id="s2757">You see, this is one thing which I know -- jumping out of the train -- if you face what I felt was certain death at the other end of the line, I didn’t find jumping out of the train requires any courage.</span> <span id="s2758">It’s the lesser of the evils.</span> <span id="s2759">What have I got to lose?</span> <span id="s2760">I know that there are people who are not able to do this -- who will go and rather be killed and not be able to act -- even act their conviction that they’re going to be killed and that it’s better to take a risk before.</span> <span id="s2761">I know that.</span> <span id="s2762">But I never was that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: Well that was my question.</span> <span id="s2764">Were you never that way or did the willingness to take risks grow on you so that it became almost second nature to you as you look back now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s2766">Probably, you’re quite right.</span> <span id="s2767">Probably it grew on me, for I know there was a time -- I don’t know how it came about -- I was thinking about jumping out of a plane with a parachute -- the idea didn’t phase me at all.</span> <span id="s2768">I wouldn’t have minded it at all -- it wouldn’t have bothered me at all.</span> <span id="s2769">Now, I think I would have to have my head examined if I would jump out with a parachute.</span> <span id="s2770">I wouldn’t jump out for anything.</span> <span id="s2771">I wouldn’t jump out -- I wouldn’t make a parachute jump -- it would be crazy.</span> <span id="s2772">At that time, I wouldn’t have minded one way or another.</span> <span id="s2773">I would have jumped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Well, of course, I think it must be said, generally speaking, that youth is less cautious.</span> <span id="s2775">And you were young and I think that was in your favor greatly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: Well, I think I wouldn’t have jumped before and I wouldn’t have jumped after, right after.</span> <span id="s2777">In remember the very thought when it was over.</span> <span id="s2778">I would think, “It’s crazy!”</span> <span id="s2779">I wouldn’t jump out of an airplane now.</span> <span id="s2780">I don’t think I could.</span> <span id="s2781">I would be deadly afraid.</span> <span id="s2782">Then, I would have been afraid, too, but it wouldn’t have bothered me.</span> <span id="s2783">The state of mind is different -- it’s completely different.</span> <span id="s2784">Values, of course, are completely different.</span> <span id="s2785">Human life is different.</span> <span id="s2786">I tell you that it is not nice to say that a human life was unimportant or less important, not only for the enemies, it was less important for us, too.</span> <span id="s2787">I don’t think that you can expect, in a camp, very many cases of self-sacrifice, that is, somebody sacrificing himself or herself to save somebody else.</span> <span id="s2788">You become very, very selfish and I think you had to be selfish to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: Well, I would tend to agree with that.</span> <span id="s2790">I’m also curious about these long months -- these weeks and months that you spent in the hospital and in prison.</span> <span id="s2791">What did you do to while away the time?</span> <span id="s2792">What did you do to keep yourself occupied?</span> <span id="s2793">Was there just constant conversation with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: In the hospital?</span> <span id="s2795">Oh, in Hungary, you mean.</span> <span id="s2796">In Hungary in the prison, oh…there was….</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: And in the Gestapo prison in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s2799">I never was alone.</span> <span id="s2800">We probably played -- we played cards.</span> <span id="s2801">And I remember that I learned a new card game in the prison in Csorgo.</span> <span id="s2802">After I came out of the hospital and got into prison, before I went on the transport to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2803">I learned a new card game there.</span> <span id="s2804">I haven’t the remotest idea what it was, but I learned a new card game.</span> <span id="s2805">Yes, we played cards and talked a lot.</span> <span id="s2806">It was not that terrible.</span> <span id="s2807">Even in Pankraz, the chap I didn’t have much in common with…I remember there was a young Czech in there, a political prisoner, a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s2808">We talked.</span> <span id="s2809">There was nothing to read, I remember, but somehow I don’t think I remember that there really was not enough to eat to be too much concerned with activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Just a general malaise?</span> <span id="s2811">Lack of energy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Yes, I think so!</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: Let me stop this tape.</span> <span id="s2814">It’s almost run out…and I will put a new one on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">(Tape 4, Side1) This is the fifth interview with Mr. Steeber, on March 13, 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">Oh, I had one other question on my mind.</span> <span id="s2817">I can’t recall what it was.</span> <span id="s2818">I really wanted to ask it.</span> <span id="s2819">It had to do with the imprisonment in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2820">You said that there were a number of unsavory characters in that prison, some double, triple agents, such as someone working with the Mufti.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: That was according to him.</span> <span id="s2822">There were many people who would tell any story at all.</span> <span id="s2823">Number one, to attract some attention.</span> <span id="s2824">Number two, to maybe create some suspicion, or some ideas, or some doubts in the German’s mind about them.</span> <span id="s2825">Many did this, too.</span> <span id="s2826">“Maybe he shouldn’t be in here?</span> <span id="s2827">Maybe he can be used.”</span> <span id="s2828">Then, there were some people, unfortunately…they were not all Jews in there--- there was a mixture -- who thought…”Maybe he can be used to our advantage?’</span> <span id="s2829">Some people would let themselves be used to the German’s advantage, such as, they would make a broadcast, they would do something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: Did you ever have any indication that there were what we would call “plants” among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: No.</span> <span id="s2832">There was no need for that.</span> <span id="s2833">Everybody was there.</span> <span id="s2834">I mean, nobody really denied being there, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s2835">If anything, they would add to the so-called interest of their case.</span> <span id="s2836">Everybody knew why I was there.</span> <span id="s2837">For the Jews who were there, there was no need to have a plant.</span> <span id="s2838">For the Jews, what they said or didn’t say, wouldn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s2839">They took them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2840">The others, maybe there were some about whom they were not sure, but I don’t think so…maybe, but I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2841">I never thought about this, truthfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: Were there any, what I would characterize as ruffians, really, ruffians that one must be in fear of in this Gestapo prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: No!</span> <span id="s2844">Absolutely not!</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: No problems of prisoner against prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: No.</span> <span id="s2847">There was nobody there, really, who was a ruffian.</span> <span id="s2848">They were all quite well behaved people.</span> <span id="s2849">Some more so than others.</span> <span id="s2850">There was nothing like having to be scared of each other.</span> <span id="s2851">Is that the right way of putting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: No prison in Europe was that way: I have been a prisoner in Berlin, I have been a prisoner in Prague, I’ve been a prisoner in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: In Csorgo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: No, the prisons were not set up this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: A different age and a different area?</span> <span id="s2857">Different standards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: Yes, completely.</span> <span id="s2859">You know, you were not in prison for anything you had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s2861">I’m asking these questions out of my own ignorance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: I think that I met more rough people, maybe on the transport, such as when I was on the transport from Prague to Berlin or the one to Prague -- especially the one from Prague to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2863">In this prison transport, there was a few days, maybe, when it was rough, but it was such a mixture of people.</span> <span id="s2864">There were Russian prisoners and French prisoners -- a lot of Russian prisoners and political prisoners.</span> <span id="s2865">I don’t really have any idea what the people did or why they were on these transports.</span> <span id="s2866">There was a rather good camaraderie among the people.</span> <span id="s2867">There really was no tough play or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: Now, another intangible question.</span> <span id="s2869">In retrospect, you say that surviving in part meant looking out for yourself and not worrying about anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Would you say that was true at the beginning, back in ’37, ’38, ’39, ’40, or that that grew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: No.</span> <span id="s2873">In ’37, ’38 you led a fairly normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Well, even after the war started, let’s say late ’39, ’40 -- what I’m saying…what I’m asking is, did this, and I don’t want to use the word selfishness, appear?</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: Why not use the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Because it implies something else than what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: Well we were.</span> <span id="s2878">We really were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: But was there a growing selfishness?</span> <span id="s2880">Did it exist from the beginning?</span> <span id="s2881">Did it grow?</span> <span id="s2882">Or was it not there?</span> <span id="s2883">Now in a sense, you may not realize it, but you are contradicting yourself, because in an earlier interview I asked you about looking out for yourself and being concerned about others and you replied that always everyone had the concern of others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: I said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2886">You were talking about your days in Berlin and Vienna when you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s2887">You may think I am being mean to you as far as this question goes…</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: No!</span> <span id="s2889">I don’t have any recollection of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: Well, I think it related particularly to your hiding in Vienna, and people taking other people in.</span> <span id="s2891">You were talking about the lady who let you live in the apartment in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s2893">These are two different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: Well, now, that’s what I can’t separate from my mind.</span> <span id="s2895">She was taking a risk for you.</span> <span id="s2896">She was not looking out for herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Ah, that was a different thing.</span> <span id="s2898">I’m talking right now about Jew against Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Oh, well, I’m talking about people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: Now, these are two different things.</span> <span id="s2901">I am talking right now of a camp situation -- not living in society, where interaction was fairly normal, as it is today.</span> <span id="s2902">I mean you saw people -- if somebody needed some money and you had some money, you gave them some money.</span> <span id="s2903">You helped them.</span> <span id="s2904">That was what I’m talking about, but when your life is in question…I am talking about, not the social amenities which were in a camp, but that if you had food or you were able to get some extra food, you would not share it with somebody else.</span> <span id="s2905">You would eat it yourself.</span> <span id="s2906">There is nothing wrong with sharing it with someone else, but your first responsibility is to yourself.</span> <span id="s2907">But my point in asking this is whether that interest in oneself existed from very early or whether it grew with the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">The situations were not comparable.</span> <span id="s2909">You cannot compare a prison or camp situation with a situation outside in freedom.</span> <span id="s2910">These are two completely different things.</span> <span id="s2911">If you were outside, there were selfish people and unselfish people.</span> <span id="s2912">In camp, there were mostly selfish people, and if somebody was not selfish, he didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s2913">I was on a transport and when I jumped out of the train, I jumped out of the train well knowing that maybe my jumping out of the train may cost the life of somebody else.</span> <span id="s2914">That’s what I’m talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2916">Did you witness any selfless acts in prison, in the hospital, in transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">A: No.</span> <span id="s2918">There really were none.</span> <span id="s2919">I can’t say that there was any such situation.</span> <span id="s2920">There was no catastrophe somewhere where somebody jumps into the flames to save a burning child.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: I am talking about the kinds of acts that one reads about in connection, for example, with the Polish doctor who headed the orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2922">When, for example, the children who were his wards were rounded up to go to Auschwitz, he went with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">A: Well, I have to tell you, no.</span> <span id="s2924">I never noticed anything like this.</span> <span id="s2925">I never witnessed anything like this.</span> <span id="s2926">These things happen -- I would honor these people as much as possible.</span> <span id="s2927">I hope Israel or another country can do or did this either during their lives or posthumously.</span> <span id="s2928">But these were, unfortunately, very, very rare occasions.</span> <span id="s2929">To witness something like that would have been rather like winning the Irish Sweepstakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Another thing that intrigues me: now, I’m going to change the subject since I’ve probed enough on that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: I like to think about it.</span> <span id="s2932">I like to think back about it, but sometimes my mind is not very clear on many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: The reputation of the various camps…you seem to have known what Auschwitz meant, what Treblinka might have meant, what Bergen-Belsen was.</span> <span id="s2934">You seemed to know that Theresienstadt was a little bit better…now how did this word get around?</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2936">I knew what Auschwitz meant when I left Hungary.</span> <span id="s2937">I did not hear about Bergen-Belsen until I was in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2938">This, I remember very well.</span> <span id="s2939">In the Gestapo prison since Dobberke came to some people and said they are going to Bergen-Belsen and that it was a very nice place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: Well, what about Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s2941">You seem to have known before you went to Theresienstadt that that was a safer place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2943">I heard about things -- you talk to people.</span> <span id="s2944">I don’t know exactly how.</span> <span id="s2945">Theresienstadt was publicized, of course.</span> <span id="s2946">The Germans made a point of publicizing Theresienstadt, too, so that might be it, but exactly how we knew about everything…I’m sure that we learned about it somehow -- I just don’t remember how.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Now let’s come to the point where I started interrupting and that is the Russian liberation of Theresienstadt and your determination to get away as soon as you possibly could -- two days after liberation.</span> <span id="s2948">Now, could you begin to recount the details of that?</span> <span id="s2949">Do you want to go on a little longer or are you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: I am fine.</span> <span id="s2951">As I said, the Russian liberation was a mixed thing -- we were very, very happy, of course, that they came and we were very grateful, etc., but it was the kind of a let down, I think, more than anything else.</span> <span id="s2952">I think they had a somewhat of a “so-what” attitude, and as I say, they considered us kind of a nuisance.</span> <span id="s2953">“Keep away.</span> <span id="s2954">Keep away.”</span> <span id="s2955">And of course, it was the beginning.</span> <span id="s2956">The Russians were not any worse, as it turned out later, than the Americans were.</span> <span id="s2957">I mean, many of the American generals regarded these camps as breeding places of crime and vermins and diseases, and they would have liked nothing better than to bomb them out of existence.</span> <span id="s2958">Now I agree that these places were not pleasant and they must have been quite a nuisance in the ordered lives of the military.</span> <span id="s2959">But it was the liberation and the post war world were a let down and a disappointment – I don’t think only to me.</span> <span id="s2960">We hear it from other people too.</span> <span id="s2961">I got on a truck with a number of Czechs.</span> <span id="s2962">The Czechs were the first allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s2963">I was not really allowed to leave, but I got myself a Red Cross paper from Theresienstadt and I got a release from the hospital, from Dr. Neuhaus, that he didn’t need me anymore -- this you had to have or you were not allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s2964">And we went to Prague -- there was still shooting all around when you drove down the road that there were still little nests of Germans around.</span> <span id="s2965">I went to Prague and got to the railroad station and wanted to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2966">I didn’t have anywhere else to go at that time.</span> <span id="s2967">Berlin was impossible!</span> <span id="s2968">There had not been a train yet.</span> <span id="s2969">The place was full with partisans who told in detail how they hung the Gestapo by the feet and burned them.</span> <span id="s2970">I had a paper from Theresienstadt, on the other hand, and I made a point of it since I was supposed to be English, so I spoke German with a heavy English accent.</span> <span id="s2971">I thought, ‘If I speak one clear word of German, I’ll be in the soup.”</span> <span id="s2972">They spoke German to me after they found out that they couldn’t speak English to me.</span> <span id="s2973">I spoke English to them.</span> <span id="s2974">They didn’t understand English, so finally, I said, “Sprechen Sie Deutsch?”</span> <span id="s2975">or “Sprichst Du Deutsch?’</span> <span id="s2976">(Do you speak German?)</span> <span id="s2977">They said, “Oh, ein bischen” (a little), and since they wanted to talk to me, we spoke in German.</span> <span id="s2978">It must have been a terrible effort for them, you know.</span> <span id="s2979">I told myself, “If I speak one correct word of German, they’re going to hang me up by the feet.”</span> <span id="s2980">So after a while, there was a group of former English prisoners from camp.</span> <span id="s2981">I joined them.</span> <span id="s2982">I felt a little bit more at ease, at that time, with them.</span> <span id="s2983">Then, the first train came.</span> <span id="s2984">That first train went to a place called Ceske Budejovice.</span> <span id="s2985">It was more or less in the direction I wanted to go, so I got on the train and we went there.</span> <span id="s2986">It took a long time to go there.</span> <span id="s2987">I got there with a family.</span> <span id="s2988">They started to set up a lot of committees and still the Germans were around there.</span> <span id="s2989">They were still shooting around.</span> <span id="s2990">The committees were the start of local government.</span> <span id="s2991">You know, there was no government.</span> <span id="s2992">Everything started during the first couple of days.</span> <span id="s2993">I went to one of these committees and they received me very, very nicely and put me up with a family.</span> <span id="s2994">I got fed much better than I had been fed in a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: Was this a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2997">There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s2998">There were no Jews left in the provinces.</span> <span id="s2999">I mean not one.</span> <span id="s3000">The Germans had seen to that.</span> <span id="s3001">Eventually, I wanted to get on.</span> <span id="s3002">I had nothing to do in Ceske Budejovice.</span> <span id="s3003">My host found for me a convoy of Russian trucks going somewhere near Vienna, not even in Vienna, but near Vienna.</span> <span id="s3004">I went with them and I got into one of the trucks and they took me along.</span> <span id="s3005">Now, also, our communications, of course, were somewhat difficult at times, but they spoke a little German.</span> <span id="s3006">They had a whole lot of German spam-type stuff in the back of the truck -- and jams -- the horrible artificial jam they had -- that, and wine -- barrels of wine.</span> <span id="s3007">The wine was too sour for them, so they put sugar into it -- lots of sugar.</span> <span id="s3008">I weighed about 100 pounds or 110 pounds I think, at that time, when I got out of Theresienstadt, so I didn’t look so good.</span> <span id="s3009">I was sitting there and they were good hearted people and they came to me with food -- big pieces of bread with big slices of spam in it; there was bread with marmalade and spam and the jam and big slices of bread with wine and the sugar and they gave it to me and said, “Ess!</span> <span id="s3010">Ess!</span> <span id="s3011">Ess!</span> <span id="s3012">Drink!”</span> <span id="s3013">(Eat!</span> <span id="s3014">Eat!</span> <span id="s3015">Eat1 Drink!)</span> <span id="s3016">They really stuffed it into me.</span> <span id="s3017">I was lying in the front of that cab and I thought I was going to die…I thought, “I had survived this whole sad mess, and now I’m going to die in the front of a Russian cab of a Russian truck.”</span> <span id="s3018">I felt like dying -- I felt terrible -- I was very, very sick for a long time.</span> <span id="s3019">Eventually, we got to the outskirts of Vienna.</span> <span id="s3020">They were going on and I had to find some alternate way of transportation.</span> <span id="s3021">I got off the truck and we parted very lovingly, and before I know it, I was picked up by another, less loving truck, again with Russians.</span> <span id="s3022">They were picking up people who came from camps and from forced labor camps, and everybody they could, to take them to one of their camps.</span> <span id="s3023">And from there, they were going to take them to Russia.</span> <span id="s3024">I was in that truck!</span> <span id="s3025">I thought, “No, I don’t like that at all.</span> <span id="s3026">I’m not going to go!”</span> <span id="s3027">I told the people that I was English.</span> <span id="s3028">That didn’t impress them at all.</span> <span id="s3029">Finally we drove on.</span> <span id="s3030">I was on the outside of the truck.</span> <span id="s3031">It was a pickup truck -- a panel truck.</span> <span id="s3032">I was on the outside, standing there when we drove by a building on the outskirts of Vienna, with a big English flag, the Union Jack, hanging down.</span> <span id="s3033">I saw that Union Jack and I told that driver, “That’s my building!”</span> <span id="s3034">Then, I jumped off the truck and I ran towards the Union Jack, but the building was locked.</span> <span id="s3035">In the meantime, he didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s3036">He probably contemplated that either he could shoot me or he could get me back or just drive on.</span> <span id="s3037">It was easier, I suppose, to just drive on.</span> <span id="s3038">So, he drove on, and I was standing there.</span> <span id="s3039">There was a fellow near the house there, and I don’t know what connection he had with England.</span> <span id="s3040">I don’t remember!</span> <span id="s3041">I think his wife was English or something, but it was a very good house to find, for he had an apartment there and he wanted somehow to get it protected from the Russians, of course.</span> <span id="s3042">He had a woman living in there with a husband at the German front, a German, you know!</span> <span id="s3043">The Russians were in the building, too.</span> <span id="s3044">They had some apartments.</span> <span id="s3045">He wanted to have the house protected.</span> <span id="s3046">Now, he thought, “An English fellow, that’s beautiful!</span> <span id="s3047">He’s going to protect my apartment!”</span> <span id="s3048">So he gave me the apartment.</span> <span id="s3049">So I moved in.</span> <span id="s3050">The trouble was that the day after I moved on, I got dysentery.</span> <span id="s3051">I had dysentery in the worst way.</span> <span id="s3052">I was sick like a dog and they had to take me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s3053">I think that was the closest call I had in the whole time -- the dysentery, that was, after I came back!</span> <span id="s3054">I got out of the hospital and went back to the apartment.</span> <span id="s3055">What I really did then, it’s not very clear to me.</span> <span id="s3056">I raised some money, I know this but how, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3057">I have not very many recollections of exactly what I did for it.</span> <span id="s3058">I know that I wanted to go to London.</span> <span id="s3059">This was my next step -- I wanted to go to England.</span> <span id="s3060">I had an uncle there -- my mother’s brother, and there was absolutely no connection of mail or telephone -- that didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s3061">There were no connections whatsoever.</span> <span id="s3062">There was complete breakdown of everything after the war.</span> <span id="s3063">Besides Vienna was completely Russian occupied and they stole everything which wasn’t nailed down, and it was not the most healthy place to be -- not the most pleasant place.</span> <span id="s3064">I mean, there was absolutely nothing to eat, absolutely nothing in town.</span> <span id="s3065">If they didn’t buy on the black market the people really were starving in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3066">There were a couple of episodes -- later it was denied -- but I know it happened -- where human flesh was being eaten.</span> <span id="s3067">It was a very, very bad--- extremely bad time.</span> <span id="s3068">People were living on 700 calories or something like that.</span> <span id="s3069">It was the normal diet.</span> <span id="s3070">That is not very much to live on -- particularly if you worked.</span> <span id="s3071">Anyway, I wanted to get out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s3072">I ran, somehow into a fellow from South Africa, either a Dutchman or a German (I don’t recall what he was) -- but he had a South African passport.</span> <span id="s3073">He had a British passport.</span> <span id="s3074">His name was Hans Heinrich Kristoph von Giser.</span> <span id="s3075">He, I am quite sure, had been a collaborator.</span> <span id="s3076">Probably a Nazi and a collaborator.</span> <span id="s3077">However, we got along quite well and we were of help to each other up to a certain point.</span> <span id="s3078">He had a British passport, which was impressive to a lot of people, and I had concentration camp papers, which was impressive to another set of people.</span> <span id="s3079">So we complemented each other pretty well…So to get to England, the closest place where there was no Russian occupation, since you couldn’t get over the line to Linz -- it was just impossible to get over there…but you could get to Prague and from Prague you could get to Pilsen and Pilsen was American.</span> <span id="s3080">So we went to Prague and stayed in Prague for a few days until we got a permit.</span> <span id="s3081">The line was just being established.</span> <span id="s3082">The Americans were just moving into Pilsen then.</span> <span id="s3083">In Pilsen, we went to the British consulate.</span> <span id="s3084">It was established the very day we got there, or the day before.</span> <span id="s3085">The consul had not the remotest idea about what to do.</span> <span id="s3086">He couldn’t find his bathroom yet!</span> <span id="s3087">We approached him.</span> <span id="s3088">We wanted to go to London and I told him, of course, that I was English, too -- I was Henry Brook, still.</span> <span id="s3089">He was most impressed.</span> <span id="s3090">He didn’t know what to do!</span> <span id="s3091">He didn’t know what was front or what was back.</span> <span id="s3092">He gave us a paper to get on a military transport to London.</span> <span id="s3093">So we went to what was the airport then, and went -- got on a military transport to London.</span> <span id="s3094">I think the plane was a DC-3.</span> <span id="s3095">(The following description makes the plane appear more like a Piper Cub).</span> <span id="s3096">It was a small plane with bucket seats along the sides and windows with the kind of rubber stoppers in them which always fell out.</span> <span id="s3097">It was miserably cold in that plane.</span> <span id="s3098">It had no heat!</span> <span id="s3099">We went to England in a very, very rough flight.</span> <span id="s3100">I was sick like a dog, I remember.</span> <span id="s3101">It was very rough!</span> <span id="s3102">When we came down, I couldn’t hear a thing.</span> <span id="s3103">They had not pressurized the plane, of course.</span> <span id="s3104">We got to immigration, and I made a mistake there.</span> <span id="s3105">I still maintained that I was Henry Brook.</span> <span id="s3106">I should have known that I couldn’t keep it up there -- I mean, that it was nonsense to keep it up in England, I mean.</span> <span id="s3107">They can find out easily enough…Well, Hans Heinrich Kristoph von Giser was taken somewhere – I don’t know where they took him.</span> <span id="s3108">I never saw him again!</span> <span id="s3109">I was taken to another internment camp in Wimbledon.</span> <span id="s3110">It was a nice place.</span> <span id="s3111">We had movies twice a week and we played poker and we got a lot of tea -- not much to eat, but a lot of tea.</span> <span id="s3112">It wasn’t a bad place!</span> <span id="s3113">(The English also were on short rations in 1945).</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: After all you’d been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: Then, the immigration people came – the Scotland Yard people (it is most doubtful that Scotland Yard had anything to do with HS’s papers).</span> <span id="s3116">I don’t know which branch or who interrogated me.</span> <span id="s3117">They made a big deal out of the fact that I came in as Henry Brook.</span> <span id="s3118">“Why did I say I was Henry Brook?”</span> <span id="s3119">And “How did I know Henry Brook?”</span> <span id="s3120">and I said, “I don’t know Henry Brook.</span> <span id="s3121">I made him up,” and they said, “It is not true that you made it up.”</span> <span id="s3122">I said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s3123">They said, “There’s a Henry Brook with your birth date right here in London.’</span> <span id="s3124">Then they asked me: “Did you make broadcasts for the Germans?</span> <span id="s3125">Did you do this?</span> <span id="s3126">Did you do this?”</span> <span id="s3127">You know, they didn’t trust me for one moment.</span> <span id="s3128">The upshot was that they took me to the airport and they put me on a plane and they sent me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: So you were in England for how long?</span> <span id="s3130">About a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">A: No, longer than that.</span> <span id="s3132">I would say maybe three weeks, or two weeks.</span> <span id="s3133">My uncle couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s3134">You see, my uncle was never naturalized.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: Had you been able to contact him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: No, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Q: He didn’t know you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: I guess that he knew that I was there.</span> <span id="s3139">I gave his name and address to the people.</span> <span id="s3140">I gave his last address and his name, so I guess they did contact him.</span> <span id="s3141">Exactly whatever happened, I never found out, because before I got back to England, my uncle died.</span> <span id="s3142">So they took me to a plane and they deported me.</span> <span id="s3143">They said that they would send me to Brussels and the bastards sent me to Prague.</span> <span id="s3144">In Prague, because somebody deported from England can’t be any good, I was arrested by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s3145">It’s so ridiculous when you think back to it -- when you think back to the whole thing!</span> <span id="s3146">I was put in a Czech camp.</span> <span id="s3147">I was rubbing shoulders or whatever you rub in camps, with Germans -- with honest to goodness Nazis!</span> <span id="s3148">I didn’t like this at all and I made a big scene.</span> <span id="s3149">They separated me then somewhat and I got somewhat better treatment.</span> <span id="s3150">I don’t know how or why, but I wasn’t there very long.</span> <span id="s3151">It still must have been two weeks, three weeks or four weeks.</span> <span id="s3152">There was an Austrian repatriation commission which came, and eventually, I was able -- I became Heinz Stieber again at that point or I had become it already, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3153">I’ll have to look up the papers.</span> <span id="s3154">I have to look at what point I became Heinz Stieber.</span> <span id="s3155">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3156">In the repatriation commission, I got to talk to a communist recruiter.</span> <span id="s3157">No, there were two who wanted to know whether I was a communist, and I assured them that I was not, and they lost interest in me!</span> <span id="s3158">Then the repatriation group came and then I got back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s3159">When I did get back to Vienna, it was 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: The repatriation committee…you told them the story of how you had been getting around.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: They believed you this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: Well, I had all the papers.</span> <span id="s3164">It wasn’t hard to prove my identity as Heinz Stieber.</span> <span id="s3165">It wasn’t hard to prove!</span> <span id="s3166">There was Israelitische Kultursgemeinde (The Jewish Culture Committee)…there was the City hall with the papers.</span> <span id="s3167">I was there.</span> <span id="s3168">There was no problem proving it.</span> <span id="s3169">It was a little hard to prove that I was Henry Brook, but Heinz Stieber was not hard to prove.</span> <span id="s3170">I was born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3171">Especially if you were born in Vienna, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s3172">The people who were not born in Vienna -- they had problems.</span> <span id="s3173">The people who were born in Bruck an der Leitha, or other hinterlands -- they had a problem.</span> <span id="s3174">So I got back to Vienna and I got a job.</span> <span id="s3175">It must have been just after the Americans.</span> <span id="s3176">The Americans came very shortly after the Russians.</span> <span id="s3177">Vienna was split into four zones at that time, or shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s3178">Anyhow, I became storekeeper in an officers’ mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">Q: British or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">A: American.</span> <span id="s3181">The British had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s3182">The American was much better.</span> <span id="s3183">And I was there for I don’t know how long -- I don’t remember the timetable exactly.</span> <span id="s3184">Later, I took a job as a manager of an officers’ mess -- a different one.</span> <span id="s3185">Being the manager of an officer’s mess was a good job mainly because the American officers were very poor poker players and I was a good poker player, so the income was fairly regular there.</span> <span id="s3186">That was our main occupation -- playing poker.</span> <span id="s3187">I had a fairly regular income from the poker game in dollars.</span> <span id="s3188">It was script, probably.</span> <span id="s3189">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3190">I don’t think it was dollars -- it was probably script -- but it was still enough to get something from the PX.</span> <span id="s3191">(Americans generally did not care how much they lost at the poker table since black market money from cigarettes, etc. was plentiful and you could not ship it stateside without finding a loser who would attest that he lost the money).</span> <span id="s3192">And whatever we got from the PX was good money -- that means, it was good money, if sold in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Had you been trying to re-establish contact with old Viennese friends of the family or had you already found them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: I tell you that there was nobody left.</span> <span id="s3195">Not a soul left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">Q: But you did actively seek to find them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s3198">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s3199">Well, I tell you, yes, I did!</span> <span id="s3200">However, how active I really was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3201">I don’t think that I had, at that time, a great desire, strangely enough, to find other people.</span> <span id="s3202">I have the feeling that I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3203">I was so busy with walking out of my room and out of my building, just to feel that I could walk out whenever I wanted to.</span> <span id="s3204">I just would walk out and go around the block and come back and then I would walk out again and go around, walk around the block and come back just because of the feeling.</span> <span id="s3205">It was the greatest thing for me that I could walk out anytime I wanted to.</span> <span id="s3206">That I could go out in the street anytime I wanted.</span> <span id="s3207">I don’t really know whether I was looking forward awfully much to finding and therefore to trying too much to find somebody.</span> <span id="s3208">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: I think we should probably stop at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: OK!</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">Q: Interview with Mr. Henry Steeber.</span> <span id="s3212">It is Friday, March the 16th (1979) and we’re in the living room of his apartment.</span> <span id="s3213">Mr. Steeber, at the end of the last tape you were talking about your work in the -- what would you call it -- commissary?</span> <span id="s3214">Dining room?</span> <span id="s3215">In the American mess?</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s3217">That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: I got you off the subject after that and was asking you about your attempt to locate friends and family after the war was over, and you had said that, yes, you did try, that you don’t know now how actively you tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: Well, I tried, of course.</span> <span id="s3220">I tried to see whether I would hear anything from my parents -- I never thought that I would.</span> <span id="s3221">From what I knew from Riga (this was an “extermination camp”, notoriously so), about the first transport to Riga by that time, somehow, we knew that none of these people survived -- really, the people who got in January ’42 to Riga…My grandmother went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s3222">While I was in Theresienstadt I never could find any record of her and so…I had some relatives in Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s3223">I got into contact with them.</span> <span id="s3224">My uncle in England, of course -- he had had a hard time.</span> <span id="s3225">It really was a sad, sad thing, because before the war, he had a fairly good position.</span> <span id="s3226">I think that it was a mistake that he never became a British citizen or a British subject, whatever you can become (however, it was not easy).</span> <span id="s3227">It was more advantageous I think, for taxes, at that time.</span> <span id="s3228">He was interned during the war for a good part of the war.</span> <span id="s3229">After the war, he never was able to re-establish himself, really.</span> <span id="s3230">He lived on a very reduced income and I think he talked himself into being an old man.</span> <span id="s3231">He always had the habit of considering himself an old man, when he was 25.</span> <span id="s3232">So he talked himself into aging rapidly, I think, and this is what he did.</span> <span id="s3233">He developed, suddenly, some kind of muscle illness -- nobody knew, really, at that time, what it was.</span> <span id="s3234">I don’t know today what it was either.</span> <span id="s3235">Some muscles were diseased and malfunctioned in his legs or in one leg.</span> <span id="s3236">Anyhow, he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s3237">It was very hard for him to walk and he couldn’t walk after a while, at all, I think.</span> <span id="s3238">Then they put him in a hospital and he contracted pneumonia and he died.</span> <span id="s3239">So that was the last blood relative I had in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: Did his wife survive him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s3242">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Did you try to contact her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: We did not have a great lot of admiration for one another.</span> <span id="s3245">We always thought that she was quite smitten with Hitler for a while.</span> <span id="s3246">She was a Christian.</span> <span id="s3247">Of course, as you can see in the beginning, that was the fault of my family who looked down on her when they were married.</span> <span id="s3248">So, I don’t think she ever could quite forget that, either, so it was an element of utter dislike.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">Q: Well, I remember that you said that, at one point in your travels, you had gone to her family for refuge and they had not been very receptive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">Q: How long were you with the American army officers’ mess?</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">A: Until somewhere in late ’46, I think.</span> <span id="s3253">Then I went with the Joint Distribution Committee (this is actually the American Joint Distribution Committee).</span> <span id="s3254">I don’t even know how I got there anymore, but somehow I got to them and got a job working for this Jewish help agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: In Vienna.</span> <span id="s3257">I just found an old, old slide (photograph) of my boss and me standing before a jeep in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3258">Somehow I got recommended to the Joint Distribution Committee, which was the biggest Jewish relief organization at that time.</span> <span id="s3259">There were two of them working, the HIAS (HIAS is the abbreviation for the Hebrew Immigrants Aid Society) and the Joint (the Joint was the highest).</span> <span id="s3260">Much of Joint’s work later was taken over by UNRA (the United Nations Relief Association).</span> <span id="s3261">At first, I was kind of secretary to the Director of the Joint, a Joe Silver from Cleveland.</span> <span id="s3262">He was a lawyer from Cleveland.</span> <span id="s3263">Before he left, I did a little translation work and dealt with people coming to the Joint -- you know, the chap who sits in the anteroom and deals with everything?</span> <span id="s3264">That was me!</span> <span id="s3265">Later, I became a photographer.</span> <span id="s3266">Again, I think it was my own volition -- I’m sure of it, because I was getting quite sick and tired of being a secretary.</span> <span id="s3267">It was a good job for a crook, to be such a secretary.</span> <span id="s3268">That was a strange thing, but it was a good job for a crook.</span> <span id="s3269">I never could bring myself to do it (to be a crook).</span> <span id="s3270">I got packages of CARE certificates to distribute -- blank ones, you know.</span> <span id="s3271">People just bought for ten dollars whatever was in a CARE package and Americans sent it over.</span> <span id="s3272">So, we got this whole package of CARE certificates -- whole packages came in.</span> <span id="s3273">We would distribute them.</span> <span id="s3274">We would get them distributed to whoever we thought should get them.</span> <span id="s3275">I know that in some places, there was tremendous trade in these CARE packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">(Continued on Tape 4, Side 2) This is part of the fourth interview with Mr. Steeber.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">A: From the people who received it, you know that each CARE package just after the war was worth actually a junior fortune in some trading commodity.</span> <span id="s3278">I never was able to do it, I mean, maybe I didn’t know any better.</span> <span id="s3279">I think that I was pretty naïve in these days…pretty stupid…still thinking of the golden future or something.</span> <span id="s3280">Anyhow, I became a photographer for the Joint.</span> <span id="s3281">I did some publicity work.</span> <span id="s3282">I just found some the other day and I’m going to show it to you later.</span> <span id="s3283">(Actually, much black market activities were centered around CARE packages, but many welfare workers refused to participate in them.</span> <span id="s3284">Fines were also heavy).</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: I’d like to see that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">A: I always find boxes and I take them out, and something comes up about which I didn’t even think for ages.</span> <span id="s3287">So, we traveled to Displaced Persons camps (i.e., DP camps) in Austria.</span> <span id="s3288">We traveled all over Austria, but there were quite a number in the American Zone, there were some in the English Zone, there were none in the French Zone.</span> <span id="s3289">There was a big one in Admont.</span> <span id="s3290">There are some nice pictures here from Admont.</span> <span id="s3291">Then I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Let me ask you a question or two about this.</span> <span id="s3293">Now you worked with the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC).</span> <span id="s3294">You say you were doing just general clerical work, translation and so forth, but what was the main thrust of the JDC at that time?</span> <span id="s3295">Was it locating people or was it getting food to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">A: Neither.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">Q: Or was it getting people to Israel?</span> <span id="s3298">(It was still Palestine and immigrations were nearly closed).</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: Well, it was a mixture of all of them.</span> <span id="s3300">There were camps in Austria -- refugee camps in Austria -- the DP camps.</span> <span id="s3301">They were supported partly by the army -- monies from the army, and partly by private funds.</span> <span id="s3302">The main distributor of private funds was the JDC.</span> <span id="s3303">The JDC started a number of projects in the camps.</span> <span id="s3304">Their idea was to make people self-sufficient to a certain degree, not to let them sit around the whole day thinking up unpleasantries.</span> <span id="s3305">So they started a work program and encouraged people to join.</span> <span id="s3306">They brought tools in and materials and encouraged people to open workshops: tailor, carpenter, etc. and to manufacture certain things and these things were sold in the camp PX for script.</span> <span id="s3307">The people who worked would earn script for their work in the workshops.</span> <span id="s3308">This script they could use in the PX to buy back the merchandise, also the merchandise they produced themselves.</span> <span id="s3309">Of course, they could go outside and buy money for script and go to town.</span> <span id="s3310">I mean, they were not locked into the camps.</span> <span id="s3311">They could go outside, but, of course, the local government and the JDC.</span> <span id="s3312">More or less, discouraged too many excursions outside.</span> <span id="s3313">I mean they couldn’t lock them in.</span> <span id="s3314">Of course, there was friction.</span> <span id="s3315">It was easy to have friction between the local population and the camp inmates, but comparatively, there was not much.</span> <span id="s3316">I remember some unpleasantness in some camps, especially one camp.</span> <span id="s3317">That was mostly, I think, provoked by the Jews more than by the local population.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: Could you elaborate on that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: Oh, I would say that they would walk along and would stop people and say “Umhoch!”</span> <span id="s3320">which means friend -- “Uster Umhoch!”</span> <span id="s3321">If they didn’t understand, then they would give them a kick or something like this …just nastiness, you know, which, of course, is born out of great frustration -- you know, these people sitting in these camps!</span> <span id="s3322">By that time, it was early ’47, ’48, 49, maybe -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3323">I was not in there after ’45, so I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s3324">The war was over in ’45 and nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s3325">After ’48, it started to empty out into Israel, but before ’48, nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s3326">Nobody wanted them.</span> <span id="s3327">No country wanted them.</span> <span id="s3328">Israel was closed.</span> <span id="s3329">There was illegal immigration, of course.</span> <span id="s3330">Some undertook trips to get into Israel.</span> <span id="s3331">Yes, there were quite a few people, there was quite a bit of traffic in people being smuggled.</span> <span id="s3332">I met some people, also people from the Jewish underground armies (The Irgun -- the illegal terrorist groups), but mostly they tried to bring people in.</span> <span id="s3333">To smuggle people in</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">Q: The photography work that you did, was that mainly in the line of public relations?</span> <span id="s3335">Publicity for the manufacturing and the PX store?</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s3337">Mostly.</span> <span id="s3338">Also to show off general conditions in the camps.</span> <span id="s3339">If you wanted to tug at the heartstrings, there were always ways to tug at heartstrings, to show this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">Q: Which agency was mainly concerned with finding people, putting families back together, locating people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">A: I think it was mostly in Aronson.</span> <span id="s3342">I don’t remember the exact location, but it was over there in Germany.</span> <span id="s3343">I think it was mostly a Red Cross agency.</span> <span id="s3344">You mean a Jewish agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: Yes, surely.</span> <span id="s3346">There must have been some central office, some administration where people could inquire about relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">A: The only one I would know was the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s3348">They had a search service; a central search service.</span> <span id="s3349">Let me try to remember where that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">Q: In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">A: No.</span> <span id="s3352">Not in Germany!</span> <span id="s3353">Not in Berlin!</span> <span id="s3354">In Arosa I think it was.</span> <span id="s3355">(Arosa is a resort town located in Switzerland).</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">Q: You never got involved in that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">Q: Would you comment on the administration of the JDC in Vienna, on Silver, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">A: Silver was a lawyer and after that there was a fellow named Traub!</span> <span id="s3360">I think he was a lawyer, too.</span> <span id="s3361">His name was spelled “TRAUB”, I think.</span> <span id="s3362">Look, you have evil people, in their way, as administrators, but when you have a lot of easy money around, you have corruption.</span> <span id="s3363">There’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s3364">I don’t know how much Silver stole and I don’t know how much Traub stole, really.</span> <span id="s3365">I’m quite sure they did steal, though.</span> <span id="s3366">I know that there was one chap in charge of the work program and he started it while I was there.</span> <span id="s3367">He was able to buy up a lot of art in Austria and ship it back to the United States.</span> <span id="s3368">Again, I have never stood next to any of them and saw them put their hand into the till, but I am convinced that some money went the wrong way.</span> <span id="s3369">I am not quite as convinced now, maybe than I was then, even, but it is the old story.</span> <span id="s3370">So, they didn’t get 90 cents on the dollar or something like that -- they get 50 cents on the dollar.</span> <span id="s3371">But if it wouldn’t have been there, they wouldn’t have gotten anything.</span> <span id="s3372">It’s the old story with charities.</span> <span id="s3373">It’s unfortunate what happens sometimes, but if it’s not there you are getting less.</span> <span id="s3374">Who gets burned is usually really the people who shouldn’t be: The recipients.</span> <span id="s3375">But, I don’t think that it was more corrupt, that more was stolen than was normal under these circumstances.</span> <span id="s3376">I say that I never could pinpoint it, where it was done and how exactly it was done.</span> <span id="s3377">I know that there was a lot of money disbursed and I think that the control of this money which was received and disbursed was very, very loose.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Q: Well, you know, this is very interesting to me.</span> <span id="s3379">I’ve not read much material on it.</span> <span id="s3380">It may exist and I just don’t know about it, but to my knowledge, I don’t know that much exists on this period after the war and down to the creation of Israel in ’48 and the big waves of immigration in ’48 and ’49 to Israel: the emptying of the camps.</span> <span id="s3381">I’ve not really seen much authoritative information on the displaced camps in that three or four year period.</span> <span id="s3382">So any detail that you can give, any memories that you can summon about all sorts of activities would be good, for example: health care in the camps, any details about the administration of JDC or the work of HIAS, or conflicting jurisdictions between HIAS and JDC, or work of Irgun (this was one of the secret armies of terrorism) and their agents, your contacts with them and who they were by name.</span> <span id="s3383">I would be very appreciative for that kind of detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">A: I don’t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s3385">You see, I was on the fringes.</span> <span id="s3386">I was not really involved.</span> <span id="s3387">First of all, don’t forget, in all American post-war institutions there was one great division: the division between Americans and what was kindly called Indigenous Personnel.</span> <span id="s3388">If you belonged to the Indigenous Personnel, regardless of who you are, you were a second-class citizens to start with.</span> <span id="s3389">I mean there were no questions asked -- you were a second class.</span> <span id="s3390">Then within that second class, you might have been top second class or middle second class or bottom second class.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: Well, see, even that’s important.</span> <span id="s3392">Even that kind of information is important to me.</span> <span id="s3393">So you’re on the right track, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s3394">A: Well, OK, there were non-Americans involved in decision making or policy making in any of the organizations, so all I can tell you is from a second-class point of view.</span> <span id="s3395">So, from a peripheral point of view…</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">Q: But, that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">A: I do not think that there was an affection between HIAS and Joint.</span> <span id="s3398">I don’t think it was overlapping anywhere.</span> <span id="s3399">It must have been, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3400">I never saw it.</span> <span id="s3401">There was some friction later between UNRA and Joint.</span> <span id="s3402">Between the United States Relief Organization and Joint there were some overlapping authorities in the camps.</span> <span id="s3403">I think.</span> <span id="s3404">The administration was very simple: there was a director and there was a secretary and there was a medical department and a work project department.</span> <span id="s3405">These were really the main functions of Joint together with Emigration, but there was, of course, an emigration administrative staff which concerned itself with emigration.</span> <span id="s3406">But in the camps the main functions of Joint were medical and work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">Q: Now, I assume that your knowledge pertains more to the work end of it than to the medical, since you were serving as a photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">A: Yes, I made a little booklet.</span> <span id="s3409">Where will I find it?</span> <span id="s3410">...you might be interested in it.</span> <span id="s3411">It is called “My Child”.</span> <span id="s3412">As a photographer, I did it with some other people.</span> <span id="s3413">We have very simple steps to show what you do with a baby for the DP’s, the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">Q: Did you have much contact with the DP’s themselves -- on a one-to-one basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">A: Yes, well, not really too much.</span> <span id="s3416">We’d get into the camp.</span> <span id="s3417">We’d talk to them, of course.</span> <span id="s3418">One thing was the language, of course.</span> <span id="s3419">My Yiddish is nearly nonexistent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">Q: So you were dealing mostly with Polish refugees in Austrian camps.</span> <span id="s3421">See, that was the next question I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s3422">Was that the provenance of the geography of displacement?</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">A: Yes, there were Polish, Russian -- mostly refugees from Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">Q: Would you say that was true also in the German camps -- that it was mostly Eastern Europeans?</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">A: Well, I tell you, the French Jews -- there weren’t many left of the French Jews and the Dutch Jews and of other Western Jews -- there was very little left -- much less even than of the Eastern Jews.</span> <span id="s3426">Mainly because there were more (Eastern Jews) so the percentage, the probability was higher to survive.</span> <span id="s3427">But there was nobody left.</span> <span id="s3428">So the few, the few who night have been left -- they went back to France, they went back to Denmark, and they went back to Holland and so on, but they were assured of either a friendly or, at least, an acceptable reception.</span> <span id="s3429">Actually, the Danes kept the property of the Jews very carefully and gave it back after the war, very carefully.</span> <span id="s3430">They, of course, were the only ones that did it!</span> <span id="s3431">The others were not so happy when the Jews came back -- the ones who survived.</span> <span id="s3432">There was not a great joy in many places.</span> <span id="s3433">So the only people really who were left for camps were the people from the East.</span> <span id="s3434">They couldn’t go back to Poland or they wouldn’t go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s3435">They couldn’t or wouldn’t go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s3436">They wouldn’t go to Romania, you know, they wouldn’t go back to any communist country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">Q: You stayed with JDC ‘til 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">A: Until 1949, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">Q: As a photographer?</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">A: As a photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: Then, what happened?</span> <span id="s3442">What was the next step?</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: In ’48 the DP laws were passed in the United States.</span> <span id="s3444">That means that a large quota, a large number of DP’s were allowed to enter the U.S. I wanted to go to the U.S. I didn’t even know whether I wanted to stay truthfully.</span> <span id="s3445">“It doesn’t cost me anything -- the government pays for it…why shouldn’t I go?”</span> <span id="s3446">That is what I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Had you not thought of going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: No!</span> <span id="s3449">For some reason, no.</span> <span id="s3450">It was just not the thing.</span> <span id="s3451">You see, my family had no Zionist background, nor did I. My family was completely assimilationist.</span> <span id="s3452">I was very happy with Israel, but I just didn’t have any feeling -- I never had any feeling of going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Why was Argentina eliminated in your mind?</span> <span id="s3454">You had relatives in Buenos Aires?</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">A: Oh, I didn’t want to go to Argentina.</span> <span id="s3456">I think relatives are nice, but you would not necessarily follow them this way.</span> <span id="s3457">No, no, no!</span> <span id="s3458">I wanted to go and it was made so easy to go to the ‘States.</span> <span id="s3459">It didn’t cost anything.</span> <span id="s3460">The government picked up the tag for the transportation and all.</span> <span id="s3461">Truman did a tremendous thing there, with the DP laws.</span> <span id="s3462">It was enormous.</span> <span id="s3463">There were a lot of people going, after all.</span> <span id="s3464">The urge to go to Israel -- I think it became much stronger in later years.</span> <span id="s3465">Then, in 1948, it was very new.</span> <span id="s3466">There was -- the war was on.</span> <span id="s3467">(The State of Israel was in great danger, since about seven Arab countries invaded the Jewish State within one week of its establishment).</span> <span id="s3468">There was fighting going on.</span> <span id="s3469">Things were quite unsettled, but this was not a reason.</span> <span id="s3470">It just never occurred to me to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s3471">I didn’t have any intention of going to Israel.</span> <span id="s3472">I don’t know, maybe I am anti-Semitic, myself.</span> <span id="s3473">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3474">Too many Jews, you know, in that State.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">Q: I don’t think that translates into any sort of anti-Semitism -- that you’d prefer going to the ‘States rather than Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">A: I was thinking about settling in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3477">Why I was thinking that, I don’t know, either, for I really didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s3478">Possibly to open a business -- somebody suggested it, or I wanted to do it myself -- to open a photo store -- a retail store.</span> <span id="s3479">So I looked into the possibility of opening a retail store.</span> <span id="s3480">Now to open any retail store -- number one, you have to prove to the satisfaction of something like a Chamber of Commerce, let us say, that you are proficient in your business; number two, you have to find a store which is willing and a location where you can rent a store; number three, you have to go on the same side, a certain distance, and get the “OK” of every store owner that it is all right for you to open a store, and on the other side of the street, you have to go a certain distance and get an “OK” from every store owner; number four, your store has to be, I don’t know how many kilometers -- from the next store of the same type.</span> <span id="s3481">Taken together, it comes to eventually telling the people exactly what they can do with their store.</span> <span id="s3482">I think it’s really ridiculous!</span> <span id="s3483">For me, it was absolutely unbearable -- the amount of bureaucracy and red tape and a narrowness in Europe at that time.</span> <span id="s3484">This was, I think, really, the main reason why I decided to go to the ‘States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">Q: Before we take up the story of your coming to the ‘States, can I ask you again about sentiments -- emotions.</span> <span id="s3486">I should think that a person who had survived emotionally would probably be rather fragile.</span> <span id="s3487">Looking back, do you recall having to really grapple with or come to grips with or handle biases and prejudices, anti-German feelings, anti-Austrian feelings, anti-gentile feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">A: In myself?</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">Q: In yourself.</span> <span id="s3490">Obviously, you have overcome them, if you ever had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: To tell you the truth, I don’t think I ever had them in any degree.</span> <span id="s3492">I don’t think so!</span> <span id="s3493">I think that I was brought up that way: to abhor any kind of generalization, to infer from one case, from one instance, to generalize from one instance -- a general condition from that to infer a general condition.</span> <span id="s3494">Of course, I had a certain uneasy feeling, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s3495">I tell you that I came back from Austria and Germany in 1958 and I think I had a much uneasier feeling in 1958 than I had in 1948.</span> <span id="s3496">I saw much more of the resurgence.</span> <span id="s3497">You see, in 1948, nobody was a Nazi -- Oh, God “Nazi” was a dirty word.</span> <span id="s3498">Nobody ever heard of anybody who was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s3499">And if anybody would have said, “Jews have flat feet!”</span> <span id="s3500">somebody else would have hit him over the head immediately, you know.</span> <span id="s3501">It was different.</span> <span id="s3502">There was too much reaction, yet, from the war.</span> <span id="s3503">Then a few years later, that softened somewhat and the good old Austrian anti-Semitism came out again.</span> <span id="s3504">It was not expressed as strongly, but it was there.</span> <span id="s3505">It was this kind of insidious slime crawling around everywhere.</span> <span id="s3506">It is hard to see -- hard to express: “Eglicher Jude!”</span> <span id="s3507">(Jewish Leech!)</span> <span id="s3508">or “Sau Jude!”</span> <span id="s3509">(Jewish sow).</span> <span id="s3510">Nobody did this.</span> <span id="s3511">There was a certain -- slime -- all over the place.</span> <span id="s3512">Maybe it was in your mind.</span> <span id="s3513">Maybe much of it was in the mind.</span> <span id="s3514">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3515">But, in 1958, I said, “I couldn’t live here.’</span> <span id="s3516">Well, now, I know I couldn’t live there anymore or anything.</span> <span id="s3517">If you ask me why, I will say, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s3518">Nobody came to me as a Jew.</span> <span id="s3519">Nobody!</span> <span id="s3520">These same characteristics are coming up again -- raising their heads again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">Q: Well, one more question before we get you off to America.</span> <span id="s3522">Did you have any contact with the authorities who were involved with war crimes in identifying, tracing, documenting in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">A: No.</span> <span id="s3524">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">Q: Was that of your own choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">A: Nobody asked me, I think.</span> <span id="s3527">You know, there were not so many people there.</span> <span id="s3528">There were no Wiesenthals there.</span> <span id="s3529">(Reference is made to Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who has established his worldwide hunting headquarters in Los Angeles: the Simon Wiesenthal Center).</span> <span id="s3530">I never heard of Wiesenthal before I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">Q: He is Austrian, isn’t he?</span> <span id="s3532">Or is he German?</span></p> <p><span id="s3533">A: No.</span> <span id="s3534">He is Hungarian, I think -- as far as I know.</span> <span id="s3535">I think he is Hungarian, originally, but maybe not.</span> <span id="s3536">Nobody asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">Q: You felt no strong urge to prosecute?</span> <span id="s3538">You didn’t want to see Dobberke on trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">A: Well, I didn’t really know what to try him for; except that he hit a few people a number of times -- that he mistreated people sometimes, but I never saw him kill a man.</span> <span id="s3540">There were so many people there who were much worse than he was.</span> <span id="s3541">Also, in Theresienstadt, people who were much, much worse than he ever was, fortunately: Himmler (reference is made to SS Chief Heinrich Himmler who committed suicide shortly after his arrest on May 23, 1945) and so on -- they got them.</span> <span id="s3542">They hanged most of these.</span> <span id="s3543">This was giving satisfaction, but not very much.</span> <span id="s3544">I found out that it really doesn’t do much for you.</span> <span id="s3545">Revenge is beautiful, I think, when you think of it and it falls very flat when it’s accomplished.</span> <span id="s3546">So I never had any great satisfaction from any of it.</span> <span id="s3547">I remember that after, just after the liberation, that they brought in some German women or German men to clean up Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s3548">They picked them up from the countryside.</span> <span id="s3549">They brought them in and let them clean.</span> <span id="s3550">And not one person would lift a finger against -- one, maybe -- a Russian soldier, but nobody else -- not a Jew, for sure.</span> <span id="s3551">So that’s not what you dream.</span> <span id="s3552">You fantasize, you dream what you would do and, fortunately, or unfortunately, I don’t know which, reality is quite different when it comes to it.</span> <span id="s3553">And as I said, the whole post-war situation, the post-war life, it was a let down for most people -- a terrible let down.</span> <span id="s3554">After you went through all these things and saved yourself -- you saved your life somehow, and then you find someone in the world who is politely regretful that you saved your life.</span> <span id="s3555">I think that for a great many people it would have been much easier if you would have died, you know -- that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s3556">Then they could stand and cry a big tear and say, “how terrible” and go home and everything is peaceful and they don’t have people around who remind them constantly of this -- of these things .</span> <span id="s3557">No, I am convinced, and I am becoming more and more convinced, of it, that the Jews made a great mistake to survive, as far as just the world around them is concerned.</span> <span id="s3558">That is the case here, too.</span> <span id="s3559">If you ask people here what they would prefer -- if the Jews would go away suddenly, then there would be no problem at all.</span> <span id="s3560">The mid-East would be a great, happy Arab family, without Jews!</span> <span id="s3561">Now, wouldn’t it be easier?</span> <span id="s3562">Ask this question and find out how many people would say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">Q: That’s a provocative , and what do I want to say…damning indictment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">A: Well, it’s hard to bear.</span> <span id="s3565">You see, I think that I still can feel and keep fairly objective!</span> <span id="s3566">I’m fairly objective about it.</span> <span id="s3567">I feel that I am not being terribly bitter about it -- maybe bitter to a certain degree, but I think it’s a fact</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">Q: Yes!</span> <span id="s3569">Well what month, what part of 1949 did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">A: November.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">Q: November!</span> <span id="s3572">Late 1949…how much red tape was involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">A: Well, that went fairly fast.</span> <span id="s3574">You see, the Joint expedited it after I made up my mind.</span> <span id="s3575">It went fairly fast for the immigration visa -- you filled out a few forms.</span> <span id="s3576">I think it was not very much even then.</span> <span id="s3577">Their only concern was that you didn’t have a Communist past.</span> <span id="s3578">I think that if you were a mass murderer, at that time, it was much more admissible than being a Communist.</span> <span id="s3579">It went pretty fast.</span> <span id="s3580">And I went to Bremerhaven from some staging are near Salzburg -- and went to Bremerhaven and I came on…I came on the General JH MacRay --one of these “General” ships -- the Liberty ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s3581">Q: Transport ship?</span> <span id="s3582">( The “General” and “Admiral” class ships were used to transport U.S. troops during World War II).</span></p> <p><span id="s3583">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3584">Now, there were about three times as many people on there than there should have been.</span> <span id="s3585">It was terribly, terribly overcrowded.</span> <span id="s3586">Three layers of bodies and it was during November, and we got some God-awful storms.</span> <span id="s3587">It was the most miserable weather -- thirteen days!</span> <span id="s3588">Thirteen days from Bremerhaven to New York!</span> <span id="s3589">Some of the most miserable days I’ve ever seen, with furniture just going from one side to the other -- the ships’ screw out of the water half the time.</span> <span id="s3590">You thought that the ship would fall apart, it was shaking so badly.</span> <span id="s3591">It was very, very miserable.</span> <span id="s3592">But, we made it.</span> <span id="s3593">We came here on Thanksgiving, 1949.</span> <span id="s3594">We had to stay outside the harbor for a day because there was no customs and immigration service that day and wait until the next day.</span> <span id="s3595">I came to New York on the -- I don’t even know what day it was -- the twenty-third of November or the twenty-fifth of November -- I don’t know what date it was when I came, but it was in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s3597">I didn’t think that customs closed down on holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">A: I don’t know whether customs closed down, but the immigration closed down.</span> <span id="s3599">“The DP’s are there now.</span> <span id="s3600">Well, who cares?</span> <span id="s3601">Why should we forego a turkey dinner for them?”</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">Q: Well, you had about 2,000 people on that ship.</span> <span id="s3603">(That was a normal load for a “General’ class ship).</span> <span id="s3604">Did you make any friends on the ship that have been lasting?</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: No.</span> <span id="s3606">I didn’t know anybody on that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s3607">Q: And you had no contacts in New York, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">A: No, I had no contacts in New York.</span> <span id="s3609">I had absolutely none.</span> <span id="s3610">I had the Joint.</span> <span id="s3611">I went to the Joint.</span> <span id="s3612">They owed me something which seemed to be a large sum then, for some reason -- I don’t know why -- I think from my last payment or something.</span> <span id="s3613">They owed me something like $50, which was, to me, then, a very large sum of money, so I went to Madison Avenue.</span> <span id="s3614">It was one of my first trips to collect it.</span> <span id="s3615">I had a very rough time.</span> <span id="s3616">I don’t know…it was 1949…it was very bad -- it was a recession.</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">Q: I honestly don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">A: Yeah, but it was -- there was a recession in ’49.</span> <span id="s3619">The Joint was only overseas.</span> <span id="s3620">They didn’t do anything in the United States.</span> <span id="s3621">There was a United States Service for New Americans on Park Row in New York, downtown.</span> <span id="s3622">They registered you and they tried to get you a job and you should have seen it!</span> <span id="s3623">I wanted to be a photographer, but you should see it -- of course, I could accept something else, too, I suppose.</span> <span id="s3624">I don’t know what I would have done.</span> <span id="s3625">But you should see the jobs they send you too!</span> <span id="s3626">Some were on the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s3627">One was with an old man in a store -- in a filthy old store --filled up with old furs or something, I remember.</span> <span id="s3628">And he wanted me to do something.</span> <span id="s3629">When you got in there, you started sneezing already, when you opened the door.</span> <span id="s3630">He had work that nobody else would touch -- Nobody in his right mind!</span> <span id="s3631">-- Americans or immigrants or nobody in his right mind would touch.</span> <span id="s3632">So eventually, as I think I told you, I found a job as a baby photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3633">Q: Well, all right, but before we get into that, let me ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s3634">Would you mind saying how much money you had on you, or in your pocket when you arrived in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">A: I don’t mind at all.</span> <span id="s3636">My whole fortune at that time, including the $50, may have amounted to $100.</span> <span id="s3637">It’s a lot.</span> <span id="s3638">What more do you want?</span></p> <p><span id="s3639">Q: Did your situation, without friends, without a job, without many resources, intimidate you in any way at all?</span> <span id="s3640">Did you feel overwhelmed?</span> <span id="s3641">Or were you so joyous about getting to the States that you compensated?</span></p> <p><span id="s3642">A: Somehow, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3643">I don’t think I was particularly overwhelmed by New York.</span> <span id="s3644">I don’t know why -- whether I am just blasé or a snob or what -- I don’t know, but I liked it.</span> <span id="s3645">I always liked New York.</span> <span id="s3646">I don’t really know but I never felt particularly strange in New York.</span> <span id="s3647">Maybe in a former life I was a cop -- a New York cop.</span> <span id="s3648">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">Q: Do you recall any of the emotions that you had at that point, or upon arrival, such as size, bigness, tall buildings, swarms of people, dress, clothes, traffic, whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">A: I thought it was pleasant…pleasant, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3651">This is one thing I think which got lost during the war!</span> <span id="s3652">Any great emotions from changes.</span> <span id="s3653">The whole thing was very factual -- very matter of fact -- to me.</span> <span id="s3654">I hate that I cannot tell you that when I saw the Statue of Liberty that the tears were running down my cheeks -- they were not.</span> <span id="s3655">I enjoyed seeing the Statue of Liberty and it was interesting.</span> <span id="s3656">I enjoyed seeing the skyline and I remember the ship lying outside, in the outer bay, and we saw New York in the background.</span> <span id="s3657">When you looked closely, you could see the cars going by, I guess on the West side Highway (that appears to have been most unlikely from the outer bay) -- a lot of traffic going by.</span> <span id="s3658">All that was very impressive, but, at the same time, I was thinking that I would rather be there than sitting in the middle of New York Bay.</span> <span id="s3659">I thought: “Let’s go!”</span> <span id="s3660">Naturally I was very curious how New York would be.</span> <span id="s3661">I didn’t see it from the very best angle, of course, when I arrived.</span> <span id="s3662">I mean, people who come and stay at the Plaza have a better impression of New York than I had.</span> <span id="s3663">I stayed where they put me -- on Upper Broadway at 100th St. and Broadway, which at that point in time, was not the very best part of the city.</span> <span id="s3664">I was in a hotel there.</span> <span id="s3665">I remember that I was going in the shower in the morning and there were a great number of cockroaches.</span> <span id="s3666">I mentioned this to the room clerk or to the maid or to somebody and said, “You have a lot of cockroaches in the shower.”</span> <span id="s3667">They looked at me like somebody from Mars and said, “What do you think?</span> <span id="s3668">Of course we have cockroaches in the shower.</span> <span id="s3669">Everybody has cockroaches in the shower, you know?”</span> <span id="s3670">Just think as if to say, “Are you crazy to tell me that there are cockroaches in the shower?”</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">Q: Were all your living expenses paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">A: No!</span> <span id="s3673">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">Q: In other words, from the time you stepped off the boat, you were on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s3675">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s3676">No.</span> <span id="s3677">I know that they gave me some small amount of money in the beginning.</span> <span id="s3678">I think that they paid the hotel for a limited time.</span> <span id="s3679">They gave me some small amount of money and, I don’t really know…</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">Q: Did you find your English adequate?</span></p> <p><span id="s3681">A: Yes, quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">Q: As far as idiomatic speech?</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s3684">People thought that I was English -- that didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s3685">Oh yes, quite, quite adequate.</span> <span id="s3686">I never had any problem with the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">Q: Did you find the people at “United Service for New Americans” compassionate or treating you in a rather routine way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">A: They were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s3689">They would try to talk to you on an individual basis, but there was a great influx of people right then.</span> <span id="s3690">The program was in full swing.</span> <span id="s3691">The DP program saw thousands and thousands come into this country.</span> <span id="s3692">There was only so much that they could do.</span> <span id="s3693">There is no question about it.</span> <span id="s3694">I think that they did what they could.</span> <span id="s3695">I don’t know whether the organizations were the best.</span> <span id="s3696">I really have no idea.</span> <span id="s3697">I know very, very little about it -- nothing, really.</span> <span id="s3698">They tried.</span> <span id="s3699">In my case, they didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s3700">I think, again, the circumstances at that time might have a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s3701">It was a very poor time economically.</span> <span id="s3702">1949 was a very poor time.</span> <span id="s3703">It became easier in ’50 -- it became easier -- the economy picked up already</span></p> <p><span id="s3704">Q: How long was it before you found work?</span> <span id="s3705">How long was it from getting off the boat to the first job?</span> <span id="s3706">How much time elapsed?</span> <span id="s3707">A few weeks?</span> <span id="s3708">A few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">A: Something in between, I would say.</span> <span id="s3710">You see, I’m going to have to go backwards a little bit.</span> <span id="s3711">It was ’50 and it must have been in the spring, since I didn’t go out in the winter.</span> <span id="s3712">It could not have been long.</span> <span id="s3713">It couldn’t have been too long.</span> <span id="s3714">Maybe it was in November -- December.</span> <span id="s3715">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3716">I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3717">I’m trying for the season, to adjust it to the season.</span> <span id="s3718">Oh, I’m sorry!</span> <span id="s3719">You asked about relatives!</span> <span id="s3720">Of course, I had relatives here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">Q: In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s3723">Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s3724">That’s true!</span> <span id="s3725">What am I talking about?</span> <span id="s3726">One of the relatives was an insurance agent, an insurance broker, actually -- Arthur Schoenstadt.</span> <span id="s3727">He was a nephew -- no -- a cousin of my mother’s -- nephew of my grandmother -- a cousin of my mother’s from her mother’s side, and the other one was Anne De Teffler.</span> <span id="s3728">She was also a cousin of my mother’s, but from the other side.</span> <span id="s3729">But since my mother and father were cousins, it’s hard to say really from which side they were.</span> <span id="s3730">But, I remember that I met them when I came, but I don’t even want to remember them.</span> <span id="s3731">When I came, I called Arthur: “Oh1 Oh!</span> <span id="s3732">you’re here!</span> <span id="s3733">Wonderful1 Wonderful!</span> <span id="s3734">Let’s meet for lunch.”</span> <span id="s3735">So we met for lunch and we talked for a while and then he slapped me on the shoulder and said, “I know you will be doing all right.</span> <span id="s3736">Call me if you want something!”</span> <span id="s3737">(Tape 5, Side 1)</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">Q: That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s3740">I saw him twice: the first and last time at that lunch.</span> <span id="s3741">I never saw him again!</span> <span id="s3742">That was number one relative.</span> <span id="s3743">Number two corresponded with -- I mean that I saw her occasionally, and, well, I got absolutely no help from her, but I mean that I could relate to her, in some degree, on a human basis.</span> <span id="s3744">You see, I didn’t expect anything.</span> <span id="s3745">This is one thing I learned: never to expect anything from people, then you cannot be disappointed.</span> <span id="s3746">So, I don’t expect anything.</span> <span id="s3747">I didn’t expect anything from Arthur Schoenstadt, but I don’t need people like this either.</span> <span id="s3748">I don’t need a lunch and I don’t need a slap on the shoulder and I don’t need patronizing.</span> <span id="s3749">I never needed patronizing.</span> <span id="s3750">I never appreciated patronizing -- neither coming or going.</span> <span id="s3751">So that was the last, as I say, that was the last I ever saw of him.</span> <span id="s3752">And with the other one, I kind of lost contact with her, but that was as much my fault, I think.</span> <span id="s3753">It was never a warm relationship, but it was as much my fault as hers that I lost contact with Anne De Teffler.</span> <span id="s3754">She was a very sensitive person, I think, and if you didn’t cater to her, if you didn’t do exactly what she thought was right, she didn’t care.</span> <span id="s3755">Nobody could really deal with her.</span> <span id="s3756">I had a friend in Vienna -- he worked for Joint, too.</span> <span id="s3757">He came just a little later than I came -- just a couple of weeks later than I. I was happy to have him here: Peter Keyes.</span> <span id="s3758">He’s younger than I am, quite a bit younger.</span> <span id="s3759">He’s an insurance broker, too, in New York now.</span> <span id="s3760">He had relatives here, so I got into a certain amount of personal contact -- I met a certain number of people fairly fast.</span> <span id="s3761">It was not that I was totally alone here.</span> <span id="s3762">I formed quite a number of acquaintances fairly fast.</span> <span id="s3763">So my first job, really, was that “baby racket.”</span> <span id="s3764">It must have been early in the year -- something like that, for it didn’t last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">Q: 1950?</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">A: It didn’t last long -- maybe two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">Q: And specifically, what did it consist of?</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">A: Taking baby pictures.</span> <span id="s3769">Somebody would make an appointment and I would go with my equipment and schlep it outside to their place and take the baby picture, if they let me in the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s3770">Q: Where did you get the equipment?</span></p> <p><span id="s3771">A: Oh, I brought some along.</span> <span id="s3772">It was my stuff I brought along.</span> <span id="s3773">It was old stuff even then.</span> <span id="s3774">Today, it would be museum quality, you know.</span> <span id="s3775">It was old stuff, even then.</span> <span id="s3776">I told you the other day that you would go out and, of course, I had no car and there was no strobe equipment.</span> <span id="s3777">It was all flashlights, big reflectors, and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s3778">The bulbs -- you had two of them -- you had to have two of them.</span> <span id="s3779">it was all folded up, but you had to carry it in one hand with tripod and camera and so on.</span> <span id="s3780">So you went on the subway with it all held together with leather straps and then it was half an hour by the subway and twenty minutes by bus, and then you walked for ten minutes through the darkest Bronx or Brooklyn or whatever.</span> <span id="s3781">It was mostly the Bronx.</span> <span id="s3782">A lot of customers were in the Bronx and all the new streets -- it was impossible to find some of these.</span> <span id="s3783">Then the mother would stick her head out of the window and say, “Oh, yes, but the baby has a cold.</span> <span id="s3784">You wouldn’t mind coming back tomorrow?</span> <span id="s3785">…” for instance.</span> <span id="s3786">Something like that.</span> <span id="s3787">So, uh, I didn’t really make much money -- I made some money with it -- sure -- but very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">Q: Were you with a firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s3790">It wasn’t actually a firm.</span> <span id="s3791">It was one fellow who had a studio on 505 Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s3792">He had a studio, actually -- a reception room and a dark room -- a studio dark room -- that is all.</span> <span id="s3793">He went into the business of being a photographer.</span> <span id="s3794">He rented the office with the idea of going into the business of being a photographer.</span> <span id="s3795">So he probably couldn’t find anybody else -- so he took me.</span> <span id="s3796">He was a nice enough chap.</span></p> <p><span id="s3797">Q: Now, did you find that job through the agency for the aid of new Americans, or did you find that job through the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">A: I knew you would ask that question.</span> <span id="s3799">I have not the remotest idea.</span> <span id="s3800">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3801">I have no recollection how I found that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3802">Q: You were with him about two months, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s3803">A: That’s by figuring times, you know -- time periods when things happened.</span> <span id="s3804">I would say about two months.</span> <span id="s3805">I really don’t remember much about it.</span> <span id="s3806">I would say about two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">Q: Were you continuing to live at the hotel on 100th and Broadway?</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">A: Let’s see now…I lived at 100th and Broadway…I got out of there fast.</span> <span id="s3809">I lived at another hotel on upper Broadway, too, but at the time I was being a photographer, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3810">I lived in a room.</span> <span id="s3811">I had been recommended to a family – A German Jewish family, by the name of Bach.</span> <span id="s3812">They lived in the “Fourth Reich.”</span> <span id="s3813">What was called then the “Fourth Reich” was Washington Heights, you know.</span> <span id="s3814">.</span> <span id="s3815">There were a lot of Jews there.</span> <span id="s3816">It’s all Spanish now, I guess, on 163rd St. They had an apartment and they rented a couple of rooms.</span> <span id="s3817">It was a large apartment and I rented a room there for ten dollars a week, which was just about the right amount for me to pay.</span> <span id="s3818">The ten dollars included breakfast, and I think I lived there by the time of the baby photographs.</span> <span id="s3819">I think Peter must have been in the U.S. already.</span> <span id="s3820">I think it was someone connected with Peter Keyes, who recommended me to these people.</span> <span id="s3821">So it must have been a couple of months -- maybe three months after I came.</span> <span id="s3822">It was all around the same time.</span> <span id="s3823">so, I left there eventually -- I mean it really left me.</span> <span id="s3824">There was nothing -- it just was not possible.</span> <span id="s3825">I couldn’t make enough money.</span> <span id="s3826">There was no money at all.</span> <span id="s3827">It cost me more money than the whole thing was worth.</span> <span id="s3828">Then, again, I tried to find more jobs, I think, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s3829">Eventually…there is a street in New York -- downtown -- where there are a lot of buildings a whole building is filled with employment agencies -- mostly for cheap jobs (entry level jobs) -- floor after floor of one room employment agencies -- one after the other.</span> <span id="s3830">They all have boards outside to show what they have available.</span> <span id="s3831">I went in there.</span> <span id="s3832">I had three dollars in my pocket or four, maybe -- this was all I had, and I bought myself (you had to pay for the service before getting the address) -- there was a part time job available as a delivery boy for carry out lunches on 52nd St. I bought this job and I went right over and it was another dime to take the subway.</span> <span id="s3833">The subway had been a nickel before.</span> <span id="s3834">Just when I came, it went up to a dime -- the subway, that is.</span> <span id="s3835">I got the job and I started working right away, which was very nice, for I got money in my pocket again.</span> <span id="s3836">There were a lot of tips involved, and there were interesting places to go to.</span> <span id="s3837">It was on 52nd St, close to 6th Ave. It went to all the studios – radio studios, television studios.</span> <span id="s3838">It was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">This is the end of interview #6.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">Q: This is the seventh interview with Mr. Henry Steeber.</span> <span id="s3841">It is Thursday March 22, 1979, and we’re in the living room of his apartment.</span> <span id="s3842">Mr. Steeber, at the end of the last interview, we were at the point where you had purchased a job and were carrying coffee and sandwiches to various businesses in New York City, so could you take it up to that point about your subsequent career?</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">A: Well, I stayed with this for a couple of months -- two…three months -- maybe a little longer.</span> <span id="s3844">We carried out a lot of coffee to the various offices in the morning and the afternoon, especially.</span> <span id="s3845">That was quite inefficient.</span> <span id="s3846">I talked it over with somebody.</span> <span id="s3847">I said, “Couldn’t we take this coffee over to these offices in containers -- in large containers.</span> <span id="s3848">You used to take a half dozen coffees and then come back and go back again and take another half dozen coffees to the same place.</span> <span id="s3849">It seems impractical.</span> <span id="s3850">So I, with a partner, opened a little business in the Wall St. section, on Broad St. It was called the “Coffee Cow Company,” which was primarily designed for coffee service in the morning and in the afternoon, but we also had lunch.</span> <span id="s3851">We had lunches.</span> <span id="s3852">It was just one room, one large loft.</span> <span id="s3853">We started at 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s3854">We built it up.</span> <span id="s3855">We didn’t have any business to start at all!!</span> <span id="s3856">We started with zero and built up a nice business with it, but after three years, we were at a point that either we would have to enlarge the business, go somewhere else (the place got too small) or stay where we were.</span> <span id="s3857">Neither alternative interested me, particularly.</span> <span id="s3858">It was not a very interesting business and I found somebody to buy my share -- my part -- 50/50 part.</span> <span id="s3859">The first thing I did was to take a bus trip around the States.</span> <span id="s3860">I took a Greyhound bus and went riding around for two months.</span> <span id="s3861">I went down South -- I was out West and up North and came back again and stopped at certain places for some time.</span> <span id="s3862">It was a tremendous experience.</span> <span id="s3863">It was just unbelievable to realize the size of the country.</span> <span id="s3864">I never could realize the size of the country until I did this: that you can go for days -- you can go for days in one direction and there’s no end to it.</span> <span id="s3865">You go through Texas for two days.</span> <span id="s3866">There is absolutely nothing to be seen along that road.</span> <span id="s3867">We saw quite amazing sights which even today are fairly unknown.</span> <span id="s3868">There is a town, which I think was called Ozona, if I remember rightly.</span> <span id="s3869">You come up to it and suddenly, from nowhere, from absolutely nothing -- old palaces -- palatial homes, just standing there in the middle of the desert, practically.</span> <span id="s3870">This was all former sheep country and these were all the old sheep ranchers and their water was very short, of course, so they started digging for water, but they found oil.</span> <span id="s3871">That’s quite an amazing thing.</span> <span id="s3872">And the site of things…you would see a town in the distance -- it’s so flat in parts, you’d see a town in the distance and you’d think you will be there, maybe, in half an hour, and in two hours, you’re still as far away as you were before.</span> <span id="s3873">It’s impossible to picture.</span> <span id="s3874">Well, it was very interesting and impressive, at that time, and I came back and I had to do something, and a number of people talked to me.</span> <span id="s3875">I wanted to stay in the food business.</span> <span id="s3876">That interested me.</span> <span id="s3877">I was just on the periphery of the food business, of course.</span> <span id="s3878">Making sandwiches doesn’t make a food business, but it kind of interested me and a lot of people said: “Why don’t you stay in it?</span> <span id="s3879">It’s a good business.</span> <span id="s3880">Maybe you want to go into the hotel business -- it’s an interesting business.”</span> <span id="s3881">At that time, I had had it with photography and so I said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s3882">However, I realized that I needed some kind of background.</span> <span id="s3883">I didn’t want to start in a hotel or restaurant in a kitchen, washing dishes if I could avoid it.</span> <span id="s3884">And this is not very educational anyhow.</span> <span id="s3885">Even in 1954, these times had passed that always you start as a dishwasher and become a general manager in easy stages.</span> <span id="s3886">And so, I enrolled at the two-year college: New York City Community College, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s3887">They had a Hotel Administration course, and I took it.</span> <span id="s3888">I stayed for two years.</span> <span id="s3889">I took a Hotel Administration course and at the same time, I worked at the Hotel New Yorker.</span> <span id="s3890">I don’t know whether you are familiar with New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">Q: Vaguely!</span> <span id="s3892">Yes, I’ve been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3893">A: Well, you know the New Yorker.</span> <span id="s3894">I think it has been bought up by the Rev. Moon or something.</span> <span id="s3895">It had a checkered history -- the New Yorker .</span> <span id="s3896">I worked there as a Food Checker and then I worked as a cashier and, again, Food Checker, and eventually, as Room Service Captain.</span> <span id="s3897">I stayed there until I graduated -- even a little longer.</span> <span id="s3898">I went on working there for another half a year, approximately, as Room Service Captain, which was a good business.</span> <span id="s3899">It was at that time – there was quite a bit of money in it.</span> <span id="s3900">And, again, I was looking around for a job and found one out of town, in Canton, Ohio, as a Catering Steward.</span> <span id="s3901">I didn’t even know what it was.</span> <span id="s3902">I figured that it must be a local expression.</span> <span id="s3903">I knew what a steward was, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: You were saying that you took a job as a Catering Steward and you knew what a Steward was, but not what a Catering Steward was, before the taping was interrupted.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">A: I forgot one thing a little prior to this: during the summer of that year I was a manager, for a few months, in a “Gay Ninety” ice cream parlor in Westport, Ct.</span> <span id="s3906">It was an interesting place.</span> <span id="s3907">It had an original back bar -- today that would be worth a fortune.</span> <span id="s3908">At that time, nobody really wanted original back bars, so you could get these things for a song -- pick it up for a song anywhere, but it had to have the original back bar of the Gay Nineties with the old faucets and the old mirrors and a nickelodeon with the big metal records.</span> <span id="s3909">It was a very interesting place, but not really -- not quite up to my ambitions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3910">Q: To this point in your business career in New York, that is from 1949 down to 1954 -- that’s five years -- would you say that your circle of friends was generally survivors or not?</span> <span id="s3911">Had you broken away from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3913">I wouldn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3914">Q: Were there any other survivors like you in your group of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s3915">A: Well, I had one good friend, who still is my good friend, who is a bit younger than I am.</span> <span id="s3916">He went as a child to England and survived in England, and he came here.</span> <span id="s3917">And the first thing, after he came here, is that he got in the army and they sent him to Korea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3918">Q: Well, the reason I asked the question was, I wondered about other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3919">A: About other people?</span> <span id="s3920">There were people connected with him.</span> <span id="s3921">I would think it was mixed.</span> <span id="s3922">I neither avoided anybody, nor did I seek out anybody.</span> <span id="s3923">Let’s put it this way -- I took it as it came.</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">Q: Well, come sociologists write about survivors in this period of the late ‘40’s and the early ‘50’s who came to the United States, as clinging together.</span> <span id="s3925">And that’s what prompted my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3926">A: Well, there is no pattern.</span> <span id="s3927">I would have had to actively seek out people.</span> <span id="s3928">You know how it is in New York -- you don’t have all the time in the world for social life, anyhow, and you couldn’t see people very often.</span> <span id="s3929">I lived in uptown Manhattan.</span> <span id="s3930">A lot of people lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s3931">To go from Manhattan to Brooklyn and back, you can’t afford it.</span> <span id="s3932">I mean, in time, you can’t afford it.</span> <span id="s3933">It takes at least an hour and a half to get there and an hour and a half to get back.</span> <span id="s3934">I mean, who has the time to do it?</span> <span id="s3935">So there was a limitation.</span> <span id="s3936">I can’t remember…oh, well…I will say yes, there were some people.</span> <span id="s3937">There weren’t so many people around, you see.</span> <span id="s3938">I didn’t seek out anybody.</span> <span id="s3939">I know that I didn’t go out of my way to join a club.</span> <span id="s3940">I never liked to join anything and never liked to join clubs, organizations…I never liked even to join synagogues or temples.</span> <span id="s3941">I do not like organizations period -- whatever they are -- whether it’s religion or whether it’s playing poker.</span> <span id="s3942">I don’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3943">Q: Another question along this line: Were most of your friends German-speaking Austrians in New York in this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s3944">A: No, there were some Hungarian German speaking, I guess.</span> <span id="s3945">There were more German speaking people of European background than others.</span> <span id="s3946">Yes!</span> <span id="s3947">I don’t think that I spoke very much German at that time.</span> <span id="s3948">I remember that it didn’t take very long for German to start already to get a little difficult for me to speak.</span> <span id="s3949">I always said that it is a relatively vicious thing, really.</span> <span id="s3950">I never learned how to speak English and I forgot how to speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3951">Q: Well, on to Canton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s3952">Then, you came to Canton in 1954?</span></p> <p><span id="s3953">A: No!</span> <span id="s3954">I took the two years in school, so it was ’56.</span> <span id="s3955">I graduated in June and I left in December of 1956 and went to Canton.</span> <span id="s3956">I found out what the job was.</span> <span id="s3957">It was a very small hotel.</span> <span id="s3958">The job was to do everything which has anything to do with food.</span> <span id="s3959">But the hotel closed in January.</span> <span id="s3960">I think in January of 1957, so it didn’t take very long -- they sold it.</span> <span id="s3961">Maybe it didn’t close, but Pick (the Albert Pick chain) sold the hotel and they wanted to keep me in the organization.</span> <span id="s3962">They suggested that I should go to Youngstown.</span> <span id="s3963">Yes, it was Youngstown, so it was really no difference for me with Youngstown.</span> <span id="s3964">I had to look at the hotel and talk to the manager and, if we get together, I should work there as an Assistant Manager.</span> <span id="s3965">Now, Assistant Manager work is, of course, close to the front of the house, not the back of the house, not food, but the front desk, etc. of which I knew nothing, practically.</span> <span id="s3966">I went to Youngstown and we talked and we agreed on it and again I got the word.</span> <span id="s3967">They said: “Now, since you don’t know anything about the front desk, it would not be a good idea to start at a hotel as Assistant Manager -- if you don’t know anything about it -- so do go to Dayton.</span> <span id="s3968">Go to the Miami Hotel and stay there as long as you want -- a couple of months or three months -- whatever you want -- until you get a little bit of proficiency on the front desk and then, come back to Youngstown and take over as Assistant Manager.”</span> <span id="s3969">So I drove to Dayton and I met Gene Berry, who was at that time -- he became rather important to me so I just thought I’d mention his name -- at that time, he was the General Manager of the Miami Hotel.</span> <span id="s3970">The next day, I met with him, after I arrived, and he said, “Henry, do you really want to work at the front desk?”</span> <span id="s3971">I said, “What else do you have in mind?”</span> <span id="s3972">He said, “Wouldn’t you rather stay with the food end of it?”</span> <span id="s3973">I said, “I guess I would.”</span> <span id="s3974">He said, “I tell you, my Catering Manager is leaving jut now -- why don’t you take over?”</span> <span id="s3975">I said, “Fine!</span> <span id="s3976">Sounds very good!”</span> <span id="s3977">He told me the conditions and so on.</span> <span id="s3978">So I said, ‘It sounds very good” and it was.</span> <span id="s3979">The Miami was a three hundred-room hotel.</span> <span id="s3980">It had a dining room and a coffee shop.</span> <span id="s3981">I don’t know whether you ever encountered “The Purple Cow” -- whether it ever played a role in your life?</span> <span id="s3982">No?</span> <span id="s3983">OK I had a cocktail lounge and quite a number of banquet halls.</span> <span id="s3984">It had one of the biggest ballrooms in the city, seating 500, and quite a number of other rooms.</span> <span id="s3985">So it was a job way above what I had before -- way above.</span> <span id="s3986">And at that time, I think I had unlimited nerve and was ready to do anything.</span> <span id="s3987">I bluffed my way through when I had to, and some things I knew, and much of it is common sense.</span> <span id="s3988">I did all right with it.</span> <span id="s3989">I stayed there for three years and in my second year there.</span> <span id="s3990">I met my wife.</span> <span id="s3991">She wasn’t my wife then.</span> <span id="s3992">We married in the same year, in ’58.</span> <span id="s3993">I catered our wedding.</span> <span id="s3994">Well, we all have to have some claim to fame.</span> <span id="s3995">It was a very nice wedding and one of these days I know that my wife will show you the wedding pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3996">Louise Steeber: I was just thinking about it…Here’s somebody who hasn’t seen the wedding pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">Q: Louise, what was your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">LS: Samuels.</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">Q: Samuels.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">A: Now Gene Berry, who was the General Manager, was offered a job in Aruba.</span> <span id="s4001">He told me that it was in Aruba.</span> <span id="s4002">My first question was, “Where the hell is that?”</span> <span id="s4003">I learned where it was.</span> <span id="s4004">In Aruba, it was a brand new hotel.</span> <span id="s4005">It was the first hotel on the island.</span> <span id="s4006">Now, Aruba, for our listeners, is an island 12 miles -- almost 12 miles -- or was it 19 miles?</span></p> <p><span id="s4007">LS: 19 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s4008">A: 19 miles off the coast of Venezuela -- let’s see if we can get this thing sorted out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4009">LS: No, it’s 15 miles off the coast of Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s4010">A: 15 miles off the coast of Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s4011">LS: The island is 19 miles long.</span></p> <p><span id="s4012">A: Well, I don’t want to know how long it was.</span> <span id="s4013">It’s part of the Netherlands Antilles (East Indies) in a group together with Curacao and Bonaire.</span> <span id="s4014">They form the ABC Islands down there.</span> <span id="s4015">At that time, all there was on the island was a very large oil refinery by Standard Oil of New Jersey, at one end of the island.</span> <span id="s4016">The other end of the island had beautiful, beautiful beaches.</span> <span id="s4017">Beautiful beaches!</span> <span id="s4018">There was a little kind of hotel there and a kind of night club there, but very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s4019">One company built a 120-room hotel.</span> <span id="s4020">That was a tremendously big hotel for this place and it was very luxurious.</span> <span id="s4021">A very luxurious hotel!</span> <span id="s4022">Gene Berry got the job as General Manager, and he asked me, “Do you want to come along, if it’s possible?”</span> <span id="s4023">I asked Louise.</span> <span id="s4024">She’s adventuresome and she said: ”Yes.”</span> <span id="s4025">In the meantime, naturally, the Miami Hotel changed managers and did it much for the worse.</span> <span id="s4026">So I was very eager to get out.</span> <span id="s4027">I had started to look for another job already, even before I heard anything from Aruba.</span> <span id="s4028">The following May -- Berry left sometime in the winter -- the following May, I received a telephone call from Miami.</span> <span id="s4029">It went as follows: “This is Mr. Rubens.</span> <span id="s4030">Can you go to Aruba?</span> <span id="s4031">Or rather, can you come to Miami?”</span> <span id="s4032">I said, “Certainly, I can, but why?”</span> <span id="s4033">He said that he was the Executive Vice President of the company and that they wanted to talk to me.</span> <span id="s4034">So, I went to Miami.</span> <span id="s4035">They offered ma a job as Executive Assistant Manager, which I gladly accepted, and in May, 1960, I went to Aruba for three years, until Gene Berry was transferred to another hotel of the group, and I became General Manager in Aruba.</span> <span id="s4036">Now, Aruba is a very small island and it becomes very, very confining after awhile.</span> <span id="s4037">It was a very interesting -- six years is too long -- but it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s4038">I met a lot of very interesting people -- a lot of very dull people.</span> <span id="s4039">However, the interesting people, I would say, have stayed more in my mind, fortunately.</span> <span id="s4040">But you know, we lived in the hotel.</span> <span id="s4041">We had an apartment in the hotel and we entertained in the hotel and I worked in the hotel, so everything centered around the hotel.</span> <span id="s4042">The walls closed in on you.</span> <span id="s4043">We, of course, had to go to every conceivable cocktail party in the community and at times, such as at Christmas time, there were many of them.</span> <span id="s4044">You would go to three in one day and you met the same people, heard the same small talk -- which was dull in the first place -- and in many respects, it was hard to take.</span> <span id="s4045">In the summer, especially, we had entertainment every night and we had to be kind to the entertainers.</span> <span id="s4046">There were many second rate singers.</span> <span id="s4047">In the summer, we hired some girl to stand on the stage and sing and she would have been better at many other things -- many other endeavors.</span> <span id="s4048">We had to entertain a lot.</span> <span id="s4049">At times, we would go down six nights a week.</span> <span id="s4050">I don’t know whether it was seven (I balked at that), but six nights a week, we had to take people to dinner and sit and hear this entertainment.</span> <span id="s4051">Some of these girls had not changed their program one note -- not one word.</span> <span id="s4052">The same words, the same movements, the same dress, everything night after night.</span> <span id="s4053">To sit there for six nights and hear the same program, which was immensely dull in the first place…I acquired the habit of sleeping with my eyes open and I turned it off completely.</span> <span id="s4054">Anyhow, after six years, I wanted to get away and we left and we went back to Dayton where we had a home.</span> <span id="s4055">We had bought a home for my mother-in-law in Dayton, and we stayed there on Cornell Drive.</span> <span id="s4056">We wanted to get back to the ‘States -- for me to get a job -- to do something in the ‘States.</span> <span id="s4057">Unfortunately, in this business, it is like show business.</span> <span id="s4058">It is type casting.</span> <span id="s4059">I was known as a resort manager, as a Caribbean resort manager.</span> <span id="s4060">I had to offer something in the Caribbean.</span> <span id="s4061">I knew all the travel agents and all the people who brought business in and the groups.</span> <span id="s4062">In the “States I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s4063">I was looking for a job from May until December.</span> <span id="s4064">I was traveling around, going from California to New York -- having interviews.</span> <span id="s4065">Nothing really materialized until I got an offer to go to Puerto Rico.</span> <span id="s4066">Puerto Rico really was my very last choice of all the places in the world to go, but by that time, it was one of the offers I couldn’t refuse.</span> <span id="s4067">I became the Managing Director of a resort hotel, the Flamboyant Hotel in Puerto Rico, in San Juan.</span> <span id="s4068">So I went there in January or in December, 1967.</span> <span id="s4069">We came back in ’66.</span> <span id="s4070">The end of ’66 or in ’67.</span> <span id="s4071">I went to San Juan.</span> <span id="s4072">It was another interesting chapter.</span> <span id="s4073">It was interesting in many respects.</span> <span id="s4074">It was also frustrating business.</span> <span id="s4075">We had an apartment.</span> <span id="s4076">It was the first time, really, that we had an apartment in the city.</span> <span id="s4077">This was an advantage.</span> <span id="s4078">However, it was a time when the unions had decided to ruin the hotel business.</span> <span id="s4079">Really.</span> <span id="s4080">There were two unions which fought each other in San Juan -- the Teamsters and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers -- for the control of the hotels.</span> <span id="s4081">Each had to outdo the other to show what they can do for the people.</span> <span id="s4082">It came to a point that, we had a terrace at the hotel by the pool where we had informal eating, we had paper service, including paper napkins, and if a paper napkin fell on the floor, neither a waitress nor a busboy was allowed to pick it up, according to the union.</span> <span id="s4083">They had to scout a special houseman to go and pick up the paper napkin.</span> <span id="s4084">We had walkouts, too, all the time.</span> <span id="s4085">We had walkouts -- about one a week.</span> <span id="s4086">Every week, we had a walkout there for a few hours.</span> <span id="s4087">I took it until I left.</span> <span id="s4088">When did I leave?</span> <span id="s4089">In 1969, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s4090">LS: You left twice.</span> <span id="s4091">Why don’t you tell about that German fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s4092">A: That’s a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s4093">LS: I don’t know how you got through this interview without me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4094">A: I don’t know, either.</span> <span id="s4095">Somehow I managed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4096">Q: I thought I was being very thorough, but there are great, gaping holes that you’re telling me about.</span></p> <p><span id="s4097">A: A friend of mine came to me and asked me to hire a certain person in Puerto Rico.</span> <span id="s4098">Some other places had to let him go because they cut down on personnel.</span> <span id="s4099">He’s a good man, I was told.</span> <span id="s4100">At that time, I was thinking that I wanted to hire an assistant.</span> <span id="s4101">So I talked to him and this fellow turned out to be a German who was a young man in Germany during Hitler.</span> <span id="s4102">He went to “Adolf Hitler Schule.”</span> <span id="s4103">So he was a trained Nazi.</span> <span id="s4104">What I was thinking is that, and I think that I was stupid in that way, a man who was once a Nazi -- always a Nazi, when you go through this.</span> <span id="s4105">But I hired him, for he was a knowledgeable fellow and he was a personable fellow and because his background really had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s4106">What he did as a child was 25 years ago.</span> <span id="s4107">I hired him, but I think that he still was an unreconstructed Nazi.</span> <span id="s4108">One of the first things he tried to do was to stick a knife in my back.</span> <span id="s4109">Not an actual knife -- a figurative knife in my back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4110">Q: To get your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s4111">A: To get my job -- yes.</span> <span id="s4112">That didn’t bother me too much, but I can’t really talk very much about him.</span> <span id="s4113">I found that he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s4114">He was not very well liked.</span> <span id="s4115">He was too “Achtung!”</span> <span id="s4116">You know that type of fellow, and he couldn’t get this out of his system.</span> <span id="s4117">Well, so much for him.</span> <span id="s4118">We got rid of him eventually.</span> <span id="s4119">I got rid of him.</span> <span id="s4120">I fired him, eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s4121">Q: Was he openly anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s4122">A: No!</span> <span id="s4123">No!</span> <span id="s4124">No!</span> <span id="s4125">He was never anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s4126">Never a word!!</span> <span id="s4127">I mean, I don’t even know if he was anti-Semitic -- if his anti-Semitism was explicit.</span> <span id="s4128">I think his whole attitude was authoritarian.</span> <span id="s4129">He was a super race type person.</span> <span id="s4130">Don’t you think that was really the most revolting thing or repellent thing with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s4131">LS: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s4132">A: I think he had this superman personality.</span> <span id="s4133">I don’t think he was anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s4134">LS: Well, he probably was.</span></p> <p><span id="s4135">A: Yes, he probably was, but there was never anything -- any indication of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s4136">But that arrogance, you know this arrogance -- “I am here!</span> <span id="s4137">Look at me!</span> <span id="s4138">Siegfried reborn!”</span></p> <p><span id="s4139">Q: That is a good phrase.</span></p> <p><span id="s4140">A: So, so much for Siegfried reborn.</span> <span id="s4141">Where were we before that?</span> <span id="s4142">OK…So I left in 1969.</span> <span id="s4143">I gave notice and I started my own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s4144">Q: In San Juan?</span></p> <p><span id="s4145">A: In San Juan -- as Henry Steeber Associates, Incorporated, as consultant, and also as a manufacture’s representative.</span> <span id="s4146">I traveled a lot in the islands to get accounts.</span> <span id="s4147">It was a so-so business and then I had one very good account which carried me through, really, with a New York interior designer who established a subsidiary in the islands.</span> <span id="s4148">He brought in a fellow from Holland, or, I’m sorry, Spain -- a Dutchman from Spain.</span> <span id="s4149">We opened an office and I took him around to all the islands and I got him accounts, etc.</span> <span id="s4150">I worked with him quite a bit and that was rather successful.</span> <span id="s4151">I still work with these people at times.</span> <span id="s4152">In the meantime, number one, this was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s4153">I mean that I saw that this was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s4154">Number two, traveling in the islands, for me, was an unbelievable punishment.</span> <span id="s4155">Well, from Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands -- Saint Martin, Saint Lucia, Barbados, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s4156">Q: That is a wide territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">A: It sure is.</span> <span id="s4158">The plane schedules were quite approximate.</span> <span id="s4159">Either the plane came in or it didn’t.</span> <span id="s4160">The airports!</span> <span id="s4161">None of the airports were air conditioned because, they explain to you, in the islands, we are in the trade winds zone and the trade winds cool everything.</span> <span id="s4162">That is true between the twelfth and eighteenth of February, but for the rest of the year, it’s unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s4163">(Tape 5, Side 2)</span></p> <p><span id="s4164">A: Then you have Antigua.</span> <span id="s4165">Antigua is a big island, you know.</span> <span id="s4166">In Antigua you have the airport here and you have a hotel you want to go to here -- you can’t really see the hotel.</span> <span id="s4167">The only road goes around the whole island to get to this hotel.</span> <span id="s4168">And what road!</span> <span id="s4169">I would come back after a couple of weeks, a week or ten days in the islands -- sometimes I stayed longer than that -- and I would be ready to hang myself.</span> <span id="s4170">It was just murder, you know, the heat -- the constant heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s4171">Q: Indeterminate schedules?</span></p> <p><span id="s4172">A: Yes, very, very tough!</span> <span id="s4173">Also, my mother-in-law, at that time, was deteriorating.</span> <span id="s4174">She was starting to get some strokes.</span> <span id="s4175">We knew that she had to be put in a home.</span> <span id="s4176">We couldn’t keep her at home since she just needed constant attention.</span> <span id="s4177">There was nobody there who could move her.</span> <span id="s4178">So we came back.</span> <span id="s4179">It was a combination of reasons for us to come back.</span> <span id="s4180">We sold everything -- furniture and everything in Puerto Rico.</span> <span id="s4181">We came back in spring -- I think it was of ’69.</span> <span id="s4182">I think it was the spring or fall -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4183">Well, whenever we came back, in ’69 or ’70 -- I’m sorry -- 1970 -- in the fall of 1970, I think… and after taking care of family affairs, I was again looking to get some connections and made one with some people I knew.</span> <span id="s4184">I was trying to buy a motel here which doesn’t exist anymore -- the Travelodge downtown.</span> <span id="s4185">It was so mismanaged -- so run down.</span> <span id="s4186">It would not have been a bad property for a certain type of business.</span> <span id="s4187">The same people who owned it said I should go to Toledo.</span> <span id="s4188">They had a rather large motel there -- the Town House -- with a nightclub and dining room, etc.</span> <span id="s4189">It was a rather big property.</span> <span id="s4190">I should go to manage this.</span> <span id="s4191">That place was in a completely deteriorating neighborhood.</span> <span id="s4192">Number one, the neighborhood had turned black, considerably.</span> <span id="s4193">Number two -- and that was worse -- there was a shopping center catty-corner across the street.</span> <span id="s4194">It was just after the riots -- the Martin Luther King riots.</span> <span id="s4195">They wrecked the whole area, so while it had been a very popular place at some time.</span> <span id="s4196">For some time they had had a nightclub or supper club-type place with it, called the Acu Acu Room, which was very popular.</span> <span id="s4197">The then manager of the Acu Acu Room which the owners had let go to give me the place, was mob connected.</span> <span id="s4198">The Acu Acu Room was a mob hangout.</span></p> <p><span id="s4199">Q: Mafia?</span></p> <p><span id="s4200">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4201">The first thing that they did was to send the union in and make difficulty.</span> <span id="s4202">Anyhow, that place lost a great deal of money and that didn’t take long.</span> <span id="s4203">I had two partners.</span> <span id="s4204">The place was very run down.</span> <span id="s4205">There were certain things you could have done with it, for we hoped very much that that area would improve.</span> <span id="s4206">They had put a new road in and it was a good highway access.</span> <span id="s4207">I had a marketing study made by Harris, Kerr and Foster and they decided it would be OK, but only if certain changes would be made.</span> <span id="s4208">Then the place could be quite successful.</span> <span id="s4209">Now one of the owners, one of the partners, wanted to do it -- the other one didn’t want to do it, and I was in the middle.</span> <span id="s4210">Anyhow, the place went into receivership.</span> <span id="s4211">The court appointed me the Receiver, so I stayed there and received.</span> <span id="s4212">Then the place was sold to two people -- two real estate people.</span> <span id="s4213">They, in turn, made a deal with “Dutch Inns of America” of Coral Gables, Fla., Inc. to operate the place.</span> <span id="s4214">Dutch Inns came to me and made a deal with me that I would stay on as a consultant until the place has been finished and then I would take over as General Manager of the place, if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s4215">Now, the owners who had bought the place were supposed to make certain building repairs and do certain things to the building up to a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s4216">The lease was signed already, and they never came up with penny one.</span> <span id="s4217">So, eventually, I got a call from Dutch Inns and they had nothing to operate there, so I had nothing to consult anymore.</span> <span id="s4218">“We don’t have anything to operate.”</span> <span id="s4219">These people don’t come up with anything -- there’s nothing.</span> <span id="s4220">So I reverted to my old business.</span> <span id="s4221">One of the places I got was the “King’s Table” here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s4222">So I came to Dayton.</span> <span id="s4223">Do you know the King’s Table on First St?</span></p> <p><span id="s4224">Q: Is it a buffet?</span></p> <p><span id="s4225">A: It was.</span> <span id="s4226">It was a long time ago.</span> <span id="s4227">It’s not anymore.</span> <span id="s4228">It’s a restaurant and Charlie Brennan was there.</span> <span id="s4229">It was a place with seven owners and there was supposed to be a change.</span> <span id="s4230">If I wanted to, I could buy a piece of it, and so it was another mess.</span> <span id="s4231">Another mess!</span> <span id="s4232">I mean I just walked out of that.</span> <span id="s4233">Then I just did my little business -- whatever I could find on a consulting basis and doing certain things.</span> <span id="s4234">This is just about the end of the sad story.</span> <span id="s4235">There is no climax to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4236">Q: When was James born?</span></p> <p><span id="s4237">A: God, I didn’t talk about James!</span> <span id="s4238">This is terrible!</span> <span id="s4239">James was born, and there’s a whole story to it, too.</span> <span id="s4240">James was born in Aruba on February 16, 1962.</span> <span id="s4241">He was very inconsiderate because it was in the high season.</span> <span id="s4242">I never forgave him for that.</span> <span id="s4243">He was born in a hospital which would have done Albert Schweitzer proud.</span> <span id="s4244">It was with a courtyard with a walk around it and the rooms off it -- a typical tropical hospital.</span> <span id="s4245">It was run by an order of Dutch nuns.</span> <span id="s4246">All were very nice.</span> <span id="s4247">None were English speaking.</span> <span id="s4248">My wife’s doctor was Chinese -- Dr. Ho Kan Fu.</span> <span id="s4249">His vocabulary consisted of “Everything will be all right, Mr. Steeber.</span> <span id="s4250">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s4251">Everything will be all right!”</span> <span id="s4252">James was born by caesarian and I was waiting outside the operating room with Mrs. Berry.</span> <span id="s4253">The Berrys, both he and she, were the only people who were so special to me -- who were at our wedding and were there when our son was born and were at our son’s Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s4254">Those were the only people who carried through.</span> <span id="s4255">Oh, Berry -- I didn’t think -- I never considered…they were none of your relatives, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4256">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4257">A: I was waiting out there and James was being brought out fresh from the operation, rather messy looking, of course.</span> <span id="s4258">They had a sink there like a big slop sink, you know, a slop sink with a faucet, and the nurse went over there with him on the arm and turned on the faucet and held him under it and washed him off.</span> <span id="s4259">I said, “What happens now?”</span> <span id="s4260">The nurse said, “Oh, go to the room.”</span> <span id="s4261">There was the luggage standing there and I said, “Shall I take the luggage?”</span> <span id="s4262">she said, “No, we bring it, we bring it.”</span> <span id="s4263">We talked half Dutch, half Papiamento and half English.</span> <span id="s4264">You make your own language there.</span> <span id="s4265">There were service tables or carts and they put the luggage on the bottom shelf and they put James on the top shelf and pushed him along with his little feet sticking out, you know, out of his diapers, pushing him to the room where my wife was.</span> <span id="s4266">And then, when they got to the room, they found out there was no place for him.</span> <span id="s4267">They had no place to put him, so they rolled him back and took him to the nursery.</span> <span id="s4268">They had a nursery there -- a big nursery -- a very nice, big nursery there.</span> <span id="s4269">They put him in the bassinette overnight, you know, until they got something the next day to put him in with my wife.</span> <span id="s4270">That was James’ birth and then, the next step, I think, is the bris, the circumcision eight days afterwards.</span> <span id="s4271">I knew it would be a difficult thing at that hospital, so you couldn’t do it that way.</span> <span id="s4272">We didn’t have a Mohel (somebody religiously qualified to perform the circumcision).</span> <span id="s4273">We didn’t have a religious circumcision.</span> <span id="s4274">We had it done at the hospital by a doctor.</span> <span id="s4275">What a crook!</span> <span id="s4276">The owner of the casino, Jay Kaslov became James’ godfather.</span> <span id="s4277">So he invited over a lot of people before James was born.</span> <span id="s4278">I said, “Couldn’t we let people believe that it was a girl, at least until the time is over, so we don’t have to have a bris -- so we don’t have to invite everybody to the bris?’</span> <span id="s4279">We had about a hundred people there eventually.</span> <span id="s4280">Anyway, otherwise, it was a nice occasion, anyhow -- only the mother was absent.</span></p> <p><span id="s4281">Q: Have you been back to Germany or Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s4282">A: In ’58.</span></p> <p><span id="s4283">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s4284">A: Oh, I don’t know why, really.</span> <span id="s4285">I was in Dayton and I just had met Louise.</span> <span id="s4286">At the same time, I met her I made arrangements to go.</span> <span id="s4287">I just felt like getting away.</span> <span id="s4288">I wanted to go to Europe.</span> <span id="s4289">I wanted to go to the World’s Fair in Brussels -- that was the number one thing, and I wanted to go to London for a few days.</span> <span id="s4290">I was going to see Austria.</span> <span id="s4291">After all, I lived in Vienna for a number of years after the war.</span> <span id="s4292">It was not a thing that it was the first time of going back since it happened.</span> <span id="s4293">I wanted to go to Berlin, too, where I hadn’t been after the war and I wanted to see what changed.</span> <span id="s4294">So, at that time, it was very difficult to get air flights.</span> <span id="s4295">There was not so much in the summer.</span> <span id="s4296">There was very little trans-Atlantic travel compared to the planes we have today.</span> <span id="s4297">Finally, I got a place on Lufthansa (that is the German line).</span> <span id="s4298">They had just started to fly Lufthansa planes.</span> <span id="s4299">All the planes were, of course, propeller planes.</span> <span id="s4300">You sit there in your seat, you know, when you’re tall, sitting there on the aisle, trying to stretch your feet out with every stewardess falling over them constantly -- it was uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s4301">Eventually, you fell asleep, fortunately.</span> <span id="s4302">I fall asleep easily on a plane.</span> <span id="s4303">I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s4304">Suddenly came a voice saying, “Everybody put your seat up, please, we are all drinking coffee now!”</span> <span id="s4305">And I thought, “The German spirit has not died,” you know -- the Prussian spirit.</span> <span id="s4306">You know “everybody put up your seat!”</span></p> <p><span id="s4307">Q: Was it a satisfactory visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">A: Well, I will tell you, Berlin -- I didn’t recognize a thing, hardly, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s4309">I had lived there for ten years and I didn’t recognize a thing.</span> <span id="s4310">It had been completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s4311">In very, very few things you could pinpoint what something had been.</span> <span id="s4312">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s4313">Of course, they had started to rebuild quite a bit, I mean, in West Berlin.</span> <span id="s4314">the Kurfuersten Dam (one of the main thoroughfares) was very lively.</span> <span id="s4315">There were a lot of things being built up and even that area -- it was very hard to recognize.</span> <span id="s4316">In Vienna, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4317">No I don’t think that was satisfactory at all.</span> <span id="s4318">I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s4319">I visited some friends.</span> <span id="s4320">It was very bad weather.</span> <span id="s4321">It was constantly raining.</span> <span id="s4322">I went to the opera and to the theater and did the things I like to do in Vienna.</span> <span id="s4323">I stayed there for a few days and then I took, at that time, very, very inexpensive bus trips by Austrobus.</span> <span id="s4324">They were very good trips – very inexpensive trips also.</span> <span id="s4325">I had nothing else to do for a few days, and I knew that I wouldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s4326">I stopped in Salzburg and then I went on to Zurich.</span> <span id="s4327">I stopped in Zurich a couple of days and then Brussels and then to London.</span> <span id="s4328">I tell you, I did really have only a few relaxed moments in Austria.</span> <span id="s4329">You had a feeling of the Nazi presence.</span> <span id="s4330">Not that I had any experience or any personal things.</span> <span id="s4331">Nothing!</span> <span id="s4332">But it was absolutely, and I’m not paranoid!</span> <span id="s4333">You know, by now, I can’t be called paranoid in this respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s4334">Q: Was there anti-Semitism present overtly?</span></p> <p><span id="s4335">A: I don’t know…not really -- not overtly!</span></p> <p><span id="s4336">Q: Not overtly.</span></p> <p><span id="s4337">A: Not overtly.</span> <span id="s4338">No, not overtly.</span> <span id="s4339">I mean, you had to look for it -- probably if you looked for it.</span> <span id="s4340">I didn’t have any personal experience.</span> <span id="s4341">However, this feeling that the same -- that the same ways -- you know, still are there.</span> <span id="s4342">They were always very sweet to your face, most of them, and kicked you in the behind, but it was that way.</span> <span id="s4343">“Oh, how do you do Der Herr Steeber?</span> <span id="s4344">Der Herr Doktor, Der Herr Direktor or General Direktor.</span> <span id="s4345">Wie gets Herr General Direktor!”</span> <span id="s4346">All that bowing and artificial fawning.</span> <span id="s4347">I just couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s4348">It turned my stomach.</span> <span id="s4349">I was glad to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4350">Q: Have you become a U.S. citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s4351">A: Yes, in ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s4352">Q: Has this story -- has this life affected religious beliefs in Judaism in any way at all?</span> <span id="s4353">You characterized your pre-World War II youth as being not very religious -- assimilated.</span> <span id="s4354">Has that changed in any way at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s4355">A: Somehow you will have to have a lot of experiences with Jews to determine what makes a Jew?</span> <span id="s4356">I became more Jewish, but certainly not more religious.</span> <span id="s4357">Religiously, I would say that I am an agnostic, in the best of cases.</span> <span id="s4358">Maybe not an atheist, but since there are certain powers -- we don’t know what they are -- let us say, an agnostic.</span></p> <p><span id="s4359">Q: Well, you see, another way of asking that question, or, no -- a different way -- not the same question even, is, did the Holocaust affect your view toward God any?</span> <span id="s4360">That’s a different question from saying ,”Did you become more or less religious?”</span> <span id="s4361">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s4362">A: No!</span> <span id="s4363">No!</span> <span id="s4364">I had considerable doubts about God before and I had no reason to change my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s4365">Q: Now, you say you feel more Jewish as a result of your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s4366">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4367">I have considerable more feeling of solidarity with Jews now than I had before.</span> <span id="s4368">Before I could have viewed -- I never, really, was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s4369">(That is the desire of Jews to return to Israel).</span> <span id="s4370">I think it’s a beautiful thing for Israel.</span> <span id="s4371">Somehow I never brought up the Zionist spirit.</span> <span id="s4372">And I was in a very Zionist organization at that time.</span> <span id="s4373">I didn’t know very much about Zionism.</span> <span id="s4374">At one time, I probably could have viewed Israel in a much more cold objective light than I can do today.</span> <span id="s4375">Today, quite truthfully, I, if I analyze my feelings, I would say, if any injustices are committed in this area, I prefer the Arabs to suffer them than the Jews.</span> <span id="s4376">There have to be injustices.</span> <span id="s4377">It is not a situation where there can be any justice, and I think that the Arabs suffer a lot of injustices.</span> <span id="s4378">It’s hard to explain to them that it -- before the Arabs lived there -- that it was Jewish land so many years ago.</span> <span id="s4379">How do you explain it?</span> <span id="s4380">But I would say, after all these years, after all these injustices that have been visited upon Jews, I think it’s just time that it happens to somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s4381">Q: Now, a similar large question is your view toward what is currently called human rights in other areas besides the Near East.</span> <span id="s4382">For example, the Vietnamese refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s4383">A: It turns my stomach when I read about the Boat People and now I was happy that Israel admitted some.</span> <span id="s4384">I think the United States could do a hell of a lot more than we are doing.</span> <span id="s4385">Cambodia was an atrocity.</span> <span id="s4386">I think what happened in Cambodia -- I think that we are at fault.</span> <span id="s4387">Naturally, the easiest way and the natural way is to ask, “What can we do about it?”</span> <span id="s4388">We have no real comfortable thing except wringing our hands and deploring it.</span> <span id="s4389">But on the other hand very few of us really try to find out what could be done.</span> <span id="s4390">Even if we take an active part…what could be done?</span> <span id="s4391">If we would be asked to help, probably we would help, try to help, but none of us or very few of us take an active part and go out of our way to ask somebody else, “What can we do about it?”</span> <span id="s4392">It’s exactly the same thing -- what I am blaming and what other people are blaming is the American Jews, not the gentiles, but the American Jews before the war.</span> <span id="s4393">What they didn’t do!</span> <span id="s4394">Their idea of help often was having a cocktail party, you know.</span> <span id="s4395">This was their idea of helping the people.</span> <span id="s4396">So, it is unfortunate, but we are continuing this thing.</span> <span id="s4397">We are continuing this indifference to other people and I feel very badly about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4398">Q: I feel very much the same way that you do and it’s curious to me why, as I attempt to analyze my own feelings, why I find no sympathy.</span> <span id="s4399">Of all the sympathy I find with the Vietnamese, the Cambodians, the Cuban refugees, the Nicaraguans and so forth -- why I feel no sympathy for the Palestinians.</span></p> <p><span id="s4400">A: Because the Palestinians have simply been used as an instrument.</span> <span id="s4401">Now, things -- migrations or changes in population like those which happened in Israel have happened before.</span> <span id="s4402">This is not a new experience.</span> <span id="s4403">The only new experience is that the people have not been absorbed anywhere -- that they have been artificially kept in camps and kept in poverty and kept in misery, only to make political capital against Israel.</span> <span id="s4404">Let us take the post World War II period.</span> <span id="s4405">I would say that Breslau, which is Wroslaw today, was at least as German a city as Jaffa was Arab.</span> <span id="s4406">It was a pure German city, Breslau, and still the Poles drove the Germans out like out of Lower Silesia, out of Upper Silesia, out of a good part of Prussia.</span> <span id="s4407">There had not been a Pole living there anywhere in sight.</span> <span id="s4408">They put them in cattle cars, everybody.</span> <span id="s4409">I saw them -- under the most inhumane way.</span> <span id="s4410">Now, I had no great love for anything German in 1945, you may believe me.</span> <span id="s4411">My stomach turned when I saw how these people were treated.</span> <span id="s4412">They were pushed out of the area over into another part of the land, west of Oder River and left.</span> <span id="s4413">Everything was gone: their possessions, their houses, their farms, everything was gone with not a penny restitution.</span> <span id="s4414">“They are criminals -- out with them” was the cry.</span> <span id="s4415">What happened?</span> <span id="s4416">There was an outcry after the war and again some deploring and a question, “what are these refugees going to do?</span> <span id="s4417">They will be a source.”</span> <span id="s4418">I don’t know whether you remember that, “of future trouble, they will be a source of a future war!”</span> <span id="s4419">And all the forecasts…they were absorbed into Germany because Germany wanted to absorb them.</span> <span id="s4420">They were absorbed into Germany.</span> <span id="s4421">In a couple of years, nobody talked about it anymore.</span> <span id="s4422">They were absorbed.</span> <span id="s4423">That area is Polish.</span> <span id="s4424">In Wroclaw there’s no more Breslau.</span> <span id="s4425">It is Szczecu instead of Stettin.</span> <span id="s4426">Anybody who does tell you that Stettin was a Polish city is nuts.</span> <span id="s4427">All these cities, I mean, I know the area pretty well…it’s nuts to say -- I mean there was not one Pole living there -- not one Pole in that whole area.</span> <span id="s4428">That all is Polish now.</span> <span id="s4429">There is absolutely no question about it -- that this is Polish-- the refugees are out of there -- they’re out of Germany.</span> <span id="s4430">They have been absorbed.</span> <span id="s4431">There is no question that they are.</span> <span id="s4432">But what happened, do you think -- what happened in Palestine…in Israel?</span> <span id="s4433">What happened with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s4434">Q: No absorption.</span></p> <p><span id="s4435">A: No absorption.</span> <span id="s4436">Not a thing.</span> <span id="s4437">And intentionally -- no absorption.</span> <span id="s4438">They intentionally keep them out.</span> <span id="s4439">What did the Egyptians , our allies now, the Egyptians -- what did they do with these camps in the Gaza Strip, with these refugee camps?</span> <span id="s4440">After Israel took over, let’s face it, I think they lived with luxury compared with what they live now.</span> <span id="s4441">Of course, it is hard on them, but, for heaven’s sake, we have to stop sometimes.</span> <span id="s4442">We have to stop sometimes to believe, to believe that there can be two laws -- one for Jews and one for non-Jews.</span> <span id="s4443">That’s what existed for ages.</span> <span id="s4444">Whatever Jews did was judged on a different basis than what non-Jews did.</span> <span id="s4445">If a Jew was a crook, he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s4446">If a non-Jew was a crook, he was a crook.</span> <span id="s4447">Right?</span> <span id="s4448">This has to stop sometimes, and if that means war, if that means injustice, so be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4449">.</span></p> <p><span id="s4450">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
