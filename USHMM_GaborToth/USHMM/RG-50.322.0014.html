tell me where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Yes, I was born in Kurzeniez, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s9">KURZENIEZ.</span> <span id="s10">It is a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: It is not the name that it has anymore, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: No, it is the same name, even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Did it always have that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes, it always has had and always will have, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Oh, and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: It must be in a district or region.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes, it is near Wilaika, which is a bigger town.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: All right because there might be a number of places with that name.</span> <span id="s20">It was a small town then?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yes, a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Do you have a very clear memory of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, I remember this small town.</span> <span id="s24">I don’t know how many people lived in it but there were about 100 Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: About 100 Jewish families and how many others?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Probably the same.</span> <span id="s27">About half and half.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: You lived there until 1939 or 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We lived there really until 1942.</span> <span id="s30">In 1939, the war started in Poland.</span> <span id="s31">Half of Poland was taken over by the Germans and the Russians took over the other half of the country.</span> <span id="s32">So we had Communists for almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So this is east of Warsaw, some distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Oh, it is far to the east.</span> <span id="s35">It is really White Russia.</span> <span id="s36">Close to our neighborhood, it is already Lithuania but we were White Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: So the other people living in that town were Russians not Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, they were White Russians.</span> <span id="s39">That is, the gentiles were White Russians.</span> <span id="s40">There were Protestants, as they are here, and then there were Catholics and then the Jews.</span> <span id="s41">They all lived in the same place, in the same area, in the same neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Did you travel much?</span> <span id="s43">Did you and your family travel to other places very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No.</span> <span id="s45">When I was a child, I don’t remember any traveling at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: So you mostly just stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes, we stayed in the same place.</span> <span id="s48">Well, when my father was younger, he traveled.</span> <span id="s49">He traveled a lot to Poland and to the border with Germany because he dealt with them.</span> <span id="s50">He dealt with cattle at that time.</span> <span id="s51">He supplied cattle for the German army because he spoke German.</span> <span id="s52">He dealt with that.</span> <span id="s53">He was in a partnership.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was that a business which he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: It was a business which he started when he got married.</span> <span id="s56">He started it after WWI in 1918.</span> <span id="s57">However, from what I remember from when I was a child, my father had a butcher shop in our own hometown.</span> <span id="s58">For example, we lived in part of the same house to the rear and to the front of the house there was a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s59">This was my father’s business.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I have one brother and one sister who are alive, Thank G-d.</span> <span id="s62">It is my only brother who came to visit me now from Israel and my sister lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s63">We all went through the war in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did you know about each other at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: No!</span> <span id="s66">No, we did not.</span> <span id="s67">We found each other after the war.</span> <span id="s68">My sister ran away from the front in 1941.</span> <span id="s69">The Russians went and she went with them just to get away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s70">We knew in 1941 that the Germans were coming, so she went with the Russian people.</span> <span id="s71">The Russian people went.</span> <span id="s72">The real Russians who came over from Russia and stayed, they were working there.</span> <span id="s73">The Russian government had sent them to all the parts of the country from 1939 to 1941.</span> <span id="s74">At that time she went with the Russians, she went with some friends of ours.</span> <span id="s75">A lot of people from our town went.</span> <span id="s76">We couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s77">We started out and we heard that the German army was already ahead of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So you just went back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: We went back home and we settled and waited for whatever would happen to happen; I, my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s80">My father died just exactly the day the war started on Sept 01, 1939 and he knew that Hitler was already on his way to part of the country of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So he died and was buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: He was buried the right way.</span> <span id="s83">Everything might be considered normal with the funeral, so to say.</span> <span id="s84">Then we were in Sept. 1941, no Oct.</span> <span id="s85">The Russians had taken over until June 22, 1941.</span> <span id="s86">This is when the war started, when the Germans started the war with Russia.</span> <span id="s87">It took maybe ten days until the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s88">When we saw the first German military units, that is when the army units and the officers came into our small town.</span> <span id="s89">It was all mixed up.</span> <span id="s90">People didn’t know where to go, what it was all about.</span> <span id="s91">We knew that Hitler was bad for us, especially for the Jews, but we waited until time gave us some indications.</span> <span id="s92">The local people, really they started to loot like during all the wars, but especially our houses.</span> <span id="s93">They got whatever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Even while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s96">We were there, we had a family coming from another small town, visiting.</span> <span id="s97">They were not just friends, they were relatives really.</span> <span id="s98">When they came, they had a lot of luggage.</span> <span id="s99">They brought luggage with them.</span> <span id="s100">They came by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s101">So we had the whole house full with packages and the people started to loot.</span> <span id="s102">People came into the house from all around the little small towns, even smaller villages (than the one we lived in) farmers even some who didn’t who didn’t live in villages, they came to the small towns to loot.</span> <span id="s103">My mother recognized one person whom she had known and she talked to him by name.</span> <span id="s104">She said: “Why, this is mine, take mine, but don’t take from these people, they just left home.</span> <span id="s105">They tried to run, they didn’t know where to go.”</span> <span id="s106">People just ran, they didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s107">He got so mad that he broke my mother’s arm.</span> <span id="s108">It was already hard to get a doctor.</span> <span id="s109">On the second day my mother thought that it was broken and she felt that she couldn’t move it.</span> <span id="s110">It was also swollen.</span> <span id="s111">So she went to a doctor and the doctor put her in a cast.</span> <span id="s112">She had that cast for six weeks.</span> <span id="s113">When the German army came, they made up the “Kommandatur” (military command place).</span> <span id="s114">They organized the local police that means local people to maintain order.</span> <span id="s115">At that time they didn’t tell them what to do with the Jews.</span> <span id="s116">Everybody continued to live in their own room and house.</span> <span id="s117">What they asked from this local police committee was all the best of all the belongings such as gold or diamonds or pearls.</span> <span id="s118">You know, we had skins to make furs, like skins from sheep, we had to give it up.</span> <span id="s119">So much money to be collected.</span> <span id="s120">Especially from the Jews, not from the gentile people, just from the Jews, as a contribution for the German army.</span> <span id="s121">It had to be paid otherwise they would take a few Jews and they would kill them.</span> <span id="s122">What could we do?</span> <span id="s123">We gave.</span> <span id="s124">We brought it to one point which they had designated as the place where we had to bring it.</span> <span id="s125">We brought it and it was collected.</span> <span id="s126">Then the real problems started.</span> <span id="s127">They put out a call.</span> <span id="s128">All of the Jewish men and boys had to assemble at one certain place, it was in the market place of the small town.</span> <span id="s129">There were stores and places where most Jews lived all around this market place.</span> <span id="s130">That was so, because the Jews had the stores and the businesses.</span> <span id="s131">In that center of the small town, they gathered them all together for a whole day.</span> <span id="s132">They told them what they had to do in a day and they had to work and if they didn’t obey, they were going to be killed.</span> <span id="s133">If someone turned their head, there was a soldier right there and he just shot him.</span> <span id="s134">So they had to obey (the Germans).</span> <span id="s135">Then they left it all up to the local police.</span> <span id="s136">The local police did whatever they wanted to do, even if it was wrong and they really did a lot.</span> <span id="s137">They made a lot of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: In 1941, two or three weeks (after the Germans invaded) that is all the time it took.</span> <span id="s140">Then they had the local police giving orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The men were made to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s143">Especially the men and all the boys, not the children.</span> <span id="s144">They sent them to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, nearby.</span> <span id="s147">They sent them whenever there was something to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did they come home at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s150">They came home at night and they had to go to work from the very beginning on.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Were they paid at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Were any promises made?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, the only thing we got was like ration coupons to buy certain foods.</span> <span id="s155">Not a lot of food because they didn’t give a lot to the whole community not just to us Jews.</span> <span id="s156">We got less, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: But the coupons were good?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, we could use them for some foods.</span> <span id="s159">However, at that time food was not the problem.</span> <span id="s160">First of all, we had food which we had stored from before which they didn’t take away from us.</span> <span id="s161">We had wood for the first winter.</span> <span id="s162">We had a supply.</span> <span id="s163">Everybody had a little supply of food.</span> <span id="s164">Then the local people, the gentile people not from our hometown, the farmers, we went there and they helped us.</span> <span id="s165">We sold something and always gave them something in exchange.</span> <span id="s166">They didn’t take money because they didn’t know what the German money was all about.</span> <span id="s167">So during the war, we gave them clothes or whatever.</span> <span id="s168">Somebody had us bargaining for food.</span> <span id="s169">They brought us potatoes, flour, but they didn’t have sugar themselves because sugar was out .</span> <span id="s170">First of all, when the war started it was that whoever had a supply of sugar had sugar otherwise, they didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s171">It was the same with salt or with kerosene because we had lamps we didn’t have electricity yet.</span> <span id="s172">And then it was exactly at this time of the year, in October of 1941, it was the job of the local police really they seized some Jews whom they thought or they had in their mind were Communists.</span> <span id="s173">So they gathered them at night and they locked them up.</span> <span id="s174">They brought them to one place the next morning.</span> <span id="s175">They kept them the whole morning until afternoon.</span> <span id="s176">I myself was sent to work.</span> <span id="s177">I was only 14 years old.</span> <span id="s178">I was sent to work about seven or eight kilometers away from our town to the next bigger town.</span> <span id="s179">They sent us to work there.</span> <span id="s180">What we did there was really work.</span> <span id="s181">My job was to clean up a basement with a lot of books in Russian.</span> <span id="s182">All kinds of books and papers, something like archives.</span> <span id="s183">We had to pick it up from the basement and load it up on trucks and they took it someplace.</span> <span id="s184">We did the same the entire day.</span> <span id="s185">When we got home, it was our (Jewish) holiday which is coming in two weeks, Simchas Torah, we heard that all 53 people had been slaughtered.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: The 53 people who had been arrested the previous night?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, these people and amongst them were two cousins of mine.</span> <span id="s188">Two first cousins, some very handsome boys.</span> <span id="s189">One was maybe 22 and the other probably 19.</span> <span id="s190">Out of all of them, one person was left.</span> <span id="s191">He was a gentle man who had been put in that group.</span> <span id="s192">He was working for the Soviets but he was not a Communist.</span> <span id="s193">They probably needed him because he was now working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s194">This family, it was a special family.</span> <span id="s195">It was a mother and two sons, they were also to be slaughtered like cattle.</span> <span id="s196">So he stood up and he said, “Hold it!”</span> <span id="s197">to the German officers.</span> <span id="s198">“This family cannot be killed because of Communism.</span> <span id="s199">If you look at them as Jews, they are Jews, but they are not Communists because their father, her husband, is in the equivalent of a concentration camp in Russia.</span> <span id="s200">He was sent to Russia because he made a deal for grain and the Russians did not allow things like this.</span> <span id="s201">So they sent him to Siberia for five or ten years.</span> <span id="s202">The Germans heard that so they knew that she could not be a Communist because he was in jail there, so they let her go with her young son.</span> <span id="s203">But the other son, the older boy, he was given an assignment like that when (the others) were slaughtered, none of them were really dead.</span> <span id="s204">You know when they shot them they did not verify whether the victim was really dead, or not dead.</span> <span id="s205">They dropped them into a hole which they had to dig prior to their death.</span> <span id="s206">See, that is why it took them all morning to kill them until afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: So they were made to dig their own graves?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: They dug the deep hole and they threw them into the hole.</span> <span id="s209">That boy, that young man, he was five or six years older that I was, that means that he was then probably 21 or 22, he had to cover the hole (probably it was a trench) together with a few gentiles, who worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s210">He was the first one to cover the dead.</span> <span id="s211">He was so mixed up later, that he went crazy.</span> <span id="s212">He couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s213">It had been like a shock.</span> <span id="s214">The first time in his life -- the first time in all of our lives that we saw something like this.</span> <span id="s215">Prior to the killing, we saw that the Germans caught two people, not Jews.</span> <span id="s216">I myself saw it, two people, some farmers from a village.</span> <span id="s217">I don’t know why and no one else knew either.</span> <span id="s218">They caught them.</span> <span id="s219">They couldn’t speak to them because they couldn’t speak any German.</span> <span id="s220">The Germans were looking for somebody and maybe these people weren’t the ones they were looking for but they seized them.</span> <span id="s221">I went by there myself and I saw them, they hung them.</span> <span id="s222">It was shocking what people could do.</span> <span id="s223">We found it just shocking that people did things like this.</span> <span id="s224">But the other was the first real slaughter in our hometown.</span> <span id="s225">It was a few weeks after the Germans were really settled.</span> <span id="s226">These were the first 53 people who died, the first Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: They were picked up by the local police?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, they were locals because the Germans didn’t know who was who.</span> <span id="s229">You see the German people from the German Kommandatur -- you remember that that was really a military government.</span> <span id="s230">They didn’t know who was a Jew and who was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s231">They could care less!</span> <span id="s232">Later on, when the Gestapo (this stands for “Geheime Staat’s Polizei” translated into Secret State Police) arrived when the German soldiers went to the front, deeper in Russia, they set up a government type of administration.</span> <span id="s233">They were there for three years, after all!</span> <span id="s234">Then it was different.</span> <span id="s235">However, in the beginning, the Germans, especially the military, they didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: That lasted for a period of maybe six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">So the local police was the government made up of our local people.</span> <span id="s239">The local people, from our hometown, they knew who is a Jew and who is not.</span> <span id="s240">Maybe someone was mixed up with the Russians, when they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Were any of the local police Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No!</span> <span id="s243">No!</span> <span id="s244">They made a Jewish committee, something like our JCC (Jewish Community Committee) here in Dayton which takes care of the Jewish people around here.</span> <span id="s245">They called it a “Judenrat” in every small and big town, no matter where.</span> <span id="s246">There had to be someone in charge.</span> <span id="s247">For us, it was our teacher who had taught us sports.</span> <span id="s248">Here it would be a coach.</span> <span id="s249">He had been coaching the girls and boys in all kinds of sports.</span> <span id="s250">He had been a German Jew, a Jew from Vienna.</span> <span id="s251">Really from Austria.</span> <span id="s252">He spoke the best German.</span> <span id="s253">He was put in charge of the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s254">Now, a few more people had to be in charge.</span> <span id="s255">Someone had to be in charge or else they would kill all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Was the Judenrat ever asked, as for example, when these 53 people were arrested?</span> <span id="s257">Was it involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We had no Judenrat yet.</span> <span id="s259">We were free so that everyone could lead his on life.</span> <span id="s260">The Judenrat came later after things settled, it was just made up of local people, like our neighbors.</span> <span id="s261">We knew each other, as neighbors.</span> <span id="s262">Like neighbors knew my cousins.</span> <span id="s263">If they were mad at them or something like that or if you had something to say to someone or you didn’t like somebody.</span> <span id="s264">That was a time when you could do anything to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: There were about 800 people involved, did they all know each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, we had more than 800.</span> <span id="s267">We had 400 Jewish families and 400 gentiles (in our small town).</span> <span id="s268">It was half in half, but the people knew each other.</span> <span id="s269">It was just a small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Maybe 2,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes, we lived together for so many years.</span> <span id="s272">We knew each other.</span> <span id="s273">We had a next door neighbor like we have here.</span> <span id="s274">At that time, we had small homes in a small town.</span> <span id="s275">Next door to us we had a neighbor, a gentile neighbor, it was one family which spoke Hebrew and Yiddish as we did, because we played together.</span> <span id="s276">They had only one son who joined the Germans, that means the local police.</span> <span id="s277">He is the one, only he himself with his own hands caught my cousin who was driven to that slaughter but ran away from there.</span> <span id="s278">He had hidden in a place at the Polish teacher’s -- the one who used to teach us Polish in the school -- he knew the way to his place and he went to hide in his place.</span> <span id="s279">My neighbor found him there.</span> <span id="s280">That was my neighbor who knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Your neighbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, my neighbor who knew him.</span> <span id="s283">He knew that he was not there and that he had not been slaughtered.</span> <span id="s284">The neighbor went with a few more police.</span> <span id="s285">They found him.</span> <span id="s286">First of all they dragged him all the way back, that was a long way back.</span> <span id="s287">They dragged him back behind the town and they shot him only once and the neighbor boy finished him off.</span> <span id="s288">I wasn’t there myself.</span> <span id="s289">It was the story which was told me.</span> <span id="s290">This guy who was left alive just to cover up the hole, he was there.</span> <span id="s291">These were local people.</span> <span id="s292">As a matter of fact, after the war in 1945, no, in 1947, because we left Russia in 1946, my brother was there from the army.</span> <span id="s293">The Russian people dug them out (of the hole) and brought them to a cemetery, and put them into one grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Were there other times when people were rounded up like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes, a lot of times.</span> <span id="s296">Especially in my hometown because we never had a ghetto.</span> <span id="s297">They left us where we were.</span> <span id="s298">We stayed there until they liquidated the whole place.</span> <span id="s299">They liquidated it two weeks before the High Holy Days in 1942.</span> <span id="s300">The Germans knew when our holidays are.</span> <span id="s301">Always when it was a holiday they did especially nasty things: like ten Jews to be gathered for slaughter; 22 Jews there -- a few Jews here and a few Jews there; they came in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s302">They took them out of their beds and just slaughtered them right here at these places.</span> <span id="s303">Just like a cat and mouse game.</span> <span id="s304">We were not in a ghetto environment, that was different.</span> <span id="s305">Later on, they started to send Jews from our hometown to another city which was a bigger city and had a bigger Kommandatur.</span> <span id="s306">There were more Germans there.</span> <span id="s307">So they sent us to work and they made like a little concentration camp, a really little camp.</span> <span id="s308">As a matter of fact my brother was sent there and we had to bail him out through a Polish fellow whom we knew.</span> <span id="s309">I was working for a Polish family.</span> <span id="s310">I was young then but I knew that this particular Pole was a big shot.</span> <span id="s311">He worked with the Germans and he liked me.</span> <span id="s312">I did clean his house nicely and he liked how I did my job so he told the Judenrat not to send me anywhere else.</span> <span id="s313">He said that if they touched me, if they sent me anywhere else to work he would make a mess for them.</span> <span id="s314">He just liked me and he wanted me for himself and his family.</span> <span id="s315">He had a wife and two children and I took good care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Until the end of the day, until the day that they slaughtered the whole town.</span> <span id="s318">Until they slaughtered everybody.</span> <span id="s319">Until they liquidated (all the Jews).</span> <span id="s320">It was in 1942 in Sept. on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s321">I don’t remember the date.</span> <span id="s322">Three days before our New Year’s.</span> <span id="s323">Three days!!</span> <span id="s324">So, I worked there for over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: When you couldn’t work there anymore, where did you have to go?</span> <span id="s326">With the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I had to!</span> <span id="s328">There was much more to the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: We need to go back and get some more of the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: That’s right!</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Your father had been a cattle trader?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s333">At the beginning after he got married.</span> <span id="s334">Then he didn’t do it anymore.</span> <span id="s335">He settled in the same little town but he had a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s336">My mother helped him in it.</span> <span id="s337">That was until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Was it kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Did he have the equivalent of a high school education?</span> <span id="s341">How much education did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s343">You see I don’t think that when he was going to school they even had a high school.</span> <span id="s344">They had the local (primary grade) education then they went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s345">They learned in the Jewish prayer book.</span> <span id="s346">In the old times, the Jews were on their own to learn.</span> <span id="s347">But my father he was abroad before he got married.</span> <span id="s348">He was here in the United States.</span> <span id="s349">Then he came home (to Poland) after three or four years.</span> <span id="s350">He worked already in 1914.</span> <span id="s351">He was taken into the army.</span> <span id="s352">It was the Russian army at that time (prior to WWI there was no Poland since Poland had been divided in the1871 war between Russia, Prussia and the Austrian empire) truly the Russian army, in 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: So, he served for a few years?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: And he went to war against Germany.</span> <span id="s355">The Russians sent him to the front.</span> <span id="s356">He was taken prisoner and he was in Germany for a few years.</span> <span id="s357">Before that, he had already met my mother and they had become engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Before WWI?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, before the war.</span> <span id="s360">After he came back from America to his father’s house.</span> <span id="s361">My father spoke German.</span> <span id="s362">My father also spoke English because he had lived in America.</span> <span id="s363">So he was already more knowledgeable, more educated because of the traveling.</span> <span id="s364">Being in Germany for a few years, he spoke German, that is how he could deal with the German people.</span> <span id="s365">He also spoke Polish of course and Russian and Yiddish and Hebrew; he could manage with the papers.</span> <span id="s366">So he was not such an uneducated person.</span> <span id="s367">I don’t know what the equivalent would be but he didn’t go to high school.</span> <span id="s368">He didn’t have a diploma.</span> <span id="s369">I don’t think that they had a high school at that time in our little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: But he was a very knowledgeable and capable man with six languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: That’s right!</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: And your mother also?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: My mother was different.</span> <span id="s374">In those days, the women did not have much education.</span> <span id="s375">She went to a school like a Hebrew school probably.</span> <span id="s376">She finished the Cheder and probably at that time they spoke Yiddish and Polish, also Russian.</span> <span id="s377">Then she knew how to bake and how to cook.</span> <span id="s378">At that time, that was it.</span> <span id="s379">She also had to know how to be a housewife, how to raise children and how to manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And she taught you that also?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: That is right!</span> <span id="s382">Then, also, life wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s383">People worked very hard in those days in Poland.</span> <span id="s384">They worked very hard to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes, oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Most everybody.</span> <span id="s389">Maybe a few didn’t but I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s390">At that time everybody kept kosher, not like here now.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: And celebrated the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, and how!</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: And all the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s395">We celebrated all the holidays, like we say in Yiddish, “Fromm.”</span> <span id="s396">It was not like we say here a Conservative Synagogue and a “Fromm” (Orthodox) Synagogue.</span> <span id="s397">We never knew about Reform at all.</span> <span id="s398">There were Very Very Very Orthodox and then there were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s399">A Jew had to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s400">They didn’t know any other way.</span> <span id="s401">We were taught like this, they were all taught like from generation to generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Were all the boys Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s404">We didn’t have parties like here.</span> <span id="s405">This is just the opposite.</span> <span id="s406">Here they have the parties.</span> <span id="s407">The Bar Mitzvah is not so important here.</span> <span id="s408">For us it was the Bar mitzvah which was very important.</span> <span id="s409">And a wedding was a real wedding!!</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: For seven days?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: They celebrated every day.</span> <span id="s412">It was a real wedding the night of the wedding, the celebration of the wedding and the seven days were the seven blessings.</span> <span id="s413">They celebrated the entire week.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: People still do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes, but here it is just a bigger place, bigger city.</span> <span id="s416">It is more difficult to do that than in a little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So you children also spoke all the languages, also English?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, we did not.</span> <span id="s419">We spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s420">We went to school for it.</span> <span id="s421">I went to a Hebrew school and I spoke Hebrew and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: You spoke mainly Yiddish in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: At home it was always Yiddish.</span> <span id="s424">Then in 1939, the Russians came.</span> <span id="s425">T hey stopped all the languages and we went to Russian schools and we learned Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Russian besides everything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: We started with Russian and then we learned Russian very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Your father had a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s429">Would you think of him as being of average income in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: At that time it was average.</span> <span id="s431">There were a lot of poor Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: How did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A; As I said it was a small town and we knew about each other.</span> <span id="s434">A shoemaker was poor and a tailor was poor.</span> <span id="s435">So was a dressmaker lady who mended dresses.</span> <span id="s436">She didn’t make a lot of money.</span> <span id="s437">So we were above average, a little higher than average, but not rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: But there were some richer people?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, richer people.</span> <span id="s440">There were people who had stores.</span> <span id="s441">People who had bigger businesses such as sending out the material and buying.</span> <span id="s442">It was more.</span> <span id="s443">Maybe they had inherited more than my father did.</span> <span id="s444">My father did not inherit anything from his father because it went to the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: There was just one Synagogue in the town?</span> <span id="s446">Did everyone go to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, we had three.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Three!</span> <span id="s449">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: There were 400 families.</span> <span id="s451">It was a big community.</span> <span id="s452">Three beautiful Synagogues, all three in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Right near each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were they different from each other in anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s457">All about the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did they each have a Rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s460">We had like three Rabbis, no two Rabbis in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Two?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I believe that there were two.</span> <span id="s463">Two Reverends like.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: But three Synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, three Synagogues, one next to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: The one Synagogue didn’t have a Rabbi, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I really just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s468">(here follows a consultation in Yiddish with someone else in the room).</span> <span id="s469">We had one Rabbi for the first Synagogue and one for the third one.</span> <span id="s470">There were three Synagogues built together.</span> <span id="s471">The front Shul, the middle Shul and the left Shul.</span> <span id="s472">The front Shul and the last Shul had one Rabbi, our Rabbi.</span> <span id="s473">This was the bigger Shul, more congregants.</span> <span id="s474">So that is how they divided it up.</span> <span id="s475">And then we had a little place, just like we have here.</span> <span id="s476">Shomrai Enumah.</span> <span id="s477">Have you heard about them?</span> <span id="s478">We had a little Shul just a little place like a private home, and they prayed there.</span> <span id="s479">They were ultra orthodox.</span> <span id="s480">They were Hassidim.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Were there many Hassids?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, not many.</span> <span id="s483">But a few of them made their own congregation.</span> <span id="s484">They made their own congregation.</span> <span id="s485">So this was a small place, but the main Synagogues were three Synagogues.</span> <span id="s486">They were really beautiful Synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Were the Hassidim very different than the rest of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: The way of their prayers are different.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: They kept to themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: They kept to themselves just as they do here.</span> <span id="s491">The Hassidim are different.</span> <span id="s492">They pray differently.</span> <span id="s493">So they could not go together with us.</span> <span id="s494">It wouldn’t have worked.</span> <span id="s495">It wouldn’t have meant anything for them.</span> <span id="s496">it has a different meaning, like old Jewish traditions.</span> <span id="s497">But otherwise, the three Shuls were not different one from the other.</span> <span id="s498">They were just almost the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Was the Synagogue very much the place where people would do things?</span> <span id="s500">The center of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s502">The Center of life.</span> <span id="s503">The Shul was the center of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: People met each other there?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s506">The weddings were in the Shul and in the places around the Shul.</span> <span id="s507">Or a speaker came in and he spoke in the Shul.</span> <span id="s508">If a cantor came to sing, it was in the Shul and we had the Hebrew schools there.</span> <span id="s509">Most of our Jewish kids went to Hebrew schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: That was the main meeting place?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s512">It was a nice Jewish life.</span> <span id="s513">I believe that it was even more than here, as a place for Jews.</span> <span id="s514">It was a real Jewish Shtetl.</span> <span id="s515">Whenever you went that is where you went.</span> <span id="s516">Even the gentile people spoke Yiddish, mixed up.</span> <span id="s517">It was one family!</span> <span id="s518">And that is why we were shocked when the Germans came in 1941 and they really broke it up.</span> <span id="s519">It hurt us (mentally) because we didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s520">How could they do it to us?</span> <span id="s521">Here we lived with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s522">We had the first potatoes from the ground in the spring.</span> <span id="s523">They brought them to us so that we could eat them because we didn’t have a garden.</span> <span id="s524">Here it is impossible to comprehend that they would get together with the Germans and that they would help the Germans to destroy us, to kill us, to slaughter us.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did the other members of his family criticize him, do you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: They did not criticize him.</span> <span id="s527">They couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s528">No father or mother could criticize their children.</span> <span id="s529">No father or mother could do anything to their child.</span> <span id="s530">Maybe they were afraid of him.</span> <span id="s531">The father or mother really didn’t do any harm to us.</span> <span id="s532">They couldn’t help us.</span> <span id="s533">This guy was totally uneducated, maybe he went to school for one year, so he had a good opportunity there (with the local police).</span> <span id="s534">But his father, for example, and his mother could not help us either.</span> <span id="s535">They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Were there other people.</span> <span id="s537">Gentiles in the Community who would have helped you if they could have?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s539">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s540">First of all, we had not far from us in a small, small town, maybe a few blocks away where people lived by themselves, farming.</span> <span id="s541">You could call it a little village.</span> <span id="s542">The lady had worked for my mother and she had helped raise us.</span> <span id="s543">She used to come to my mother and cry: “I would like to save your children.”</span> <span id="s544">She had raised us when we were little and she used to take me in her arms and say: “I wish.</span> <span id="s545">I wish that I could save you.</span> <span id="s546">I wish, I wish that I could keep you!</span> <span id="s547">I wish that I could do something that you could stay alive.”</span> <span id="s548">But she couldn’t!</span> <span id="s549">it was too close to our town and one would have told another.</span> <span id="s550">This is what the problem was.</span> <span id="s551">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s552">The good people couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s553">What they did for us was to help us with food.</span> <span id="s554">They gave us always, no matter if we didn’t have something I exchange.</span> <span id="s555">They would give us food.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Was there anybody who was hidden during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: We couldn’t in our small town.</span> <span id="s558">They couldn’t hide us.</span> <span id="s559">As a matter of fact, it was in the second year at the beginning of 1942 that two young men, in my brother’s age, they went out of the town and they went into the woods to hide.</span> <span id="s560">Then they sent messages that we could go out and that we could survive there.</span> <span id="s561">Somebody, locally, found out where they were hiding and the police got them and they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Right out there in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Oh yes and one family they went out there to hide.</span> <span id="s564">They were wealthy people.</span> <span id="s565">And the local people round the wood knew it.</span> <span id="s566">In White Russia, if you start talking about woods, it is not like here, just a little bit, it is kilometers (km) and km of just woods, big old trees; and you could hide there forever.</span> <span id="s567">But the people were first of all afraid of each other.</span> <span id="s568">After the slaughter in our hometown, three days before Rosh Hashanah, we went out into hiding for two days.</span> <span id="s569">Later we went out and we were there for two years.</span> <span id="s570">I and my mother.</span> <span id="s571">My brother was separated from us.</span> <span id="s572">This is a story to tell.</span> <span id="s573">This is something you can tell about for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Were there any of the young men who got away during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: A few of them got away and then they were found.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: But they were all caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Eventually they were all caught.</span> <span id="s578">Later on, when the Russian army already fought back against the Germans, when the Russian people gave themselves up to the Germans they were slaughtered, in the prisons like the Jews.</span> <span id="s579">So they had a war there in Russia because the Germans killed the Russian people and the Russian soldiers -- they did not save them to, later on, get them out of the prisons -- but they killed them.</span> <span id="s580">So they didn’t surrender but fought back, they had no choice.</span> <span id="s581">So they sent people into the woods and that started out the Partisan war, and then we could hide and then we could be saved.</span> <span id="s582">Anyone who was there (in the woods) could be saved.</span> <span id="s583">My mother was then slaughtered there.</span> <span id="s584">She was caught by the Germans, by the German army</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When exactly was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: It was in 1943 already.</span> <span id="s587">It was a long way off from what we had been talking about.</span> <span id="s588">Much happened before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Tell me a little more about your town?</span> <span id="s590">The Shul was the main place in which Jews got together.</span> <span id="s591">Was there any place in the community where Jews and gentiles would get together?</span> <span id="s592">A theater, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s594">It was a Polish place.</span> <span id="s595">We were under Polish rule yet.</span> <span id="s596">It was a club like where I went.</span> <span id="s597">I used to play in every play, every year we presented a play.</span> <span id="s598">We raised funds for our school that way.</span> <span id="s599">We sold tickets anywhere.</span> <span id="s600">We performed a play, maybe with music and it was in the Polish place.</span> <span id="s601">It was not performed in the Shul.</span> <span id="s602">We needed a larger place.</span> <span id="s603">It was for everybody.</span> <span id="s604">Sure the Jews came to a Jewish play in Hebrew but it was in a local Polish club.</span> <span id="s605">It was a very big place and it was rented out.</span> <span id="s606">Across the street from this club was the Polish school.</span> <span id="s607">A lot of Jews went to Polish wochnachna (school) as they called it.</span> <span id="s608">A lot of Jewish kids went there.</span> <span id="s609">There, you didn’t have to pay.</span> <span id="s610">Yes, they went to school there and finished there their first seven grades.</span> <span id="s611">I went to Hebrew school because my father wanted me to have a Jewish education, since we did learn Polish in our school as a language.</span> <span id="s612">And we learned the Hebrew, we really got the Bible and the reading, the Hebrew and the history, everything.</span> <span id="s613">We also learned Polish geography and history.</span> <span id="s614">All the rest was in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Did most of the children do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Almost everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, a few of them went to wochnachna.</span> <span id="s619">A lot of people couldn’t afford it since it was a private school.</span> <span id="s620">We had to pay tuition and the tuition was high.</span> <span id="s621">If you had a few children there, particularly so.</span> <span id="s622">It was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Were there ever any Jews who got elected to public office?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: There were a few, but not in our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: It never happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: It happened in the big cities but not in the small towns.</span> <span id="s627">We had a good relationship with the Polish local government.</span> <span id="s628">They didn’t bother us until 1938 because the Germans were already sending out a lot of their own people like spies to Poland and it was like a cancer spreading all over Poland.</span> <span id="s629">We felt the anti-Semitism already.</span> <span id="s630">But before that we didn’t know any of it in Poland.</span> <span id="s631">We just lived with the gentile people together in peace and we dealt with them and they dealt with us.</span> <span id="s632">They bought from us and we bought from them and it was that we couldn’t succeed without them and they couldn’t succeed without us.</span> <span id="s633">It was just as it is here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s634">It doesn’t matter who my neighbor is we say “Hello” and he says “Hello, we are fine.”</span> <span id="s635">That is why in 1941 it was a shock to us, a real shock, we couldn’t believe it, what they did to us.</span> <span id="s636">First of all, this you have to know, when the Germans came for a few weeks only, we were free.</span> <span id="s637">We could walk anyplace.</span> <span id="s638">But there came an order that Jews were not supposed to walk on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s639">Just in the middle of the streets and we had to put on the yellow star in the front and in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did houses have to be marked?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span> <span id="s642">Usually in every small town and big town and big city there was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s643">However, in our particular place there was no ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: But they didn’t make any exceptions and mark the houses also?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s646">We just had to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s647">They knew that even if the Germans would not recognize us, our neighbors would recognize us.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Was it like on the upper arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No, it was on our breasts.</span> <span id="s650">The same thing on the back and in front.</span> <span id="s651">You got clobbered if you didn’t have it on.</span> <span id="s652">If you went into the street without it, then you got clobbered from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: By the police?</span> <span id="s654">How about the local people?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: The local people didn’t care one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Just the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes, the police, the local police.</span> <span id="s658">The people didn’t care.</span> <span id="s659">They didn’t bother.</span> <span id="s660">They didn’t bother to talk.</span> <span id="s661">They knew that eventually they would have everything of ours, everything that belonged to us.</span> <span id="s662">It would go to them anyhow.</span> <span id="s663">They knew, even the local people.</span> <span id="s664">They weren’t dumb.</span> <span id="s665">They knew that they would slaughter us.</span> <span id="s666">One day, another week, another one.</span> <span id="s667">Eventually we all would be killed because it went from one place to another place.</span> <span id="s668">One place was “Judenrein” (clean of Jews) and then the next place would be.</span> <span id="s669">Soon it would happen to us too, but we couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s670">There was no place to go to.</span> <span id="s671">I know that if I got to another place, another small town, it would be the same thing.</span> <span id="s672">Should I die in a strange place when I can die in my place?</span> <span id="s673">We knew that eventually we would be dead.</span> <span id="s674">But this is already the nature of human beings.</span> <span id="s675">If you are alive, you hope until the last minute you hope that you will be saved.</span> <span id="s676">That some miracle would happen.</span> <span id="s677">We all prayed that maybe something would happen at the front in the war.</span> <span id="s678">Maybe something would happen to Hitler.</span> <span id="s679">You have to live by this otherwise you are dead.</span> <span id="s680">You have hope.</span> <span id="s681">This is all we lived by.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: We are getting close to the end of this tape for this hour but we got a lot of information.</span> <span id="s683">Everything we wanted to know.</span> <span id="s684">First of all some of it even though I haven’t asked the questions, this has been very fruitful.</span> <span id="s685">I am, however, still puzzled.</span> <span id="s686">It is so strange that this one fellow, the neighbor, would do such a terrible thing as that, even though his own family would probably have liked him not to.</span> <span id="s687">They couldn’t do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: They didn’t do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did he think that the Germans would take care of him, whatever happened?</span> <span id="s690">That he would be all right.</span> <span id="s691">He just went over to the Germans then?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes, he worked with the Germans.</span> <span id="s693">He was one of the local police.</span> <span id="s694">He was so mad.</span> <span id="s695">As if something had turned over in him.</span> <span id="s696">He was divorced in our hometown.</span> <span id="s697">He was not alone.</span> <span id="s698">There were a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: A lot of them did similar things?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Oh yes, but most people, most of them were more educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: How about the people who had been on the police (before the Germans came)?</span> <span id="s702">There must have been a police department.</span> <span id="s703">Did they all stay on the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: It was like a transformation you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: All different people?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: You see it was Poland until 1939.</span> <span id="s707">Until 1939 the Polish police kept order, everything was normal.</span> <span id="s708">Then when the war started Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s709">We were taken over by the Russians.</span> <span id="s710">The Russian army came into our town.</span> <span id="s711">Up to Vilna, the Russian army took over.</span> <span id="s712">All White Russia was taken over by the Russians.</span> <span id="s713">So then, (after Sept. 1939), it was the Russian police.</span> <span id="s714">The Russians constituted the local government for almost two years.</span> <span id="s715">In 1941, the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s716">The Russians went with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s717">They went back to Russia, as well as whoever wanted to.</span> <span id="s718">A lot of people ran away.</span> <span id="s719">It was lucky for them they ran away to Russia and they stayed alive.</span> <span id="s720">Families ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So the police was a Russian police for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: The Russian police stayed as long as the Russian government was in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Was that the local police?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, local also!</span> <span id="s725">Yes, the Russians managed the local police, which worked with the Russians, and left with them.</span> <span id="s726">So, when the Germans came there was no police at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Just the Germans, as in German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: The army came in and they recruited local people for the local police station.</span> <span id="s729">They took whoever joined them.</span> <span id="s730">They didn’t choose.</span> <span id="s731">It was just the beginning, they just got in and it was wartime, it was not a government yet.</span> <span id="s732">So the local police governed.</span> <span id="s733">These young men, they were the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Just anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yes, they put an armband on with a swastika and that was the police.</span> <span id="s736">They took care of us (for law and order).</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Were they paid very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Why did they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: They wanted to.</span> <span id="s741">They knew that they would be able to do something against the Jews.</span> <span id="s742">They could do anything they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So they agreed to become policemen for the Germans because they could so something to the Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: That they could do something to the Jews and they liked the Germans and they didn’t like the Russians.</span> <span id="s745">They didn’t like the Russians and the Russian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You mentioned that the Germans already sent out people in 1938 as spies in Poland.</span> <span id="s747">Would some of these people who came to work for the police have been contacted?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Maybe yes.</span> <span id="s749">We didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: You didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Nobody knew but we knew that we felt it.</span> <span id="s752">As Jews we felt it, the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s753">They felt sure of themselves.</span> <span id="s754">They knew that Germany was strong and that sooner or later the German army would start out.</span> <span id="s755">They started by invading Czechoslovakia in 1938 already.</span> <span id="s756">They took a lot of territory.</span> <span id="s757">Then they started on Poland.</span> <span id="s758">It took them two weeks and they got Poland.</span> <span id="s759">They didn’t have a long fight.</span> <span id="s760">Poland didn’t have a strong army because the spies had already done so much.</span> <span id="s761">They sold out, the entire Polish army disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s763">So the spies were already at work?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: The spies were there in 1938.</span> <span id="s765">Already there were a lot of spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: They weakened the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: That is right!</span> <span id="s768">They weakened the whole Polish government.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: How could they do that, bribe people?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Anyway they could.</span> <span id="s771">Anytime they could get hold of anyone who worked or wanted to work for the government.</span> <span id="s772">If they were part of the fascist party or anybody else.</span> <span id="s773">Let’s face it they got help.</span> <span id="s774">They had their own people who worked for them there in every local government and everyplace.</span> <span id="s775">We knew it, we felt it, but there was no choice.</span> <span id="s776">You couldn’t go to the other part of Poland which is even closer to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Did your father ever think of going back to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: It never came to his mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: He didn’t talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: We didn’t have anybody in the U.S.</span> <span id="s781">The last year he was so sick.</span> <span id="s782">You see he knew, he read the German papers and the local papers, so he knew.</span> <span id="s783">When Hitler came to the government (in Germany) he knew that Hitler was not a joke.</span> <span id="s784">Before he died, he died of cancer, but he fought to the last minute.</span> <span id="s785">He already said, “poor Jews, Hitler will get here and it will just happen.</span> <span id="s786">Just what happened in Germany.”</span> <span id="s787">Because he knew what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s788">The Germans already had concentration camps.</span> <span id="s789">Luckily a lot of the German (Jewish) people were able to leave.</span> <span id="s790">They told a lot of them to go out of the country.</span> <span id="s791">Whoever went out, went out.</span> <span id="s792">The rest suffered the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s793">Something like what we lived through in our part of Poland.</span> <span id="s794">These German people lived in their part of Germany.</span> <span id="s795">That included the beating up of the Jews in the streets, exactly as happened in our place.</span> <span id="s796">They just beat up whoever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: When Kristallnacht happened, did anything like that happen in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: That was not one night only, it was many nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Were you there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes, you could not show a lot of nights on television!</span> <span id="s801">It was similar, it was just similar.</span> <span id="s802">Like they beat us up.</span> <span id="s803">They took some of the Jews in the marketplace and just beat them.</span> <span id="s804">Just beating.</span> <span id="s805">Like they took my cousin the same night, a very handsome young man, they took him to the police station and they held him the entire night and they beat him.</span> <span id="s806">They beat him so badly that he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s807">Then they released him to go home.</span> <span id="s808">When we went in to see him, since it was such a small town, it was my cousin, we went to see him.</span> <span id="s809">I remember that you sometimes see that on television, like the shows when they beat the people, they hang them up by the wrists (and then whip them) that is how his back was.</span> <span id="s810">When you see it with your own eyes you can never forget it.</span> <span id="s811">Even though it has been 36 or 37 years ago, but seeing it with your own eyes, it is like seeing it again and again and again on a TV show.</span> <span id="s812">You forget many things but you cannot forget this -- during the nights, the nightmares don’t let us forget!!</span> <span id="s813">Sometimes even I dream that I am running and that the Germans are running after me.</span> <span id="s814">They almost catch me.</span> <span id="s815">Here they catch me.</span> <span id="s816">Here I am running again.</span> <span id="s817">It is the same story.</span> <span id="s818">We ran so many times, so many times.</span> <span id="s819">It is not just one time.</span> <span id="s820">Here is, for example, one episode, which involves a rabbi, another first cousin of mine, they gathered ten people in a roundup.</span> <span id="s821">It was Friday.</span> <span id="s822">You see, they always do something on a holiday or on a Friday or on a Shabbos.</span> <span id="s823">So they took the people from the roundup to the marketplace, into the middle of the marketplace, across from his house.</span> <span id="s824">Since he lived at the marketplace where there are nice houses, they shot them in the middle of the marketplace.</span> <span id="s825">Before they shot him they beat the rabbi so much.</span> <span id="s826">He was a nicely built, tall guy and he didn’t cry, he just praised G-d that the ending was there.</span> <span id="s827">You know the prayer we always say for our dead, you know, the “Shma.”</span> <span id="s828">So the Gestapo let us, the local people bury him in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s829">Only the ten Jews in this roundup were buried in the cemetery, not just put in a pit.</span> <span id="s830">That is the case until now because when I brought my mother back from the woods, after she had been buried for three years there, I buried her in my hometown.</span> <span id="s831">I buried her in the Jewish cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: It was in 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No.</span> <span id="s834">It was in 1946 when I brought her back with my own hands.</span> <span id="s835">It was a long way to carry her home from the woods.</span> <span id="s836">It is a long story.</span> <span id="s837">This is interesting, but she is buried not far from the roundup with the rabbi with the ten people.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: That must give you at least some satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes, so I said: “I am leaving Russia for good (note that the Eastern portions of pre-war Poland was attached to Russia and Poland was given some territories of eastern Germany including East Prussia in exchange at the 1948 treaty).</span> <span id="s840">I don’t know if I will ever come back” But I had to do it.</span> <span id="s841">I could not leave my mother buried in the woods, thrown in a pit.</span> <span id="s842">So I brought her back and I made a funeral as it is supposed to be done, according to Jewish law.</span> <span id="s843">The day before sundown before the Shabbos.</span> <span id="s844">It was the end of March.</span> <span id="s845">It was cold but I made it.</span> <span id="s846">So that is what I did for my own satisfaction.</span> <span id="s847">This is, after all, the only thing you could do, what else, nothing was left after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: That was something you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I was able to do it.</span> <span id="s850">Luckily I was saved.</span> <span id="s851">My brother was saved in a different way and my sister was saved in a different way.</span> <span id="s852">It was all different.</span> <span id="s853">We got together after the war and found each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: The tape is almost over and I don’t want to have it run out in the middle of a sentence so I will stop it and start again maybe one week from today.</span> <span id="s855">Next week, Thursday?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: I don’t think we can do it next Thursday because my brother is leaving.</span> <span id="s857">Next week my son will be here, maybe yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Since we talked last, I listened to the tape and there are a couple of things I need to clarify and it may be helpful to do that right now.</span> <span id="s859">I did not ask about your grandparents.</span> <span id="s860">Do you know the occupation about your father’s father?</span> <span id="s861">He also lived in Kurzeniez, am I saying it correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yes, the accent is on the second syllable in Polish and it is slightly different in Russian.</span> <span id="s863">We used the Polish name because we were living in Poland.</span> <span id="s864">Both my grandparents on my father’s side were from that place.</span> <span id="s865">Their parents, my great grandparents lived also in the same place.</span> <span id="s866">They had lived there for generations.</span> <span id="s867">I just remember them from when I was little.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: I have forgotten whether I asked whether your father had brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s870">Six brothers but only one brother and one sister lived in the same town.</span> <span id="s871">The rest were scattered all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: A long distance away?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s874">Far far away.</span> <span id="s875">One was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s876">One was in Minsk and another Bolushnik, another place in White Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Doing the same kind of things your father did, running a shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yes, most of them.</span> <span id="s879">No, in Russia they worked.</span> <span id="s880">One brother was also a butcher.</span> <span id="s881">One made hats for the police and such.</span> <span id="s882">You know, the police wore different hats as they do today.</span> <span id="s883">He was the only one in that place to make them.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You had to get a special shape, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s886">He had a specialized shop.</span> <span id="s887">He was a specialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: And your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: They came from a different place.</span> <span id="s890">My mother came from a different place.</span> <span id="s891">She married my father and moved to Kurzeniez.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Was it far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: It was kind of far but also in Poland.</span> <span id="s894">From the same area but pretty far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: You said that it was near the Russian border.</span> <span id="s896">How far was it from Russia?</span> <span id="s897">How far was it from Latvia?</span> <span id="s898">It was in northeastern Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Latvia was to the north.</span> <span id="s900">It was one of the Baltic States and we were in White Russia to the east, rather southeast.</span> <span id="s901">To the south of us it was already not White Russia.</span> <span id="s902">It was Prussia.</span> <span id="s903">It was a different area altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: OK, now I can see it on the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: So, we were kind of in the middle, closer to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Then I was wondering about the different schools, not to spend too much time on it.</span> <span id="s907">But there was the Hebrew school and then there was the town school, where Polish was spoken.</span> <span id="s908">It cost tuition to go to the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s909">Did all the girls go to Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s911">The tuition is right and the schooling was the same for girls and boys.</span> <span id="s912">But only those who could afford it went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s913">They sent their children to have a religious education and those who couldn’t afford it went to public school.</span> <span id="s914">In public school the first seven grades were free.</span> <span id="s915">Like here, exactly.</span> <span id="s916">Instruction was only in one language, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Did as many girls as boys go to the Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s919">Maybe there were more boys because their fathers wanted their sons to know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s920">To know the prayers, but then all the Jewish kids, or most of them at least, who did not go to Hebrew school, they had a Cheder.</span> <span id="s921">It was taught by a rebbbe, not a rabbi like in a synagogue, but a rebbe who taught only the Bible and to become Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Did he teach the Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s924">Torah and prior to the time we started on the Torah, we have to go to the beginning of the Bible and the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s925">Like writing and reading because they did not go to Hebrew school, as well as later to become Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Did the girls get to be Bat Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Very seldom.</span> <span id="s928">We knew that there is such a thing as a Bat Mitzvah at thirteen, but we did not have this famous things like the girls have here of becoming Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s929">It was not the custom.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Were you aware, obviously you were a child then, of the kind of education which your brother had?</span> <span id="s931">You were not Hassidic?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No.</span> <span id="s933">We were just Orthodox.</span> <span id="s934">You see we didn’t have Conservative or Reform.</span> <span id="s935">Except for the Hassidim, there was one Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s936">There were different groups, but otherwise everybody was just the same.</span> <span id="s937">The basic Jewish education was the same.</span> <span id="s938">But a rabbi had more, he had a license.</span> <span id="s939">You also had to know more to be a rabbi, like the teachers were.</span> <span id="s940">You had to finish school for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: They all had that, however there was something like a “mousssar” movement.</span> <span id="s942">It was kind of like a reform movement in education.</span> <span id="s943">Did you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A; Not in our small town!</span> <span id="s945">Maybe in a big city but not in small towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: You never heard about it?</span> <span id="s947">You didn’t have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: No.</span> <span id="s949">we didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s950">No, we just had the Hebrew school and the Cheder.</span> <span id="s951">The “Misnadim” like.</span> <span id="s952">Just two parts.</span> <span id="s953">In our own synagogue for example, it was divided.</span> <span id="s954">We had the, the word “Misrarhet” means something like against.</span> <span id="s955">It is “their way.”</span> <span id="s956">That is what it says.</span> <span id="s957">Well, traditionally the Jewish rituals are the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: I wondered whether that movement was present?</span> <span id="s959">Whether it had made any impact in your town?</span> <span id="s960">Okay.</span> <span id="s961">So you remember anything else about the religious education, or what went on in the Cheder or in the Hebrew school or in the Synagogue that you would like to mention now?</span> <span id="s962">Something especially important or unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Hebrew school was the same as other schools.</span> <span id="s964">We had Hebrew, most of the teaching was in Hebrew and then we had the Bible and the Torah, of course, and we had Polish as a language and Polish history.</span> <span id="s965">However, otherwise than that it was just a regular school.</span> <span id="s966">One just finished just basic schooling there until the war.</span> <span id="s967">That is what I had time to finish</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Yes, until you were fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s969">Well, I just wondered about that.</span> <span id="s970">I also wondered about the town.</span> <span id="s971">You mentioned that amongst the Christians here were both Catholics and Protestants.</span> <span id="s972">Do you have a clear memory about how many of the Christians were Protestants, half in half?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Really, in the town where we lived we had more Protestants than Catholics.</span> <span id="s974">I do remember that on Sunday when the churches had services we noticed where more people went since they were in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: You mentioned that people pretty much got along one with the other, like half in half, Jewish and Christian.</span> <span id="s976">It appears unusual to me that there were a lot of Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: That was because we were in the White Russian area.</span> <span id="s978">We were not in Poland proper.</span> <span id="s979">Poland had more Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: So the fact that there was not so much anti-Semitism in your area had to do with the fact that it was White Russia rather than with the fact that there was a large number of Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: You see, before the war, until 1938 we didn’t know or feel any anti-Semitism because we lived in harmony.</span> <span id="s982">It was a small place, everybody knew everybody so we didn’t feel anything.</span> <span id="s983">.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Were the Protestants more open, more willing to be free and easy with Jews than the Catholics or don’t you know?</span> <span id="s985">Maybe that is too difficult a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: No, no, not different at all.</span> <span id="s987">We didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s988">At least we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s989">We didn’t notice anything from the other side.</span> <span id="s990">No, we especially led our lives.</span> <span id="s991">You know every Jew had his own home.</span> <span id="s992">Not many were mixed up with the government and things like politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Let’s see now about the sequence of dates.</span> <span id="s994">The Russians moved in Oct 1939.</span> <span id="s995">Then in Sept of ’41 about two years later, the Germans came in, the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No, that was earlier.</span> <span id="s997">The war started in June, so they came in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: All right, in the beginning of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yes, eight days after the war started on June 22.</span> <span id="s1000">Then the Germans were already to be seen.</span> <span id="s1001">In the middle of July the Germans were already well established in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: So that would be June 30 and when the 53 people were taken that was about the time of the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: In October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: In October.</span> <span id="s1005">So, there was a period of a couple of months or three months.</span> <span id="s1006">Now, I just want to establish the dates.</span> <span id="s1007">How long did it take for the Judenrat to be set up?</span> <span id="s1008">Was that during the same fall, after the 53 were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1010">That’s right!</span> <span id="s1011">I will tell you why I can place it.</span> <span id="s1012">The Germans, not the Germans but the local police ordered the Jews to clean out the house at the market place.</span> <span id="s1013">They moved the lady out of there.</span> <span id="s1014">Prior to that, the same house had been occupied by the Russian police.</span> <span id="s1015">The young men, whoever were there, all the men who worked there had to move out the furniture from the police station, the Russian police station.</span> <span id="s1016">It had all been locked up.</span> <span id="s1017">They moved it out and they claimed that they found papers from people who had filed some kind of petitions.</span> <span id="s1018">Anyhow, they got names.</span> <span id="s1019">According to those papers, anybody who had their names there for any reason, they figured that they were mixed up with the communists.</span> <span id="s1020">After that, they had a list and they went according to the list and then they picked the people up at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And those were the 53 victims?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Those were the 53.</span> <span id="s1023">After these 53 died, they set up the Judenrat at the very same place.</span> <span id="s1024">In the same house, after it had been cleaned out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: So the Germans took the initiative to clean the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: It was not the Germans yet really.</span> <span id="s1027">It was just the local government.</span> <span id="s1028">The local police.</span> <span id="s1029">In our hometown, we did not have many Germans staying there, but five miles further in Vilejka they had a kommandatur.</span> <span id="s1030">The local kommandatur was made up of one or two Germans.</span> <span id="s1031">Most of the Gestapo and the S.S. (the black shirted Nazis of the Schutz Staffel or Security Guards) stayed in the bigger city, five miles from us.</span> <span id="s1032">Whenever they needed something to do they had their men available anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So the Judenrat was set up a little after the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1035">Just after the holidays.</span> <span id="s1036">The Judenrat was set up to tell us whatever we had to do.</span> <span id="s1037">For example, they had to bring so much for the German government to collect that sum from the Jews, or they had to send so many people to work in one place and so many people to send to another place.</span> <span id="s1038">So the Judenrat had to do their bidding.</span> <span id="s1039">They had to take care of it.</span> <span id="s1040">They took care of everything except, of course, harming and killing.</span> <span id="s1041">The Gestapo came in for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So the Judenrat existed there and in Sept of ’42 about one year later, when the Germans evicted the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Oh, just three days before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s1044">Whenever it comes out, three days before but the Judenrat was there as long as the Jews were there.</span> <span id="s1045">In Sept in ’42, just three days before Rosh Hashanah, it took them but a few days to liquidate the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: To liquidate the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1048">We didn’t have a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1049">We each lived in our own places.</span> <span id="s1050">What they did was that they surrounded the town in the morning fog.</span> <span id="s1051">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1052">It was just all of a sudden and whoever went to work in the morning was caught and that is how they went from house to house.</span> <span id="s1053">Whoever was caught on their first day, they brought him to the end of the town, in just a field and they made a fire and they burned them.</span> <span id="s1054">We were in a hiding place for two days that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: They must have had several hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: More than that.</span> <span id="s1057">At least 1,500.</span> <span id="s1058">It took them two to three days to kill them because for two days we were hiding and seeing everything which was going on.</span> <span id="s1059">When we went out, the second night, we smelled it and we saw just a little flame.</span> <span id="s1060">We could just see it as we went by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: All in one open field then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: All in one open field.</span> <span id="s1063">They just scattered the ashes and at the end they couldn’t do it any longer.</span> <span id="s1064">So the third day, whoever was caught on that third day, they just shot them and put them in holes in ditches and they covered it.</span> <span id="s1065">When we came back we found the one mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: How many people were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Quite a few people, thank goodness, because my brother, you met him here before he left.</span> <span id="s1068">He went to work early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1069">You see, in our town was a distribution station for power and light and together with the distribution station they had a sawmill.</span> <span id="s1070">We called it the Tartack at home and a lot of people worked there.</span> <span id="s1071">They had Germans watching that day and night because it was the main switching station and they were afraid that someone may sabotage it.</span> <span id="s1072">So my brother went early in the morning to work with another fellow.</span> <span id="s1073">When they were already half way, another fellow, who was a good friend, he was a gentile man, he was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1074">He went out of his house and he met them both.</span> <span id="s1075">The fellow who was with my brother was a friend from school of this Catholic man.</span> <span id="s1076">The Catholic man told them, “Turn back because today is the end!</span> <span id="s1077">Today is the day!”</span> <span id="s1078">He didn’t have to say anymore.</span> <span id="s1079">He was afraid to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1080">My brother came home.</span> <span id="s1081">While he was walking home, whomever he met in the street outside he said, “If you have a hiding place -- it is “scrony’ in White Russian -- go ahead and hide because there is nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1082">The town is surrounded by the Germans and this is the day.”</span> <span id="s1083">So from our street that I know, people had hiding places and they hid and they scattered into the woods and we met later on.</span> <span id="s1084">Whoever didn’t know and went to work as usual to their own jobs like I had to go to work at that Polish family, they got caught and killed.</span> <span id="s1085">I worked for that Polish family, the fellow I worked for was there.</span> <span id="s1086">A big shot at the power and light station.</span> <span id="s1087">My mother had to go to work in the woods, whatever odd jobs they got.</span> <span id="s1088">My brother woke me up and he said.</span> <span id="s1089">“You are not going to work.”</span> <span id="s1090">I said, “How come?</span> <span id="s1091">I have to go!”</span> <span id="s1092">because I had to buy some food for the Polish family.</span> <span id="s1093">I would stop by the store on my way to work to buy the food for her and take it to her home.</span> <span id="s1094">My brother said, “No, you can’t go!</span> <span id="s1095">Dress and let’s go out and we will go to our hiding place.”</span> <span id="s1096">My brother had built this hiding place.</span> <span id="s1097">We took another mother and daughter, neighbors and a little orphan boy with us.</span> <span id="s1098">The boy had been orphaned in another place from where he ran away and came to our hometown.</span> <span id="s1099">We hid there for three days and we saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s1100">Just 15 or 20 minutes after we were there in the attic.</span> <span id="s1101">It was in the attic he had made a double wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Yes, so the hiding place was right in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yes, right next to our home.</span> <span id="s1104">Our house was facing the street and it was to the back of us, a small house.</span> <span id="s1105">My brother built another wall in the attic there with a little door behind the chimney.</span> <span id="s1106">We all went in there.</span> <span id="s1107">We couldn’t lay down in that small room, we could only sit down, since it was such a small area.</span> <span id="s1108">We remained there for two days.</span> <span id="s1109">Through the wooden frames, all the houses had wooden frames, we could peek, actually through the roof.</span> <span id="s1110">We could see how the Germans went around with the local police.</span> <span id="s1111">They went from house to house just looking for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1112">Wherever they could find them.</span> <span id="s1113">They went around the houses, behind the houses, inside every room and they turned everything upside down.</span> <span id="s1114">At our neighbors, they caught them right away.</span> <span id="s1115">We listened to the neighbors as she was begging them, “Why?</span> <span id="s1116">Just leave me, let me live!”</span> <span id="s1117">They took him out from the basement.</span> <span id="s1118">That was just next door to us.</span> <span id="s1119">Then one of the neighbors, a young man, he started to run so they shot him right there.</span> <span id="s1120">We understood because we could understand German, we could also understand the local people, the White Russians.</span> <span id="s1121">We understood when they said, “You can’t run!</span> <span id="s1122">There is no place to run.</span> <span id="s1123">The town is surrounded.</span> <span id="s1124">Wherever you go, you can’t escape!</span> <span id="s1125">This is the end for you.”</span> <span id="s1126">As I said, we stayed up there two days and the second day in the morning, we heard our next door neighbor, they packed everything in their wagon and they said that there was a fire, that someone had made a fire.</span> <span id="s1127">The way they were talking we knew the couple, they were a childless couple.</span> <span id="s1128">They were a Jewish couple.</span> <span id="s1129">They were rich people.</span> <span id="s1130">They decided not to give in to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1131">They took their own lives and made a fire.</span> <span id="s1132">Obviously it started to burn.</span> <span id="s1133">Of course, in a small town if one house goes the rest of town catches fire.</span> <span id="s1134">However here, they didn’t want that to happen.</span> <span id="s1135">The local people, the people who had a lot at stake because they had all the goods in their houses, they didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s1136">They didn’t want everything to go up in flames.</span> <span id="s1137">So they fought the fire.</span> <span id="s1138">We heard the racket when they put the fire out and they found the couple dead in their house.</span> <span id="s1139">We still sat there for an entire night.</span> <span id="s1140">As a matter of fact, that neighbor of ours, who was so good to us, when the Germans went to look (for us) -- she couldn’t speak with the Germans -- so she said that the Jews were in the attic.</span> <span id="s1141">The Germans didn’t know what attic and in what house.</span> <span id="s1142">But the Germans didn’t want to go because when we had our ladder we had dropped it.</span> <span id="s1143">You see the ladder had been dropped on the ground.</span> <span id="s1144">So they didn’t know which attic and what she was talking to them.</span> <span id="s1145">They didn’t want to waste time and they didn’t want to go up so they sent him.</span> <span id="s1146">He put the ladder back up and we were sitting there and we were just sitting like mice not moving hardly breathing.</span> <span id="s1147">He went up, he took something down.</span> <span id="s1148">Something in a copper container and he said, “I could see nobody.”</span> <span id="s1149">During all that time we were so quiet.</span> <span id="s1150">If he had seen somebody or he would even hear something that would have been it.</span> <span id="s1151">However, fortunately he didn’t see anything and he didn’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s1152">He didn’t go behind the chimney.</span> <span id="s1153">He just went up and since he didn’t see anything there, so he went back down.</span> <span id="s1154">He couldn’t see anything because my brother had made the wall of old wood.</span> <span id="s1155">The same wood matching the original wall.</span> <span id="s1156">So he went down and luckily for us, he left the ladder up.</span> <span id="s1157">That was good for us since we waited through the night.</span> <span id="s1158">At night my brother went down first on the ladder then we followed him.</span> <span id="s1159">That is how we went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: So you didn’t see the Germans?</span> <span id="s1161">They had gone from around the town by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes, it was at night.</span> <span id="s1163">The second day already.</span> <span id="s1164">But we heard everything and we heard everybody talking.</span> <span id="s1165">We knew everything because we heard it all.</span> <span id="s1166">At night they had the watch.</span> <span id="s1167">We called it “die patrol.”</span> <span id="s1168">They went all around the town and all the places.</span> <span id="s1169">So we had heard everything and we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1170">We knew who even died, because as a matter of fact this same neighbor of ours, who had talked to the Germans, the husband and wife said to their own friends.</span> <span id="s1171">She said that she didn’t see my mother.</span> <span id="s1172">They even called her by my father’s name.</span> <span id="s1173">My mother and the children did not see them.</span> <span id="s1174">So she said that they must be hiding someplace.</span> <span id="s1175">You see, they knew who was there and who was not.</span> <span id="s1176">You see it was as I told you --– we all knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: But they didn’t tell the Germans though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: She just couldn’t say.</span> <span id="s1179">She just mumbled that she saw all of the people.</span> <span id="s1180">She didn’t see my mother there dying -- so she didn’t know where we are.</span> <span id="s1181">She thought maybe we ran out and maybe we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1182">She might have said it (to the Germans) but she didn’t know!</span> <span id="s1183">That is how we waited up through the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: That was just about New Year’s day (the Jewish New Year’s, I meant).</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, it was the day before New Year’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Was your mother with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1188">My mother was with me until 1943, February 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Oh, for another five or six months then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1191">We were in the woods already hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Many people were in hiding that way after the round up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: From our town maybe, thanks to my brother, quite a few.</span> <span id="s1194">He had warned a lot of people from our street.</span> <span id="s1195">They went to their hiding places and then escaped because we had no choice.</span> <span id="s1196">Most people had hiding places.</span> <span id="s1197">We had no choice because there was no other way, either you die in the hiding place or you die by the Germans unless you go into the woods.</span> <span id="s1198">By that time, we already knew that we could survive in the woods.</span> <span id="s1199">We had at least a chance to survive there.</span> <span id="s1200">As a matter of fact, we did.</span> <span id="s1201">A lot of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1202">Just as my mother was killed there by the Germans and by the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: So maybe 50 or 100 people got away that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Oh more!</span> <span id="s1205">We had around 300 people from our hometown who got out but they got killed later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: But maybe 1,000 did not get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1208">More than 1,500.</span> <span id="s1209">They were slaughtered like sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Well.</span> <span id="s1211">Then the Judenrat also went out of existence at the same time, so maybe before going on we should talk about that.</span> <span id="s1212">It is important to know about the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1213">What was the name of the man who was the head of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Schatz.</span> <span id="s1215">He was a teacher of sports.</span> <span id="s1216">He had run away from Austria.</span> <span id="s1217">He was an Austrian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: He left from there after the Anschluss in 1938?</span> <span id="s1219">(That is when Germany occupied Austria).</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: I guess, because he was there already in 1939, when the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s1221">He was our teacher.</span> <span id="s1222">His name was spelled S-C-H-A-T-Z.</span> <span id="s1223">I forgot his first name.</span> <span id="s1224">I believe he was Viennese.</span> <span id="s1225">He had been educated there.</span> <span id="s1226">He couldn’t speak any Russian or any Polish.</span> <span id="s1227">He just spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: How many people were in the Judenrat?</span> <span id="s1229">It must have had at least five or six members.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Oh, they had more than that.</span> <span id="s1231">They had representatives from every little group.</span> <span id="s1232">They had like a twelve member committee.</span> <span id="s1233">They were not at all like police but they had their own militia.</span> <span id="s1234">You know, like a few men in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Do you know how these twelve members were chosen?</span> <span id="s1236">Did Schatz choose them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No, the Germans asked who was well educated in German so that they could speak to him.</span> <span id="s1238">So just when the Germans came to our town we asked Schatz to talk to them because he talked perfect German.</span> <span id="s1239">So this is how he started out, and he was in charge of everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: So he did not volunteer for that job?</span> <span id="s1241">He was asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s1243">He was asked by his neighbors and by the people who knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: He was just the logical person for the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yes, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1246">He was in charge of all the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1247">So, if something came up he spoke to them.</span> <span id="s1248">As a matter of fact, it happened before the liquidation of our town.</span> <span id="s1249">We had several things like terrible nights.</span> <span id="s1250">We had one policeman, he was from a small village, a local man not a German at all.</span> <span id="s1251">We used to call him the cat.</span> <span id="s1252">He was like a hit man for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1253">He was wild.</span> <span id="s1254">For him to kill was just like a play.</span> <span id="s1255">Every few months or weeks he went out with a few other policemen on his own, without even being told by the Germans, he went out just gathered some Jews from their homes during the night and slaughtered them in the yards.</span> <span id="s1256">Then, it was already around springtime in ’42, around April that some guy went out of his way and he went to a small village, not far from the same village he came from.</span> <span id="s1257">Somebody told him that a few people there from the village had something to do with the underground with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1258">We already had heard that some people, partisans were in the woods.</span> <span id="s1259">So, he went and he made a mess.</span> <span id="s1260">First of all he killed two people there.</span> <span id="s1261">And these were not Jews.</span> <span id="s1262">And he messed up a few families.</span> <span id="s1263">These people couldn’t stand it any longer so they went and drew up a petition to the Germans that it was too much!</span> <span id="s1264">He was punished.</span> <span id="s1265">I saw it myself because I was in a place where I could see it because of my job.</span> <span id="s1266">He used to come in where I worked.</span> <span id="s1267">No Jew could walk on the sidewalk but I could because my employer said to me, “You should not be afraid” because I was so devoted to the couple I worked for.</span> <span id="s1268">I was still a child myself but I was so devoted and I really worked hard for them.</span> <span id="s1269">So, he really did not care whether I walked on the street or on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1270">But on that day the Germans from Wilaika, the Gestapo came and I saw that they took him and took his gun away and put on handcuffs.</span> <span id="s1271">That was the most pleasing thing I could see.</span> <span id="s1272">To see it, gave me a lot of pleasure.</span> <span id="s1273">Then they took him to a cellar, like a basement in their police headquarters, he was in handcuffs and they took hi in a car and they drove him back to their headquarters in Wilaika and there he was shot by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1274">So in a way, we were pleased because there was nobody worse than him.</span> <span id="s1275">He was truly the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: He was from a small village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1278">From a small village not far from our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Was he a farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Like a small farming village as they have here.</span> <span id="s1281">A small place.</span> <span id="s1282">He was uneducated but he was just good for this.</span> <span id="s1283">But until he did what he did, several times the same thing.</span> <span id="s1284">He had stopped whomever he wanted.</span> <span id="s1285">He went to the house and he killed the whole family.</span> <span id="s1286">So when he was shot we had kind of peace for a few months.</span> <span id="s1287">It got quiet because then the local police were afraid.</span> <span id="s1288">They were not afraid to kill Jews, but they were afraid that since something happened to him, it might happen to them.</span> <span id="s1289">So, it was kind of quiet for almost the whole summer.</span> <span id="s1290">We had no killings.</span> <span id="s1291">Just go to work.</span> <span id="s1292">A lot of young people went to Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1293">It was really not a concentration camp like the really well known ones.</span> <span id="s1294">But it was a camp.</span> <span id="s1295">They stayed there, they lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">End of Side Two of Tape One.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: This is an interview with Mrs. Rachel Frydman, 200 Folsom Dr. Looking back over the last hour we had, there were a couple of other questions which occurred to me such as: when you were in the hiding place, there was a lady who said in Polish so that the Gestapo people did not understand it, that “they are in the attic.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: She was a neighbor of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: But a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1301">That was the mother of the boy whom I spoke about earlier.</span> <span id="s1302">Whom we grew up with and who went to work for the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: So that was the mother of that fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yes, that was the family which lived next door to us.</span> <span id="s1305">She knew my mother and she knew that my mother wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1306">She came back from out of town when they slaughtered and burned the Jews and she noticed that my mother and brother were not amongst them.</span> <span id="s1307">She came back and she talked to her family and to people, whoever came to take the goods from the houses; she mentioned my mother’s name that she didn’t see her and her kids (being burned or otherwise slaughtered) so that she must be some place.</span> <span id="s1308">That is really all she said.</span> <span id="s1309">That was the second day in the hiding place when the Gestapo came around to look for Jews to see wherever they would be hiding.</span> <span id="s1310">She told them in Polish, “The Jews are in the attic.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: So she did know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: No!</span> <span id="s1313">She just said it.</span> <span id="s1314">No, if she really had known and they would have known they really would have come after us, but they really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1315">They didn’t want to go up there, the Germans, so they sent him, her husband.</span> <span id="s1316">He came up there, he looked around but he didn’t notice anything because the door through which we went in was made so specially, skillfully, that was a little tiny entrance door, as I told you behind the chimney, that he didn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1317">You know in Europe every house has a chimney which goes through the attic.</span> <span id="s1318">He didn’t really look for us but he, this neighbor, just took something made of copper.</span> <span id="s1319">You know just about every house had some old things made of copper which was kept over the generations.</span> <span id="s1320">So, he just took something and he went back down and said something in White Russian language which meant that no one is there and that I couldn’t see anybody there.</span> <span id="s1321">During that time we were just sitting there, quietly.</span> <span id="s1322">He didn’t look long.</span> <span id="s1323">It was good too because this one lady who was the owner of the house was sick.</span> <span id="s1324">As a matter of fact she died later in the woods.</span> <span id="s1325">This lady could hardly breathe.</span> <span id="s1326">We kept her under the clothes which we had up there so that she wouldn’t give us away by coughing or even breathing loudly.</span> <span id="s1327">She had been a sick lady most of her life.</span> <span id="s1328">So he went down rapidly and we waited until night came, the second night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: So it was important to be very very quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1331">That is so because below us, there was another family residence where they gathered all the things which had been looted from the Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s1332">You see, this was a good place to load it up.</span> <span id="s1333">We even noticed some of our own things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Your own things had been looted and were being carted away, right like you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Yes, they were stored right beneath us and we could see them because they were very old things made out of metal.</span> <span id="s1336">We could see them through the outside walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s1338">Then another question is, you were talking about the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1339">Then a question about the Judenrat which was working during that year.</span> <span id="s1340">I was wondering how the people were chosen and you said that they were not chosen by the Germans at all but by members of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: That is right, they were appointed to be in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: You said that there was one from every little group.</span> <span id="s1343">I didn’t understand what these groups were.</span> <span id="s1344">Were they neighbor groups or groups from the different schools or family groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes, family groups and neighborhood groups.</span> <span id="s1346">So that they would know people.</span> <span id="s1347">They appointed somebody so that they would have to give their orders to ten or twelve people altogether.</span> <span id="s1348">The people of the Judenrat were in charge about what went on during the fifteen months when we were at home.</span> <span id="s1349">They were not special people but they were people whom we had chosen because they were more knowledgeable and who could talk better.</span> <span id="s1350">They could take care of us, the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s1351">For example, I mentioned that Mr. Schatz, who was in charge because he spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s1352">Somebody had to take care of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: All right!</span> <span id="s1354">So you had a good feeling towards the members of the Judenrat, they were not against you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: That’s right!</span> <span id="s1356">They just did the job someone had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Could you remember a little more exactly about what I had asked you about before.</span> <span id="s1358">About this man Schatz.</span> <span id="s1359">He came in 1938 as a Jewish refugee from Austria about one year before the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: He came in 1939 and by 1940, he was a teacher in our school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: So he really arrived just before the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yes, he obviously had been somewhere in Poland earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: How did he happen to come to your town, Kurzeniez?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I really don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1365">During that time he was our next-door neighbor from the other side.</span> <span id="s1366">He was in charge and the Germans always came to his house, to his small apartment.</span> <span id="s1367">As a matter of fact, I worked for him for a while.</span> <span id="s1368">I did clean everything in his house.</span> <span id="s1369">The German people smoked a lot.</span> <span id="s1370">You know, they had meetings during which they talked about the future.</span> <span id="s1371">About what to do next and I was always there, listening.</span> <span id="s1372">When they left, I had to clean up.</span> <span id="s1373">He asked me.</span> <span id="s1374">I cleaned up the house and he used to give me an extra something such as a copper piece to buy something.</span> <span id="s1375">Really, I did not go for his sake but I went for another neighbor.</span> <span id="s1376">You see, they smoked a lot and they used to leave a lot of ends of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1377">I used to pick them up before they were thrown out.</span> <span id="s1378">I got a handful of tobacco and I gave it to the other guy.</span> <span id="s1379">It was like giving him bread and butter.</span> <span id="s1380">I remember this.</span> <span id="s1381">You know, I was still a child.</span> <span id="s1382">He got married.</span> <span id="s1383">He found a girl in another town.</span> <span id="s1384">Apparently he had been somewhere else before but this girl had blood relative in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1385">He was probably looking for a job when the Soviets came and this (being a school coach) is the only job he could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: We were thinking, when we were talking about him the last time that maybe he left Austria.</span> <span id="s1387">Perhaps Vienna because of the Anschluss (the Germans sponsored unification between Germany and Austria which Hitler engineered in 1936).</span> <span id="s1388">However, if he was a Jew running away from the Germans, from the Nazis, wouldn’t Poland be a rather poor place to run to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: They all left!</span> <span id="s1390">There were a lot of (Jewish) people who came to Poland and who were caught again.</span> <span id="s1391">Yes!</span> <span id="s1392">Yes!</span> <span id="s1393">As a matter of fact, in 1939 when the war started in Poland, the whole war with Poland took only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1394">A lot of people ran just to our side of the border, agreed to by Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s1395">The Russians gathered them in one place.</span> <span id="s1396">We had one couple housed with us for a few weeks until the Russian government took care of them.</span> <span id="s1397">So they asked them that whoever wanted to go back, they could go back but those who said they wanted to go back were not sent back but were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1398">As a matter of fact, these Jews generally survived.</span> <span id="s1399">They were sent to Siberia because they didn’t like it where they went first.</span> <span id="s1400">Of course, they didn’t have homes there.</span> <span id="s1401">They were even called the homeless ones.</span> <span id="s1402">Staying in our part of Poland was safe until 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: I guess people never thought that the Russian army would have to retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s1405">As a matter of fact, in 1941 a lot of our people, whoever could, ran away together with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1406">My sister went with them.</span> <span id="s1407">She left home before the Germans came.</span> <span id="s1408">She left and went to Russia with a group of people.</span> <span id="s1409">A lot of these people have since resettled here in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s1410">They took her with a horse and wagon on which they had loaded everything.</span> <span id="s1411">You see I could not go with my mother because my brother was in school in a different town and we waited for him to come back from school.</span> <span id="s1412">When he came back it was already too late for us to go any place.</span> <span id="s1413">We tried to set out but the farmers along the road told us that there was no use.</span> <span id="s1414">That the Germans were already in Minsk, which is in the main city in White Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: So, you actually got ready to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1417">We would have like to, why not!</span> <span id="s1418">We already knew what was going on but it was too late.</span> <span id="s1419">The German army was already ahead of us.</span> <span id="s1420">So we returned home the same day.</span> <span id="s1421">A lot of other people did also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: What I was really getting at was that there was no reason, that it was just a crazy idea that Mr. Schatz had come there as an error.</span> <span id="s1423">He was Jewish, wasn’t he disguised?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Oh yes, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1425">Oh no, no, he was just used by the Germans in case there was something they wanted they would ask it from him.</span> <span id="s1426">He was in charge just because he could speak to them.</span> <span id="s1427">He befriended individuals and he has friends but when it came to the burning and slaughter, the Judenrat was not notified, They didn’t know that it would happen, or when, because most of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1428">Schatz lived through it.</span> <span id="s1429">He ran out.</span> <span id="s1430">His wife was killed.</span> <span id="s1431">Only one person that I know survived those days…me!</span> <span id="s1432">I don’t know if Schatz is alive right now but he ran out from a hiding place to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: So Schatz survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Yes, he survived.</span> <span id="s1435">I met him.</span> <span id="s1436">The Russians came back by the end of ’44 then I met him in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1437">He came back alone.</span> <span id="s1438">So, he had survived, just like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Do you know where he is now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: I never encountered him again.</span> <span id="s1441">The only thing which he told me was that I should go back to school.</span> <span id="s1442">He said, “For the years you lost, go back and learn something.</span> <span id="s1443">Become something!”</span> <span id="s1444">He cried when he saw me because I had been a child when he last saw me and in those three years I had grown up.</span> <span id="s1445">That is all I know about him.</span> <span id="s1446">I never saw him or heard from him anymore.</span> <span id="s1447">Somebody told me, we were talking about him while we were in Germany, in ’46 already, when I was already married, that Schatz was in Germany on his way to Israel.</span> <span id="s1448">I never met him in Israel while I was living there.</span> <span id="s1449">But he could be there or maybe, he is back in Austria someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Now, on a different subject.</span> <span id="s1451">There was a small camp in Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1452">Incidentally, where in Wilaika was it, nearby?</span> <span id="s1453">(This question was answered earlier).</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: It is five miles, seven km, from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s1455">Wilaika is a bigger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: And Wilaika is how far from Bialystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Oh, it is a little further, maybe ten miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s1459">So, which is the bigger city.</span> <span id="s1460">I was looking at a map and trying to find it (actually Bialystok is located at the Eastern border of postwar Poland).</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Bialystok is also in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1462">I believe that Bialystok is more to the north and Grodno is a little to the south (actually that is inverted since Grodno is located at the western border of postwar Russia, but well within 1938 Poland).</span> <span id="s1463">I really don’t remember the map anymore.</span> <span id="s1464">They are both in our area in White Russia.</span> <span id="s1465">White Russia is actually a big area from Vilna to Minsk and even further but it is all Russia (actually Minsk is the capitol of the Byelorussian S.S.R.).</span> <span id="s1466">Minsk was always Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: How far were you away from Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Oh, pretty far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Would Minsk be a couple of hundred km (kilometers)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Oh no, it was not that far.</span> <span id="s1471">Maybe my husband knows better but I don’t.</span> <span id="s1472">I went to Minsk twice but I really don’t know the distance.</span> <span id="s1473">I don’t remember it now if I ever knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: I was looking at a map and I was trying to see where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: You should be able to find Wilaika on a map but I doubt that you would find Kurzeniez because it is so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Wilaika (here WS spells the town and RF agrees to the spelling.</span> <span id="s1477">Note that the transcriber couldn’t find it on a map)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: I believe that you will be able to find it on a larger scale map because it was at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s1479">It was a much more important town.</span> <span id="s1480">Marked with a star on the map (probably a district capitol city).</span> <span id="s1481">The relationship between Kurzeniez and Wilaika was like the relationship of Troy to Dayton.</span> <span id="s1482">Of course, not as big but comparing the importance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Now, during the time that the Germans were in control there and were in Kurzeniez, you said that there was a work camp.</span> <span id="s1484">That some of the younger people were taken off to the work camp in Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1485">It was not a concentration camp but more like a boarding camp.</span> <span id="s1486">How were they chosen for that?</span> <span id="s1487">Was it just people who didn’t have anything to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yes, they stayed there.</span> <span id="s1489">They lived there.</span> <span id="s1490">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1491">The Judenrat sent them.</span> <span id="s1492">The Gestapo or whoever was in the Kommandatur in Wilaika asked for 40 or 50 people.</span> <span id="s1493">As a matter of fact, the Judenrat came to my mother and said that you have to send your son, but my mother said that it was her only son, that she was a widow and that she would do anything she could so as not to send him there.</span> <span id="s1494">There would only have been the two of us left.</span> <span id="s1495">My mother begged that guy, that Polish gentleman whom I worked for to intervene not to take my brother.</span> <span id="s1496">At least not until later, and that is what the guy did.</span> <span id="s1497">Of course, we gave them a lot of presents for it.</span> <span id="s1498">Actually we gave them to his wife and he intervened and he told them that he needs my brother in the electric station and the sawmill for himself.</span> <span id="s1499">So my brother worked there until they had the roundup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: So, that your boss, the man you worked for, did help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Yes, he did help.</span> <span id="s1502">He really liked me.</span> <span id="s1503">I was really lucky to work for him.</span> <span id="s1504">When I came the first time, it was because my mother couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s1505">My mother had worked for them.</span> <span id="s1506">They always sent him all the help he needed because they considered him an important man for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1507">You see, the sawmill operated for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1508">He asked the Judenrat that someone be sent.</span> <span id="s1509">The Judenrat sent my mother.</span> <span id="s1510">So one day my mother couldn’t come, so I came.</span> <span id="s1511">I was young.</span> <span id="s1512">Only fourteen years old at that time and I cleaned his library.</span> <span id="s1513">I managed to put his books in such good order that he liked the job I did.</span> <span id="s1514">So, he asked, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1515">so I told him that I do a different job every day; that I work wherever they send me.</span> <span id="s1516">He told me: “OK, I want you to come back here tomorow.”</span> <span id="s1517">I said: “Well, I don’t know, you have to ask the Judenrat.”</span> <span id="s1518">He said: “I will take care of it.”</span> <span id="s1519">He really did.</span> <span id="s1520">.</span> <span id="s1521">He went there and he said: “I want Rachel to work for me as a steady job, coming to me every day.”</span> <span id="s1522">They had two children.</span> <span id="s1523">The baby was nine months old when I started.</span> <span id="s1524">He was one and a half years old on my last day of work.</span> <span id="s1525">I did work there.</span> <span id="s1526">I did everything.</span> <span id="s1527">I cooked and I cleaned.</span> <span id="s1528">He like everything I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: So, if you had not been working there, either you or your brother might have been sent off to that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1531">Because he was very pleased with my work and I did a good job for him, including cooking even though there was one German SS man there in charge of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1532">This SS man was unusually nice except that he talked a little too much.</span> <span id="s1533">I used to work twice a week for him in that house.</span> <span id="s1534">I brought the food over there myself.</span> <span id="s1535">I used to walk over there.</span> <span id="s1536">He asked me, usually, why couldn’t I eat over there.</span> <span id="s1537">Yes, he used to ask me to sit down and eat with him.</span> <span id="s1538">I did not eat there because it was not kosher.</span> <span id="s1539">I had been brought up to eat strictly kosher only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: But he understood that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: He understood that.</span> <span id="s1542">He used to say, “You better eat everything you can in that house.</span> <span id="s1543">You will need your strength because you have to suffer a lot longer and a lot more.”</span> <span id="s1544">That is what he used to tell me in German.</span> <span id="s1545">He spoke German to me.</span> <span id="s1546">He found a nice young man who also worked there.</span> <span id="s1547">This young man, a Jewish man, was in charge of the whole group in that place.</span> <span id="s1548">That was a nice big place which was important for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1549">They worked there day and night.</span> <span id="s1550">So he told him that while they had the night people watching, they were watching day and night, that the day would come, but he didn’t say exactly when or how, when it wouldn’t remain like this.</span> <span id="s1551">“In another few months and you will be gone.”</span> <span id="s1552">(He was warning that Jewish young man.)</span> <span id="s1553">.</span> <span id="s1554">He told him and me what to do and how to do it in case it came about and where to hide and how to hide.</span> <span id="s1555">He told us that.</span> <span id="s1556">Somehow, it happened that he drank too much at a party with my boss and he talked a little too much and they took him away.</span> <span id="s1557">They took him away and they sent him to the front.</span> <span id="s1558">Then we had a bad German and then I didn’t cook any more for the new guy.</span> <span id="s1559">I never really met this other SS German, except that I saw him in the house, at my boss’s house.</span> <span id="s1560">He was there for Christmas.</span> <span id="s1561">My boss had a party for Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: But your boss might still be there at the sawmill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: He was from Vilna himself.</span> <span id="s1564">He was sent to the sawmill when there was still a Polish government.</span> <span id="s1565">He had been working for a company, actually, I believe for the government, in an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: You think that he might be back in Vilna now?</span> <span id="s1567">(Actually now Vilna is called by its Russian name of Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1568">It is the capitol of the Lithuanian SSR).</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Nobody ever saw him in Vilna, but he might be in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1570">He never really was a good man for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1571">The only thing he really cared about, because he said it was for my mother, my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s1572">He liked us.</span> <span id="s1573">He liked me because I was so clean and I saw to it that the house was kept in order .</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: What happened to the people who were sent off to the camp in Wilaika?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: They survived longer than we did.</span> <span id="s1576">They were still there after our place was gone.</span> <span id="s1577">Then a few months later, I believe that it was in the middle of winter, they kept them.</span> <span id="s1578">They had kept us until Sept.</span> <span id="s1579">After that, middle of winter, they sent them someplace.</span> <span id="s1580">Maybe to a concentration camp, one by one.</span> <span id="s1581">A few of them got back to the woods where we met them, a few of them are still alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Was it more like a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: It was not like a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1584">It was one place.</span> <span id="s1585">Like a block or half block with wire around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Were all the Jews of Wilaika in that same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: They were already gone.</span> <span id="s1588">The Jews of Wilaika were gone before they got after us.</span> <span id="s1589">Well, Wenetchka is next to Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1590">It is a rather big place.</span> <span id="s1591">It was the first city without Jews.</span> <span id="s1592">A big, big “Judenrein” sign was visible for anyone who drove by.</span> <span id="s1593">That was the first such place in all of White Russia from where they took out the Jews.</span> <span id="s1594">They took out the Jews from Wilaika in the first few weeks.</span> <span id="s1595">They sent all the men off someplace and they told the women not to cry, to be calm, that they would come back, but they never did.</span> <span id="s1596">They slaughtered them somewhere near Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1597">They slaughtered all the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: They slaughtered them in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1600">Later on we found the bodies.</span> <span id="s1601">Oh yes, Wilaika no longer had their own Jews.</span> <span id="s1602">That is why they sent them over from Kurzeniez.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Now, when that incident happened about the burglar, the one who broke into houses, then the Gestapo came and everyone was worried what this meant; but your boss said, “No, don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s1604">How did he know that?</span> <span id="s1605">Was that knowledge just for him not for everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: He came out of the place where he worked, from where he was in charge, he came home for lunch as he usually did.</span> <span id="s1607">I was there and I saw all the Jews running.</span> <span id="s1608">I saw my mother running there also.</span> <span id="s1609">They ran to the end of town.</span> <span id="s1610">It was just stupid because the people got so excited and so worried.</span> <span id="s1611">They didn’t know what to do for themselves.</span> <span id="s1612">They ran from the center of town to the outskirts of town, but that was all.</span> <span id="s1613">Then he came into the house and he said it is nothing.</span> <span id="s1614">Then I called my mother in and he told her that there was nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s1615">That there were no killings.</span> <span id="s1616">They didn’t come for killings.</span> <span id="s1617">That they didn’t come for anything.</span> <span id="s1618">He told us not to be afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: How did he know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: He probably had been informed that there was nothing going on.</span> <span id="s1621">He had connections with them.</span> <span id="s1622">As a matter of fact, he used to go to Wilaika for parties.</span> <span id="s1623">He used to stay overnight there once in a while and I used to stay in his house once in a while to watch the children overnight.</span> <span id="s1624">He knew that it was nothing except that they came to get that guy.</span> <span id="s1625">Actually, it was an accident with that guy and they made him pay for it so that the rest of the people would control themselves.</span> <span id="s1626">It was already the second year.</span> <span id="s1627">It was in April of the second year that was in 1942.</span> <span id="s1628">At that time, they should already have enforced the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: But later on, when the town was really surrounded, he must have known that that was happening, but he didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes, he didn’t say anything, but then we did not see him anymore.</span> <span id="s1631">You see, it happened in the morning, as I told you during the last session that my brother went to work as usual.</span> <span id="s1632">Remember that he met a guy, a gentile person who knew the guy who was with my brother who told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: But you didn’t see your boss for quite a while, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: That was the last day that I am going to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: But your boss’s wife had given you a ration card?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Yes, I was supposed to buy things for her and bring them with me.</span> <span id="s1637">I had the card to buy them with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: But he was not at home on that day?</span> <span id="s1639">He wasn’t there at the time, you hadn’t seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: I saw him every day, but I had nothing to do with him.</span> <span id="s1641">You see, I worked for her and I worked in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: If he did know that the first time, there was nothing to worry about, he must have known that this time it was something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: This time was early in the morning, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1644">I don’t think that he knew.</span> <span id="s1645">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1646">It was a surprise to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: As far as you know, he didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: No!</span> <span id="s1649">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1650">We knew that someday the day would come.</span> <span id="s1651">We all knew that the day would come because [the slaughter] was going from one little city or town to another city or town.</span> <span id="s1652">They really took care of one town at a time.</span> <span id="s1653">I don’t know if you believe it or not but it was expected sooner or later.</span> <span id="s1654">However we did not know it would be this soon.</span> <span id="s1655">We thought “Us, they will keep.”</span> <span id="s1656">We thought that we were better Jews, that we always were orderly.</span> <span id="s1657">We worked wherever they sent us.</span> <span id="s1658">We thought that we did that much better than Wilaika.</span> <span id="s1659">You know Wilaika was such a big city.</span> <span id="s1660">The Gestapo headquarters were there and they needed somebody to work.</span> <span id="s1661">They needed somebody so they kept us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: So you were thinking that maybe you would get by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: We were all hoping that maybe we wouldn’t get slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1664">You know as long as there is life there is hope!</span> <span id="s1665">Maybe we would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Had you heard?</span> <span id="s1667">Did you have any contact that would let you know what was happening in Russia or on the Western front, or elsewhere in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: No, No nothing!</span> <span id="s1669">We knew absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: You didn’t have a radio or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Maybe some people had but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1672">Those who had them listened to them in secret since we were all afraid.</span> <span id="s1673">First of all, we had been told to give everything like that away.</span> <span id="s1674">Whoever had a radio had to give it away,</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1676">No one got broadcasts from the BBC or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Did people know about the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).</span> <span id="s1679">[The BBC undertook as early as 1939 to broadcast from England to the European continent in the various languages.</span> <span id="s1680">They used refugees from various countries so as to talk in “perfect idiomatic languages to broadcast news and other programs.</span> <span id="s1681">It was a way of obtaining news and keeping up with the war to listen to “Big Ben” which started the BBC news at 9 PM in France.</span> <span id="s1682">Listening was done clandestinely by people gathering in people’s bedrooms from where sounds could not penetrate to the streets.</span> <span id="s1683">The news about the Germans lack of success and then reversals in Eastern Libya as well as the naval victory against the Battleship, the Graf Spee etc. were great moral boosters.</span> <span id="s1684">They prevented complete mental cave-ins to the German over lordship.</span> <span id="s1685">These BBC news programs were utilized later to pass coded messages to the underground.</span> <span id="s1686">Listening was, of course, illegal and was punished by deportation or execution without trial or appeal.</span> <span id="s1687">Attempts were made regularly to jam the programs but usually, especially in the evenings, it was possible to listen and understand most of it.</span> <span id="s1688">(The Voice of America programs were patterned on the BBC prototypes).</span> <span id="s1689">The BBC was frank enough about reversals of the allies to be completely believable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Not at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s1691">We were not that advanced in technology and we had very few radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: On quite a different subject, during that year, when the Germans were there, were there any marriages or funerals?</span> <span id="s1693">There were funerals, of course, but were there marriages though?</span> <span id="s1694">Did people get married during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: No, not that I remember, no marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: People who wanted to get married, have family gatherings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: There were no marriages or no births that I know of.</span> <span id="s1698">Except the birth of that little baby which survived with me.</span> <span id="s1699">She was born after the Germans came.</span> <span id="s1700">That lady was pregnant before.</span> <span id="s1701">As a matter of fact, I was in the woods with her.</span> <span id="s1702">With that little baby, there were three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: This was your boss’s baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Oh, another lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: This has nothing to do with my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: We will get back to the woods a little later, but I just wanted to clear that up.</span> <span id="s1708">Nobody was Bar Mitzvahed or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Oh no, oh no!</span> <span id="s1710">The entire religion was put away from sight.</span> <span id="s1711">We just made it privately at home when a holiday came.</span> <span id="s1712">Like first we had Rosh Hashanah in 1941.</span> <span id="s1713">We gathered in our homes.</span> <span id="s1714">Then came Yom Kippur, the day of the fast.</span> <span id="s1715">We gathered as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1716">We were afraid even to be all together.</span> <span id="s1717">Maybe only ten men (certain prayers according to Jewish tradition required ten men per orthodox tradition, expanded to accept ten people as sufficient in the postwar days) to make services.</span> <span id="s1718">Then, there was the following spring, the Passover festival when I helped to make the matzoh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Oh, you made matzoh?</span> <span id="s1720">That was very good!</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Yes, we made matzohs.</span> <span id="s1722">We had flour so we could make it.</span> <span id="s1723">We made it in a place where she used to bake bread.</span> <span id="s1724">To go to the main market place from my home we only needed to go through a little garden which she had and the bakery was there.</span> <span id="s1725">It was there that I helped them bake the matzoh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: On Purim did you make Hamentashen also (those are the special three cornered pastries which are prepared to celebrate the victory of the Jews under Esther and Mordecai against the bloodthirsty Haman who wanted to kill all the Jews in Persia but was hanged on the very gallows he had prepared as his own “final solution” for the Jews in his own time)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yes, we certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Did you give them names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Gestapo would have been a good name for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s1732">The Hamentashen are named after Haman whose name we don’t even want to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: I see, but everybody was thinking that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s1735">There was a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: It was hard for people to keep their hopes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Well, a human being, no matter how bad he is off, still has hope.</span> <span id="s1738">As long as your eyes are open you hope that maybe some miracle will happen.</span> <span id="s1739">We used to hear a plane coming, then we thought that maybe, maybe the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s1740">Maybe something will help us.</span> <span id="s1741">We didn’t know about the Americans on the Western front, you know.</span> <span id="s1742">We never heard anything from that side.</span> <span id="s1743">However, we thought maybe the Soviets will wake up.</span> <span id="s1744">Maybe they will see what the Germans are doing to their people.</span> <span id="s1745">After all, the Soviet army had given up.</span> <span id="s1746">They surrendered to the Germans like flies.</span> <span id="s1747">They ran to them after the German attack in 1941 and later on the Germans kept them in the camps.</span> <span id="s1748">In the prison camps and they were mistreated.</span> <span id="s1749">They were treated worse than the Jews.</span> <span id="s1750">We had homes, we had ghettos, we had something.</span> <span id="s1751">They had nothing.</span> <span id="s1752">They were without shoes when they were working together with the Jews on the railroads and other projects for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1753">I was one time in Wilaika to work and I worked with these Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1754">They went to prison camps, that is the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1755">They were without shoes, their clothes were torn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: That was in the wintertime already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: It was already very late fall.</span> <span id="s1758">The German army gathered a lot of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1759">What we did was that the soldiers dug like a big pit and we used to put the potatoes in there and cover them with straw and then with the ground.</span> <span id="s1760">.</span> <span id="s1761">It could lay in there for the entire winter, and the potatoes were available when needed.</span> <span id="s1762">Then they started killing them and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1763">The word of that treatment got back to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1764">That is what caused the partisans to get started.</span> <span id="s1765">They saw that there was no reason to surrender to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1766">They then fought better, first of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: These were the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Yes, the Russians.</span> <span id="s1769">Then a lot of them ran away from the camps and they found hiding places with the people of the forest area.</span> <span id="s1770">So the Germans realized what they had done (they also began to have many of their own people as prisoners of the Russians, who, of course, returned the treatment of their own prisoners ) and they fed them better and they gave them clothes to put on.</span> <span id="s1771">Then the Jews came out from all over, whoever could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: And joined the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Then the Russian army already sent supplies by parachutes and also they parachuted special groups in to organize the partisans.</span> <span id="s1774">That is how it started that we could survive because of this.</span> <span id="s1775">However, later on, when we were in the woods, the Germans came and blockaded off one section of the woods.</span> <span id="s1776">They were really looking for the partisans not for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1777">They did not know that there were Jews in hiding.</span> <span id="s1778">Actually they found out because some people told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: I would have to ask you this eventually.</span> <span id="s1780">Did the groups which were dropped by parachute know that they would join up with the Russian prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: And that there were Jews with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1784">I worked for a group like this.</span> <span id="s1785">My brother worked for another group like this.</span> <span id="s1786">These were special groups, especially trained people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Were they glad to have the help of the Jews, the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: That was a good thing.</span> <span id="s1790">Even though they were communists, were they okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1792">They helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s1793">But what happened when an area was blockaded off, the partisans went.</span> <span id="s1794">They had guns, they had everything.</span> <span id="s1795">So they ran out.</span> <span id="s1796">They didn’t wait to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1797">They went from one forest to another forest.</span> <span id="s1798">However the Jews with small children, the families, who were hiding could not go.</span> <span id="s1799">Where could we go?</span> <span id="s1800">That is why we were left behind there and a lot of children were killed.</span> <span id="s1801">Three times they killed three or four children.</span> <span id="s1802">The fourth time they did not come to us.</span> <span id="s1803">That fourth time was when the Germans were already in retreat.</span> <span id="s1804">There were three blockades in almost two year’s time.</span> <span id="s1805">From September to August of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: The first time was in February of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: When my mother was killed.</span> <span id="s1808">She was caught in a small village.</span> <span id="s1809">I am telling the story from way back and there really was a lot to tell you before that.</span> <span id="s1810">We were living in a bunker underground and she went out.</span> <span id="s1811">We had food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: There were eighteen of you in that bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1814">We had saved food for the winter because winter was hard.</span> <span id="s1815">In winter we could not go out and beg because first of all, on the fresh snow you could see the tracks.</span> <span id="s1816">So we tried not to make tracks, therefore, we saved up some food.</span> <span id="s1817">that is, potatoes, peas, whatever the people from the surrounding areas would give us.</span> <span id="s1818">We could even have survived for a few months with the little we had.</span> <span id="s1819">Then my mother saw that there was snow., a lot of snow on the ground and it was really cold.</span> <span id="s1820">She said, I am going to go to that place, Margi (spelled by RF at the request of WS) that little village.</span> <span id="s1821">She went there since we knew all the people there already.</span> <span id="s1822">We had gone there so often.</span> <span id="s1823">We knew all the people.</span> <span id="s1824">She said, I am going to bring some peelings, you know when we cleaned the potatoes, the potato peelings which we saved for them as fodder for the cows.</span> <span id="s1825">So my mother had saved a whole bag and she said I am going to bring it to them and will drink a little milk and I will bring back some straw for a new mattress.</span> <span id="s1826">She said I will ask a lady there whom she know who was a dressmaker for some scissors, because when we came out of our hiding place my mother ran into our house and tore one drape and she rolled up with a pair of shoes in it and she ran back out.</span> <span id="s1827">Then at night we ran out of the attic.</span> <span id="s1828">So she had a piece of material and she said, “I am going to make a dress for you.”</span> <span id="s1829">That is why she left me in the cellar.</span> <span id="s1830">She went together with another lady.</span> <span id="s1831">This other lady had a husband and four children.</span> <span id="s1832">The two ladies went and she even put what she wanted us to eat to boil and said, ‘you eat, don’t wait.</span> <span id="s1833">I will eat later.</span> <span id="s1834">The food will be ready.</span> <span id="s1835">Just take it off the stove.”</span> <span id="s1836">That was the stove which we had made.</span> <span id="s1837">I was already nervous because it got pretty late in the morning and my mother was not there.</span> <span id="s1838">She should have been back.</span> <span id="s1839">I ventured out of the cellar and I heard a few shots.</span> <span id="s1840">I went back down and I said you know what, I heard shots, something is wrong here.</span> <span id="s1841">So the man said, ”Oh nothing is wrong.</span> <span id="s1842">Don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s1843">Don’t panic” My heart wasn’t in it and I said something is wrong!</span> <span id="s1844">I tell you!</span> <span id="s1845">I should go out and investigate.</span> <span id="s1846">So they said, okay, go.</span> <span id="s1847">I went.</span> <span id="s1848">There was snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s1849">There were a lot of tracks and no one could see which way they were and where they led to.</span> <span id="s1850">Before I left, I stopped in another underground shelter where another few Jews lived altogether.</span> <span id="s1851">There were always three or four Jews living together in one area.</span> <span id="s1852">We were all taking care of ourselves (there were no chiefs or other people who organized us).</span> <span id="s1853">I talked to them and I told them that I was worried because my mother had been gone for a long time.</span> <span id="s1854">I asked them whether they heard about anything going on.</span> <span id="s1855">Anything strange going on in the woods.</span> <span id="s1856">They said they did not, that they had not heard anything.</span> <span id="s1857">However, later, while I was talking to them, one came running.</span> <span id="s1858">He came from the other side of the same forest.</span> <span id="s1859">He said that on the other side of the forest (the terms of woods and forest are used interchangeable) not of the village but of the woods, that the Germans had surrounded the whole forest,.</span> <span id="s1860">He told us that one guy had been killed and that a lady who I knew had been killed.</span> <span id="s1861">He did not know yet about my mother.</span> <span id="s1862">Then I said, oh, something happened to mother!!!!</span> <span id="s1863">.</span> <span id="s1864">Then I told them, I am going.</span> <span id="s1865">In case I am caught I am not going to tell anything.</span> <span id="s1866">I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1867">If my mother is gone I want to go to find out.</span> <span id="s1868">I don’t care to stay by myself.</span> <span id="s1869">I came just to the end of the forest and from afar I saw the village.</span> <span id="s1870">You know you could see a lot of tracks from houses and buggies.</span> <span id="s1871">Actually in the wintertime you don’t have the buggies but you have the sleighs.</span> <span id="s1872">I saw that there was something wrong.</span> <span id="s1873">There was something more than a few Germans, as that fellow had been saying, were on the other side.</span> <span id="s1874">That place, Margi was on our side and they had another few villages on that side in which other Jews live.</span> <span id="s1875">As a matter of fact, my future husband’s mother lived in one.</span> <span id="s1876">His sister, who came to visit, stayed there also.</span> <span id="s1877">I went into the first house.</span> <span id="s1878">I didn’t care at that time.</span> <span id="s1879">I didn’t see anybody in the street, that was the first house from the corner facing the forest.</span> <span id="s1880">There was a guy who was always in contact with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1881">He always gave warnings to the partisans and as “The Germans are coming.”</span> <span id="s1882">or ‘The Germans are here”.</span> <span id="s1883">He always knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1884">He worked for the partisans and he supplied them with information.</span> <span id="s1885">I came into that house, and he said, “Jew, what are you doing here, right now?”</span> <span id="s1886">I said “Why?”</span> <span id="s1887">I knew already that something was dreadfully wrong because he was shaking.</span> <span id="s1888">He said “You better go out from here this minute.</span> <span id="s1889">Go out!</span> <span id="s1890">Your mother was caught just one hour ago with that other lady.</span> <span id="s1891">I don’t know what they did to her and what they did to the other lady.</span> <span id="s1892">There was one German and ten Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1893">The Ukrainians worked for the Germans then.</span> <span id="s1894">I don’t know if they are alive or not.”</span> <span id="s1895">Of course, I was very upset and I cried and he said “There is no use to cry, you just go out because in case they come back.</span> <span id="s1896">In case they are still around.</span> <span id="s1897">They might be at the other end of the village.’</span> <span id="s1898">His house was at the end closest to the forest.</span> <span id="s1899">He then added, ‘you better go back and tell your people who can hide, to hide because they are going to surround the entire forest.</span> <span id="s1900">They asked, because they knew that there are a lot of Jews hiding around this place, for directions.”</span> <span id="s1901">The Germans went to the place where we were and to other places also.</span> <span id="s1902">I got back to our cellar and I told the people, the few Jews who lived underground together what had happened.</span> <span id="s1903">Then I cried and I told these friends of mine what had happened.</span> <span id="s1904">Their mother was there also.</span> <span id="s1905">“ I am not certain that they have been killed already but I believe that the shots I heard were the shots which killed my mother.”</span> <span id="s1906">I have a feeling that the guys, we had then three or four men in our group, the rest were children and women, were shocked.</span> <span id="s1907">They said “Let’s go out of there!</span> <span id="s1908">If they have not been shot, in case they are alive and they force them to show the place where they have lived, we won’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s1909">They might all come here, so let’s go out!”</span> <span id="s1910">I said “Where will we go, where is there to go to?</span> <span id="s1911">What reason do I have to go on living?”</span> <span id="s1912">they said that I just couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s1913">I felt so bad also for the children, and of course, I also felt bad for myself.</span> <span id="s1914">So we went out.</span> <span id="s1915">I was so upset!</span> <span id="s1916">We went away, just to hide in the woods.</span> <span id="s1917">Really in the same area where we had lived.</span> <span id="s1918">Really, just not to be caught in our cellar.</span> <span id="s1919">By that time, I was so upset that I got separated from the entire group.</span> <span id="s1920">I had just lost track of them.</span> <span id="s1921">I did not know where they were.</span> <span id="s1922">I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s1923">When I woke up in the evening, I was laying on the snow.</span> <span id="s1924">I was freezing.</span> <span id="s1925">I wondered, “My goodness what happened to me.”</span> <span id="s1926">It was already dark.</span> <span id="s1927">I did not know how to go and where to go.</span> <span id="s1928">I didn’t know anything then.</span> <span id="s1929">It was just too much!</span> <span id="s1930">So I went back.</span> <span id="s1931">I didn’t know how to go or where to go.</span> <span id="s1932">I didn’t know then, nothing just nothing made sense to me.</span> <span id="s1933">All the trees looked alike.</span> <span id="s1934">All the bushes looked alike.</span> <span id="s1935">I didn’t know what to do, so I just went.</span> <span id="s1936">I went and I walked and I walked until I found their tracks to our cellar.</span> <span id="s1937">When I got there they had already returned.</span> <span id="s1938">They were already in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1939">When I came back I knew that my mother would not be home, that she would not be back, that it was no use talking about it.</span> <span id="s1940">That night, I could not sleep, of course, I was too upset.</span> <span id="s1941">I, at least, wanted to find her body.</span> <span id="s1942">I said, “I give anything, just go please, don’t ask anybody.”</span> <span id="s1943">I had a few rings from my mother, just go back and find her body.</span> <span id="s1944">I said that because the Germans were already gone.</span> <span id="s1945">It didn’t take the Germans longer than one day.</span> <span id="s1946">They wouldn’t stay in the woods overnight.</span> <span id="s1947">Next day somebody came to the place, to Margi, and asked a few people, “So what happened?”</span> <span id="s1948">One fellow was also caught with the two women.</span> <span id="s1949">However they let the guy go.</span> <span id="s1950">I met him later on.</span> <span id="s1951">He told us that they shot them right in the forest while they were looking for the rest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1952">They just shot whomever they caught.</span> <span id="s1953">My mother was in the process of running away when they shot her.</span> <span id="s1954">He fell a little bit further than the other lady.</span> <span id="s1955">It was snowing very hard.</span> <span id="s1956">Then the people from Margi were so nice.</span> <span id="s1957">They knew me.</span> <span id="s1958">They knew that I was now alone.</span> <span id="s1959">So they said, “Tell her we will try to find the body for her.”</span> <span id="s1960">People from another village went to look for wood and found the bodies.</span> <span id="s1961">The bodies were partially covered with snow.</span> <span id="s1962">The fellow who found the bodies told the people in his village that he had found two bodies.</span> <span id="s1963">So the people knew already that it was my mother and the other lady.</span> <span id="s1964">They got word to us that bodies had been found and that we could have them if we wanted.</span> <span id="s1965">I got hold of the fellow and gave him one of the rings from my mother, so that he would show our people where it is.</span> <span id="s1966">Our people then went and brought her back.</span> <span id="s1967">Then we held a Jewish funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: In Margi or in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: In the forest.</span> <span id="s1970">Really not far from Margi.</span> <span id="s1971">As a matter of fact, later on, I went back to recover her body and bury it in Kurzeniez.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Yes, you mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: We buried the others wherever we could, by the people who found them.</span> <span id="s1974">They were also buried in the villages, wherever they had been caught because this raid was a surprise.</span> <span id="s1975">If my mother had known, she would not have gone.</span> <span id="s1976">But of course she didn’t even go out begging.</span> <span id="s1977">She just went out for a little bit of milk and a little straw.</span> <span id="s1978">Until then, we had lived pretty peacefully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: That was in February?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Yes, February second or third.</span> <span id="s1981">Because in December, which was the time for Chanukah and Christmas, we didn’t really know which it was.</span> <span id="s1982">The men had prepared the place to make it possible for us to move in the bunkers.</span> <span id="s1983">When we went into the bunkers there was already snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s1984">We had not had much snow until then and we had slept in the open under the sky.</span> <span id="s1985">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1986">I always had slept close to my mother.</span> <span id="s1987">She still had a fur coat from former times.</span> <span id="s1988">We covered each other with that coat and we held on to each other.</span> <span id="s1989">She used to say, “Who knows how long we will have to live like this!</span> <span id="s1990">Who knows?”</span> <span id="s1991">You see, we made a fire always but still it was cold.</span> <span id="s1992">We were sitting around the fire but still it was cold.</span> <span id="s1993">Finally the end of December, we could move into the bunkers.</span> <span id="s1994">She only lived there for five weeks or at the most six weeks, that is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Did you, the rest of you, stay in the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: Yes, we stayed there until the second blockade, that was on April 39, 1943.</span> <span id="s1997">Three months later after the first blockade there was a blockade again and this time, they destroyed our bunkers.</span> <span id="s1998">They then killed some people who had been staying close to us.</span> <span id="s1999">They killed some men who were living next to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: You got away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Yes, we got away.</span> <span id="s2002">I saw the Germans stand in front of me!</span> <span id="s2003">I saw him but he didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s2004">I was just a short distance away.</span> <span id="s2005">I was, at that time, with a gentile boy from the same village, Margi.</span> <span id="s2006">As a matter of fact, I was there.</span> <span id="s2007">They didn’t have anybody else, so I used to come to help them by peeling their potatoes and prepare supper.</span> <span id="s2008">Just so that I had something to do.</span> <span id="s2009">I met him there and he said, “I want to go with you.”</span> <span id="s2010">So I said, “All right, let’s go home!”</span> <span id="s2011">It was night and I was afraid to walk all by myself.</span> <span id="s2012">So, he went with me and he came and stayed overnight in our bunker.</span> <span id="s2013">Actually he was not a partisan, but it was about the same thing since he worked for the partisans.</span> <span id="s2014">So, he was there and he had to find out what was going on with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2015">Then, he was bringing the latest news to the partisans.</span> <span id="s2016">So, I brought him to the bunker and the next morning, the Germans came with the new blockade.</span> <span id="s2017">All of a sudden we ran out without any other consideration.</span> <span id="s2018">We just ran out!</span> <span id="s2019">Fortunately, that it was in April when it no longer was so cold or else we would have frozen to death.</span> <span id="s2020">We hid away for a whole day.</span> <span id="s2021">A little baby who by that time was already one and a half years old, she started to talk at two years of age, was hiding with us.</span> <span id="s2022">By March, the baby wouldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2023">The mother covered the baby’s mouth because if she said one thing the Germans would have heard her.</span> <span id="s2024">You see, we were just next to the Germans, just as close as that TV set is from us.</span> <span id="s2025">We were hiding under a fallen tree.</span> <span id="s2026">We were under that tree and the German was over there.</span> <span id="s2027">They went to the very place where our people were hiding.</span> <span id="s2028">However they didn’t make a chain.</span> <span id="s2029">They kept each other in sight, but they did not touch.</span> <span id="s2030">So, they went through and that was all for them.</span> <span id="s2031">They really didn’t care!</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Did they pass on either side of where you were about ten or twelve feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Just so close to us that we could hear them talking.</span> <span id="s2034">We were hiding under a fallen oak tree with a big bush near us.</span> <span id="s2035">That place was so bushy that they would not bother to go there.</span> <span id="s2036">They went where there were no trees.</span> <span id="s2037">It was a little like a match.</span> <span id="s2038">We were under that tree, under the bushes laying there quietly and they went through and we heard the grenade go off in the bunker.</span> <span id="s2039">When we got back there, later on, there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s2040">We could even hear that they took a lot of cows and a lot of pigs from the villages.</span> <span id="s2041">We could hear all that.</span> <span id="s2042">We could hear them loading the trucks with all of it.</span> <span id="s2043">They certainly did not leave empty handed.</span> <span id="s2044">Whoever was caught was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: You were that close that you could observe it all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2047">It was close.</span> <span id="s2048">We could hear it all.</span> <span id="s2049">Especially you could hear the pigs.</span> <span id="s2050">You know how pigs yell.</span> <span id="s2051">We remained holed up until late.</span> <span id="s2052">Late at night, in hiding.</span> <span id="s2053">Then we went out to see.</span> <span id="s2054">Truly, one of us went to see while the others stayed under cover what had gone on.</span> <span id="s2055">Then we noticed that everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s2056">We had been able to hear it all because we were so close by.</span> <span id="s2057">Wherever we would have gone to we would run into the Germans.</span> <span id="s2058">they were all around us.</span> <span id="s2059">Around our little area.</span> <span id="s2060">More than around any other area.</span> <span id="s2061">You see, the first time they were in another area of the forest.</span> <span id="s2062">This time, they were more concentrated in our area.</span> <span id="s2063">A forest is a big place.</span> <span id="s2064">There km, km and km of forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: You would say that it was a miracle that you escaped then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2067">Just a miracle!</span> <span id="s2068">It was just meant to be!</span> <span id="s2069">I don’t know who brought us back, but it just happened!</span> <span id="s2070">It was just meant to be.</span> <span id="s2071">Now, if someone would tell me that something like this would happen I would not believe it.</span> <span id="s2072">How could we have seen it all but the Germans did not see us.</span> <span id="s2073">We were looking for places to hide and they caught whoever they saw.</span> <span id="s2074">They shot whoever they caught.</span> <span id="s2075">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Did they get any from your group of eighteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: No, not from my immediate group.</span> <span id="s2078">Another time three of us girls went together begging on one evening when I saw somebody with a collar around his neck.</span> <span id="s2079">We used to say that it was like a court from another nationality which decided our fates.</span> <span id="s2080">They were two Jews, two men, they had run away from a concentration camp and they begged us to take them somewhere.</span> <span id="s2081">One of the girls did not want to take them and I said, “Why not, they are alone.”</span> <span id="s2082">They were actually four of them.</span> <span id="s2083">Two came out and two stayed in hiding.</span> <span id="s2084">I said let’s take them with us.</span> <span id="s2085">After all they are young men and who knows maybe they are hungry.</span> <span id="s2086">They told us that they were not hungry because they went begging at night and they had gotten some food but they just wanted a place where they could stay.</span> <span id="s2087">Where other Jews are because they had not met any Jews in a long time.</span> <span id="s2088">So, we brought them with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: The four people whom you had met in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Four men and then four more came.</span> <span id="s2091">They all had escaped from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2092">There were eight people altogether.</span> <span id="s2093">As a matter of fact, they were so religious that in the morning there were eight men and they called our two men and they used to daven (that means pray) every morning.</span> <span id="s2094">So now there were ten men and they used to make a minion (that is the number, ten men is what is required as per the orthodox Jewish ritual to say certain prayers) and daven.</span> <span id="s2095">These men were so religious.</span> <span id="s2096">One of them was very young and he used to sing like a cantor (cantorial schools educate people to sing and chant the prayers etc.).</span> <span id="s2097">He was young, intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s2098">He was killed in that blockade.</span> <span id="s2099">Actually four of them were killed in that blockade.</span> <span id="s2100">The other four were alive until we were all rescued.</span> <span id="s2101">I don’t know where they went later.</span> <span id="s2102">However, I met a few of them later in a different area of the woods.</span> <span id="s2103">Because after the blockade everyone went to different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: You don’t know what concentration camp they got away from do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2106">But my sister-in-law, she would know this because one of them was good friends with my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s2107">It was a camp from White Russia.</span> <span id="s2108">I will get that information for you.</span> <span id="s2109">I will find it out.</span> <span id="s2110">I can’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: We can get that later on.</span> <span id="s2112">Right now, we are getting pretty close to the end of the tape and we need to stop before too long.</span> <span id="s2113">But it was about the hardest part of the story to tell about your mother’s death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: That was very close to my heart.</span> <span id="s2115">There were many problems there and before and after.</span> <span id="s2116">But that was TRULY THE HARDEST PART!</span> <span id="s2117">It was hard because I lost my brother during the time when we went out to the woods.</span> <span id="s2118">That is when we lost contact with each other.</span> <span id="s2119">My brother went to a different part of the forest than we went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Oh, your brother wasn’t with you at that time?</span> <span id="s2121">Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: My brother went through hell after this entire episode.</span> <span id="s2123">He went to the woods in a different way because instead of going to the right like we went, he went first (probably right from the attic) then we went, the little boy with my mother and the lady with her daughter who was six.</span> <span id="s2124">You see, we lost him because the old lady I told you about, we went through something like a gate in a village.</span> <span id="s2125">The lady caught her coat and could not go through.</span> <span id="s2126">So, I went back and unhooked her.</span> <span id="s2127">In the meantime, I lost my brother.</span> <span id="s2128">It was dark.</span> <span id="s2129">We could not see anything.</span> <span id="s2130">Then my brother heard shots.</span> <span id="s2131">We heard shots also because in that place, close to the electrical station, sawmill, they heard us going by; so whoever was there, in charge, started shooting.</span> <span id="s2132">So we ran and my brother thought that they shot us and that we had been shot.</span> <span id="s2133">So, he went into the woods and he did not look for us anymore.</span> <span id="s2134">He told me, when I next met him, that he thought that the shots killed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: He thought that for a long time, for a couple of years, didn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: He knew later, when I sent a message to him after I had received a message from him that he is alive.</span> <span id="s2137">From the woods.</span> <span id="s2138">I even sent a message to Vilna to the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s2139">They remained in the ghetto in Vilna for a long long time after us.</span> <span id="s2140">Then he got the message that I am alive.</span> <span id="s2141">However my mother was already dead.</span> <span id="s2142">That, however, is a different episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: The place where you were hiding near this village, Margi, was Abe (RF’s husband) said like 50 or 60 km from Kurzeniez, a long distance away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: You mean in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: It was not far.</span> <span id="s2147">Margi, the little village near where my mother was killed was not far.</span> <span id="s2148">These little villages were all around the forest.</span> <span id="s2149">Farmers lived all around there.</span> <span id="s2150">Just plain farmers with a little bit of cattle and pigs and gardens.</span> <span id="s2151">The main industry they had was wood to sell.</span> <span id="s2152">Wood from this forest.</span> <span id="s2153">That was really their main business.</span> <span id="s2154">That is what they lived from.</span> <span id="s2155">They were not really rich people.</span> <span id="s2156">These people were really the ones who saved us.</span> <span id="s2157">They helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">END OF SIDE ONE TAPE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: This is the fourth session.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Now, before we start let us say that this is November 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Yes, November 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Yes, today is the day of the 40th anniversary of the Kristallnacht in Germany (night of broken glass when the synagogues throughout Germany were burned down, where businesses owned by Jews were looted.</span> <span id="s2163">Jewish homes broken into and Jewish males arrested whenever the local dictator wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s2164">The date was November 9/10 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: Oh yes, I had forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: At that time, (Rachel was eleven years old) these were not exactly our troubles but we heard the radio and the people who came from Germany.</span> <span id="s2167">We heard this news in Poland.</span> <span id="s2168">My father was still alive and he spoke and read German.</span> <span id="s2169">So, we knew more than the average person in our little town.</span> <span id="s2170">He used to talk about it with neighbors.</span> <span id="s2171">They really never thought that it ever would involve anybody outside Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: You felt safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Well, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2174">Something happened there.</span> <span id="s2175">Some people didn’t even believe that it did happen.</span> <span id="s2176">They thought, it cannot be!</span> <span id="s2177">The Jews in Germany had felt very good about being German and Jews until then.</span> <span id="s2178">They lived a quiet life.</span> <span id="s2179">As a matter of fact, they lead such a life that they went away a little bit from Judaism.</span> <span id="s2180">Conservative Judaism started prior to that time.</span> <span id="s2181">Reform also started in Germany.</span> <span id="s2182">Well, this is the night and I don’t know if you watched the news, they mentioned it, Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2185">On both channels.</span> <span id="s2186">Yes, we watched both channels at 6:30.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2188">People are beginning to realize what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: Germans not Jewish Germans but Christian Germans came to the old synagogues and they had speeches and lectures there.</span> <span id="s2190">People from the clergy came and they demonstrated that no matter what we do we should do it so that freedom prevails.</span> <span id="s2191">No matter who tries to curtail it.</span> <span id="s2192">Whether from the left or from the right, we have to make sure that freedom is here to stay.</span> <span id="s2193">Then he again, I believe it was the German Chancellor talking, apologized to the Jewry from all over the world for the wrong doings which the Germans had done to the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: I guess that was Helmut Schmidt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: I guess that it was he, since he is the Chancellor.</span> <span id="s2196">They showed him on the news and I saw him today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: They did not used to acknowledge that.</span> <span id="s2198">Adenauer and Schlissinger and these chancellors did not acknowledge that in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Now they are starting to acknowledge it.</span> <span id="s2200">They don’t want the young people to forget.</span> <span id="s2201">They want to do better, to make good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Well, I hope that they succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: On the other hand, they had here the pro-Nazi demonstrations.</span> <span id="s2204">He mentioned the name of a place where such demonstrations took place and it was here in the U.S. (probably Skokie, IL) but I don’t remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: We have to make these tapes so that people can listen to know how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: I hope so!</span> <span id="s2207">However people don’t always want to learn from their mistakes.</span> <span id="s2208">A lot, an awful lot of blood was shed and not only by Jews, not just Jewish blood, an awful lot of blood was shed.</span> <span id="s2209">Of course, we, as Jews, know that we were the main victims.</span> <span id="s2210">We were the main target.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: You mentioned that Mr. Schatz, the schoolmaster, I keep going back to Mr. Schatz because he interests me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: He was interesting.</span> <span id="s2213">He was a very interesting man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: You mentioned that he had some Germans coming to his house.</span> <span id="s2215">They must have been German Jews to talk to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2217">Those were German officials when they wanted to talk to him privately.</span> <span id="s2218">Different Germans.</span> <span id="s2219">Of course, not the SS men and not the Gestapo!</span> <span id="s2220">They were Germans who worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2221">Some of these Germans were very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s2222">They were not civilians.</span> <span id="s2223">In Kurzeniez, where we lived, there were no German civilians at all.</span> <span id="s2224">They had a few wives with them but most of it was the army.</span> <span id="s2225">All of them wore uniforms.</span> <span id="s2226">All of them.</span> <span id="s2227">We didn’t see any German civilians.</span> <span id="s2228">Maybe, there were some, but we did not see them.</span> <span id="s2229">without uniforms we really did not know who was a German and who was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: There weren’t any German Jews living in Kurzeniez before Mr. Schatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2232">We did not have any.</span> <span id="s2233">No, he truly was the only one.</span> <span id="s2234">They could speak to him since they spoke in his language.</span> <span id="s2235">We were friends and he was friendly towards us.</span> <span id="s2236">You see, we were next-door neighbors.</span> <span id="s2237">One Sunday morning they came out.</span> <span id="s2238">there was a nice breeze.</span> <span id="s2239">It was cold because it was winter.</span> <span id="s2240">They started shooting the birds.</span> <span id="s2241">I never knew why or what kind.</span> <span id="s2242">They just started shooting.</span> <span id="s2243">We heard a shot, so I came out of the house into the backyard and Schatz’s backyard opened into ours.</span> <span id="s2244">It was one backyard for both houses and I used to play there.</span> <span id="s2245">I saw Mrs. Schatz.</span> <span id="s2246">I liked her.</span> <span id="s2247">She was a very nice person but then she was not feeling well.</span> <span id="s2248">I used to help her to clean up the house.</span> <span id="s2249">There was really nothing to cleaning the house but they smoked a lot.</span> <span id="s2250">That is the most what I did, clean her living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: I was wondering again what kind of Germans they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: No, I guess just regular normal Germans.</span> <span id="s2253">The Gestapo used to come to the office not to his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: He was not specially friendly with the Gestapo was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s2256">he was doing his job as head of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s2257">He did whatever he was told to do.</span> <span id="s2258">Whatever they asked from him.</span> <span id="s2259">The Germans who came to his house had nothing to do with the rest of the Germans.</span> <span id="s2260">They were just Germans who worked someplace else and on other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: Maybe from Wilaika?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: I just know that nobody stayed there.</span> <span id="s2263">They used to come and visit with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: I wanted to get the timing down again.</span> <span id="s2265">You mentioned the three blockades in the woods.</span> <span id="s2266">Three times when the Germans came or one German with four Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s2267">When they would come into the forest and try to find whomever they could, Jews or partisans.</span> <span id="s2268">The first one was in February 1943.</span> <span id="s2269">The second one was just a short time later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: On April 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: When was the third time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: The third time was around the holidays, in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: Oh, the following September of 1943, after the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: The fourth time was in 1944, in July, but by that time they didn’t get to us.</span> <span id="s2275">The Russians got us out of that one.</span> <span id="s2276">However, more to the east, there were a lot of forests in the east.</span> <span id="s2277">Other people were killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: In September?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: No.</span> <span id="s2280">I am talking about the fourth one.</span> <span id="s2281">We were prepared.</span> <span id="s2282">We knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s2283">When the blockade was coming.</span> <span id="s2284">It was already just a few weeks before we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: So the following June or July?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: It was July because the following month, August we were already being freed.</span> <span id="s2287">We came out of the woods in late August and we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s2289">I will get to that.</span> <span id="s2290">Then you mentioned an occasion when you were helping with digging a pit for potatoes.</span> <span id="s2291">That must have been in the fall of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Yes, that was in 1942, way back in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2293">Yes, at that time, we went to work in Wilaika.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Yes, that was in Wilaika.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2296">This was my group.</span> <span id="s2297">This was just a group which were sent to work nothing personal to it.</span> <span id="s2298">That was in 1941, yes in 1941, it was in September because in October it was already too late for that.</span> <span id="s2299">We still brought the potatoes in from the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: And then the Russian prisoners were helping on this also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: They were really not working with us.</span> <span id="s2302">They were all working next to us near the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2303">They were really worn out by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Then Germans began shooting them, that following winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: That same winter.</span> <span id="s2306">During that winter they really finished them off.</span> <span id="s2307">A few of them at the beginning tried to get out.</span> <span id="s2308">a few of them got somehow out.</span> <span id="s2309">people went in to help from the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s2310">The civilian government from our area asked for help to rescue some prisoners, so a few of them got out.</span> <span id="s2311">Then they started to run away.</span> <span id="s2312">That is, whoever could get out.</span> <span id="s2313">That was the beginning of the partisans, really.</span> <span id="s2314">Before that we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2315">We only had the few people who were hiding the soldiers.</span> <span id="s2316">Starting the partisans, whoever could buy anything, anything to shoot.</span> <span id="s2317">Even an old, old hunting rifle.</span> <span id="s2318">Anything!</span> <span id="s2319">Then these prisoners got out.</span> <span id="s2320">The only way they had of getting ammunition is by killing the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Maybe we will get the full story about that at a later time.</span> <span id="s2322">I am still only getting the dates down so that it is clear in my mind when things happened.</span> <span id="s2323">There were eight people who had gotten out of a camp.</span> <span id="s2324">They were very religious people.</span> <span id="s2325">That was sometime between February and April.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: It was in March.</span> <span id="s2327">There were eight men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: They must have been able to escape just a short time before that.</span> <span id="s2329">They got out of the camp in March of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yes, in March of 1943.</span> <span id="s2331">At that time, we brought them into our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: You said that you found some of them and talked to your friends in letting you take them in?</span> <span id="s2333">Had you remembered the name of the camp they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: It was a small camp.</span> <span id="s2335">One I had never heard about (RF consults with someone else, probably her husband).</span> <span id="s2336">It was Baranovici.</span> <span id="s2337">Yes, that is it.</span> <span id="s2338">It was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s2339">These people were from Baranovici.</span> <span id="s2340">Actually someplace near Maranovitch there was a camp just for men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Oh they were from the town of Baranovici?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Yes, all from Baranovici.</span> <span id="s2343">It is a town.</span> <span id="s2344">They escaped from that camp near there.</span> <span id="s2345">More Jews escaped but we only established contact with these.</span> <span id="s2346">.</span> <span id="s2347">First, we found two, then two more were hiding and they found four more.</span> <span id="s2348">There were eight.</span> <span id="s2349">Until we got them together, we first had to contact our people to find out if they wanted them.</span> <span id="s2350">You know, if all the Jews were to congregate together, it would be dangerous.</span> <span id="s2351">It would then be hard to escape into a different place.</span> <span id="s2352">So, in case somebody gets hold of them or someone knows that Jews are sitting there and hiding and tells the Germans, it could be very bad.</span> <span id="s2353">Like we were separate, only eight people in our bunker.</span> <span id="s2354">We were all alone.</span> <span id="s2355">All alone.</span> <span id="s2356">A long way from any others, maybe one mile from us was another small camp similar to ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: You did not want them too close together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: No, No!</span> <span id="s2359">You see, at one place in the forest, in Russian it is called the “Pasha”, that is their name for forest.</span> <span id="s2360">In that one place, like a block, a whole lot of Jews were sitting there.</span> <span id="s2361">They didn’t even have any underground bunker like we did.</span> <span id="s2362">Just on top, they set up tents and they lived there for three winters.</span> <span id="s2363">Abe’s mother lived there with three sisters.</span> <span id="s2364">All three of them were there.</span> <span id="s2365">There were also some of Abe’s uncles and cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s2367">Some of the people were gathered in another part of the forest.</span> <span id="s2368">They were gathered under tents and stayed through the whole winter that way.</span> <span id="s2369">Quite a few people together, evidently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Nobody found them?</span> <span id="s2372">The Germans didn’t find them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: The Germans knew because somebody had told them that there were a number in this specific block.</span> <span id="s2374">All the blocks had been designated by numbers, since the entire forest was divided into blocks.</span> <span id="s2375">The neighboring villages, they knew which block had which number because somehow, if the farmers went for wood, which they later sold, they had to know the numbers.</span> <span id="s2376">If you did not have such numbers as guidelines, you could get lost.</span> <span id="s2377">For example, the 66th block or the 42nd block of that forest was between four villages.</span> <span id="s2378">There was a village on each side so in the block there was something like a little road and that road took you right to one of the villages.</span> <span id="s2379">So, all the villagers around one block knew where the Jews were.</span> <span id="s2380">As a matter of fact, and I am certain of this, when the first blockade happened in February 1943, during which they caught and killed my mother and another lady, they also captured and took hostage one man.</span> <span id="s2381">He had gotten up in the morning to feed the cattle.</span> <span id="s2382">They caught him and they took him with them.</span> <span id="s2383">They asked him to show them where this and this block was.</span> <span id="s2384">There could have been Russians hiding there.</span> <span id="s2385">So they knew that they were going to that place.</span> <span id="s2386">They did not go where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s2387">They did not appear to care because they never asked my mother from where she came.</span> <span id="s2388">They didn’t even bother to ask the ladies.</span> <span id="s2389">Mother just begged them to let her live because they let him live.</span> <span id="s2390">They had been sitting together when they were asking for the address where that big camp of Jews was.</span> <span id="s2391">That is where most of the Jews were.</span> <span id="s2392">After they shot the ladies they let him go because they were on their way to that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Did the Germans go to that address?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2395">They went there and I believe, they killed thirty-two people that day.</span> <span id="s2396">A few of the villagers, two young men were killed in the villages as my mother was in the woods.</span> <span id="s2397">They were caught there by surprise.</span> <span id="s2398">A few of them were killed just because they didn’t hide or run away.</span> <span id="s2399">You see that day, when I heard the shots, remember that I told you that I heard shots in the morning, they were probably the shots which killed my mother and this lady.</span> <span id="s2400">These people probably heard them also because the shots were closer to them than to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: They were on the other side of the shots?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: That is right!</span> <span id="s2403">So they knew that it was the signal that something was wrong.</span> <span id="s2404">People came back from the other side of the villages and they also told them that there is something wrong.</span> <span id="s2405">That something was going on.</span> <span id="s2406">After all, we were surprised by the first blockade.</span> <span id="s2407">You know, the first time it is always harder to know what to do.</span> <span id="s2408">We did not really know what to do.</span> <span id="s2409">Altogether, they estimated that thirty-two people were killed on that day.</span> <span id="s2410">Mostly people from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s2411">As I said, the Germans didn’t do anything after dark.</span> <span id="s2412">Somehow they were frightened of the dark.</span> <span id="s2413">They were afraid because most of what the partisans did what they did at night.</span> <span id="s2414">The partisans did not bother to go out during the day.</span> <span id="s2415">So, the Germans made sure that they were back out of the forest at night and that they did not catch any partisans.</span> <span id="s2416">The partisans always watched so that they would know what was going on.</span> <span id="s2417">They had connections all over.</span> <span id="s2418">Every village had someone working for the partisans.</span> <span id="s2419">They knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s2420">They packed up and they went someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: How far would it be from one village to another, five km or six km?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: That is right, about five km or sometimes six.</span> <span id="s2423">It was not far.</span> <span id="s2424">Some villages were side by side next to each other.</span> <span id="s2425">Then there were other people living by themselves.</span> <span id="s2426">Farmers, just like you see it here.</span> <span id="s2427">One farm with a lot of ground around it.</span> <span id="s2428">Sometimes these farmers were living very far from each other, not together as on one street.</span> <span id="s2429">That is how the richer people lived.</span> <span id="s2430">They had bigger farms.</span> <span id="s2431">Other than that all the villages were alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: OK, I am beginning to get a general picture of life in your area.</span> <span id="s2433">How did you manage to survive?</span> <span id="s2434">Of course, there were people who ran around on an area of three to five miles.</span> <span id="s2435">There would be somebody but how did you live in the bunker?</span> <span id="s2436">I was wondering, did you have a little store?</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: Yes, you see, we were in the open under a tree without anything else from September to Christmas time.</span> <span id="s2438">We made a fire.</span> <span id="s2439">After all, we had a lot of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Then you began to dig a hole?</span> <span id="s2441">Did you have shovels?</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: Yes we did.</span> <span id="s2443">You see I was with my mother at that time, my mother could not do any physical work then, and these two men they had their two families, they got up and they found the place.</span> <span id="s2444">We were actually three families and the others were singles.</span> <span id="s2445">I guess there were actually three men with one younger man who did the digging.</span> <span id="s2446">They got up in the mornings and they got shovels and they worked because they knew that sooner or later we would get a heavy frost and that it is harder to dig in the winter in frozen ground.</span> <span id="s2447">So they built something like a bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: How deep was it, like six feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: It was deep enough for us to stand up and walk around in it.</span> <span id="s2450">You see, it was lined with wood inside and the roof was flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: What, a clump of trees cut up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s2453">They covered it and later on, the snow covered it so that no one could even see it.</span> <span id="s2454">Then, inside, we had left an opening which we could, of course, close since otherwise it would have been cold.</span> <span id="s2455">Then we went into it kind of on a downhill, kind of a slide, not a slick slide, however, because we had to come up also.</span> <span id="s2456">If it was slick, we could not have come up.</span> <span id="s2457">We could not have gotten out of there.</span> <span id="s2458">They built a stove of clay.</span> <span id="s2459">We used it to cook.</span> <span id="s2460">After all, we ate.</span> <span id="s2461">We could cook potatoes and whatever we had and it was warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: An open fire then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: No.</span> <span id="s2464">It was closed.</span> <span id="s2465">An inside fireplace.</span> <span id="s2466">The top was straight and it was shaped.</span> <span id="s2467">We burned the wood inside day and night.</span> <span id="s2468">It kept us warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: It was clay?</span> <span id="s2470">Even the top was clay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yes, it was all made up of clay.</span> <span id="s2472">The top was made of bricks which at that time we got from the villages.</span> <span id="s2473">We also had gotten the shovels from the villages.</span> <span id="s2474">The only thing which we had to be careful about was who we talked to in the villages.</span> <span id="s2475">We could not trust all the individuals.</span> <span id="s2476">Of course, we had to make sure that those we couldn’t trust didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s2477">As I told you, we used to go begging in order to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Did you go every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: No!</span> <span id="s2480">No!</span> <span id="s2481">If we went every day and everybody would give us something we would have too much food.</span> <span id="s2482">we couldn’t eat so much.</span> <span id="s2483">So we went about twice a week and we got food.</span> <span id="s2484">Everybody gave something.</span> <span id="s2485">One lady may give us a potato, another lady may give us a few carrots, another gave us cabbage, another gave us a little bit of salt.</span> <span id="s2486">Salt was like gold.</span> <span id="s2487">Another would give us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2488">So you see, that we got food.</span> <span id="s2489">We got food like real beggars.</span> <span id="s2490">They helped us.</span> <span id="s2491">The just couldn’t say no to us.</span> <span id="s2492">These people were really good people.</span> <span id="s2493">What could they do!</span> <span id="s2494">They said there are children, there are people whose lives depend on us giving them something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: Was it a big enough village to have a church of it’s own?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A; No.</span> <span id="s2497">They did not have churches.</span> <span id="s2498">They had like a church on the road serving several villages.</span> <span id="s2499">There was one village which had a church of it’s own.</span> <span id="s2500">This was a bigger village.</span> <span id="s2501">It was like a small town.</span> <span id="s2502">It was further away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Were these people very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: I didn’t see them as being religious.</span> <span id="s2505">In some places I used to stay for a few days with some people.</span> <span id="s2506">Some people kept me because when I lost my mother I had nobody to care for me and to come back to.</span> <span id="s2507">So whenever it was quiet and they were not afraid of Germans.</span> <span id="s2508">You see the problem was that the people themselves were afraid.</span> <span id="s2509">They were afraid of one another.</span> <span id="s2510">That someone would tell that they kept a Jewish girl in their house.</span> <span id="s2511">They would ask me to stay over for a day or two.</span> <span id="s2512">They would keep me gladly.</span> <span id="s2513">Why not!</span> <span id="s2514">I was young.</span> <span id="s2515">I was fifteen.</span> <span id="s2516">I was healthy.</span> <span id="s2517">I could help them gladly.</span> <span id="s2518">You know I didn’t eat their food for nothing.</span> <span id="s2519">I did help them a lot.</span> <span id="s2520">When I came to one of these houses I really worked hard.</span> <span id="s2521">After all, I always liked to help them anyways.</span> <span id="s2522">As long as I can remember even when I was very little, I used to help my mother.</span> <span id="s2523">Just to have something to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: It seems like you always were that way!</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A; Yes, that is what I did most of my life.</span> <span id="s2526">As a matter of fact, it was a bad winter, a very stormy winter, a very cold one.</span> <span id="s2527">I was in one place, both the man and his wife were old.</span> <span id="s2528">Their sons had gone over to the partisans.</span> <span id="s2529">One daughter was a very sick woman.</span> <span id="s2530">I believe that she passed away later on, at the end of the war when we moved to a different place, so I am not certain since I had no more contact with them.</span> <span id="s2531">They kept me there for an entire week.</span> <span id="s2532">I really had not come to them for that.</span> <span id="s2533">I had not asked them for it.</span> <span id="s2534">I just came to that house and asked them if I could come in to bake bread.</span> <span id="s2535">Just to make a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s2536">You want to know how I got up the nerve to ask for that?</span> <span id="s2537">Well, that was nothing that extraordinary.</span> <span id="s2538">It was the harvest time but they had only the grain.</span> <span id="s2539">I said, “What a lot of grain!</span> <span id="s2540">What do you do with the grain?”</span> <span id="s2541">I went to that fellow, he was a very good really religious man.</span> <span id="s2542">As if he was actually speaking to G-d, he spoke wholeheartedly because that is a good thing to do.</span> <span id="s2543">So he said to me, “OK, child, come in.”</span> <span id="s2544">So, I came in with the grain and I said, “I will first grind it on the stone.”</span> <span id="s2545">That is what we did and we had the flour.</span> <span id="s2546">So I started to work.</span> <span id="s2547">To make the dough you have to wait at least twelve hours until it is ready and then you knead it in order to make the bread next.</span> <span id="s2548">So I stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s2549">So naturally while I stayed overnight I helped the old lady.</span> <span id="s2550">He liked that because he thought that I would not do anything and she could not do much since she was very weak.</span> <span id="s2551">He liked my work so much.</span> <span id="s2552">You know I knew how to do the work since I had done it for the Polish lady.</span> <span id="s2553">As a matter of fact, I knew how to do everything in the kitchen particularly.</span> <span id="s2554">He said, ‘It is a blessing to have you in the house.”</span> <span id="s2555">I cleaned everything, every room in the house.</span> <span id="s2556">I served them at the table.</span> <span id="s2557">He was very pleased!</span> <span id="s2558">He said, “Of course, the Germans!</span> <span id="s2559">If there could only be peace in the world and we could have the help of someone like you!”</span> <span id="s2560">It was night when somebody knocked at the door and there was a terrible storm.</span> <span id="s2561">The snow was drifting over the windows so that you couldn’t see through them.</span> <span id="s2562">The knock on the door was loud, so he was afraid, he really was afraid!</span> <span id="s2563">He was scared but he told me right away, “You don’t move.</span> <span id="s2564">Don’t make any move.”</span> <span id="s2565">If there were Germans he would let them in but they were even afraid of their own people.</span> <span id="s2566">Keeping a Jewish girl there was a crime, however, luckily they were partisans.</span> <span id="s2567">Even the partisans were hunting for people, for strangers.</span> <span id="s2568">So, they came and they asked them to explain if they had strangers in the house.</span> <span id="s2569">He said no, nobody!</span> <span id="s2570">it is all my family.</span> <span id="s2571">Later, the same night, one of his sons came.</span> <span id="s2572">The old man told him that he was keeping a Jewish girl from the forest in his house.</span> <span id="s2573">He added, “I cannot send her on; it is so bitterly cold.’</span> <span id="s2574">By that time, it was already early morning, actually daybreak.</span> <span id="s2575">So the son said, “OK dad, but be careful.”</span> <span id="s2576">He ate some breakfast and he left.</span> <span id="s2577">This was not the married son who had come, there were two sons.</span> <span id="s2578">Anyways, I was there for an entire week.</span> <span id="s2579">During that time I baked my bread.</span> <span id="s2580">I really didn’t need bread since I was alone and I would eat it alone.</span> <span id="s2581">So I left it there anyways.</span> <span id="s2582">However, he wanted to know how a fifteen year old girl can bake bread like this.</span> <span id="s2583">I was afraid to go out to the cattle which he had.</span> <span id="s2584">In our White Russian neighborhood the farmers have a kind of forehouse which is kept empty where they keep a lot of grain for the cattle.</span> <span id="s2585">Since it is so cold in the wintertime, people used to go there to clean up and to put everything in order.</span> <span id="s2586">That was really a very good week for me.</span> <span id="s2587">First of all, I was fed well, then I was warm.</span> <span id="s2588">That was lucky for me since that was the worst week of that entire winter.</span> <span id="s2589">During that week the storm quieted down a little.</span> <span id="s2590">However, at the end of that week I said that I had to go.</span> <span id="s2591">That I couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s2592">I had several other people who offered to keep me in that village.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: Was that in Ardina?</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: No, it was in a different village called Norun.</span> <span id="s2595">We had to go through a little stream of water to go from our place to this village by a little boat or by a little bridge which they had built at one place.</span> <span id="s2596">This was a nice sized village and there a lot of people knew me.</span> <span id="s2597">They knew that I did not come only to beg.</span> <span id="s2598">There was also a family with small children who would have liked to keep me.</span> <span id="s2599">However, they were not actually part of the village.</span> <span id="s2600">If something had happened such as if the Germans would come, they would have been there first, so they were really afraid.</span> <span id="s2601">They were living in a little tiny home between villages.</span> <span id="s2602">Actually, the Germans were afraid that some of these homes were communist strongholds, so they didn’t dare to go there.</span> <span id="s2603">Even the blockade in February was not all that easy for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Now that was then in late February or just a few weeks after your mother had been shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2606">That was the same month.</span> <span id="s2607">That was also the month when a big storm came.</span> <span id="s2608">We did have a lot of snow then.</span> <span id="s2609">This blizzard kept blowing for an entire week.</span> <span id="s2610">Even worse than what we had in Dayton last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: Did this farmer know that your mother had been shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Yes, he knew.</span> <span id="s2613">As a matter of fact, he had known my father.</span> <span id="s2614">You see, a lot of people knew my father.</span> <span id="s2615">You see my father traveled in the summertime.</span> <span id="s2616">He was traveling a lot when he bought and sold cattle.</span> <span id="s2617">He knew a lot of people and a lot of people knew him.</span> <span id="s2618">He was also known for his ability to tell a joke.</span> <span id="s2619">He was well liked.</span> <span id="s2620">I came to some places about which I had never heard before and when people used to ask me, as they often did, who I was, where I came from and I told them that my father was Avram the butcher from Kureniez.</span> <span id="s2621">They used to tell me how much they liked my father.</span> <span id="s2622">I had never known how many people liked him.</span> <span id="s2623">This old man had known my father.</span> <span id="s2624">I don’t know how, but he kept me, out of respect for my father.</span> <span id="s2625">You see, when my father was dead and the Russians came and closed all the businesses because they wanted Communism, farmers from all around came and brought my mother cattle for no money.</span> <span id="s2626">She was able to use the cattle as she wished, butchering them or trading them and was able to pay them later.</span> <span id="s2627">No one knew what money had any value left due to the war and the Russians and Germans splitting Poland up.</span> <span id="s2628">That is how my mother was able to get her life back on an open keel for all four of us.</span> <span id="s2629">She even made money from this until the Germans came.</span> <span id="s2630">Then, of course, it stopped.</span> <span id="s2631">That is how nice the people were.</span> <span id="s2632">They were shocked that my father had died.</span> <span id="s2633">That, of course, lasted only until the Germans came, in September 1941.</span> <span id="s2634">Of course, in 1939 and 1940 no one could do any business, only work for the government because of Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: I never had gotten your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: It was Avram.</span> <span id="s2637">That means Avarpwocz, AVARPWOCZ (spelled by WS rather rapidly).</span> <span id="s2638">However, while we were in the woods that is what we used to do twice a week, go to the villages.</span> <span id="s2639">Once in a while, we used to go out not just begging but otherwise also.</span> <span id="s2640">There was even a time when my mother was still alive in Margi that a young man from that other village came to our bunker and asked us to go to a Saturday night dance.</span> <span id="s2641">Of course, we didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s2642">We were afraid but they trusted us.</span> <span id="s2643">We were five young girls in one place.</span> <span id="s2644">He was a spokesman for his village and he said, “You are part of us now.”</span> <span id="s2645">But we didn’t go, we just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2646">However, once we went there, my mother and I and two other girls and their mother, that lady who was killed with my mother, on a Saturday night.</span> <span id="s2647">They used to have a little sauna outside.</span> <span id="s2648">The regular way to make steam by pouring water over hot bricks.</span> <span id="s2649">You know actually a sauna without electricity.</span> <span id="s2650">The sauna was just outside in a little building ,he inside of which was mainly made of stone.</span> <span id="s2651">That sauna was really hot but it was a good place to bathe.</span> <span id="s2652">After all, we had to bathe also, we were people.</span> <span id="s2653">It was cold and such a sauna, all the steam, really cleansed you.</span> <span id="s2654">It used to be a custom for people to use such a sauna on Saturday nights or Sundays to bathe.</span> <span id="s2655">So they let us in after they were finished.</span> <span id="s2656">Obviously, that was good for us because in our bunker where we lived there was one man, we had two single men, who had a coat made of sheepskin.</span> <span id="s2657">And that coat was full with lice.</span> <span id="s2658">The lice just traveled inside the coat so you could not see them.</span> <span id="s2659">We used to take this coat to the sauna and expose it to the steam so as to kill the lice.</span> <span id="s2660">Especially, we young girl were very sensitive to lice.</span> <span id="s2661">That is why my mother tried to make a new mattress for us.</span> <span id="s2662">We certainly wanted to keep clean.</span> <span id="s2663">I had long hair and I wanted such hair since my mother had long hair.</span> <span id="s2664">So cleanliness was most important!</span> <span id="s2665">So we wanted to go to such a sauna to clean up particularly in the winter.</span> <span id="s2666">During the summer we could clean ourselves outside.</span> <span id="s2667">Then we made a fire and we heated water and with hot stones, we had the equivalent of our own sauna.</span> <span id="s2668">Of course, we could not change clothes much since we didn’t have many spare clothes.</span> <span id="s2669">As a matter of fact, we didn’t have any extra clothing.</span> <span id="s2670">We had the same dress.</span> <span id="s2671">We washed it and in this way we cleaned ourselves and our clothes.</span> <span id="s2672">This was also healthy for the body.</span> <span id="s2673">So that evening, after the sauna in Margi, they bathed and then they gave us the room and then we bathed.</span> <span id="s2674">After we were done and we were already ready to leave.</span> <span id="s2675">It was the house of the mayor of Margi, one of his two sons came.</span> <span id="s2676">By that time they already had active partisans.</span> <span id="s2677">So, the son came and said, “The partisans want you to come in.</span> <span id="s2678">we are having a party.”</span> <span id="s2679">And you know that we had to run away from there!</span> <span id="s2680">First of all, they told my mother that she cannot come to the party because she is too old.</span> <span id="s2681">She was only 47 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s2682">However 47 appeared old to all of us.</span> <span id="s2683">Especially in wartime.</span> <span id="s2684">They said, “No, you go back to where you live and we will bring your daughters back to you.”</span> <span id="s2685">They thought that all three of us were her daughters.</span> <span id="s2686">The others were actually two sisters who now live here in the United States.</span> <span id="s2687">We had to leave because we were also afraid of the partisans especially on Saturday nights when they got wild.</span> <span id="s2688">We went to the party sometimes but later on we noticed it.</span> <span id="s2689">You know we had heads so much that we could observe things.</span> <span id="s2690">We noticed that they were drinking too much on Saturday night and the parties were getting wild.</span> <span id="s2691">They had a few girls there from the village, their own girls.</span> <span id="s2692">The mayor’s daughter, she was a beautiful girl but she had a bad ending.</span> <span id="s2693">However, that is a story by itself.</span> <span id="s2694">They had a party which lasted very late.</span> <span id="s2695">I was really young at the time and inexperienced and I wouldn’t let anybody touch me.</span> <span id="s2696">I was very much afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s2697">You know, here you get sex education in school, from the television and from books but we didn’t have any of it, so I was just terrified.</span> <span id="s2698">I know that nothing good would come of it, not only because the boys from the village but also the partisans.</span> <span id="s2699">They were rough, even rougher than the villagers so, we somehow made our escape.</span> <span id="s2700">One girl stayed to entertain them, she was a little older.</span> <span id="s2701">She danced with them and then when we left we told the guys who has asked us that we had to go.</span> <span id="s2702">They said, “If you have to go, you have to go by yourselves!</span> <span id="s2703">You have to go outside.”</span> <span id="s2704">There was no way that anyone would bother us so we went.</span> <span id="s2705">My mother was waiting across the street so we went with my mother.</span> <span id="s2706">Then when she was by herself, and we knew that we could talk, we decided to try to get that other girl out.</span> <span id="s2707">We knocked three knocks so she would know and she would come out.</span> <span id="s2708">Also she told them something and slipped out and we ran away.</span> <span id="s2709">They ran after us but we ran so fast that we hardly could breathe.</span> <span id="s2710">We got back home.</span> <span id="s2711">You know I mean the bunker -- quite breathless.</span> <span id="s2712">We were just afraid to get involved with them.</span> <span id="s2713">That was already during the winter.</span> <span id="s2714">It was very cold!</span> <span id="s2715">Naturally, when we ran we didn’t feel the cold.</span> <span id="s2716">Even then, it was so hard to stay away from these fellows.</span> <span id="s2717">Maybe they didn’t mean any harm, but they maybe wanted us just to be like the other girls, like the girls from the village/</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: However, you couldn’t trust that, you couldn’t take chances?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A: Of course, we were young girls.</span> <span id="s2720">They wouldn’t kill us but they would do us other harm maybe.</span> <span id="s2721">You could never be sure especially at that time.</span> <span id="s2722">In the beginning, in the forest, it was tough.</span> <span id="s2723">Later on, there was already a full- fledged partisan group.</span> <span id="s2724">Then the Germans made the rule that any man who did anything with the partisans, who carried any weapons or even just sold them anything would be punished.</span> <span id="s2725">Later on, they just shot anybody who was involved with the partisans in the slightest way.</span> <span id="s2726">A guy who was caught was brought to a simulated trial and then disciplined similarly.</span> <span id="s2727">At first, you could get by if you just watched yourself very carefully.</span> <span id="s2728">A few months later, while my mother was still alive, we didn’t have as many partisans then as yet.</span> <span id="s2729">Still, she did always keep me beside her and she watched over me.</span> <span id="s2730">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s2731">The food wasn’t so bad since we could easily beg.</span> <span id="s2732">It was easy to go begging at night but of course, it isn’t pleasant.</span> <span id="s2733">People gave us whatever they could.</span> <span id="s2734">So we always had food.</span> <span id="s2735">We were not hungry then.</span> <span id="s2736">Sure, we were hungry at the beginning of the time we were in the woods since we didn’t know where we were and whom we could trust.</span> <span id="s2737">Once we found the place where we settled we no longer suffered from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: Where did you get your water from, did you dig a well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: We begged.</span> <span id="s2740">Everyplace we begged!</span> <span id="s2741">You see, before we go to the bunker we lived in maybe twenty different places.</span> <span id="s2742">We were just in the open and we moved from one place to another.</span> <span id="s2743">Whenever somebody came into the woods, maybe just a villager drove by and knew that we were there.</span> <span id="s2744">We were afraid that they would tell.</span> <span id="s2745">After all, these were the first few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: So you just kept moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: Yes, then we just kept moving to another place.</span> <span id="s2748">At first, we got somewhere and we thought oh, this is a good place.</span> <span id="s2749">So we dug a hole for the water right away.</span> <span id="s2750">If we couldn’t find good water we didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s2751">Fresh water was needed for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: So water was not very hard to come by?</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: No, so once we had clean water we always boiled water, we washed our hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: So you had a few kettles to boil water in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2756">We had some kettles.</span> <span id="s2757">We even had something to boil potatoes in.</span> <span id="s2758">We had obtained something like this.</span> <span id="s2759">We found these in the villages.</span> <span id="s2760">Later on, that was no problem because later on the groups of partisans lived there, all over the forest.</span> <span id="s2761">Oh, there were a lot of partisans.</span> <span id="s2762">They had everything.</span> <span id="s2763">They had set up bunkers for twenty people.</span> <span id="s2764">Some of them were even large enough to accommodate maybe sixty people with twenty people in one corner.</span> <span id="s2765">When they got set up, it was unbelievable what all was set up underground in the woods.</span> <span id="s2766">That, of course, was one year later.</span> <span id="s2767">The Russians sent material and equipment by parachutes.</span> <span id="s2768">So then, we had everything and they could get anything they wanted dropped to them.</span> <span id="s2769">We even got doctors.</span> <span id="s2770">I was even treated when I had trouble with my throat by a doctor from the partisans.</span> <span id="s2771">They made me go because they were afraid that I had more than a sore throat.</span> <span id="s2772">A lot of people also had young children with them in the woods.</span> <span id="s2773">So they made me go and the doctor treated me.</span> <span id="s2774">That was a regular doctor during the second winter in the woods.</span> <span id="s2775">Yes, the first winter was tough!</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Let’s see, how big was your bunker?</span> <span id="s2777">About the size of this room, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: No, not as large as this living room.</span> <span id="s2779">Maybe from the window to the couch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: About twelve feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: Yes, about that.</span> <span id="s2782">It was narrow.</span> <span id="s2783">The entire length was maybe like a table, but it was made out of wood as a frame and we made mattresses out of straw on which we slept on both sides of the separation.</span> <span id="s2784">Here, at the end, was a family which had four children whose mother was killed with my mother and her husband.</span> <span id="s2785">Then, there were two more ladies, two single ladies, they were sisters and then my mother and me.</span> <span id="s2786">Then, on the other side, there was one family with one child.</span> <span id="s2787">We were nineteen all together.</span> <span id="s2788">However, one of the group wasn’t always with us.</span> <span id="s2789">He was a loner.</span> <span id="s2790">He came and went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: You had a door at one end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: We had one door and there was cement just across the door.</span> <span id="s2793">Yes, just across.</span> <span id="s2794">We had build a little chimney through the ceiling.</span> <span id="s2795">We also had a little window at the end opposite the door, for ventilation and so that we could see the light.</span> <span id="s2796">You see, we couldn’t see through the wooden door.</span> <span id="s2797">It was just to allow us in and out but they built it well.</span> <span id="s2798">The door was damaged during the second blockade when they threw the grenade.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: The door stood upright?</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s2801">We stayed there only until April 29, 1943.</span> <span id="s2802">Then it was damaged so that we could no longer use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Who were you with after that blockade?</span> <span id="s2804">Just with the people from the Kurzeniez?</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: Then, when that bunker was broken up on the 29th of April?</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">A: Then we moved to a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: You dug another hole?</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Another place with another hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s2810">That was a different kind of hole.</span> <span id="s2811">It was only half way below ground.</span> <span id="s2812">It was built up.</span> <span id="s2813">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q It was like a log house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: Yes, we still had to go down but only half way.</span> <span id="s2816">But when we slept then the beds we made were right between the windows.</span> <span id="s2817">I call them beds.</span> <span id="s2818">So it was a lot more airy because we were half way up.</span> <span id="s2819">That second bunker was also made better.</span> <span id="s2820">It was nicer.</span> <span id="s2821">We got bigger logs to build it with.</span> <span id="s2822">It really looked like a little home.</span> <span id="s2823">However, then we were not as many people.</span> <span id="s2824">We were people from a different group.</span> <span id="s2825">It was a different place.</span> <span id="s2826">You see, after April 29th we all separated.</span> <span id="s2827">The villager who came to invite me that night, he showed us where we could dig.</span> <span id="s2828">He really gave us the place.</span> <span id="s2829">It was also next to the village of Margi.</span> <span id="s2830">We are talking about the same village but in a different place.</span> <span id="s2831">Actually on the other side of Margi.</span> <span id="s2832">The villager showed us where we actually passed by during the day of the blockade when we saw the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: Do you remember the man’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">A: Nickolai but I don’t know the rest of his name.</span> <span id="s2835">I never did.</span> <span id="s2836">We called him Cholai.</span> <span id="s2837">You see in Russian we always shortened the names.</span> <span id="s2838">He was truly nice.</span> <span id="s2839">He was a nice young guy.</span> <span id="s2840">He worked with the partisans.</span> <span id="s2841">He was our contact with the partisans.</span> <span id="s2842">He went to the smaller cities to the farms as a kind of messenger.</span> <span id="s2843">He found out whatever he could, that was his job for the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: You see, the more names like that which we can put on the tape the more credible the entire story is.</span> <span id="s2845">The more people will feel that you are not making it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: How can you make up stories like that?</span> <span id="s2847">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s2848">It is not a story!</span> <span id="s2849">It is something which happened!</span> <span id="s2850">You can’t even tell so many things1 it is impossible!!</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q: The only thing is that when someone sits down to write a history about it, to just tell the whole story in a book, then they can refer to the stories and they know what story goes with what story and they can put it all into the proper sequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A: Yes, because I will tell you exactly how it happened day after day.</span> <span id="s2853">For example, I tied the first blockade to the second blockade and I tell you what happened before the first blockade.</span> <span id="s2854">Before we went to the bunker we had so much trouble finding a place.</span> <span id="s2855">One fellow, the one who I told you was the only survivor when they killed fifty-three out of fifty-four men who were accused of being communists in the very beginning and who had to bury all the others.</span> <span id="s2856">He survived in our corner of the woods and he was with the partisans.</span> <span id="s2857">He was a very courageous young man.</span> <span id="s2858">All the eagerness to kill and take his revenge was already in his blood.</span> <span id="s2859">So, he was the first one to join the partisans.</span> <span id="s2860">He rode on a horse.</span> <span id="s2861">He had learned to handle horses from his father.</span> <span id="s2862">He grew up with horses.</span> <span id="s2863">He rode a horse and he came to all the Jews who were gathered in one place without even knowing if we had to winter there or not.</span> <span id="s2864">He talked to the partisans and he told them that they had to bring all these Jews who survived from Kurzeniez and a few other towns around.</span> <span id="s2865">That they should be taken through the fighting line and taken to Russia.</span> <span id="s2866">He organized it and we all went like cattle.</span> <span id="s2867">A few partisans went in front of us.</span> <span id="s2868">We came to Janzun, it was a big station (the spelling is approximate since it has not been located on the map) and the Germans started to shoot.</span> <span id="s2869">There was too much commotion going on.</span> <span id="s2870">Many had children on their shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: That turned out not to have been such a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2873">There were too many all at once.</span> <span id="s2874">It should have been done by groups.</span> <span id="s2875">A group could probably have gotten through.</span> <span id="s2876">That was the first time and they had made a mistake.</span> <span id="s2877">The Germans started shooting and when they started shooting, we started to run back.</span> <span id="s2878">What else could we have done since we were helpless people.</span> <span id="s2879">We had to cross the lines somewheres.</span> <span id="s2880">Everyone ran in a different direction.</span> <span id="s2881">A young lady, she was the daughter of a fellow who did the ritual killing, who had lived in the woods, they were actually three sisters.</span> <span id="s2882">One of whom had a child, she left her little boy and she ran away.</span> <span id="s2883">That gives you an idea of the panic that existed.</span> <span id="s2884">You see, the Germans then came and ran after us.</span> <span id="s2885">They shot but they could not find us because everybody ran in another direction.</span> <span id="s2886">My mother said we are not going to drop the piece of bread which we had with us.</span> <span id="s2887">We had just a little something with us, But in case, she said, it gets to be so bad, we will drop it.</span> <span id="s2888">But don’t leave me, just hold on to my hand.</span> <span id="s2889">We held hands then because otherwise people just couldn’t find one another.</span> <span id="s2890">There was such a panic.</span> <span id="s2891">All of a sudden we ran away.</span> <span id="s2892">it was already dawn when we got to a village.</span> <span id="s2893">Then all of us gathered together with the two partisans who had escorted us.</span> <span id="s2894">They came back and they grouped us again.</span> <span id="s2895">They said, “We will wait here one hour more and whoever comes it is ok.</span> <span id="s2896">Those who don’t make it, that is too bad.</span> <span id="s2897">We will go back into the forest.”</span> <span id="s2898">A few didn’t come and we never knew what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s2899">However we learned one thing from a villager the next day.</span> <span id="s2900">That little baby boy which his mother had dropped, the villager found that the Germans had shot him.</span> <span id="s2901">That young lady could never forgive herself for dropping the baby.</span> <span id="s2902">She has been a sick person since then.</span> <span id="s2903">She got through the whole mess like I have but she is alive, all three sisters are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: This must have been September or October 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: It was October 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: What was the man’s name who had the idea of going through the German lines?</span> <span id="s2907">The one who was riding the horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">A: As a matter of fact, his last name was the same as mine, Avarowicz.</span> <span id="s2909">His first name was Joshua.</span> <span id="s2910">Yes, Joshua Avarowicz.</span> <span id="s2911">He still lives in Russia.</span> <span id="s2912">I heard from him three years ago.</span> <span id="s2913">He did not want to leave because he married a Russian girl.</span> <span id="s2914">Later on, he was a boy friend of my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s2915">That’s my husband’s sister.</span> <span id="s2916">He was a handsome, nice looking man.</span> <span id="s2917">He was also a really nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Do you know where, in what city he is living now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: I think in Moldavskaya ?</span> <span id="s2920">(there is such a town in the USSR).</span> <span id="s2921">He went back to Kurzeniez where there is nothing.</span> <span id="s2922">It was all burned down.</span> <span id="s2923">Then, he went to a place where I was in school (sounds like Posna).</span> <span id="s2924">Then he was sent for a job to Moldavskaya.</span> <span id="s2925">The Russians went him.</span> <span id="s2926">I don’t believe that he ever was a communist but he still lives in Russia because he married a Russian girl.</span> <span id="s2927">She is a doctor.</span> <span id="s2928">They have one child.</span> <span id="s2929">I heard that he is sick now, from my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: What sort of work does he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: He was a manager of a distillery.</span> <span id="s2932">They make vodka and other spirits.</span> <span id="s2933">He still works with something like this.</span> <span id="s2934">He is in a different place than Moldavskaya.</span> <span id="s2935">He does not stay in one place.</span> <span id="s2936">The latest I had heard is that he was in Moldavskaya and then he was transferred to Minsk.</span> <span id="s2937">It is all in the same general area.</span> <span id="s2938">This guy came back and he found all of us and we came back to the forest the next morning.</span> <span id="s2939">At that time, we had to go through the railroad right of way, so the partisans told us how to go through.</span> <span id="s2940">He told us you all go through the railroad right of way and after you cross the railroad there is a small forest.</span> <span id="s2941">It is not really the woods you are after but it is a small forest and there we will meet.</span> <span id="s2942">Then we will rest a while before going on.</span> <span id="s2943">You know that he was in charge with a few members of the partisans.</span> <span id="s2944">When we got through the railroad right of way and it had an alarm system that, if you touch it, it rings.</span> <span id="s2945">So one was holding it up, probably with a stick, and we all went through.</span> <span id="s2946">He had told us not to touch it so that the Germans would not hear us.</span> <span id="s2947">Later on, then we were resting, so this young girl who was from our hiding place in Kurzeniez came over to me and said, “Did you see my mother?’</span> <span id="s2948">So, my mother said, “No, we were sitting here but we never saw her.”</span> <span id="s2949">That mother had left her there and had died.</span> <span id="s2950">The girls never knew it if, where, and how she died.</span> <span id="s2951">She went back but she never found her.</span> <span id="s2952">You see, everyplace is another place to us, where someone we knew died.</span> <span id="s2953">That was a heartache even though she had been a sick woman.</span> <span id="s2954">At the end, she was very sick.</span> <span id="s2955">That is how it went, but this is only the beginning.</span> <span id="s2956">That was only the beginning.</span> <span id="s2957">Before we settled anywhere by group of 18 or 20 people, there were also some smaller groups of eight or ten people.</span> <span id="s2958">Each group then settled in for the winter.</span> <span id="s2959">We knew winter was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: How did you break up into groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: For example, these two families were neighbors from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s2962">They knew each other.</span> <span id="s2963">They both had children.</span> <span id="s2964">One family had two grown up and two smaller children and the other family had a baby.</span> <span id="s2965">I believe that I told you that she nursed the baby.</span> <span id="s2966">She still nursed the baby in the forest.</span> <span id="s2967">She had the baby in 1941 just before the Germans came.</span> <span id="s2968">When we started in the forest, the baby was just a little over one year old and when we got out of the forest she was three years old.</span> <span id="s2969">These families lived together.</span> <span id="s2970">They knew each other.</span> <span id="s2971">They knew the woods.</span> <span id="s2972">These people lived from those villages.</span> <span id="s2973">They had been there all their lives.</span> <span id="s2974">They knew the places.</span> <span id="s2975">They took us in because they felt sorry for my mother.</span> <span id="s2976">They really didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s2977">Nobody really wanted a lady alone.</span> <span id="s2978">People tried to run away, you know one from another.</span> <span id="s2979">They felt that it was a bother.</span> <span id="s2980">Why should they take us in.</span> <span id="s2981">If something were to be wrong, they knew the forest better than we do.</span> <span id="s2982">They didn’t really want us but this lady who got killed with my mother, she told my mother, “Don’t move!</span> <span id="s2983">Just follow us.</span> <span id="s2984">If we got to a different place pack up whatever you have and come with us.</span> <span id="s2985">They will try to run and hide in order to lose you.</span> <span id="s2986">They want to leave you.”</span> <span id="s2987">They really didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s2988">She told us that because she felt sorry for my mother, what could we, two helpless women do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">Q: Was this more or less how each of the small groups was formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">A: Yes, neighbors or people who knew each other well.</span> <span id="s2991">Here my mother-in-law to be, Abe’s mother was by herself, with nobody just her three daughters.</span> <span id="s2992">She didn’t even have anything like a bunker.</span> <span id="s2993">Like we, she lived in a tent but what made it easier for her is that they were helped by the partisans who brought them food.</span> <span id="s2994">We had nobody, nobody brought us anything.</span> <span id="s2995">We had to do it ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Well the eighteen of you, first there were eighteen and then there were sixteen, you had to work out ways to get along with each other.</span> <span id="s2997">You just had to</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: There were ten days since we talked last and I have to remember what we were talking about.</span> <span id="s3000">But I have gotten some of the timing down last time of the period in the forest between February of 1943.</span> <span id="s3001">That must have been early in February?</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">A: Yes on the second or third.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: And April 29th was the second blockade.</span> <span id="s3004">The one where your mother got killed.</span> <span id="s3005">The third blockade was in September of 1943.</span> <span id="s3006">The last one was in July or August of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: That was just before the Germans retreated.</span> <span id="s3008">That never came to our area.</span> <span id="s3009">It was well to the east of our forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: Now, during this time, you told me on a previous tape how your brother went one way and you went another and how you got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: Yes, during the second night of the slaughter, we got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: He went on to Vilna right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: He was really in some area of the woods.</span> <span id="s3014">You couldn’t find anybody in the woods.</span> <span id="s3015">We met up with a lot of people who got out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3016">A few days later, we got together with them in the forest.</span> <span id="s3017">He didn’t meet anybody, so he went on and then we went all the way to another small town.</span> <span id="s3018">These people were still in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3019">Somehow they did not keep him there long.</span> <span id="s3020">The Judenrat told him that he was a newcomer to their ghetto and that he has to go to work, that they would send him someplace.</span> <span id="s3021">He didn’t want to go there, so they told him, the Jewish police did, if you don’t want to go there, you have to clear out</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Do you know the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: Swia.</span> <span id="s3024">That was approximately the same size of town as Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3025">From there, he went to Smogorn where we had a relative so that he will have someone to stay with.</span> <span id="s3026">He went to Smogorn.</span> <span id="s3027">I believe that I told you during our first session that we had a little boy without parents from a small village in Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3028">We kept this boy and he was one of the six people in our hiding place.</span> <span id="s3029">He left with my brother.</span> <span id="s3030">He was truly a little boy.</span> <span id="s3031">Much younger than my brother or me.</span> <span id="s3032">He went to the Postov ghetto.</span> <span id="s3033">(That was spelled by WS but there is no assurance that RF was listening) while my brother went to Smogorn.</span> <span id="s3034">He managed to get around with the help of farmers so they were able to get around.</span> <span id="s3035">From Smogorn, they took all the young boys, I don’t know up to what age, but when I met my brother later on he told me that they took them with a transport to a type of military barracks in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s3036">It was Rzaner camp.</span> <span id="s3037">From there, they selected some young boys to the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s3038">The Judenrat that selecting.</span> <span id="s3039">You see, the Judenrat did it all.</span> <span id="s3040">They asked for so many to be transferred every time and the Judenrat had to supply the numbers.</span> <span id="s3041">So they had to transfer the required number.</span> <span id="s3042">Then from Rzaner Camp, they transferred them to Vilna.</span> <span id="s3043">Rzaner Camp was a small place.</span> <span id="s3044">It was not far from Kolna (here the name of that camp is spelled by Abe Frydman and concurred by RF).</span> <span id="s3045">Then he was in Vilna for the rest of the time until he came out from the underground.</span> <span id="s3046">He was working in Vilna.</span> <span id="s3047">In a separate place, there were 70 boys and young men.</span> <span id="s3048">They lived together.</span> <span id="s3049">They went out to work in the morning, then they came back.</span> <span id="s3050">It was in Vilna ghetto but not really a part of Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s3051">When I was in the forest and I had already lost my mother, as a matter of fact, after the second blockade, something like the second or third of May 1943.</span> <span id="s3052">I had lost all of the belongings I had since they threw a grenade into our bunker.</span> <span id="s3053">So I went to look for the rest of the people who survived hoping that they may have had something of mine.</span> <span id="s3054">When I went back to the bunker to look for my jewelry, I saw the complete destruction and that everything was gone with the rafters and all the supports.</span> <span id="s3055">I noticed that someone had been there already.</span> <span id="s3056">Obviously looking for something.</span> <span id="s3057">We understood that the people who had lived in the bunker were now separated.</span> <span id="s3058">Everybody had run into a different direction.</span> <span id="s3059">As a matter of fact, I wondered whether the fellow who hid my jewelry for me, whatever small things I had left from my mother, maybe he had been there because the jewelry had been removed from the hiding place.</span> <span id="s3060">So I tried to look for him.</span> <span id="s3061">On the way to go to the place where he and his family were, their new camp, I had figured out approximately where it should be.</span> <span id="s3062">I met four young men laying on the side of Margi.</span> <span id="s3063">There was a call “Amho” which is the Hebrew for New Nation since “Am” means nation, so “Amho” meaning ”I am from the same nation.”</span> <span id="s3064">This was a call which we used to tell one another that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s3065">You can realize that I was scared since here were four men laying in hiding there.</span> <span id="s3066">So they said, “Amho” and they knew that I would understand.</span> <span id="s3067">I asked them who they were and from where they came.</span> <span id="s3068">They told me that they came from Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s3069">That they had just come from the ghetto and that they were looking for a man whose name is Makasky and that they wanted to talk to him.</span> <span id="s3070">This was one fellow who had connections with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3071">He was a messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">Q: Was he from Margi?</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">A: Yes, however he spent most of his time in the woods near us.</span> <span id="s3074">I had just met him because I had not known about him earlier.</span> <span id="s3075">He lived in the area where we had set up our new camp.</span> <span id="s3076">The one we set up after the second blockade.</span> <span id="s3077">I told “Okay, guys, I can take you to him.</span> <span id="s3078">I don’t know whether he is there right now but I will show you the place where he comes to.</span> <span id="s3079">You should stay there and he will find you.”</span> <span id="s3080">Then I asked them from where they come?</span> <span id="s3081">I knew that they were not natives from Vilna.</span> <span id="s3082">They told me that they truly are from a different place.</span> <span id="s3083">Not far away.</span> <span id="s3084">I knew the place which they mentioned.</span> <span id="s3085">It was also a small town.</span> <span id="s3086">Three of the boys were from Kadinik and one was from Swia.</span> <span id="s3087">That was the place that my brother went to first.</span> <span id="s3088">Then they asked me who I was.</span> <span id="s3089">Naturally I told them that I came from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3090">Then one of the guys said, “Just a minute!</span> <span id="s3091">I had someone whom I met in Vilna from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3092">A young man.”</span> <span id="s3093">I said.</span> <span id="s3094">“Who could it be?”</span> <span id="s3095">From our little hometown to Vilna was quite a way and I would know any young man from my hometown.</span> <span id="s3096">Somebody about my age and Jewish.</span> <span id="s3097">He couldn’t remember the fellow’s name since he had just met him briefly.</span> <span id="s3098">So I asked him about the various names of young men I could think of who it could have been but who were not it.</span> <span id="s3099">Then all of a sudden, while we were going back toward my camp in preparation for bringing them to Makuskys, he said, “You know what.</span> <span id="s3100">There was something about that young man.</span> <span id="s3101">He told me that he had escaped with his mother and his sister from the hiding place which he had constructed.</span> <span id="s3102">He thinks that they were killed because he heard the shots.”</span> <span id="s3103">So I was stunned!!</span> <span id="s3104">I couldn’t believe it!!</span> <span id="s3105">I was shaking!!</span> <span id="s3106">I still believed that maybe my brother was alive someplace.</span> <span id="s3107">So I asked, is his name Maja?</span> <span id="s3108">So he said yes and he told me right away the family name.</span> <span id="s3109">Yes, that is the nickname for Michael or Moses.</span> <span id="s3110">As a matter of fact, he told me that he got sick in that camp.</span> <span id="s3111">He got typhus.</span> <span id="s3112">Usually, if someone has something like this which is highly contagious, they take him out of the camp and the people get destroyed.</span> <span id="s3113">That means they kill them or they send them to a death camp.</span> <span id="s3114">Him, they sent to a hospital.</span> <span id="s3115">When, maybe a year later, I met my brother he told me the same thing.</span> <span id="s3116">My brother told me about him being in the hospital at the time when my mother was killed.</span> <span id="s3117">That he was so sick and that he felt lonely there and that he cried so much, he had thought, if I could only see my mother or someone of my family due to the loneliness.</span> <span id="s3118">That was the same time when my mother was killed.</span> <span id="s3119">That fellow told me about my brother’s hospitalization, so I had some hope again that my brother was alive and in Vilna.</span> <span id="s3120">Now, I wondered how I could get word to him that I am alive.</span> <span id="s3121">There just was no way!</span> <span id="s3122">Nobody goes back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3123">Anyways, it was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s3124">Maybe just something which was supposed to happen.</span> <span id="s3125">One of those guys, after a long time before the third blockade, before September had a sister left in Vilna.</span> <span id="s3126">So he went back.</span> <span id="s3127">He was already with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3128">He was given a mission as he told them that he wanted to bring out more young men from Vilna.</span> <span id="s3129">He went on his own, by himself after he received permission.</span> <span id="s3130">He went to Vilna to bring his sister out.</span> <span id="s3131">He knew that we can survive in the woods.</span> <span id="s3132">That there is more hope to survive there than in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3133">So, he went back.</span> <span id="s3134">While he was in the ghetto he just happened to meet my brother at a time when my brother came back from work.</span> <span id="s3135">He told him, “Oh, wait a minute!</span> <span id="s3136">I have regards for you from someone but hold on and listen.”</span> <span id="s3137">My brother asked, “Where were you?</span> <span id="s3138">How come you are here to give me these regards?”</span> <span id="s3139">he said, “I am back from the woods and I came to pick up my sister, to take her with me.</span> <span id="s3140">Many people live in the woods.</span> <span id="s3141">We set up camps.</span> <span id="s3142">I have an announcement from your sister.”</span> <span id="s3143">So, my brother was astonished.</span> <span id="s3144">My brother had, of course, asked where his mother was?</span> <span id="s3145">So the fellow told him, “Your mother was caught while she went begging and she is dead.</span> <span id="s3146">But, listen to the advice from your sister, she is a young girl and came out.”</span> <span id="s3147">He told him approximately how I looked.</span> <span id="s3148">My brother was, of course, overwhelmed, and of course, he was very happy.</span> <span id="s3149">Then he told himself that he had to get out.</span> <span id="s3150">They had set up a committee in Vilna that all the young people who were willing and able to buy weapons, you had to give money to the committee, then the committee bought weapons and each time they sent men out.</span> <span id="s3151">That means small groups.</span> <span id="s3152">So my brother went after he found out where it was.</span> <span id="s3153">Then he gave them whatever he had saved up from the proceed of whatever he brought in, potatoes, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3154">He had accumulated a little money.</span> <span id="s3155">He gave them all he had so that he was in line to be sent out of the woods.</span> <span id="s3156">Of course, since he had somebody to go to and he wanted to go out, he was in consideration.</span> <span id="s3157">Still he was told we will let you know.</span> <span id="s3158">He used to come back and ask when and where?</span> <span id="s3159">But he got no answer.</span> <span id="s3160">Once he came there and there was nobody in the offices.</span> <span id="s3161">They were all gone, as if the committee had disbanded.</span> <span id="s3162">However, by then he so much wanted to get out of Vilna ghetto, so he met a guy who also for money took people out from the underground in a different way.</span> <span id="s3163">He met Halevy Aneton (the spelling here is questionable), a childless family, just a husband and wife from our hometown.</span> <span id="s3164">My brother told them what he had in mind, so they decided to go out together, all of them.</span> <span id="s3165">That they would not remain in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3166">The woman took my brother, she took a niece and another girl who was homeless and not of her family.</span> <span id="s3167">I believe that there were six of them.</span> <span id="s3168">Yes, she also took a brother-in-law, that made it a group of six.</span> <span id="s3169">First, they felt that they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s3170">So he took them out underground through the sewer.</span> <span id="s3171">Their routing was from the sewer to a cinema.</span> <span id="s3172">That night, when the people left the movie, they went out with the people.</span> <span id="s3173">My brother told me later, when we came to visit me here, that a lady saw people coming out of the sewer.</span> <span id="s3174">She got so scared that she crossed herself and said, “Oh Jesus Christ, oh Lord!!</span> <span id="s3175">What is going on here?”</span> <span id="s3176">She got so scared that she ran away.</span> <span id="s3177">She had never seen anything like this.</span> <span id="s3178">People coming out of the sewer!</span> <span id="s3179">That is how they went out of the ghetto and then into the woods.</span> <span id="s3180">When they came out, as a matter of fact, the guy who brought my brother my regards, he brought his sister out just in time to have her killed in the third blockade.</span> <span id="s3181">So they just came out in time for the third blockade.</span> <span id="s3182">These newcomers hadn’t yet learned where to go to escape.</span> <span id="s3183">Meanwhile, while my brother was attempting to go out, I was already in a different place.</span> <span id="s3184">In a different camp with different circumstances.</span> <span id="s3185">I went to visit a friend of mine who was working for a special group of partisans.</span> <span id="s3186">When I was at my friends, they asked me to work for them also, to help them in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3187">They set up a beautiful camp in a village.</span> <span id="s3188">A partisan camp.</span> <span id="s3189">I really didn’t want to do it because I wanted to get back to my place.</span> <span id="s3190">I really had only come to see my friend.</span> <span id="s3191">To visit her.</span> <span id="s3192">Anyways, I promised them that I would stay a day or two, however they noticed that I was a pretty good cook.</span> <span id="s3193">And they asked me to stay another day and I couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s3194">So I worked another day and then we transferred this partisan camp from the village of Misuni to the village of Niver.</span> <span id="s3195">Over in Niver, we set up camp.</span> <span id="s3196">So I told them that I would just stay a few days with them and that then I would go back.</span> <span id="s3197">That I was not about to go with them wherever they go.</span> <span id="s3198">Unfortunately, the blockade happened then, the September blockade.</span> <span id="s3199">At the time of the blockade one guy, he was an older man told me, “You better stay with us because there is no other way in which you can be saved.”</span> <span id="s3200">.</span> <span id="s3201">You know the rest of the people in their camps were surprised.</span> <span id="s3202">We had to leave that place and the Germans pursued us.</span> <span id="s3203">We traveled only by night.</span> <span id="s3204">During the days, we stayed in the woods.</span> <span id="s3205">Every night for one week or ten days we moved.</span> <span id="s3206">We stayed in one place during the day and that night we went to a different place.</span> <span id="s3207">Possibly in a completely different area.</span> <span id="s3208">The Germans went to every village.</span> <span id="s3209">Wherever we had stopped the Germans came.</span> <span id="s3210">We could only see the fires from the villages at night.</span> <span id="s3211">That is how far away we stayed.</span> <span id="s3212">At that time, things were really bad.</span> <span id="s3213">I happened to be at a different place altogether with the partisans, working still in the kitchen for them.</span> <span id="s3214">That happened to be already the Katania forest.</span> <span id="s3215">It was an entirely different forest than the one where we had started out.</span> <span id="s3216">This was more in the area of White Russia.</span> <span id="s3217">More to the north.</span> <span id="s3218">That was a huge forest.</span> <span id="s3219">A lot of Jewish people from different places lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: So it was still White Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3222">In the same White Russia.</span> <span id="s3223">There we set up camp and I met a lot of young men from the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s3224">You could notice them because, first of all, they were dressed differently from the way we were.</span> <span id="s3225">They were dressed nicely.</span> <span id="s3226">They were all young.</span> <span id="s3227">All had weapons, beautiful weapons.</span> <span id="s3228">A whole group of them.</span> <span id="s3229">One guy, who was with them was from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3230">He was my age otherwise said, a very young man.</span> <span id="s3231">So I was with the partisans with my girlfriend from Kurzeniez, that was the one because of whom I stayed with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3232">I told her that we should talk to the medical men.</span> <span id="s3233">We called them our “Komandier” from the “Special Group.”</span> <span id="s3234">This special group was sent to us from Russia.</span> <span id="s3235">It was not the kind of self help group from the partisans who had gathered all their people from the White Russians or was from the escaped prisoners; these were people sent from the Russian army who made up the “special group.”</span> <span id="s3236">They had been sent to take care of something special.</span> <span id="s3237">So we went to talk to them.</span> <span id="s3238">We told them that here is a group of approximately thirty-five young men with weapons just fresh from the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s3239">They have no idea about the partisans, they have nowhere to turn and nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s3240">We would like for you to take care of them.</span> <span id="s3241">You could maybe take them to our group in one group.</span> <span id="s3242">They are willing to learn whatever has t be done later on.</span> <span id="s3243">Our men told us, “Take me to their men in command of that group so that I can tell them that they should give all their weapons to our group so that we together can proceed.</span> <span id="s3244">Then, later on, they will learn all the ways to go about fighting the Germans and all the other ways of the partisans.”</span> <span id="s3245">However, their men in command did not like that setup.</span> <span id="s3246">They did not want to give their weapons away.</span> <span id="s3247">The weapons were too dear to them.</span> <span id="s3248">They had personally paid too high a price for them.</span> <span id="s3249">They had exchanged a lot of money and a lot of lives for it.</span> <span id="s3250">They were afraid of being cheated.</span> <span id="s3251">So they said no and so they left.</span> <span id="s3252">We couldn’t stay long wherever we set up camp because the Germans were after us anyhow.</span> <span id="s3253">No matter where we went they came.</span> <span id="s3254">They just executed sweeps.</span> <span id="s3255">A day or two later we heard that this group from Vilna were all massacred.</span> <span id="s3256">They just plainly had gone in a wrong direction.</span> <span id="s3257">You see, in our group, we had men who went ahead of us.</span> <span id="s3258">No matter where we were going to see where the Germans are.</span> <span id="s3259">They called them “trasvekfa,” they were horses.</span> <span id="s3260">They just scouted around.</span> <span id="s3261">If the Germans were to the west, we went to the east.</span> <span id="s3262">They also checked all the villages.</span> <span id="s3263">These Jewish boys didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s3264">They didn’t know where to turn to.</span> <span id="s3265">Then after that slaughter, we went to a different place altogether.</span> <span id="s3266">A lot of people were killed during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">Q: Your brother was still in Vilna at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">A: No.</span> <span id="s3269">My brother was out of Vilna by then but he was in a different place altogether.</span> <span id="s3270">He was not yet in the forest.</span> <span id="s3271">He was on his way from Vilna to the forest.</span> <span id="s3272">This traveling took them quite a few days.</span> <span id="s3273">It wasn’t so easy to travel.</span> <span id="s3274">They had to walk at night when the coast was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">Q: That was in September ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: Yes, middle of September ’43.</span> <span id="s3277">When I met another group, a smaller group also out of Vilna they were already in a different village.</span> <span id="s3278">I used to ask each group whether maybe they knew about a Maja Avarowicz?</span> <span id="s3279">I mean these groups who came from Vilna.</span> <span id="s3280">But nobody knew anything about him, so once, one young man told me, “Don’t wait for him.”</span> <span id="s3281">He told me the group of the seventy young men was sent to Riga.</span> <span id="s3282">To be sent to Riga meant to be sent to the death camp, that is the end.</span> <span id="s3283">Riga was the end, so I lost hope.</span> <span id="s3284">This meant that my brother would never come.</span> <span id="s3285">We already knew all about Riga.</span> <span id="s3286">That was from the Vilna boys, the young men who came they told us about Riga.</span> <span id="s3287">That camp was the final trip.</span> <span id="s3288">All the authorities in Vilna sent people to Panar or to Riga for extermination.</span> <span id="s3289">(the camp at Panar is a new one to the transcriber).</span> <span id="s3290">From Vilna my uncle and his sons went to Riga.</span> <span id="s3291">My aunt went to Panar.</span> <span id="s3292">All those who they could not get rid of in Panar they sent to Riga.</span> <span id="s3293">Sometimes later, when I met my brother and when I told him that I heard that he was sent to Riga he said, “Yes, the whole group went to Riga.</span> <span id="s3294">Only I survived by hiding under straw bags.”</span> <span id="s3295">They had straw bags instead of mattresses and he hid under them.</span> <span id="s3296">He came out and all of a sudden he was on the trucks to be loaded.</span> <span id="s3297">They didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s3298">It was as if they were going to work but he heard somebody saying “This time they are not going to work, they are going to Riga.”</span> <span id="s3299">All the Vilna people knew what Riga meant.</span> <span id="s3300">That it was the end!</span> <span id="s3301">So somehow he noticed that no one paid attention to him so he went back into the place where they slept He went under the bags and stayed there hiding the entire day until night.</span> <span id="s3302">They locked the doors because all seventy people from this barracks went.</span> <span id="s3303">So actually they did not ship seventy but sixty-nine because he was the seventieth.</span> <span id="s3304">He stayed until night and then at night we went out through a back door.</span> <span id="s3305">As things were from this place, their barracks, the back door went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3306">He went out the other side, climbed up the roof and out of the ghetto to a doctor’s house.</span> <span id="s3307">You see, the Vilna ghetto was arranged by yards.</span> <span id="s3308">In one yard there were three or four buildings (probably meaning barracks).</span> <span id="s3309">One building may be into the ghetto, the other building may lead out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3310">That doctor kept my brother until the next day and then he brought him back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3311">My brother asked for that since there was nothing he could do outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3312">So, he went back to the ghetto and that was how he survived.</span> <span id="s3313">He went back to the Jewish people in the ghetto where he had an uncle.</span> <span id="s3314">So that young man who had told me about the entire group going to Riga, told me the truth but by a miracle, because that was what was meant to happen, he escaped.</span> <span id="s3315">So he got saved in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">Q: Was that your father’s brother who was in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">A: No, that was my mother’s uncle.</span> <span id="s3318">That was my grandfather’s brother.</span> <span id="s3319">My grand uncle with his three sons.</span> <span id="s3320">I had by then already lost hope.</span> <span id="s3321">Since they told me that they all went to Riga, that was it!</span> <span id="s3322">I never heard anymore.</span> <span id="s3323">By that time, my group for whom I worked had moved around so much that we really did not know where we were.</span> <span id="s3324">The partisan group received orders from way deep in Russia to return.</span> <span id="s3325">When they received that order the one in charge told me and another Jewish fellow with his wife and son that they are not supposed to take us or the few White Russian men whom they had recruited back to Russia.</span> <span id="s3326">That they are supposed to leave us.</span> <span id="s3327">So I started to cry and I begged them “To take me wherever you go,” but now I don’t even know where I am and how will I ever get back to my people, to my camp, to my friends.</span> <span id="s3328">I begged him to take me along.</span> <span id="s3329">One young man was really very nice to me.</span> <span id="s3330">But he said that he just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s3331">That this was an order and that they could do nothing but obey.</span> <span id="s3332">He said, “This is a military order we can’t take you.</span> <span id="s3333">We now have to get back to Russia.”</span> <span id="s3334">He told me that although he was not supposed to say it.</span> <span id="s3335">“We can’t.</span> <span id="s3336">We have received the order not to take you.</span> <span id="s3337">No foreigners at all.”</span> <span id="s3338">So he said, “Do you want to stay with this couple and their son?”</span> <span id="s3339">The son was much younger than I was.</span> <span id="s3340">I was then 15.</span> <span id="s3341">He added, “I can’t take you, the only thing you can do is to follow him and to stay with them.”</span> <span id="s3342">Well, we had no choice there.</span> <span id="s3343">My friend, the girl who I came to visit, and because of whom I stayed there, she went with them because she had worked for them earlier than I had.</span> <span id="s3344">She had nobody of her family.</span> <span id="s3345">I told them that I had no place to go to.</span> <span id="s3346">They still didn’t take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">A: She was Jewish and from my same hometown.</span> <span id="s3349">It was true that she had worked for them for a very long time.</span> <span id="s3350">She worked with them ever since they came to our woods to set up camp.</span> <span id="s3351">In the beginning I was just visiting and I told them that I don’t want to join the partisan group.</span> <span id="s3352">I just wanted to stay there and help them out until I could get back to my people.</span> <span id="s3353">Unfortunately then the blockade incident happened.</span> <span id="s3354">When I went back with that fellow, his wife and his young son, we went through hell.</span> <span id="s3355">He didn’t know the way.</span> <span id="s3356">He didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s3357">After all, we were all together in a different place.</span> <span id="s3358">Far away from our home forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">Q: Almost as far as to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">A: No, not to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">Q: Well, how far to the north, east from Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">A: Right!</span> <span id="s3363">When we went back we had to go through all the forests and all kinds of places not suitable for human beings to go through.</span> <span id="s3364">We were halfway immersed in water.</span> <span id="s3365">I had been in the woods for a year by then and I had never gone through such hardship.</span> <span id="s3366">It was so hard to walk.</span> <span id="s3367">The fellow with his wife, son and I, probably had a good idea but he didn’t know exactly where we were.</span> <span id="s3368">He didn’t know everything about the forest and the swamps.</span> <span id="s3369">We went one day, it was actually already evening, out looking -- I myself was the first one -- where we are.</span> <span id="s3370">There was one house surrounded by a courtyard, no vegetation close by.</span> <span id="s3371">I crawled to that house because obviously we couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s3372">I crawled there and I heard them speaking German.</span> <span id="s3373">So it was kind of a garrison of Germans.</span> <span id="s3374">I then went back and I told the other three that we are at the wrong place.</span> <span id="s3375">Because of that garrison we went deeper into the forest and on the opposite side when we came out there was a village.</span> <span id="s3376">When we got out to the village, it was already pitch black.</span> <span id="s3377">It was the night.</span> <span id="s3378">We couldn’t find anybody to talk to.</span> <span id="s3379">So we stayed another night in that forest.</span> <span id="s3380">It was already chilly.</span> <span id="s3381">He said, “ Whatever will happen will happen.</span> <span id="s3382">We just have to get out of this place!”</span> <span id="s3383">We had no food since we were afraid to go to the village since on the other side was the house where I had heard the German speaking people.</span> <span id="s3384">We were so afraid that after we slept that night, we went the whole day in that forest and when we came out we had to go to the other side by the railroad.</span> <span id="s3385">We went over the railroad right of way.</span> <span id="s3386">When we went through that right of way, we came to a place which that fellow recognized.</span> <span id="s3387">Then he said, “Now, I know where we are!</span> <span id="s3388">Now I am not lost.”</span> <span id="s3389">Then we went a whole day, we just walked around villages.</span> <span id="s3390">We were afraid to go into them because the Germans were all around.</span> <span id="s3391">When he said that he knew where we were we followed him.</span> <span id="s3392">I didn’t know where we were so I just followed him.</span> <span id="s3393">He brought us, it was the holy day of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s3394">He didn’t ask any questions.</span> <span id="s3395">We went to a place and stayed there all day in the barn.</span> <span id="s3396">The fellow who owned the barn came out and the father told him, “We are here, we are four people.</span> <span id="s3397">We don’t eat for a whole day and after that day we will be hungry.”</span> <span id="s3398">We knew that this was a day of fast.</span> <span id="s3399">So the owner came back at night and he brought us bread and sour milk and a cheese.</span> <span id="s3400">So we ate and the moon was shining like in the middle of the lunar month.</span> <span id="s3401">It was already October, of course.</span> <span id="s3402">At that place he gave me a list of villages.</span> <span id="s3403">I will never forget that list as long as I live and he told me that he would not take me any further.</span> <span id="s3404">He told me that I would have to go back to my old place all by myself because he is going to the next village from there to his friend, a gentile friend.</span> <span id="s3405">.</span> <span id="s3406">This friend will keep him, his wife and his son until everything quiets down.</span> <span id="s3407">However he is not going to ask his friend to put me up also.</span> <span id="s3408">After saying that, he left me, after he lead me out of the village where we slept and eaten.</span> <span id="s3409">He had made up this long list of the villages through which I would have to go, to get back to the woods near Margi.</span> <span id="s3410">One of these places, it was not really a village, it was a small town, there I would have to meet somebody.</span> <span id="s3411">This somebody would give me the rest of the directions.</span> <span id="s3412">Maybe this fellow will keep me for a few days while he gives me the directions about where I am to walk.</span> <span id="s3413">This fellow is a friend.</span> <span id="s3414">It was Saturday night and I came away from that place and I stood at a four way street sign.</span> <span id="s3415">The moon was shining very brightly.</span> <span id="s3416">So I started walking all by myself in the night.</span> <span id="s3417">I had two cords with me, a longer one and a shorter one.</span> <span id="s3418">I did not want to throw them away since I felt that I might need them.</span> <span id="s3419">I was hot.</span> <span id="s3420">I walked and walked.</span> <span id="s3421">When I came to a house, I heard some noise.</span> <span id="s3422">I didn’t knock but I went to the place where the noise came from.</span> <span id="s3423">I couldn’t figure what was making the noise.</span> <span id="s3424">To myself, as young as I was, I was going to be sixteen the following year, I thought that maybe they are doing something like playing cards.</span> <span id="s3425">I heard a lot of noise and I got so scared that I started running.</span> <span id="s3426">I ran back to the major road.</span> <span id="s3427">Then I went maybe half mile and I thought where am I going?</span> <span id="s3428">How do I know that I am going in the right direction?</span> <span id="s3429">I don’t know this area.</span> <span id="s3430">The place where the noise came from was not a village.</span> <span id="s3431">It was a house.</span> <span id="s3432">So I went back and I knocked at that door.</span> <span id="s3433">After he opened, he went backwards and said, “Who the hell are you knocking at my door at this time of night?”</span> <span id="s3434">I again was scared.</span> <span id="s3435">Nobody let me in.</span> <span id="s3436">Then I thought to myself and I really cried, it was already late in the night, probably nine PM on a winter night.</span> <span id="s3437">It was very cold but I had been walking for a long time so I said to myself the hell with all of that.</span> <span id="s3438">What am I waiting for?</span> <span id="s3439">For whom?</span> <span id="s3440">For what?</span> <span id="s3441">I don’t care anymore!</span> <span id="s3442">The only thing was that I didn’t want to be caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s3443">Whatever will happen will happen!</span> <span id="s3444">I had previously told you that the people had baths outside the villages where they went to bathe once a week.</span> <span id="s3445">Usually on Saturday night.</span> <span id="s3446">I noticed that it was something like this, a little building in the middle of the field.</span> <span id="s3447">What can happen.</span> <span id="s3448">I will go there, I will see.</span> <span id="s3449">If it was that and was in use, it would be warm inside and I could sleep there.</span> <span id="s3450">I had slept in such saunas many times before.</span> <span id="s3451">That’s a Saturday night special as we called it because we knew already.</span> <span id="s3452">So I went close to it and I heard people talking.</span> <span id="s3453">I said there are people in there.</span> <span id="s3454">By that time I no longer cared.</span> <span id="s3455">I decided whatever will happen will happen.</span> <span id="s3456">What can it be?</span> <span id="s3457">they will sell me some soap.</span> <span id="s3458">Okay, let them sell me!</span> <span id="s3459">Then I came into that place.</span> <span id="s3460">There were a few women there since in the saunas , first the men take their baths in it then it is the turn of the women who take care of the rest.</span> <span id="s3461">I came into the courtyard of that place and one lady, a very old lady came out.</span> <span id="s3462">She said to me, “Daughter of mine,” That is a common expression, “Who are you, where are you going, what are you doing out so late at night?”</span> <span id="s3463">I told her quite frankly I am a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s3464">I didn’t tell her until later how that man had kicked me out.</span> <span id="s3465">By the way that man is living in Israel with his wife and his son.</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">(END SIDE SIX –BEGIN SIDE SEVEN.)</span> <span id="s3467">I didn’t tell her how they left me and everything.</span> <span id="s3468">I just told her that I got lost from the partisans and that I didn’t know where I should go or where I am.</span> <span id="s3469">If you would please let me stay here overnight.</span> <span id="s3470">So she said to me, “Listen, child, take off your clothes and take a bath.</span> <span id="s3471">Make yourself comfortable.</span> <span id="s3472">Make yourself clean.</span> <span id="s3473">It is nice here and later on we will see.</span> <span id="s3474">I have to talk about this with my daughter and daughter-in-law.”</span> <span id="s3475">A child was also in the sauna at that time.</span> <span id="s3476">She did that and then she came out back to me.</span> <span id="s3477">Of course.</span> <span id="s3478">I don’t know what they talked about.</span> <span id="s3479">I was sitting in that sauna.</span> <span id="s3480">It was so warm and comfortable.</span> <span id="s3481">I had a very good feeling inside, to the point where I really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s3482">She told me, “Listen, I can’t take you to my daughter and daughter-in-law since I never know what my son will say.</span> <span id="s3483">You have to understand us also.</span> <span id="s3484">However you come with me.”</span> <span id="s3485">Then she took me around after she had helped me to bathe and helped me to dress.</span> <span id="s3486">She never even asked me whether I was hungry or not?</span> <span id="s3487">She took me to her home.</span> <span id="s3488">Then she asked me whether I wanted to eat and I told her that I would like to eat something.</span> <span id="s3489">Just a little bit because it is late at night.</span> <span id="s3490">However I told her that I want to sleep because I am very very tired.</span> <span id="s3491">She put me on the couch to sleep.</span> <span id="s3492">I told her that I couldn’t sleep the whole night, even though I was so tired.</span> <span id="s3493">I thought what will she do tomorrow?</span> <span id="s3494">Will she really sell me?</span> <span id="s3495">That is how much my mind was wandering.</span> <span id="s3496">I was worried that she would sell me for a little bit of salt.</span> <span id="s3497">That is how the Germans bought Jews.</span> <span id="s3498">They gave the people who turned Jews in some salt.</span> <span id="s3499">Salt was scarce.</span> <span id="s3500">That was a precious item.</span> <span id="s3501">In the morning she saw that I was not asleep.</span> <span id="s3502">She was probably up early because I guess she was Catholic because she had Mary and Christ in her house whereas the Protestants just had Jesus.</span> <span id="s3503">These home shrines were beautifully decorated.</span> <span id="s3504">It was embroidered in green and amber.</span> <span id="s3505">Most of the gentile peoples had home shrines, at least in our area.</span> <span id="s3506">She stood by that home shrine and she prayed.</span> <span id="s3507">I already heard the bells from the church, then I got so scared.</span> <span id="s3508">I was more scared than, than at any other time in my life with the Germans and with anything else.</span> <span id="s3509">I don’t really know why I was so scared but it was as if I had a feeling or something.</span> <span id="s3510">I saw her praying then she looked at me and said, “Daughter of mine.</span> <span id="s3511">Oh you are not asleep?</span> <span id="s3512">Do you want to come down?”</span> <span id="s3513">I said I sure will.</span> <span id="s3514">She said here is breakfast.</span> <span id="s3515">It is ready.</span> <span id="s3516">She had a breakfast such as I hadn’t seen in a long time.</span> <span id="s3517">She had everything on the table.</span> <span id="s3518">I ate.</span> <span id="s3519">I was still waiting as to what she would say and what she would do with me.</span> <span id="s3520">Then she said, ‘Listen, I can’t keep you.</span> <span id="s3521">There just is no way!</span> <span id="s3522">I am afraid of the neighbors and I am afraid of the people here.”</span> <span id="s3523">She did not truly live in a village.</span> <span id="s3524">That village was just one street and she lived to the side of that street.</span> <span id="s3525">She gave me some food to take along and she told me, “Today is Sunday, you will see people in the street through which you will have to walk.</span> <span id="s3526">These people will look at you and the way you are dressed and they will look again at you and they might even ask questions.</span> <span id="s3527">Don’t answer anybody.</span> <span id="s3528">Don’t talk to anybody but especially don’t walk at night, because if you do, our people will kill you.</span> <span id="s3529">People in our days don’t know who is walking and who is who.</span> <span id="s3530">So just walk in the daytime.”</span> <span id="s3531">So I knew which village I had to go by.</span> <span id="s3532">I showed her the list which I had in my pocket.</span> <span id="s3533">I went through four villages that day.</span> <span id="s3534">By evening, I got to the small town of Bokolat (no spelling was supplied here).</span> <span id="s3535">In Bokolat I found the fellow who was supposed to show me again how to go further and tell me what to do next.</span> <span id="s3536">I found the house and I went in.</span> <span id="s3537">He wasn’t there then but he came later.</span> <span id="s3538">He told me that I had made a big mistake by walking so early in the evening.</span> <span id="s3539">It was not dark yet.</span> <span id="s3540">That was the case because Bokolat was a small town which had police agents and even a few Germans.</span> <span id="s3541">It was very dangerous for me to do that.</span> <span id="s3542">I told him that I had not known that and that the lady had told me to walk during the day and not at night.</span> <span id="s3543">I truly didn’t know whom to listen to.</span> <span id="s3544">Anyways he kept me overnight.</span> <span id="s3545">The next day I went out.</span> <span id="s3546">He told me that I was lucky because the Germans took all the young men to camp to Germany.</span> <span id="s3547">That was not talking about Jews now.</span> <span id="s3548">The Germans went with them so the two policemen were in the police station since that was probably all they had in that small town.</span> <span id="s3549">So no one looked at anybody and no one cared who was walking and who was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: The gentile young men had been taken to a camp in Germany?</span> <span id="s3551">To factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">A: Yes, to the German camps.</span> <span id="s3553">To work!</span> <span id="s3554">Yes, an entire transport (during WWII the Germans transported to Germany train loads of citizens from various countries which they had overrun to work as slave laborers in factories, etc.</span> <span id="s3555">IG Farben, Krupp and the other industrial plants have been forced, by international courts to reimburse these slave workers or after their death, the countries.</span> <span id="s3556">They went by entire transports of cattle cars).</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">Q: They did that in 1943?</span> <span id="s3558">(That was actually done from 1941 through 1944 and the allies did liberate dozens of DP (Displaced Person) camps all over Germany and Austria).</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">A: Yes, in October at the time of the blockade.</span> <span id="s3560">The next day I walked a lot.</span> <span id="s3561">It was already Monday morning when I left this fellow’s house.</span> <span id="s3562">I walked through a lot of other villages.</span> <span id="s3563">There I met already a few partisans.</span> <span id="s3564">They were also looking what was going on and where the Germans were, what area is clear of Germans and in what forests it was safe to return?</span> <span id="s3565">Anyhow, I walked for five days until I got back to the place from where I had started.</span> <span id="s3566">I went especially to that place to see where my girlfriends were.</span> <span id="s3567">When I got back to that place, I found that the blockade went by and that just a few of our people were missing.</span> <span id="s3568">I found that my clothes had been sold.</span> <span id="s3569">They sold whatever I had had for a few potatoes or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">Q: They didn’t think that you were coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">A: That is right!</span> <span id="s3572">They no longer knew anything about me.</span> <span id="s3573">I went back to my old place but I didn’t stay there very long.</span> <span id="s3574">Then I went back to my old friends from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s3575">Back to that very place not far from Margi.</span> <span id="s3576">However, from Margi we had gone to Nergia (the transcriber does not recall reference to this village).</span> <span id="s3577">They were sleeping in bales of hay.</span> <span id="s3578">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s3579">No people, just bales of hay.</span> <span id="s3580">It was like a little barn just filled with bales of hay.</span> <span id="s3581">Nothing else, no people.</span> <span id="s3582">We stayed in those barns on top of the hay.</span> <span id="s3583">We slept there.</span> <span id="s3584">When I arrived there a young man came and told me that he saw my brother during the blockade.</span> <span id="s3585">My brother came into the woods while I was out with the partisans and he was looking for me all over.</span> <span id="s3586">They told him that I was somewhere in a different place with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3587">I said how can that be?</span> <span id="s3588">I was told him that my brother went to Riga.</span> <span id="s3589">How could that be my brother?</span> <span id="s3590">I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3591">So I asked a girlfriend of mine, that was this young man’s girlfriend, to ask this man if he is just joking or did he really mean it.</span> <span id="s3592">The man said, “Well, I myself met him and I told him that you went away with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3593">That you were no longer with these people.”</span> <span id="s3594">It took me probably five or six weeks because by then it was probably already November to look for my brother by myself.</span> <span id="s3595">I got to so many places and I went through so much.</span> <span id="s3596">I looked everywhere and at everybody.</span> <span id="s3597">That everybody looked at me.</span> <span id="s3598">They said, “How could you go by yourself into so many woods and so many forests to look for a brother when you don’t know where he is?”</span> <span id="s3599">I was supposed to look for the people he went out with.</span> <span id="s3600">These people now live in Ohio and they are truly close friends now.</span> <span id="s3601">I found them.</span> <span id="s3602">I stayed with them for a whole week in the camp where they stayed.</span> <span id="s3603">They told me that my brother was looking for me.</span> <span id="s3604">That he couldn’t find me.</span> <span id="s3605">Then he joined up with a group of partisans.</span> <span id="s3606">So my brother went with the partisans.</span> <span id="s3607">They added someday he will come back into this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s3608">Then you will meet him.</span> <span id="s3609">Stay here.</span> <span id="s3610">However, I chose not to stay with them because I wanted to go to some other people and to look some more.</span> <span id="s3611">I thought that maybe he was already there.</span> <span id="s3612">I again went through so much hardship.</span> <span id="s3613">I had to sleep nights in different places.</span> <span id="s3614">As a matter of fact, I met Abe’s mother at that time with his sisters in a village.</span> <span id="s3615">I was waiting for someone to take me to the place where my brother was supposed to come back to, to which his group of partisans was supposed to come back to.</span> <span id="s3616">When I came here a friend of my family from Kurzeniez, the girl was a friend of mine from school, was there.</span> <span id="s3617">I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s3618">A few days later my brother came.</span> <span id="s3619">Then we finally met again.</span> <span id="s3620">I took him with me to where my other people were, not far away from Naorun (This place was mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s3621">It is spelled as phonetically as possible).</span> <span id="s3622">It was a different place.</span> <span id="s3623">We remained together until we went back during the spring of 1944.</span> <span id="s3624">During that spring we went to a different place and a different group took my brother in with them.</span> <span id="s3625">so he was with the partisans and I was in camp with the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">Q: At least you each knew where the other was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3627">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s3628">I went always to see him and he supplied me with food.</span> <span id="s3629">I didn’t have to beg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3630">Q: What sort of partisans were those he was with?</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">A: He was with a special group.</span> <span id="s3632">Under a Soviet officer who was also sent from Moscow.</span> <span id="s3633">They had orders from Moscow.</span> <span id="s3634">They had nothing to do with the partisans who were already established.</span> <span id="s3635">They had a lot of partisans there by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">Q: The group cooperated with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">A: Yes, but they each had different missions.</span> <span id="s3638">You see, the partisans had groups which had names.</span> <span id="s3639">The entire group got a name.</span> <span id="s3640">Each group had several commanders.</span> <span id="s3641">Then there were main officers who transmitted to them a mission for the day.</span> <span id="s3642">Then the groups were sent out to different areas and were given specific jobs.</span> <span id="s3643">Each group was assigned a different area where to fight.</span> <span id="s3644">Mainly what they did was to cut off the railroads to keep the trains from traveling.</span> <span id="s3645">Or else they would go into a small town and place some dynamite or bombs under something specific in order to do harm (and force German troops to guard the area behind the lines).</span> <span id="s3646">.</span> <span id="s3647">They were given specific jobs to do to sabotage.</span> <span id="s3648">We were there until we already heard about the German reversals to the east of us.</span> <span id="s3649">We were there until July or August 1944 when the Russians liberated us.</span> <span id="s3650">We went out of the woods in August 1944 and my brother went with his partisan group.</span> <span id="s3651">That group went back to Russia.</span> <span id="s3652">My brother first went to Kurzeniez and they took him in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">Q: The Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3655">I stayed in Kurzeniez and I went to school after I came back.</span> <span id="s3656">The entire period after the September blockade until July we were already prepared.</span> <span id="s3657">As a matter of fact we built an underground shelter near a small river in the woods as a hiding place so that we would have some place to go in case something happened.</span> <span id="s3658">We saved bread.</span> <span id="s3659">We dried some food including vegetables.</span> <span id="s3660">We put all that into the shelter so that we could use it if we had to run and we would not have time to take provisions with us.</span> <span id="s3661">However, the fighting didn’t get to us and we didn’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">Q: Did he stay then in the Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3664">He stayed with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s3665">He served on the front.</span> <span id="s3666">He went into Berlin and deep into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3667">Q: Did he get to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s3668">A: My sister got to Austria.</span> <span id="s3669">My brother was in different places in Germany.</span> <span id="s3670">He was in the army until he got released at the end of 1946.</span> <span id="s3671">We got married in 1946 and went to Poland.</span> <span id="s3672">We tried to find him in Poland.</span> <span id="s3673">As a matter of fact, I sent a letter.</span> <span id="s3674">You see, when we came to Poland there was a Jewish organization which wanted to save Jewish boys from wherever they could possibly find them.</span> <span id="s3675">I told them that I had a brother in the army and that I would like for him to be saved from having to go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s3676">I also told them that I am in Poland and that he was supposed to meet me and my sister in Poland.</span> <span id="s3677">I said all of that in that letter but he never got this letter.</span> <span id="s3678">He himself didn’t get it but the authorities did and they knew all about it.</span> <span id="s3679">But they sent him back to Russia.</span> <span id="s3680">You know he had finished his duty in the army after which he went back home.</span> <span id="s3681">There was no one in Kurzeniez so he went to Pskov.</span> <span id="s3682">Yes, he knew Abe’s mother and he knew that I had gotten married to Abe.</span> <span id="s3683">So he went to Abe’s mother.</span> <span id="s3684">You see Abe’s mother and sisters were in Pskov.</span> <span id="s3685">So he stayed with Abe’s mother until he got married and returned to Wilaika.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">Q: When did he go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">A: In 1956.</span> <span id="s3688">Then he left Russia for Poland.</span> <span id="s3689">In December of 1958 he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s3690">When I left Israel he came to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">Q: So, he had no difficulty in leaving Russia for Poland in 1956?</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: No, that was a time they let all the “Western” people go.</span> <span id="s3693">People who used to have Polish citizenship.</span> <span id="s3694">Those who used to inhabit lands which used to be Polish.</span> <span id="s3695">When we went to Israel all the Polish citizens, the Jews could go.</span> <span id="s3696">Not those who used to be Russian citizens.</span> <span id="s3697">Not the Russian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">Q: Kurzeniez was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">A: Yes, that is right.</span> <span id="s3700">It was Polish.</span> <span id="s3701">It was Poland until 1939, so they let him go.</span> <span id="s3702">You just applied for a visa and you got a visa.</span> <span id="s3703">It was no problem.</span> <span id="s3704">It was the same with Abe’s mother and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">Q: Did he have papers to prove that he was born in Kurzeniez?</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3707">We were registered there.</span> <span id="s3708">All of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: Did you always have papers with you the entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">A: No.</span> <span id="s3711">We had no papers.</span> <span id="s3712">Everything was done (from the original register) the whole thing.</span> <span id="s3713">First of all, when we were living in Kurzeniez we were registered there in the city hall.</span> <span id="s3714">You cannot live in Russia for three days without being registered.</span> <span id="s3715">They came, even in the middle of the night and they check you.</span> <span id="s3716">You never knew when they came in and check.</span> <span id="s3717">You couldn’t hide without registration.</span> <span id="s3718">You also had to have a passport and you can’t travel without a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">Q: I hope that we are never forced into that here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">A: The way we are now, we are used to it.</span> <span id="s3721">When we came out of Russia and Poland, everything appeared different to us.</span> <span id="s3722">We always expected to identify ourselves.</span> <span id="s3723">It is different in a free world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">Q: We need to go back and I need to know the rest of it.</span> <span id="s3725">What happened after November 1943, when your brother was with the partisans and you were in another part.</span> <span id="s3726">Actually the tape is almost over so it would be best if we did not get into that now.</span> <span id="s3727">However, your brother also went into many experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3729">He went through it his way and I went through it my way.</span> <span id="s3730">It all was tough but in different ways.</span> <span id="s3731">My brother has had plenty to tell.</span> <span id="s3732">It was just by a miracle that we survived.</span> <span id="s3733">At least to us.</span> <span id="s3734">It was just a miracle.</span> <span id="s3735">The way we both escaped from death.</span> <span id="s3736">In truth, it is impossible to comprehend how I am still alive.</span> <span id="s3737">I guess it was just meant to be that I would live and be happy.</span> <span id="s3738">It is impossible to believe.</span> <span id="s3739">Actually, it was not just death.</span> <span id="s3740">It was not the way we were hungry.</span> <span id="s3741">We were cold.</span> <span id="s3742">We were scared.</span> <span id="s3743">You never knew where you were.</span> <span id="s3744">Whom you would meet.</span> <span id="s3745">After all, anybody could have killed you.</span> <span id="s3746">Nobody cared for anything.</span> <span id="s3747">It was like Margi.</span> <span id="s3748">For example, at the place where we went to bathe and they wanted us to come to the party, the same man who was mayor of the little village he was killed by the partisans, since he had some connections to the Germans.</span> <span id="s3749">Somebody told the partisans about this connection.</span> <span id="s3750">They made it sound like a double cross.</span> <span id="s3751">So a special group came out.</span> <span id="s3752">I met that special group and I also had to run away from them for my own safety.</span> <span id="s3753">That was a different story all together.</span> <span id="s3754">But what they did to the mayor was unbelievable!</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">Q: Which partisans were those now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3756">A: You see, there were a lot of partisans of all different groups and names.</span> <span id="s3757">Tough guys.</span> <span id="s3758">That was a special group.</span> <span id="s3759">For example, if someone denounced someone else and said that this somebody was to be put to death and if they said that they have to get rid of the family, then the partisans would wipe the family out.</span> <span id="s3760">I was there and I had to run from this guy myself.</span> <span id="s3761">Because of me, our entire group, several families together, we all had to run.</span> <span id="s3762">We got away from him but that is an entirely different story.</span> <span id="s3763">A whole unbelievable story!!</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: This was a period when you were in your middle teens?</span> <span id="s3765">A period of unsettledness for two years?</span> <span id="s3766">When life could have ended any day?</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: For two years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">Q: Now, it has been ten days since we talked last.</span> <span id="s3769">Longer than that.</span> <span id="s3770">Almost two weeks.</span> <span id="s3771">Last time you told about your brother a lot and gave us the main outlines of what he was doing.</span> <span id="s3772">To end up when he was with that partisan group.</span> <span id="s3773">Then you told about being left all by yourself in the northern part of White Russia.</span> <span id="s3774">Quite some distance north of Kurzeniez in the forest, the name of which I wrote down ( it sounded something like Katania).</span> <span id="s3775">Then you worked your way back down again and finally got back together with your own original group again.</span> <span id="s3776">Then you met your brother and found him in Norun.</span> <span id="s3777">Then you were together from November until the spring of 1944.</span> <span id="s3778">(Actually the brother did not leave until liberation which occurred in August 1944).</span> <span id="s3779">One question which I had as I went over this.</span> <span id="s3780">I know that there are many kinds of partisans and you mentioned that some had Soviet officers who were under orders from the Russian army.</span> <span id="s3781">Did all the partisan groups that you know about or were in contact with have Soviet officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">A: A lot of them did.</span> <span id="s3783">You see, the partisans were groups.</span> <span id="s3784">A lot of the groups belonged to one main group.</span> <span id="s3785">They called it a brigade.</span> <span id="s3786">Most of the officers in that brigade were Russians.</span> <span id="s3787">They were sent from Russia (in opposition to the Russians who escaped from the prisoner camps) to organize it.</span> <span id="s3788">These officers were under the rule of the Soviets.</span> <span id="s3789">The Soviets sent these officers by planes and helicopters.</span> <span id="s3790">They dropped them off in certain areas and in the area where we were.</span> <span id="s3791">There was the Adrat brigade.</span> <span id="s3792">One brigade had a few Adrats since Adrat means a big group.</span> <span id="s3793">Each Adrat had a name.</span> <span id="s3794">They all were supposed to do almost the same thing but of course, in different areas.</span> <span id="s3795">Some groups were stationed in areas not far from us.</span> <span id="s3796">We were just private citizens in the underground.</span> <span id="s3797">That group was mainly to stop the railroad but also to do other damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">Q: There were some partisan groups who were Jewish and some were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s3800">Most of them were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3801">The only Jews who were there were those who had managed to escape from the camps (and towns where they were annihilated) as it happened in the Vila ghetto.</span> <span id="s3802">In Vilna ghetto, the Jews knew about the partisans.</span> <span id="s3803">You knew that it is very hard to survive just by escaping to the woods.</span> <span id="s3804">With the help of the partisans it was a lot easier to survive.</span> <span id="s3805">So, naturally the men and the young women went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s3806">The escapees from Vilna had what they brought with them or from other ghettos or towns.</span> <span id="s3807">They brought guns or a pistol or whatever else they had or had brought.</span> <span id="s3808">Also, by the time of late 1943, the Russian army dropped weapons by parachute.</span></p> <p><span id="s3809">Q: Did they also drop food?</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">A: No.</span> <span id="s3811">They did not drop food.</span> <span id="s3812">We had actually relatively more food than the Russian army.</span> <span id="s3813">We all got food from the farmers.</span> <span id="s3814">They went in and they told the head of the village we need so much of that and so much of that.</span> <span id="s3815">The villager brought it.</span> <span id="s3816">Each group had a kitchen and the cook cooked meals like in a regular army kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">Q: It was still a dangerous time there but it was much more pleasant than the winter before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3819">You see, the first winter we didn’t have such well organized Adrats.</span> <span id="s3820">We had partisans drifting by.</span> <span id="s3821">In the place where we were for the most part of the two years, they never had actual groups staying there.</span> <span id="s3822">There were also not as many partisans.</span> <span id="s3823">Remember that I told you that once the Germans mistreated the prisoners of war so badly a lot of prisoners ran away and joined the partisans.</span> <span id="s3824">Of course, the Germans sent a lot of prisoners to forced labor camps but those who were strong enough, and could, escaped.</span> <span id="s3825">These prisoners were raw materials for the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">Q: Now the Jews who were in the forest some of them were civilians with women and children.</span> <span id="s3827">Probably most of the men were with partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">A: The young men not the older men.</span> <span id="s3829">The older men would not have been much use.</span></p> <p><span id="s3830">Q: Were there some groups which were almost completely Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3831">A: There was one group.</span> <span id="s3832">It was called “mistite” which translates into “revenge.”</span> <span id="s3833">Most of the people in this group were Jewish.</span> <span id="s3834">Not all but most of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s3835">However, this was the first group which started out for the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3836">Q: Is that a Yiddish or a Hebrew word?</span></p> <p><span id="s3837">A: No, it is a Russian word.</span> <span id="s3838">It actually means “will fight back.”</span> <span id="s3839">Then they started another group of Jews.</span> <span id="s3840">Somehow nothing happened with it.</span> <span id="s3841">So they became a group of “Bryvotsla.”</span> <span id="s3842">This is also a Russian word and it means something which they make.</span> <span id="s3843">The entire group was Jewish.</span> <span id="s3844">It even contained men and women.</span> <span id="s3845">All the people had a trade.</span> <span id="s3846">Something which they could make and that is what “Bryvotsla” means.</span> <span id="s3847">They made leather goods.</span> <span id="s3848">They baked for the entire surrounding area.</span> <span id="s3849">This group was a supply group.</span> <span id="s3850">They had shoemakers, tailors, dressmakers.</span> <span id="s3851">Anything and everything which was needed.</span> <span id="s3852">Everything was done in the forest.</span> <span id="s3853">It was far away from where I stayed but we knew where they were.</span> <span id="s3854">They had buildings which were half underground.</span> <span id="s3855">They had a sauna bath, a bakery and anything you needed for a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3856">Q: Would they be paid or would they be supplied?</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s3858">Nobody got paid.</span> <span id="s3859">They were just given supplies.</span> <span id="s3860">Every group got what was needed.</span> <span id="s3861">Some people who were in charge of the groups came to the support group.</span> <span id="s3862">Some people traveled when it was needed.</span> <span id="s3863">Everybody would.</span> <span id="s3864">A lot of people who didn’t have a trade used to go out at night and obtain the supplies.</span> <span id="s3865">They also repaired things for the other groups.</span> <span id="s3866">People got around just about all the time by walking.</span> <span id="s3867">Some of them had horse buggies.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">Q: The Germans never found them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">A: No.</span> <span id="s3870">They did their traveling at night.</span> <span id="s3871">Even the group where I worked the entire summer for the partisans, there was a special group.</span> <span id="s3872">Those groups were small, they did belong to some brigades but they came from far away.</span> <span id="s3873">They weren’t stationed any place.</span> <span id="s3874">They just came to do as much work as needed.</span> <span id="s3875">Mainly like the railroad destruction.</span> <span id="s3876">There were only 12 men or so.</span> <span id="s3877">They came over to our place in 1943 to meet us in the summer.</span> <span id="s3878">We were several young girls.</span> <span id="s3879">They asked what they could do.</span> <span id="s3880">I said, “Whatever you want we might try to help you out.”</span> <span id="s3881">They said that they would like to come to set up the camp for a few weeks and that they would like me and this other girl, and they pointed at a friend of mine from Kurzeniez to help out just by preparing the food.</span> <span id="s3882">That is what we did.</span> <span id="s3883">We got up in the mornings and met a special man from their group.</span> <span id="s3884">This man escorted us from the bunkers where we slept to their place since in the woods you might get lost and he took us to his camp.</span> <span id="s3885">They brought us all the supplies, including the wood.</span> <span id="s3886">We made a quick breakfast for whoever was in the camp.</span> <span id="s3887">There were always some who were on the job.</span> <span id="s3888">However, for supper, most of them came back together.</span> <span id="s3889">Really, they used to do most of their work at night.</span> <span id="s3890">At suppertime they ate and then they had their assignments.</span> <span id="s3891">After supper we were taken back.</span> <span id="s3892">Most of them were sleeping or resting during the daytime or getting ready for their work.</span> <span id="s3893">You see, they had the main line railroad which went through.</span> <span id="s3894">The main railroad to Minsk.</span> <span id="s3895">There was a switchyard not too far at a junction at a place called Usla.</span> <span id="s3896">That junction at Usla is the main place which they damaged.</span> <span id="s3897">Every night they went back and what the Germans fixed, they destroyed.</span> <span id="s3898">Fixing and destroying was regular happening.</span> <span id="s3899">These special groups belonged to a brigade, we never knew which; they just came.</span> <span id="s3900">No questions asked.</span> <span id="s3901">And we, my friend and I just cooked for them fresh and hot food every day.</span> <span id="s3902">Usla is both the name of the switchyard and of the small village.</span> <span id="s3903">That was the main place where the partisans could do damage to the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: When did you first become involved with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">A: During the summer of 1943.</span> <span id="s3906">At the same time that I was on my own after my mother had been killed.</span> <span id="s3907">Of course we just worked with them.</span> <span id="s3908">We didn’t really join the partisans.</span> <span id="s3909">Particularly this special group was stationed far to the east.</span> <span id="s3910">They were sent from far away and at other times they were sent in different directions.</span> <span id="s3911">We would not know where.</span> <span id="s3912">That special work was good for me since during that time we got a lot of good food.</span> <span id="s3913">They were in our forest for a few weeks and when they left, they left a lot of food.</span> <span id="s3914">They left us a lot of things.</span> <span id="s3915">We kept what we could, however, we could not keep such things as eggs and meat since it was summer.</span> <span id="s3916">So we gave that surplus to other people who knew where we were working.</span> <span id="s3917">People used to come to us since they knew that they might be able to get such things as meat.</span> <span id="s3918">As I told you before I lived with the partisans I lived with a family with three children, really small children.</span> <span id="s3919">So I gave them all I could.</span> <span id="s3920">You know I was alone and a single person does not need so much.</span> <span id="s3921">So we all had food for the summer.</span> <span id="s3922">We didn’t have to go begging.</span> <span id="s3923">Of course, that also went for another family which used to live with me.</span> <span id="s3924">That lasted the entire summer.</span> <span id="s3925">That summer also I had the use of a cart.</span> <span id="s3926">One time we were just sitting around.</span> <span id="s3927">That special group, the Bryvotsla, went to a little town not far from Kurzeniez, Lubabia.</span> <span id="s3928">It is a farming place.</span> <span id="s3929">During the time we had been in Kurzeniez, under the Germans, we had been sent to work on the farm at Lubania.</span> <span id="s3930">The partisans went back to that farm in order to destroy the farm.</span> <span id="s3931">They took out all the livestock.</span> <span id="s3932">They let them loose and the brought as much as possible into the woods.</span> <span id="s3933">One cow was left over in the woods.</span> <span id="s3934">The one fellow that did scouting for the partisans and whom I mentioned before, he knew everything which went on.</span> <span id="s3935">That was his job.</span> <span id="s3936">And he chose me from all the Jewish people so lived in the camp.</span> <span id="s3937">And I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s3938">He told me that he wanted me to care for that cow for him.</span> <span id="s3939">I asked him what I should do with the cow.</span> <span id="s3940">He told me just feed her and milk her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3941">PART TWO.</span> <span id="s3942">Interview by Dr. Willis Stoesz (WS) of Mrs. Rachel Frydman (RF) “So later on somebody will come back for the cow to get it.</span> <span id="s3943">And we will give it to them but in the meantime you will have milk.”</span> <span id="s3944">The lady who had the three children in my camp, she was truly happy.</span> <span id="s3945">She personally couldn’t milk a cow.</span> <span id="s3946">I didn’t know how, so she said, “Rachel, you do it, keep the cow, just feed her and I will milk her.”</span> <span id="s3947">Feeding a cow in the summertime, in the woods is not all that difficult since the cow herself eats.</span> <span id="s3948">The lady was going to milk it, she needed the milk.</span> <span id="s3949">That summer we had a really good summer.</span> <span id="s3950">I cooked for the partisans.</span> <span id="s3951">She had the milk.</span> <span id="s3952">The kids had all the milk they wanted.</span> <span id="s3953">From nearby camps other Jews came to ask for a little milk.</span> <span id="s3954">So since she couldn’t keep all of the milk for herself, she gladly distributed it.</span> <span id="s3955">At the same time, that summer, so many things happened.</span> <span id="s3956">The Germans knew about the partisans but they couldn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s3957">So they went to the villagers and they tried to get rough with them by harming a lot of villagers.</span> <span id="s3958">Therefore, a lot of people who had gotten involved with the partisans got all afraid and they ran off to the woods.</span> <span id="s3959">We got a whole family with children.</span> <span id="s3960">A gentile family, Christians.</span> <span id="s3961">They came to the woods and set up camp close to us.</span> <span id="s3962">The fellow who gave the cow, Cholai Avarovicz, had a partner whom he worked with for the partisans.</span> <span id="s3963">This partner was staying next to that gentile family in the woods.</span> <span id="s3964">So, I told him, “Why don’t you take the cow because it is a bother to me to feed it and give the cow to this family.”</span> <span id="s3965">You know it was quite a task to stand in the pasture by myself and see that the cow wouldn’t go away.</span> <span id="s3966">The family did not want to take on another cow because they had brought their own cows.</span> <span id="s3967">So he said to me, “If you go over to that family to stay there, you can bring your cow with you.”</span> <span id="s3968">I had to go with the cow.</span> <span id="s3969">So I said, “I don’t want to go there.</span> <span id="s3970">They will stay in the woods for a few weeks and then they will go back home because they no longer will be afraid of the Germans.’</span> <span id="s3971">That won’t last.”</span> <span id="s3972">The Germans can’t kill all of them (the Germans have done just that for one village or the other which worked with the partisans) since the Germans needed them and a lot of people still work with the Germans.</span> <span id="s3973">At that time, also in Margi, another group of partisans altogether just a group of men, we didn’t know what had happened, we only knew that here came a group of four or five men and they came and they camped right next to us.</span> <span id="s3974">We never saw them by the fire and I already had brought the cow back from the pasture.</span> <span id="s3975">It was evening and the lady milked the cow.</span> <span id="s3976">She boiled the milk.</span> <span id="s3977">She asked me if I wanted a glass of warm milk.</span> <span id="s3978">I said, “Thank you.</span> <span id="s3979">Right now, I don’t want anything.”</span> <span id="s3980">Then someone called me.</span> <span id="s3981">They had another fire, like here is our fire and next to it they made a fire and a strange man whom I had never met or seen in my life was sitting beside the fire and he looked fierce.</span> <span id="s3982">But he called me so I had to go.</span> <span id="s3983">So, I went over and asked, “May I help you?”</span> <span id="s3984">He asked who I was.</span> <span id="s3985">I told him, “Well, here I am.</span> <span id="s3986">You see the whole group with the children, I am a part of this group.”</span> <span id="s3987">Then he said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s3988">I said, “I am here now.</span> <span id="s3989">You can see that I just came back from the pasture and I brought the cow back.”</span> <span id="s3990">Then he questioned, how old is the cow?</span> <span id="s3991">Then I asked him, “Why are you asking me all that?”</span> <span id="s3992">then he said, “A girl like you who is healthy and young shouldn’t be with these kids.</span> <span id="s3993">You know, with these people.</span> <span id="s3994">You should go and work for the partisans.”</span> <span id="s3995">So I told him that I do work for a group.</span> <span id="s3996">“They are not here now but they should come back any day.</span> <span id="s3997">I don’t know when but I expect them.</span> <span id="s3998">They don’t usually tell me.</span> <span id="s3999">They just come to get us and then we work for them.”</span> <span id="s4000">He asked me what I do for them.</span> <span id="s4001">I told him that I just do some cooking.</span> <span id="s4002">That I didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s4003">At that time since I had brought back the cow and she had milked the cow, a friend of mine who was older than me, as a matter of fact, she was quite a few years older, she was the sister of the woman who had the children.</span> <span id="s4004">She went to give the cow another feeding before evening.</span> <span id="s4005">So she went to look after the cow.</span> <span id="s4006">Meanwhile we heard a shot.</span> <span id="s4007">In the woods there was a rule.</span> <span id="s4008">If there is one shot it means nothing but if there are three shots, then it is trouble.</span> <span id="s4009">Then someone knows about something bad going on.</span> <span id="s4010">We heard another shot so we got scared.</span> <span id="s4011">And then it was just out of the woods, that means the shot was in the empty place where the cow went to pasture.</span> <span id="s4012">Then all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s4013">The other girl, my friend ran over.</span> <span id="s4014">She was pretty much out of breath.</span> <span id="s4015">She was so scared because one partisan had tried to do something.</span> <span id="s4016">He actually didn’t do anything to her but he had tried.</span> <span id="s4017">She got so scared that she ran back and left the cow in the pasture.</span> <span id="s4018">She said, “That guy called me.”</span> <span id="s4019">You see that had been something I had always been worrying about but something which is not truly my business is something which I try not to get involved in.</span> <span id="s4020">That is one thing I have believed in all my life.</span> <span id="s4021">However the guy had asked me to come.</span> <span id="s4022">There were four girls but he just asked me and he had never asked anybody else.</span> <span id="s4023">So he asked me again.</span> <span id="s4024">Not the man who was in charge but one of his men came over and said, “ He wants you.”</span> <span id="s4025">So I went back to that group of partisans and the fellow in charge asked me, “ What is going on there?”</span> <span id="s4026">So I told him.</span> <span id="s4027">I couldn’t say anything else.</span> <span id="s4028">I had to tell him.</span> <span id="s4029">“She ran away from one of your partisans or another man, we are not certain of who it is tried to get hold of her.”</span> <span id="s4030">For the idea of a rape happening, it was death.</span> <span id="s4031">Even as early as 1943.</span> <span id="s4032">Any man who is in charge of a group and one of his men is raping someone, that man is to die without any trial.</span> <span id="s4033">That man has to be shot!</span> <span id="s4034">The fellow in charge called his men and it was truly one of his men who had gone to the pasture.</span> <span id="s4035">It really was all in our same area.</span> <span id="s4036">It was not far from where we stayed.</span> <span id="s4037">That man was really scared.</span> <span id="s4038">The man tried to talk up and to say that he didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s4039">That she had just gotten scared.</span> <span id="s4040">That he only wanted to talk to her.</span> <span id="s4041">The chief said, “To kill a person is nothing to me.</span> <span id="s4042">It is as simple as it is for her to make a cookie.”</span> <span id="s4043">We really didn’t know what to do next.</span> <span id="s4044">If we let him do what he wanted to, that would be bad for us.</span> <span id="s4045">Somebody could take revenge under the pretext “Why he didn’t do anything to the girl.”</span> <span id="s4046">So, I myself went to the chief and I asked him “Please don’t do anything to the guy since nothing happened.</span> <span id="s4047">She has forgiven him.”</span> <span id="s4048">Then he told the guy in front of me, “Whatever Rya is saying now (there he used my Russian name) your life is in her hands and if Rya will tell me that you are guilty of an attempted rape, you know what will happen.”</span> <span id="s4049">He had a gun with a silencer and the chief was ready to do it.</span> <span id="s4050">I told him, “No!</span> <span id="s4051">We all forgive him if he promised that it will never happen again.”</span> <span id="s4052">He let it go at that.</span> <span id="s4053">After that, I prepared supper.</span> <span id="s4054">I always liked to do things like this.</span> <span id="s4055">I prepared supper for the entire group.</span> <span id="s4056">We had cheese which we had made from the milk.</span> <span id="s4057">White cheese of course.</span> <span id="s4058">We had had potatoes on the fire all day even though it was summer.</span> <span id="s4059">I called these partisans and I told them that I had enough food for all and that they should come to eat together.</span> <span id="s4060">The guy who was in charge said, “No!</span> <span id="s4061">We have an assignment to carry out for the war.”</span> <span id="s4062">So they didn’t eat and they left.</span> <span id="s4063">We didn’t know where they went or why.</span> <span id="s4064">They came back the next morning.</span> <span id="s4065">I noticed right away that something had happened.</span> <span id="s4066">Something bad!!</span> <span id="s4067">One of the partisans came over to talk to us at the fire.</span> <span id="s4068">The whole group of us was so scared of those five men.</span> <span id="s4069">We had not been able to sleep during the night, although we knew that they had not been there during the night.</span> <span id="s4070">At our fire, this partisan told us that the mayor of Margi was shot.</span> <span id="s4071">That his wife was shot.</span> <span id="s4072">They had had a very beautiful daughter and two sons.</span> <span id="s4073">However, the sons had been taken away before then for forced labor in Germany.</span> <span id="s4074">I had talked earlier about the party which took place when my mother and us ran away from the mayor’s house and that the daughter was there.</span> <span id="s4075">That daughter was older than I was.</span> <span id="s4076">That girl begged the partisans, she said she would do anything for them.</span> <span id="s4077">That she would accept any assignment after they shot her mother and father in front of her eyes.</span> <span id="s4078">The fellow who talked to our group said that they went right on, nevertheless, and raped her and then shot her.</span> <span id="s4079">Then they went to sleep after they had done the job.</span> <span id="s4080">The fellow who talked to us came over briefly.</span> <span id="s4081">When they woke up it was already afternoon then the leader again called me.</span> <span id="s4082">Before that they brought everybody in our group clothes to wear.</span> <span id="s4083">At that time we had not known what kind of a mission they were on.</span> <span id="s4084">I didn’t get anything but the other four girls, one got a jumper, one got a skirt, something but nothing for me.</span> <span id="s4085">I really didn’t know and I didn’t care!</span> <span id="s4086">I didn’t have anything and I didn’t need anything.</span> <span id="s4087">Later on he called me over again.</span> <span id="s4088">Actually that was another one that called me.</span> <span id="s4089">So again, I went over.</span> <span id="s4090">That leader was the worst man I ever met in my life except for the Germans, I am not talking about them.</span> <span id="s4091">That leader came over.</span> <span id="s4092">He took out a package and opened it up and he handed it to me.</span> <span id="s4093">I recognized right away the skirt because I knew when she was making it.</span> <span id="s4094">She worked on that skirt the whole weekend.</span> <span id="s4095">You see, we used to be over there in Margi at all occasions after my mother got killed because she went for a little bit of milk.</span> <span id="s4096">After all, Margi was the closest village to us.</span> <span id="s4097">When we used to go there for a weekend, we used to stay in their house.</span> <span id="s4098">We used to sit there and the mayor’s wife used to ask us to eat with them sometimes.</span> <span id="s4099">So, I noticed that she was knitting.</span> <span id="s4100">After all we had become friends.</span> <span id="s4101">It was some off white wool which she had.</span> <span id="s4102">When he handed me the skirt I was shaking!</span> <span id="s4103">I couldn’t refuse it!</span> <span id="s4104">I couldn’t say no!</span> <span id="s4105">I knew that he meant trouble for us!</span> <span id="s4106">I decided that if I took it he would have his hands on me and I figured that it would be something which I would have to pay back.</span> <span id="s4107">I was shocked!</span> <span id="s4108">I spoke Russian fluently and I asked him, “What would I have to pay for it?”</span> <span id="s4109">It truly was the best because it was handmade.</span> <span id="s4110">Made out of pure wool.</span> <span id="s4111">It really was a warm skirt.</span> <span id="s4112">I used it.</span> <span id="s4113">I had it.</span> <span id="s4114">I came all the way to Pskov with it.</span> <span id="s4115">Anyways, I had to take it.</span> <span id="s4116">I couldn’t refuse it.</span> <span id="s4117">I couldn’t afford to make him angry.</span> <span id="s4118">However I was still afraid that I would have to pay something for it.</span> <span id="s4119">Even though I was so young and he was so much older than I.</span> <span id="s4120">He had his eye on me anyway.</span> <span id="s4121">I felt it.</span> <span id="s4122">Then they went away and two days later they came back.</span> <span id="s4123">In the meantime my partisan group came back.</span> <span id="s4124">You see what was happening.</span> <span id="s4125">I had told that leader when he asked me to join the partisans to join his group and to work with them, to go on assignments and to do everything with them.</span> <span id="s4126">He also had told me that there was no use to stay with these people in the forest.</span> <span id="s4127">That I was not helping the cause of fighting the Germans from the woods.</span> <span id="s4128">I had told him that I don’t want to join up with the partisans or any group because I don’t want to be a wife yet.</span> <span id="s4129">That I was not ready to live with somebody.</span> <span id="s4130">I also told him that I am all alone in the world.</span> <span id="s4131">I have no idea what would happen to me later on.</span> <span id="s4132">I told him, “I can help you in a way in which it is not going to hurt me, then it is all right!”</span> <span id="s4133">I had also told him that I was working for a group which should come any day.</span> <span id="s4134">He got very angry.</span> <span id="s4135">He got so angry that he got terrible because he had been refused.</span> <span id="s4136">When this partisan group of people came back, the original partisan special mission group, an all gentile group, a whole family was back.</span> <span id="s4137">One of the sons of that group came to the woods where we stayed and he told me right away, “Do you know that Kawania,” (that was the name of the partisan leader who had killed the family of the mayor of Margi) is back.”</span> <span id="s4138">You see, they knew him also and knew he meant trouble.</span> <span id="s4139">They didn’t belong in that area to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s4140">Q: They were both gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s4141">A: Yes, both groups.</span> <span id="s4142">I was scared but what could I do?</span> <span id="s4143">I am not going to run now.</span> <span id="s4144">Wherever I run to, he will find me.</span> <span id="s4145">Anyways, I was awakened in the morning when the group I used to work for woke me up, as well as my friend.</span> <span id="s4146">We get breakfast very early in the morning because they had to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s4147">We never know where.</span> <span id="s4148">They never told us about their missions.</span> <span id="s4149">This was not our business.</span> <span id="s4150">That day, I was so tired!</span> <span id="s4151">They had a tent.</span> <span id="s4152">I went in the tent and laid down with my friend.</span> <span id="s4153">One soldier was staying there watching the area.</span> <span id="s4154">So we two girls went inside and we fell asleep.</span> <span id="s4155">We told the guy outside, he was not really a soldier but one of the partisans, to wake us up because we had to prepare dinner for the group of partisans when they returned.</span> <span id="s4156">While we were sleeping, the same Kawania with another man came by.</span> <span id="s4157">Somebody must have told him where we were or maybe he was just looking for me or something else, we never knew.</span> <span id="s4158">He went by and he started not yelling but using obscene words.</span> <span id="s4159">“What are you doing there and why are you sleeping there?”</span> <span id="s4160">The guy who was on guard duty, first of all, was not supposed to let him through, since there was a code.</span> <span id="s4161">If he is a partisan he should know the code, so maybe he knew the code.</span> <span id="s4162">We all knew that every day they had a new code.</span> <span id="s4163">However, he called us out of that tent.</span> <span id="s4164">Both of us and he started on us.</span> <span id="s4165">He said that he does not want to see us anymore there or any place because I, he especially talked to me, had told him a lie.</span> <span id="s4166">Such as, “To me she told that she doesn’t want to go with partisans and here she is with partisans.”</span> <span id="s4167">I tried to explain to him what it was all about.</span> <span id="s4168">“I am here because this is my group.</span> <span id="s4169">I told you that this is my group!</span> <span id="s4170">The group for which I am working whenever they come.</span> <span id="s4171">They come and they go back.</span> <span id="s4172">I don’t know where they go.</span> <span id="s4173">I just know when they come to get us.</span> <span id="s4174">Here is the food and here is the wood so that we can prepare dinner.”</span> <span id="s4175">So we prepared dinner.</span> <span id="s4176">When my group came, I told them all about this encounter.</span> <span id="s4177">I actually told the whole problem to the man in charge.</span> <span id="s4178">The one guy whose name was Sacha and whose name I never forgot.</span> <span id="s4179">He told me, ‘Raja, if Kawania does something to you, we will do it to him.</span> <span id="s4180">Don’t worry!!?</span> <span id="s4181">Another day went by.</span> <span id="s4182">Then the same guy from the partisan gentile family came back to me again and said, “Raja, just go away from here!</span> <span id="s4183">Wherever you can.</span> <span id="s4184">But go far.</span> <span id="s4185">He is so mad, but especially he is mad at you that he will kill you as easily as nothing.</span> <span id="s4186">He is too mad.</span> <span id="s4187">He is not going to take “No” for an answer!”</span> <span id="s4188">We took off that same night.</span> <span id="s4189">We left everything although we had a good time there.</span> <span id="s4190">What does a good time mean?</span> <span id="s4191">We certainly were in danger.</span> <span id="s4192">We had to beg for food.</span> <span id="s4193">We helped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s4194">So, we had to leave everything and go away.</span> <span id="s4195">That means the whole group not just I including the children, had to go.</span> <span id="s4196">Because of me they also had to move.</span> <span id="s4197">We moved then to the Naoran Jari (that was mentioned earlier).</span> <span id="s4198">It was a long distance.</span> <span id="s4199">We traveled through the entire night.</span> <span id="s4200">We took whatever we could take with us.</span> <span id="s4201">We met different people when we settled in the new place.</span> <span id="s4202">By then, it was already late in the summer.</span> <span id="s4203">It was already coming toward the time of the third blockade.</span> <span id="s4204">It probably was late August and the blockade happened in September.</span> <span id="s4205">I had not been there long.</span> <span id="s4206">We had just settled there and we just had gotten to meet people in Naoran when the blockade happened.</span> <span id="s4207">You see, I was alone and I had no one to care for and no one cared for me.</span> <span id="s4208">So I didn’t care to stay long in one place.</span> <span id="s4209">I could collect my things from the family I stayed with and I could go away.</span> <span id="s4210">I went away during the day.</span> <span id="s4211">Not just at night.</span> <span id="s4212">In Naoran, we had to cross the river.</span> <span id="s4213">I went off in the morning.</span> <span id="s4214">We crossed the river by boat.</span> <span id="s4215">The river wasn’t very high.</span> <span id="s4216">As a matter of fact, at one time, it was so low that I could just walk across.</span> <span id="s4217">I stayed with many families there.</span> <span id="s4218">They all wanted me to stay because I helped them.</span> <span id="s4219">I didn’t only want to stay with them.</span> <span id="s4220">I wanted to help them.</span> <span id="s4221">I didn’t stay there just to talk to them.</span> <span id="s4222">These people were very busy.</span> <span id="s4223">Everything had to be done by hand including boiling clothes to wash them.</span> <span id="s4224">They were also busy working in the fields.</span> <span id="s4225">It was already harvest time.</span> <span id="s4226">I always helped them.</span> <span id="s4227">No matter what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4228">Q: Were they Jews or gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s4229">A: They were farmers.</span> <span id="s4230">The small farmers from around there.</span> <span id="s4231">They were gentiles from the small villages.</span> <span id="s4232">They all wanted me because the minute I went, I had to do something.</span> <span id="s4233">I peeled potatoes or I cut something.</span> <span id="s4234">Help them cook something different.</span> <span id="s4235">Prepare the evening meal for the people coming in from the fields.</span> <span id="s4236">They used to come back good and hungry and they liked to have something ready and waiting.</span> <span id="s4237">They really liked me wherever I went.</span> <span id="s4238">They would have kept me there if they had not been afraid but you just can’t stay too long anywhere at a farm.</span> <span id="s4239">I sometimes stayed one day and a couple of nights.</span> <span id="s4240">Then I went somewhere else or I went back to my own quarters.</span> <span id="s4241">Once, I went to a little island where a few families lived.</span> <span id="s4242">I went to see a friend of mine, Nidia.</span> <span id="s4243">Then it started!</span> <span id="s4244">When I went to see this friend, I stayed there.</span> <span id="s4245">Then I went to Mizoli to see another friend and then the blockade started.</span> <span id="s4246">I knew about my brother at that time, but I could not do anything.</span> <span id="s4247">(She had heard that he had been deported to Riga).</span> <span id="s4248">After the blockade and after all my troubles, after all my traveling I came back to Midiair (the transcriber is not at all certain about the spelling of these places except that Midiair must have been close to Naaran) and I found that all my possessions had been sold.</span> <span id="s4249">I had nothing left.</span> <span id="s4250">So nothing tied me to Midiair anymore and I went back to my original group.</span> <span id="s4251">Back to the place in Navania.</span> <span id="s4252">There, we stayed in a barn.</span> <span id="s4253">As I said before, you see when they get the hay for winter they put it in little barns.</span> <span id="s4254">That barn where we stayed, was on a very small island.</span> <span id="s4255">You could not go around it because it was a very swampy place.</span> <span id="s4256">On the island there was a small dry place and they had the barn there.</span> <span id="s4257">At that time, usually several farmers had a barn together.</span> <span id="s4258">Except for the richer farmers who owned their own barns.</span> <span id="s4259">We then stayed several weeks in this barn when I came back and then I got busy looking for my brother.</span> <span id="s4260">I came back late in October and it was already November when I met up with my brother.</span> <span id="s4261">It was already very cold.</span> <span id="s4262">When I was with my brother, so many things happened to me.</span> <span id="s4263">I had never given up on my brother.</span> <span id="s4264">I fought to see him back alive!</span> <span id="s4265">All my dreams came really true then.</span> <span id="s4266">I brought him back and it was a little place near Naoran and Midiair.</span> <span id="s4267">It was Nivarishi -- Nometa (or something which phonetically sound like that).</span> <span id="s4268">That was a small place.</span> <span id="s4269">When we went out to this place, there was a big farm.</span> <span id="s4270">This farm was more than the usual farm.</span> <span id="s4271">It belonged to a rich man with a lot of workers to help him.</span> <span id="s4272">It was not in a village.</span> <span id="s4273">Just a beautiful big home!</span> <span id="s4274">There were a lot of smaller farmers who worked for this rich farmer.</span> <span id="s4275">We used to come and meet at this place.</span> <span id="s4276">We used to meet with the partisans who came through the area.</span> <span id="s4277">They had a very big kitchen in which I used to help.</span> <span id="s4278">In the summertime I came there to help in the harvest.</span> <span id="s4279">This is where I cut this finger.</span> <span id="s4280">I didn’t know how to do many things for the farm.</span> <span id="s4281">I had not been used to living on a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4282">Q: You were a city girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s4283">A: Kurzeniez was not a big town but this was really the farm.</span> <span id="s4284">We had not been farmers.</span> <span id="s4285">I had to help them in the fields and I learned.</span> <span id="s4286">We cut flax.</span> <span id="s4287">You know, the plant you make linen out of.</span> <span id="s4288">We bundled it up to dry it then we worked it.</span> <span id="s4289">When I brought my brother back we stayed in that place all through the winter.</span> <span id="s4290">That was a really bad winter for us (but worse for the German army) since I did not want my brother to go begging.</span> <span id="s4291">If he were to meet partisans, that would not be good for him.</span> <span id="s4292">They would take him with them.</span> <span id="s4293">I didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s4294">I wanted him to stay with me until we could find out really where he could belong since he was already with the partisans but not with any special group.</span> <span id="s4295">When he met me he had left his group.</span> <span id="s4296">We thought that we would go someplace together.</span> <span id="s4297">He didn’t want to leave me alone now.</span> <span id="s4298">I went begging for 20 km during the night.</span> <span id="s4299">That was really bold!</span> <span id="s4300">There were no villages, and those villages that were there we didn’t want to beg so much.</span> <span id="s4301">The people who had families with smaller children, they begged in villages close to them.</span> <span id="s4302">We went where the partisans used to go or where the Germans used to come for food.</span> <span id="s4303">But the Germans never came at night.</span> <span id="s4304">There, where the Germans came, we got a lot of food because the people were really scared.</span> <span id="s4305">You see, the people who lived close to the main railroad, they were truly afraid!</span> <span id="s4306">They were scared both from the partisans and the Germans.</span> <span id="s4307">They were really in a bad spot.</span> <span id="s4308">So that is where we used to go begging the whole winter.</span> <span id="s4309">Actually we were still together with the people.</span> <span id="s4310">At least many of them who we started with in 1942.</span> <span id="s4311">Naturally several of them had gotten killed but the rest were still in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s4312">Q: How many were there still left from Kurzeniez?</span> <span id="s4313">Still a couple of hundred?</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">A; Yes, still a few hundred.</span> <span id="s4315">We were together then for the entire winter.</span> <span id="s4316">The men came out to Noaran and they took out a cow from a widow.</span> <span id="s4317">They knew that they should not have done it!</span> <span id="s4318">They took out the cow and they slaughtered it.</span> <span id="s4319">Then we had meat for the whole winter.</span> <span id="s4320">You see, in the winter, it is cold.</span> <span id="s4321">Everything is frozen and you can’t stay outside in the snow.</span> <span id="s4322">Somehow, word got out to the partisans and the partisans came out to tell the men that they were not allowed to do anything like this.</span> <span id="s4323">First of all, in general, but particular to these villagers who are very helpful.</span> <span id="s4324">So it was hard to make our peace with them.</span> <span id="s4325">They were told how much they had to pay for that.</span> <span id="s4326">I don’t know how much that was.</span> <span id="s4327">They paid it off to that poor widow for that cow.</span> <span id="s4328">If they hadn’t paid they would have been shot.</span> <span id="s4329">There were three men who were involved with that.</span> <span id="s4330">One was a father with three children.</span> <span id="s4331">Another had two children.</span> <span id="s4332">The third man was not from our hometown.</span> <span id="s4333">Somehow, they were able to work out a deal.</span> <span id="s4334">That was around February 1944.</span> <span id="s4335">So I told my brother, “Let’s try next month when the snow will be down a little to get away from here.</span> <span id="s4336">This is not the place for us anymore.</span> <span id="s4337">We are both too young for this and I have had enough of it.</span> <span id="s4338">When I go begging for whom do I have to do it?</span> <span id="s4339">We are two adults.</span> <span id="s4340">Let us join a group some place.”</span> <span id="s4341">It just happened around the beginning of spring, in April, because in March we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s4342">The roads were impassable.</span> <span id="s4343">There had been so much snow and the snow had melted in places to make a swamp.</span> <span id="s4344">In the woods the snow melts slowly.</span> <span id="s4345">In April, we went to a different place altogether, Abe’s mother was there.</span> <span id="s4346">Actually, they had just gotten there.</span> <span id="s4347">We all traveled around.</span> <span id="s4348">None of us stayed in the same place for long.</span> <span id="s4349">If we got wind of a blockade, for example, we had to travel.</span> <span id="s4350">We went to that place and there we met a group, the supply group I told you about.</span> <span id="s4351">One man came to us and he said to my brother, “I have a place where a special group is looking for a young man who could speak some languages.</span> <span id="s4352">They need someone like you.”</span> <span id="s4353">He went there, of course.</span> <span id="s4354">It is not easy to say that.</span> <span id="s4355">It took a day to go there and that was by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s4356">He went there and he told the fellow in charge, the man in charge had been specially sent from Russia.</span> <span id="s4357">He came special to that place and he took my brother with him.</span> <span id="s4358">He didn’t take me but he took my brother.</span> <span id="s4359">I had gone with my brother but he did take me.</span> <span id="s4360">Then I traveled and I stayed in a different place and left my friends.</span> <span id="s4361">I then met new people.</span> <span id="s4362">Most of them were from Vilna, the big city.</span> <span id="s4363">We then stayed Not very far from where my brother was stationed.</span> <span id="s4364">I didn’t want to lose my brother again.</span> <span id="s4365">He had told them, “if you take me, I have my little sister and you have to help me take care of her.</span> <span id="s4366">You have to supply her with food.”</span> <span id="s4367">He would never go without me.</span> <span id="s4368">As a matter of fact, they supplied me with food until the end when we came out of the woods.</span> <span id="s4369">Still, when I was with the mainly young people who were there and he brought the food for me, they usually brought me more than I needed so our whole group of young people ate.</span> <span id="s4370">At that time a piece of salt was very valuable.</span> <span id="s4371">Nobody had salt but the partisans had salt.</span> <span id="s4372">So they used to give their clothes to wash to farmers and give them soap to wash it with.</span> <span id="s4373">So I told one of the partisans, “Bring me your things and I will wash for you.</span> <span id="s4374">I clean and I wash for you but I will need soap.”</span> <span id="s4375">Once I started washing word got around to that special group of partisans that I had washed the clothes.</span> <span id="s4376">The man in command knew about it.</span> <span id="s4377">He says, ‘No more!”</span> <span id="s4378">I was not supposed to wash.</span> <span id="s4379">He even sent me a piece of soap not to have me wash for anybody.</span> <span id="s4380">They truly treated me like one of them.</span> <span id="s4381">They could really have used me in the kitchen or they could have taught me how to use their radio transmitter.</span> <span id="s4382">Instead of letters, they used dots on their transmitters.</span> <span id="s4383">However, if I would go there I was still only sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s4384">I was just afraid to get involved.</span> <span id="s4385">You see, they had plenty of young men.</span> <span id="s4386">This kept me back from whatever happened or could have happened.</span> <span id="s4387">It probably would even have been safer for me but I was just afraid.</span> <span id="s4388">I was at that age and I was afraid of falling in love.</span> <span id="s4389">You fall in love anyways!</span> <span id="s4390">I fell in love with a fellow whom I never ever saw.</span> <span id="s4391">Well, I saw him a few times and I fell in love and then I didn’t want to get involved with anyone.</span> <span id="s4392">I just didn’t wasn’t to be involved with anybody.</span> <span id="s4393">You see, when people are young, they don’t think about anything and we were young.</span> <span id="s4394">I don’t have to tell you.</span> <span id="s4395">You are still young.</span> <span id="s4396">Nature takes over!</span> <span id="s4397">There were so many young men and nice looking men.</span> <span id="s4398">However, somehow that was not for me.</span> <span id="s4399">You get together with friends.</span> <span id="s4400">You see them.</span> <span id="s4401">You enjoy them.</span> <span id="s4402">in the evening at times, you are so relaxed.</span> <span id="s4403">We formed a group.</span> <span id="s4404">One used to come and play the guitar and I used to sing a lot.</span> <span id="s4405">Everybody knew that I sang well.</span> <span id="s4406">They brought me a song written on a piece of paper and told me how to sing it with a tune.</span> <span id="s4407">That is how we entertained ourselves.</span> <span id="s4408">The only thing was that I was afraid.</span> <span id="s4409">Since I was alone, I was afraid to get involved.</span> <span id="s4410">I thought that if anything happens, what would I do alone?</span> <span id="s4411">That is what kept me away from being actually with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s4412">Q: Do you still remember your mother at that time?</span> <span id="s4413">Was that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s4414">A: You see, my mother had already been gone for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s4415">Q: You remembered your mother, did that make you hesitate?</span></p> <p><span id="s4416">A; I certainly remembered my mother but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s4417">I just was afraid because I felt that I was too young to get seriously involved, possibly heartbroken.</span> <span id="s4418">You know people can get pregnant!</span> <span id="s4419">You see, here the young kids are more knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s4420">They know more about sex.</span> <span id="s4421">Maybe they don’t know all that much about love.</span> <span id="s4422">It is hard to take care of them even now.</span> <span id="s4423">But we were afraid because we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s4424">We didn’t know how to take care of ourselves.</span> <span id="s4425">So we thought best not to go near men.</span> <span id="s4426">Not to know them.</span> <span id="s4427">There were different times and we were afraid!</span> <span id="s4428">We act differently even.</span> <span id="s4429">We are brought up different.</span> <span id="s4430">When my brother said, ‘You know what” he came over every so often to visit me “The man in command” he was a big shot a colonel here or something like that.</span> <span id="s4431">He wanted me to join them.</span> <span id="s4432">You know to be with them to stay with them to sleep with them.</span> <span id="s4433">To eat there and do whatever I could.</span> <span id="s4434">That he would find something for me.</span> <span id="s4435">I told my brother plainly that there was a man upon whom I had my eyes.</span> <span id="s4436">He was really handsome!</span> <span id="s4437">I just was afraid!</span> <span id="s4438">I was afraid that I would fall in love with him and he is not even a Jew.</span> <span id="s4439">I had in my thoughts that if I ever get married it would be to a Jew and he is not a Jew.</span> <span id="s4440">That was the problem.</span> <span id="s4441">You know now in college the kids are falling in love.</span> <span id="s4442">Jewish and non-Jewish and the whole world is mixed up.</span> <span id="s4443">After all these days they go out together.</span> <span id="s4444">They never talk about religion.</span> <span id="s4445">Love is supposed to be the answer.</span> <span id="s4446">As a matter of fact, when we came out of the woods, much much later, that guy went back to Moscow to the regular army.</span> <span id="s4447">Most of them went to the regular army.</span> <span id="s4448">Then he talked to me and he said that if I would like to go to Moscow he would arrange for me to be sent to Moscow to school.</span> <span id="s4449">Because he knew that my brother also would go to the army, so I would be again by myself, all alone.</span> <span id="s4450">But I didn’t want to accept his offer.</span> <span id="s4451">I didn’t want to go to Moscow.</span> <span id="s4452">I didn’t even want to go deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s4453">I just went back to Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4454">I didn’t find anybody there so I went back to school.</span> <span id="s4455">I didn’t want to go to Russia for them to take care of me.</span> <span id="s4456">That guy went back.</span> <span id="s4457">He had a temporary wife in the woods.</span> <span id="s4458">As a matter of fact, he really fell in love with a Jewish girl from Vilna.</span> <span id="s4459">A friend of mine and my brother came to the place where the girl lived.</span> <span id="s4460">My brother moved in there.</span> <span id="s4461">She told him right away “No!”</span> <span id="s4462">Even although he was very good looking.</span> <span id="s4463">Oh what a good looking guy!</span> <span id="s4464">However, she said No!</span> <span id="s4465">No!</span> <span id="s4466">She probably had the feeling that it was a temporary thing.</span> <span id="s4467">However he found a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s4468">In the place next to my brother’s partisan was a group of partisans “Gepiais” and she moved in with him.</span> <span id="s4469">Her mother also moved in.</span> <span id="s4470">They lived in a truly beautiful place.</span> <span id="s4471">Everything including vodka was sent from Russia.</span> <span id="s4472">She lived with him until August of 1944 when we came out of the woods.</span> <span id="s4473">Then he sent her home with her mother.</span> <span id="s4474">His wife was the ballet dancer Alova.</span> <span id="s4475">He was too good looking not to have a wife.</span> <span id="s4476">A lot of people connected to the dancing field have heard of Alova.</span> <span id="s4477">Alova was his real wife.</span> <span id="s4478">We said goodbye to him in a little town and at that time he said, “Raja, here is my wife Alova.’</span> <span id="s4479">She was truly a beautiful lady.</span> <span id="s4480">It was late in 1944 when we said goodbye to him.</span> <span id="s4481">This was when the farmers again had their barns filled.</span> <span id="s4482">He tore off the whole canopy of his parachute the material and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s4483">He also gave me a few other things.</span> <span id="s4484">We did not have anything at all.</span> <span id="s4485">From the canopy of the parachute I made bed sheets, pillowcases and a gown.</span> <span id="s4486">You see, that it came in handy.</span> <span id="s4487">He was a very nice fellow, but you see what happened with the partisans.</span> <span id="s4488">They didn’t take my brother with them when they left.</span> <span id="s4489">They only took their own original group, the way they arrived and went back to Moscow.</span> <span id="s4490">But the people whom they used in the woods, the White Russians and the Jews, they told them just “Go home!”</span> <span id="s4491">And that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s4492">That was 1944 at the time the army came through and they fought.</span> <span id="s4493">This was in Poland in Eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s4494">We had already been liberated from the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s4495">Q: You have mentioned about fighting.</span> <span id="s4496">Were there battles with the Germans where you were?</span> <span id="s4497">As the Germans were retreating to the west were they fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s4498">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s4499">They were not fighting so much just in certain places.</span> <span id="s4500">The Germans were scattered.</span> <span id="s4501">They traveled by small groups and they caught and made prisoners.</span> <span id="s4502">The partisans took a very big group of German soldiers prisoners.</span> <span id="s4503">As a matter of fact, a dear friend of mine, who was taken into the same group with my brother, he was sent to a different area to do something special.</span> <span id="s4504">But he never came back.</span> <span id="s4505">When the Germans ran back toward the west from the frontlines, they had all kinds of ammunition with them.</span> <span id="s4506">He was killed by them.</span> <span id="s4507">Another friend of mine, this one was from Kurzeniez and we had been brought up together, and another friend from a different small town, they were both killed just a few days before we got clear of the Germans.</span> <span id="s4508">The Germans even while running away still shot people.</span> <span id="s4509">They actually tried to shoot their way back into Germany.</span> <span id="s4510">However, all of them were caught and a lot of them were killed.</span> <span id="s4511">And the others were sent to prison that was most of them.</span> <span id="s4512">They gathered them as prisoners where we stayed and then sent them to Witnica (the transcriber located such a town which is much further west than had been anticipated.</span> <span id="s4513">Therefore it is possible that the name was misunderstood).</span> <span id="s4514">Witnica was always the center of all that surrounding area.</span> <span id="s4515">An odd thing, is that my brother went into the Russian army wearing German boots.</span> <span id="s4516">They took the boots from the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s4517">The Germans had their watches which the Russian people never had.</span> <span id="s4518">The partisans didn’t have anything so they took the clothes from the Germans including their watches.</span> <span id="s4519">We all took some things like that.</span> <span id="s4520">They called it “Gonif” and it was gathered.</span> <span id="s4521">They even offered me some of it but I didn’t take it.</span> <span id="s4522">I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s4523">The only thing my brother took were the boots.</span> <span id="s4524">He didn’t have anything on his feet.</span> <span id="s4525">I have a picture of him being a soldier.</span> <span id="s4526">A Russian soldier wearing German boots.</span> <span id="s4527">By that time the Germans no longer fought back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4528">Q: After six hours of talking we have recorded a lot of experiences for people to know about eventually.</span> <span id="s4529">We got pretty much to the end of the Germans being in that part of Poland which was in August of 1944.</span> <span id="s4530">The end was coming fast.</span> <span id="s4531">The Germans had disintegrated into small groups.</span> <span id="s4532">A lot were take prisoners and a few were shot.</span> <span id="s4533">One of the Germans contributed his boots to your brother so that he could fight for the Russians in the winter that was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s4534">A: Yes, he had these boots in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s4535">These were the only shoes which he had to wear.</span> <span id="s4536">I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s4537">When we came out of the woods I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s4538">I had no shoes on my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s4539">Q: What was the name of the town?</span> <span id="s4540">I am looking for it here in my notes.</span> <span id="s4541">The town where Abe’s mother was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s4542">A: Pskov.</span> <span id="s4543">It was Pskawy in Polish.</span> <span id="s4544">In Polish it has a y at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s4545">Q: Is that near Kurzeniez?</span></p> <p><span id="s4546">A: It is almost the same area.</span> <span id="s4547">It is to the east closer to Vilna.</span> <span id="s4548">When I went there I went to the railroad center of Kuryecheniez.</span> <span id="s4549">From there you could go to Vilna and to Milovetchna and to Miladera, to Kurzeniez and to Pskov and Vestadi (no attempts to locate these cities were made with all the post war changes of names from Polish to Russian and the relative casual importance this did not appear required or even possible.</span> <span id="s4550">Some

<span id="s4553">Vilna is Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s4554">Q: So, that is where you went eventually, after you came out of the forest?</span> <span id="s4555">You didn’t go to Pskov for a while, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s4556">A: You see, when we came out of the forest in August 1944, we first stayed in the villages.</span> <span id="s4557">When we learned that the German army was retreating and the Russians were advancing, we had really been prepared for another blockade.</span> <span id="s4558">Remember that I told you that the fourth blockade did not get to us.</span> <span id="s4559">It remained far to the east, in Russia.</span> <span id="s4560">They did kill a lot of people in that fourth blockade, also in the wooded areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s4561">Q: In the area of Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s4562">A: It was further away from Minsk.</span> <span id="s4563">Much closer to Smolensk.</span> <span id="s4564">Yes, in that area.</span> <span id="s4565">So we had prepared ourselves since we knew that the blockade was coming.</span> <span id="s4566">Fortunately they did not get to us.</span> <span id="s4567">The fourth blockade was not a day thing like the three we had had.</span> <span id="s4568">The first three were that they came and stayed for one day and then they went.</span> <span id="s4569">They went from one part of the forest to another part.</span> <span id="s4570">That is how the Germans went.</span> <span id="s4571">During the third blockade I went wherever the group went until they sent me home.</span> <span id="s4572">It was fortunate for me that they sent me home.</span> <span id="s4573">The entire group got killed later on long after I had left them.</span> <span id="s4574">The friend whom I had gone to see when I got involved with the group never came back.</span> <span id="s4575">Later I heard that the whole group which by then was deep in Russia when they tried to cross through the German lines got involved in a fight and were slaughtered.</span></p> <p><span id="s4576">Q: So, it was good luck for you that they didn’t allow you to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s4577">A: Yes it was but at that time I suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s4578">It took me a long time until I did rejoin my original group with my friends.</span> <span id="s4579">I truly had to go through hell.</span> <span id="s4580">I guess it was meant for me to survive this.</span> <span id="s4581">I suffered but I came out of it.</span> <span id="s4582">She never came back!</span> <span id="s4583">She never did.</span> <span id="s4584">I never found out where she died.</span> <span id="s4585">We got ready for that blockade!</span> <span id="s4586">That summer we built hiding places.</span> <span id="s4587">It was built on the edge of the wooded area where we were staying.</span> <span id="s4588">It was built by big groups of young and old people, most of them from Vilna.</span> <span id="s4589">It was not far from the area where my brother was with the partisans.</span> <span id="s4590">All the men of that big group started in July to dig the hiding place.</span> <span id="s4591">I remember that it was July because it was very hot.</span> <span id="s4592">All the men went to dig for half a day every morning.</span> <span id="s4593">They dug so much that they established a very big underground bunker.</span> <span id="s4594">We even stored dry bread.</span> <span id="s4595">Since it was summer it was easy to dry whatever bread was left over.</span> <span id="s4596">Whenever we could get bread.</span> <span id="s4597">We dried some fruit.</span> <span id="s4598">Whatever fruit we could find in the woods such as blueberries.</span> <span id="s4599">We dried it out and put it in bags.</span> <span id="s4600">We said that in case something happened and we hear that the blockade comes closer to us, we would first transfer all the bread there, since we wouldn’t know how long it would last.</span> <span id="s4601">They took me there for one day to help only.</span> <span id="s4602">You see, they didn’t often take the women.</span> <span id="s4603">They didn’t even want word to get out that they were making such a major effort.</span> <span id="s4604">One day I went down there to work.</span> <span id="s4605">The entrance was at a very big rock just near a very small lake.</span> <span id="s4606">That lake was flowing into a big lake at Narod.</span> <span id="s4607">Narod used to be a resort place in the area.</span> <span id="s4608">There was a small town of Kapmunih then it went to Narod.</span> <span id="s4609">The big lake was far away but it has a very long shoreline.</span> <span id="s4610">To show the kind of resort area it was, you have to look at the richest people of the area.</span> <span id="s4611">The ones from Vilna used to come there for the summer.</span> <span id="s4612">Most people who came there went fishing.</span> <span id="s4613">A cousin of mine, after the war, her husband was in charge of the fishing, they also had experiences similar to mine.</span> <span id="s4614">Under that rock was the entrance and they had put a little door behind the rock.</span> <span id="s4615">Of course when I went to work it was just a hole, the door had not yet been installed.</span> <span id="s4616">The hole was the entrance.</span> <span id="s4617">It remained as it was and we never had to use it.</span> <span id="s4618">But nobody could ever, unless someone talked or pointed it out, have known that it was there.</span> <span id="s4619">We knew the tactics of the Germans.</span> <span id="s4620">How they travel.</span> <span id="s4621">How they go about a blockade.</span> <span id="s4622">They would just move at arms length to each other.</span> <span id="s4623">They would not go into the water.</span> <span id="s4624">Since this was on the edge of the water they would never think of that.</span> <span id="s4625">So from our previous experiences we already knew how to hide.</span> <span id="s4626">Even the partisans and the group which my brother joined weren’t far away.</span> <span id="s4627">It really was only walking distance from our place.</span> <span id="s4628">Didn’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s4629">That partisan group belonged to a bigger group which was called the Chipai.</span> <span id="s4630">It was not the supply group and it was mixed Jewish and non-Jewish group.</span> <span id="s4631">It was a real fighting group.</span> <span id="s4632">They had the same idea.</span> <span id="s4633">They also built a shelter and places to hide.</span> <span id="s4634">They would use these hiding places in case they were not ready and the Germans would come sooner than expected and sooner than they got the order to move.</span> <span id="s4635">The partisans received orders from someone deep in Russia and the orders were that the partisans should not fight the Germans when the Germans came out to look for them but that they should leave everything they couldn’t carry with them and move.</span> <span id="s4636">Of course, they would know where the Germans are so that they would move away from them.</span> <span id="s4637">There were orders not to make a stand of it since it would be useless to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s4638">The partisans existed only for one purpose.</span> <span id="s4639">Not to fight the Germans for a piece of land.</span> <span id="s4640">It would just be suicidal.</span> <span id="s4641">They were to do harm to the German communications.</span> <span id="s4642">Whatever they could do in that line would help a lot.</span> <span id="s4643">They built shelters.</span> <span id="s4644">Not so much to hide people but to store all their valuable supplies such as food and grain.</span> <span id="s4645">I knew that since it was not a secret.</span> <span id="s4646">Partisans wouldn’t tell you their secrets anymore than any other military unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s4647">Q: They would have been ready to move out and hide everything there?</span></p> <p><span id="s4648">A: Yes, hide it and when they would come back it would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s4649">Q: They had supplies for many weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s4650">A; Yes, they had a lot of things.</span> <span id="s4651">Of course, they could not keep things which would spoil.</span> <span id="s4652">But they kept things like grain which they could save and which would last for at least a month since there was not refrigeration.</span> <span id="s4653">If the blockade lasted longer, they would at least have food.</span> <span id="s4654">However, that was not all that important for the partisans since the Russians always supplied food first.</span></p> <p><span id="s4655">In any village which the Germans suspected of helping the partisans, such as Margi in the third blockade, they burned it completely.</span> <span id="s4656">They did that to all the villages.</span> <span id="s4657">When we traveled in the third blockade with the partisans, when I was with the group, we could only travel at night.</span> <span id="s4658">You could always tell the villages.</span> <span id="s4659">Village by village.</span> <span id="s4660">Wherever they set foot they burned, they took most of the men especially the young men with them.</span> <span id="s4661">that is the same thing which they did in Varska (not far from Pskov) which is in the east.</span> <span id="s4662">We, really the Jews, were sitting there just hoping to survive but the partisans knew every move the Germans made.</span> <span id="s4663">Wherever they went or where they were supposed to go the next day, the partisans usually knew everything.</span> <span id="s4664">They also had their own people to find out.</span> <span id="s4665">so nothing stayed a secret from the partisans.</span> <span id="s4666">So, we were prepared, even we.</span> <span id="s4667">This is one thing you have to hand it to them, they told us everybody had connections, just as I had my brother there.</span> <span id="s4668">He would warn me.</span> <span id="s4669">However, fortunately, they didn’t get to us and we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s4670">Q: So further east the Germans had time to destroy everything but by the time they came to you they were in disarray and in retreat?</span></p> <p><span id="s4671">A: They were in complete retreat.</span> <span id="s4672">They were retreating so fast that they no longer thought about catching partisans or anybody.</span> <span id="s4673">They were just glad to be alive and to survive themselves.</span> <span id="s4674">They ran away in very small groups.</span> <span id="s4675">Everything came to fast for the Germans.</span> <span id="s4676">All of a sudden, after nearly two years in the woods where just about everyday was like every other day, at the end of which we thought, “Oh a day went by!</span> <span id="s4677">Maybe tomorrow something will happen at the front and maybe something else will happen.”</span> <span id="s4678">Things did happen.</span> <span id="s4679">Our hope, we had lived by hope so long that we didn’t even hope anymore.</span> <span id="s4680">Everyday was the same as every other day.</span> <span id="s4681">Maybe somebody got killed or somebody came back from the frontline and we would not hear anything special.</span> <span id="s4682">Then all of a sudden even for us, it was really too fast.</span> <span id="s4683">Since they got hit deep in Russia (she is groping for the name of Stalingrad) in 1943 they had bad luck.</span> <span id="s4684">After that there was a time when there was something like a standstill and we didn’t know about anything and how things were going.</span> <span id="s4685">We didn’t know what is what.</span> <span id="s4686">The only thing we knew was that there were always more partisans around.</span> <span id="s4687">Their numbers was ever increasing.</span> <span id="s4688">By the end of that same summer the Ukrainians came back.</span> <span id="s4689">The very same ones who had worked with the Germans.</span> <span id="s4690">they came over to the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s4691">Q: Even the Ukrainians came to join the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s4692">A: Yes, but they had worked with the Germans all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s4693">Q: Were people warned about the Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s4694">A; Yes we were.</span> <span id="s4695">We were worried about them.</span> <span id="s4696">During all the three blockades, the Germans really didn’t go there not so many Germans.</span> <span id="s4697">The Ukrainians came.</span> <span id="s4698">There were two Germans to ten Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s4699">The Ukrainians fought against their own people.</span> <span id="s4700">After all, the Ukraine was one of the Soviet socialist Republics.</span> <span id="s4701">However, then something happened in the German army.</span> <span id="s4702">Maybe they didn’t treat them well.</span> <span id="s4703">The Ukrainians really were not prisoners of the Germans, those who were prisoners were really treated badly and not many of them survived unless they just ran over to the partisans or just decide to change sides.</span> <span id="s4704">You see, the partisans were a refuge for all of them whoever could join up.</span> <span id="s4705">The Ukrainians came back and they begged to join up.</span> <span id="s4706">Of course, they did but they were not just accepted like that to come back because the partisans, whoever was in charge did not accept them easily.</span> <span id="s4707">They had to prove that they were trustworthy and to do something.</span> <span id="s4708">For example, they had to bring a live German with them or something like that in order to atone for having run over to the Germans and worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s4709">That the first thing they had to do.</span> <span id="s4710">Of course, they knew how and where to get their Germans.</span> <span id="s4711">After all they worked with them.</span> <span id="s4712">That summer it was just full of partisans.</span> <span id="s4713">Wherever we went, whenever we turned around there were partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s4714">Q: When did the Ukrainians first start to be friendly with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s4715">A: In the summer of 1944.</span> <span id="s4716">Not yet in the spring.</span> <span id="s4717">They started to come over in May.</span> <span id="s4718">As a matter of fact, one told me that he was there when my mother got killed.</span> <span id="s4719">He showed me where her body was near Margi.</span> <span id="s4720">Of course, he didn’t know it was my mother.</span> <span id="s4721">Another one who wanted to make himself look nice he said that they shot those few Jews who were going out.</span> <span id="s4722">You remember, that my mother went to the village but it was a different village, he knew that when they shot at them, one fell to the ground but these Ukrainians said to me, “I knew that he was not dead, that he couldn’t be dead because we were firing from too far.”</span> <span id="s4723">So I said it was a couple of children: “the other four were dead.”</span> <span id="s4724">He said, “ But this one, he couldn’t be dead!</span> <span id="s4725">I knew he is not dead.</span> <span id="s4726">He made himself lay down and lay still!</span> <span id="s4727">But I didn’t want to bother, I thought let him go.</span> <span id="s4728">Let him live.’</span> <span id="s4729">As a matter of fact, the Ukrainian was right, that fellow was not even wounded.</span> <span id="s4730">Just when they started shooting he fell from fright and he is still alive someplace.</span> <span id="s4731">So then the Ukrainians joined and they did whatever they were told to do.</span> <span id="s4732">They didn’t know what we had gone through.</span> <span id="s4733">There were so many that summer.</span> <span id="s4734">There were so many of them.</span> <span id="s4735">They knew that the Germans could not last long.</span> <span id="s4736">So they had no choice if they wanted to wind up on the right side.</span></p> <p><span id="s4737">Q: So, all during August then the Germans were coming by in small groups.</span> <span id="s4738">It must have taken quite a while until they got past of where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s4739">A: We were afraid only if somebody would try to interfere with the groups of Germans.</span> <span id="s4740">The partisans told all the Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s4741">The Jewish families there, “The war is over!</span> <span id="s4742">Be careful try to get together into a group and go home.</span> <span id="s4743">Wherever home is.</span> <span id="s4744">Whenever you can.”</span> <span id="s4745">So, I, for example, tried to gather a few things.</span> <span id="s4746">After all being with so many people and everyone gave you something.</span> <span id="s4747">I had a blanket and I got another blanket.</span> <span id="s4748">I got a little cart and I got a washbowl.</span> <span id="s4749">You know I had to have something to carry it in.</span> <span id="s4750">I could not just leave the woods with that stuff in my hands.</span> <span id="s4751">I didn’t know how far it was.</span> <span id="s4752">I knew that it was far from Kurzeniez anyhow.</span> <span id="s4753">So we got to a little village.</span> <span id="s4754">Katowitz, next to the lake.</span> <span id="s4755">Truly it was beautiful there.</span> <span id="s4756">I went there and I talked to a villager.</span> <span id="s4757">“Listen, I have some things.</span> <span id="s4758">Take me from your forest to your village and I will give these things to you and I have some food which all the people from Vilna had abandoned.”</span> <span id="s4759">The people from Vilna went in another direction from mine in order to get back to Vilna.</span> <span id="s4760">They went off in a group and left everything they had behind.</span> <span id="s4761">I told that fellow, “Come and I will show you where it all is.”</span> <span id="s4762">Oh, we were still all in the woods and we knew that things were still going on.</span> <span id="s4763">We knew that the Russians were coming but we had not seen them.</span> <span id="s4764">They took me to their place.</span> <span id="s4765">I stayed there for three days.</span> <span id="s4766">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s4767">Every morning I went to the lake.</span> <span id="s4768">It was like a beach.</span> <span id="s4769">That place was just beautiful!!</span> <span id="s4770">However, I wanted to get to my own people and particularly to see where my brother is.</span> <span id="s4771">He had left.</span> <span id="s4772">They left before us anyway.</span> <span id="s4773">They had to go someplace and I didn’t know where to.</span> <span id="s4774">I had asked them too.</span> <span id="s4775">They then asked me if I wanted to go back to Kurzeniez?</span> <span id="s4776">I told them, “No, that is too far!”</span> <span id="s4777">so I mentioned another small town and he took me half way and then told me that I would walk the rest of the way.</span> <span id="s4778">He knew that it was dangerous to go.</span> <span id="s4779">At that time, it was more dangerous to go in the forest than during the previous two years.</span> <span id="s4780">I went to one place to see one friend and some people I knew were at the other end of the forest.</span> <span id="s4781">I almost knew every corner of the forest.</span> <span id="s4782">I wasn’t afraid!</span> <span id="s4783">I thought, “What can happen?”</span> <span id="s4784">The Germans certainly would not go there in the middle of the day unless they had a blockade and there were the partisans.</span> <span id="s4785">I was concerned of the partisans too, after all, I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s4786">By that time I got a little more afraid.</span> <span id="s4787">After all, I could meet Germans too.</span> <span id="s4788">They were cutting through at times.</span> <span id="s4789">However, most of the Germans were afraid of the partisans.</span> <span id="s4790">The Germans really by then gave up the fight.</span> <span id="s4791">They really had.</span> <span id="s4792">Maybe a few stronger groups still tried but not many.</span> <span id="s4793">And usually they traveled by groups of three or four.</span> <span id="s4794">They didn’t know where there were roads in the forest.</span> <span id="s4795">By that time, I had arrived in that small town, Yadlig.</span> <span id="s4796">It was closer to the forest than Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4797">But, anyway I was already not far away from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4798">There, in a village, not even in Yadlig, somebody told me that there is a group of partisans who had been there already for a few days.</span> <span id="s4799">That there were two Jewish boys with them.</span> <span id="s4800">so, I went to the other end of the village and there was my brother with his group.</span> <span id="s4801">A few of the Chipai group had joined them.</span> <span id="s4802">I knew a few of them from the Chipai group.</span> <span id="s4803">I stayed with a villager for a few days then I went to the little town of Yadlig.</span> <span id="s4804">There, I already met a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s4805">They came out of the woods earlier than I.</span> <span id="s4806">They came directly there while I was staying at the two villages.</span> <span id="s4807">So they were ahead of me.</span> <span id="s4808">I met a lot of people there from the forest where we had seen each other.</span> <span id="s4809">I stayed there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s4810">Some of the partisans somehow went back to Russia and my brother was sent home.</span> <span id="s4811">He joined me in Yadlig where we stayed together.</span> <span id="s4812">Then word reached me that my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s4813">She wrote a letter to one Christian family which lived in Kurzeniez next door to us.</span> <span id="s4814">She sent a letter to them.</span> <span id="s4815">They, however were not there because they ran away with the Germans.</span> <span id="s4816">The letter, however, was kept in the post office and somebody brought the letter to us in Yadlig.</span> <span id="s4817">She wrote in her letter to the neighbor that she had-- she was in the Russian army -- hoped that she could answer some questions for her mainly: is someone of all, she asked could you please right away let me know if someone of my family is still alive.</span> <span id="s4818">Of course, no one received that letter, it was at the post office until we got it.</span> <span id="s4819">So my brother said, “Let’s go home.”</span> <span id="s4820">He went first, since he was a young man.</span> <span id="s4821">He wanted to see how we could settle in.</span> <span id="s4822">Whether he could look for a job or whether they would take him into the army.</span> <span id="s4823">Later on, they took him anyhow.</span> <span id="s4824">They didn’t tell him earlier but that was that.</span> <span id="s4825">I stayed for a few days with a friend of mine, Andreovitz, later on we even went to school together.</span> <span id="s4826">Her father, since we had gone home barefoot, he made us each a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s4827">He was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s4828">Naturally I had to wait for that because it took a few days.</span> <span id="s4829">After I had gotten these boots I went home.</span> <span id="s4830">By that time I had a few things, not much with me.</span> <span id="s4831">A family from that area, as a matter of fact, there in that little town of Yadlig I met again a young man from Krymsk, in Russia.</span> <span id="s4832">In Krymsk they are dark haired people who look like Jews.</span> <span id="s4833">As a matter of fact, when I met him in the woods I thought that he was a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s4834">We now got acquainted and he really was paying court to me.</span> <span id="s4835">Maybe it wasn’t love, but then we were both young.</span> <span id="s4836">When we were in the woods he used to come often.</span> <span id="s4837">He was in that partisan group, Chipai.</span> <span id="s4838">When I used to go to see my brother I went near there to see him.</span> <span id="s4839">Whenever he used to see me while I was with the group from Vilna, he used to bring me flowers that entire summer.</span> <span id="s4840">Then when I was in Yadlig, that little town which was near the lake, the whole area is such a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s4841">When I met him in Yadlig I asked him “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s4842">He answered me, “Well, I am waiting since our group will be going into the army.”</span> <span id="s4843">As a matter of fact, some of the partisans did not go home.</span> <span id="s4844">Most of the people from that area they went home.</span> <span id="s4845">They could go home if they had a home to go to.</span> <span id="s4846">However, people from deep in Russia (Krymsk is located in the Crimea ) couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s4847">He told me, “ I am going to go into the army and we are waiting for someone to come and get us.”</span> <span id="s4848">I guess that is what he had been told.</span> <span id="s4849">They had assigned a place where they should wait until the unit was assembled for those who were going into the army.</span> <span id="s4850">They supported them by giving them food while they were waiting.</span> <span id="s4851">They really already were part of the army.</span> <span id="s4852">Then he told me when we said goodbye: “Maybe someday we will meet again!”</span> <span id="s4853">I told him, “There is no way now.</span> <span id="s4854">That’s it!</span> <span id="s4855">It is over!”</span> <span id="s4856">Things like these, you know.</span> <span id="s4857">Then I said to my friend, “I will go home!”</span> <span id="s4858">After her father had made me the boots.</span> <span id="s4859">So I took the little bundle which I had accumulated, it wasn’t much.</span> <span id="s4860">I heard of a man who went to Wilaika, I guess that is where he was going to and I asked him to let me go with him.</span> <span id="s4861">He told me that his horse was not strong enough to pull him, his wife and me but that he would take my baggage.</span> <span id="s4862">I would have to walk in my new boots.</span> <span id="s4863">So I walked all the way by road.</span> <span id="s4864">It is far from Yadlig to Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4865">It took us a long time and I walked all the way.</span> <span id="s4866">I followed the wagon.</span> <span id="s4867">When we came to Kurzeniez it was already late afternoon after a whole day of traveling.</span> <span id="s4868">I thanked him and he went on.</span> <span id="s4869">So then I was back home.</span> <span id="s4870">That was my first time home after these three years.</span> <span id="s4871">There was nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s4872">Q: Your brother was there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s4873">A: My brother was staying with a family for a while.</span> <span id="s4874">I asked him, “Did you go to see the house?”</span> <span id="s4875">He said, “There is nothing to see.”</span> <span id="s4876">Everything had been burned because when the Germans had retreated they didn’t leave anything.</span> <span id="s4877">So they just burned it.</span> <span id="s4878">There really was one street at the edge of town which had escaped the burning.</span> <span id="s4879">It had not been a big town to begin with, but the edge of town was saved.</span> <span id="s4880">So we had no home to go to.</span> <span id="s4881">I stayed with a family.</span> <span id="s4882">They took me.</span> <span id="s4883">That was the same family with which I had started out in the woods with.</span> <span id="s4884">The one with the three small children.</span> <span id="s4885">She took me in back after I had separated myself from them in the woods when I went different places with my brother.</span> <span id="s4886">I stayed with them for the summer.</span> <span id="s4887">Not longer because I became sick.</span> <span id="s4888">Most of the people who had been in the woods became sick with the typhus.</span> <span id="s4889">A man who had been very strong and a young man died.</span> <span id="s4890">A lot of people died from it.</span> <span id="s4891">I never got sick while we were in the woods.</span> <span id="s4892">I had been strong as a horse.</span> <span id="s4893">I developed and I grew.</span> <span id="s4894">When I went into the forest I had been thin.</span> <span id="s4895">However, then I got sick.</span> <span id="s4896">First, I had a very bad case of diarrhea and then I caught the typhus.</span> <span id="s4897">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s4898">We had no medicine.</span> <span id="s4899">I was afraid to tell anybody.</span> <span id="s4900">When you tell somebody they take you to the hospital where you are isolated.</span> <span id="s4901">In the house where I stayed with the family, the Russian army set up their headquarters in the rest of the house.</span> <span id="s4902">So if word got out that I am sick with the diarrhea they would want to know and they would send me away since it is so contagious.</span> <span id="s4903">I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s4904">However, one of them found out.</span> <span id="s4905">He noticed that I was sick.</span> <span id="s4906">He brought me rice.</span> <span id="s4907">I hadn’t had anything to eat.</span> <span id="s4908">We had three eggs at that time.</span> <span id="s4909">We went into the fields.</span> <span id="s4910">We dug the potatoes out.</span> <span id="s4911">They were ready by then, that late in the season.</span> <span id="s4912">It was already September.</span> <span id="s4913">We also ate whatever the people could beg again.</span> <span id="s4914">As a matter of fact, I got so homesick for the life back in the woods that I said that I would be better off there than in my hometown since I had no work.</span> <span id="s4915">I had no money.</span> <span id="s4916">Truly I had nothing.</span> <span id="s4917">From the woods I used to go out to the villages and they gave me food.</span> <span id="s4918">They supplied me with everything I needed.</span> <span id="s4919">I had enough food so that I was not hungry.</span> <span id="s4920">Here I was at home and I had nothing.</span> <span id="s4921">When the Russian army came back there was still a war going on and they didn’t have time to look who is and who is not hungry.</span> <span id="s4922">The army itself didn’t have much food.</span> <span id="s4923">Then I got sick.</span> <span id="s4924">I thought that I had a cold.</span> <span id="s4925">I went to see my brother in Wilaika.</span> <span id="s4926">He was already there.</span> <span id="s4927">He worked there.</span> <span id="s4928">While I was in Wilaika, I had troubles.</span> <span id="s4929">I don’t think that that had anything to do with the Germans because the German era was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s4930">Q: About two hundred Jews from Kurzeniez were left.</span> <span id="s4931">How many came back, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s4932">A: Not many.</span> <span id="s4933">At the beginning most of them came back but they didn’t stay long.</span> <span id="s4934">Everybody had worked for a different group and there was no reason to stay in that small town.</span> <span id="s4935">As a matter of fact, when I applied for a job I had already filled out the application and even been accepted, I got sick.</span> <span id="s4936">Then when they saw that I was sick this time they took me to a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s4937">Q: In Wilaika?</span></p> <p><span id="s4938">A: In Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4939">They cut off part of my hair which had taken me so many years to grow during the German times.</span> <span id="s4940">I was sick.</span> <span id="s4941">I was really sick!</span> <span id="s4942">After I got through the typhus and all the other sickness in the isolation unit in the hospital, I went back to the same family to live.</span> <span id="s4943">Of course, by that time I was again without a job since my job had been taken by someone else.</span> <span id="s4944">Therefore, I did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s4945">Of course, all the other people who lived in Kurzeniez knew me and they tried to help me.</span> <span id="s4946">Then I was again thinking what shall I do?</span> <span id="s4947">I had recuperated.</span> <span id="s4948">I felt well but I just didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s4949">Then I met the same Schatz about whom I told you.</span> <span id="s4950">He first had been my teacher and then he was my neighbor.</span> <span id="s4951">He saw that I survived and he was so happy to see me.</span> <span id="s4952">I told him now that I am even worse off than I had been before.</span> <span id="s4953">Now I had nobody!</span> <span id="s4954">By that time my brother was already in the army.</span> <span id="s4955">It was already September or October.</span> <span id="s4956">Anyway, it was fall.</span> <span id="s4957">It was around the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s4958">He told me, “Listen.</span> <span id="s4959">You are a child anyhow.</span> <span id="s4960">In spite of all, you are still a child.</span> <span id="s4961">Forget these three years which you lost and go back to school.”</span> <span id="s4962">I really wanted to do that since another friend of mine, she had her father and mother in the woods, they all survived, was going to school in Wilaika.</span> <span id="s4963">I was so envious!</span> <span id="s4964">She goes to school and I can’t go to school I thought.</span> <span id="s4965">How can I go to school?</span> <span id="s4966">Who will give me the proper food?</span> <span id="s4967">I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s4968">So he said, “You know in Pskov, there is a school for teachers.</span> <span id="s4969">They are just now accepting students.</span> <span id="s4970">The head of the school is a fellow by the name of Ischkin.”</span> <span id="s4971">I answered.</span> <span id="s4972">“The same Ischkin who was the principal of our high school?”</span> <span id="s4973">he said, “Yes, the same Ischkin.”</span> <span id="s4974">He came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s4975">When the war started he was from 1939 to 1941 the principal of our high school in Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s4976">Then in 1941, when the Germans invaded, he took his wife and children into Russia.</span> <span id="s4977">They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s4978">He had come from Russia and then they went back to Russia.</span> <span id="s4979">Schatz told me, “Ischkin came back.</span> <span id="s4980">His wife didn’t.</span> <span id="s4981">He is alone with the two children.”</span> <span id="s4982">He is now the head of that school for teachers.</span> <span id="s4983">It is a three years teacher seminary.</span> <span id="s4984">That seminary prepared you only to teach the first four grades.</span> <span id="s4985">That is how I got involved with Pskov.</span> <span id="s4986">So it came to my mind that what do you have, nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s4987">If you go to work as a secretary someplace.</span> <span id="s4988">You earn 200 rubles.</span> <span id="s4989">If you go to school you make 100 rubles.</span> <span id="s4990">You see, they actually pay you while you go to school.”</span> <span id="s4991">Schatz added, “As Ischkin is the head of the school he will do something for you which no one else could do.”</span> <span id="s4992">So I packed my things and I told my friends I am going to Pskov and I am going to apply for the school.</span> <span id="s4993">I wrote a letter to Ischkin right away.</span> <span id="s4994">I told him that I was from Kurzeniez and this and this, of course, he would not remember me of course.</span> <span id="s4995">After all he couldn’t possibly know all the children in his high school.</span> <span id="s4996">I told him that I survived and that my ambition is to further my education and to become something.</span> <span id="s4997">I received a letter back before I had even time to think about it.</span> <span id="s4998">The letter told me that it was still time to apply for enrollment even though the school was already open because it was already October, and cool, really cool I again took the couple of things which I had and I went to Pskov.</span> <span id="s4999">I went by train but then I found out that the trains didn’t run.</span> <span id="s5000">Finally I caught a train and I had to sit on top of the caboose and I got very dirty.</span> <span id="s5001">I first came to Kralerseina.</span> <span id="s5002">From there I took a real train (probably meaning passenger train) and from there on to Pskov.</span> <span id="s5003">It was not easy to travel in Russia at the time.</span> <span id="s5004">It was still during the war.</span> <span id="s5005">People were traveling all over.</span> <span id="s5006">The trains were full with people from Russia who came to look to buy grain, or to buy anything else (the German army had lived off the land in Russia for two years or more and then practiced a “scorched earth policy” before finally collapsing into a route).</span> <span id="s5007">All of the Russian people came.</span> <span id="s5008">You see these Russian people were very poor.</span> <span id="s5009">A lot of the army people traveled.</span> <span id="s5010">So the trains were overcrowded.</span> <span id="s5011">You had to run to see if you could get on the train.</span> <span id="s5012">Whoever came first got in.</span> <span id="s5013">The other didn’t!</span> <span id="s5014">I got to Pskov.</span> <span id="s5015">In Pskov I came to Abe’s aunt who was living in the same place with his mother in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s5016">Q: Did you know Abe’s family from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s5017">A: I knew them from the woods.</span> <span id="s5018">As a matter of fact, I had stayed with them.</span> <span id="s5019">As a matter of fact, I had stayed with his aunt for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s5020">She took me into her bunker.</span> <span id="s5021">So, when I got to Pskov, I went to see her and I remained with her for a few weeks, and I went to school.</span> <span id="s5022">By the way, I got accepted in the school right away.</span> <span id="s5023">Ischkin told me then that there is a place in the dorm.</span> <span id="s5024">First, I had a friend from Kurzeniez who had not been in the woods.</span> <span id="s5025">She had been somewhere else from where she came back.</span> <span id="s5026">She had married a fellow from Pskov.</span> <span id="s5027">She asked me to stay with her.</span> <span id="s5028">I told her we will see.</span> <span id="s5029">Then in Pskov I had a boy friend from the forest.</span> <span id="s5030">I had met the boy.</span> <span id="s5031">We kind of fell in love.</span> <span id="s5032">We didn’t see each other often.</span> <span id="s5033">However we dreamed!</span> <span id="s5034">It was our wish that we would get to meet someday.</span> <span id="s5035">As a matter of fact, when I got to school he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s5036">He was stationed in Pskov.</span> <span id="s5037">So he tried to find an apartment for me.</span> <span id="s5038">Instead of the dorm.</span> <span id="s5039">However, I was the kind of girl who also got concerned what someone else would think.</span> <span id="s5040">(During the above telling, Abe intervened with some gentle teasing of Rachel which she completely ignored).</span> <span id="s5041">He would have to pay my rent since I had no money to pay rent.</span> <span id="s5042">So, he would pay the rent for my apartment and he would come to see me.</span> <span id="s5043">I felt that I was getting involved too much.</span> <span id="s5044">So I said ‘No!!”</span> <span id="s5045">Of course, I went to see the apartment.</span> <span id="s5046">It was a nice apartment not far from the school.</span> <span id="s5047">Anyhow, I decided to continue living in the dorm.</span> <span id="s5048">As long as Ischkin was director of that school he made sure in the school restaurant that I would not have to pay for my food.</span> <span id="s5049">That was for three meals a day, including breakfast if I got up in time.</span> <span id="s5050">If not, then starting with lunch.</span> <span id="s5051">I was a very good student.</span> <span id="s5052">For straight A students, you were given an extra stipend of twenty rubles.</span> <span id="s5053">So I got 120 rubles and I had no way to spend it.</span> <span id="s5054">Just about all the food was free and I didn’t have to pay for the dormitory.</span> <span id="s5055">It was very very cold in the dormitory.</span> <span id="s5056">All we could do on Sunday was to go into the forest to cut wood.</span> <span id="s5057">That is what all the students did.</span> <span id="s5058">We brought the wood back to the school.</span> <span id="s5059">That is how we kept warm in the dorm.</span> <span id="s5060">It was a bad winter that winter of 1944 -- 1945.</span> <span id="s5061">So in school I did normal studying and led a normal life.</span> <span id="s5062">However, it was still lonely.</span> <span id="s5063">It was even lonelier because it was a strange town.</span> <span id="s5064">I had nobody.</span> <span id="s5065">A short time later, my supposed boyfriend, he was transferred back to Wilaika.</span> <span id="s5066">Now, he was closer to Kurzeniez but that didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s5067">At least he had supported me morally and now he was gone.</span> <span id="s5068">I really wanted to study.</span> <span id="s5069">It was the thing I really wanted to do so that I could see what might become of me.</span> <span id="s5070">In 1945, Ischkin days ended.</span> <span id="s5071">They didn’t send him away but someone else who had been an army man got out of the army.</span> <span id="s5072">So they officially made this new guy the principal of that school.</span> <span id="s5073">He was really a nobody.</span> <span id="s5074">A nothing!</span> <span id="s5075">He wasn’t even a good teacher.</span> <span id="s5076">He taught us geography.</span> <span id="s5077">Once, he called on me to give a report on geography.</span> <span id="s5078">I started with Suez.</span> <span id="s5079">I talked for an hour and I could tell that he himself didn’t know what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s5080">He got the job because he had been in the army and that gave him something to do.</span> <span id="s5081">Ischkin had been a good principal truly.</span> <span id="s5082">He was a historian, so he taught history.</span> <span id="s5083">At that time we had no books.</span> <span id="s5084">We had to make notes on whatever the teachers told us.</span> <span id="s5085">Then I got very sick.</span> <span id="s5086">They didn’t think that I could make it because I was so weak.</span> <span id="s5087">You see, after I got typhus, I needed food, nourishment and I did not get it.</span> <span id="s5088">I just got plain bread and potatoes.</span> <span id="s5089">So, I got weaker and I got a virus.</span> <span id="s5090">It affected my eyes.</span> <span id="s5091">I went to a doctor.</span> <span id="s5092">She gave me some ointment but it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s5093">The infection went into my eyes and my face broke out.</span> <span id="s5094">My Russian teacher’s daughter was a doctor.</span> <span id="s5095">She was in charge of the hospital.</span> <span id="s5096">This teacher talked to her daughter, “There is this student of mine, this poor Jewish girl, she is very sick.”</span> <span id="s5097">Then she told her about the symptoms.</span> <span id="s5098">So the daughter said, “She needs nourishment.</span> <span id="s5099">She needs good food.</span> <span id="s5100">Something including fat such as milk, cheese, eggs, poultry.”</span> <span id="s5101">So Ischkin offered me because it was so cold in the dorm, his home.</span> <span id="s5102">So that I could stay with them.</span> <span id="s5103">With the entire family.</span> <span id="s5104">That meant his mother and his brother and to sisters.</span> <span id="s5105">So I stayed with them in their house and they gave me some food.</span> <span id="s5106">However, they were poor themselves.</span> <span id="s5107">Whenever they had food I went out since I didn’t want to take some of the meager resources for me.</span> <span id="s5108">Anyway, when I didn’t eat, the daughter of my teacher told her mother.</span> <span id="s5109">Send the child to me and to the hospital.</span> <span id="s5110">I couldn’t see so I covered my eyes and learned what was being taught just by listening.</span> <span id="s5111">But then the friend whose father had made my shoes, she also came there to go to school.</span> <span id="s5112">She took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s5113">On the way to the hospital, it was a very cold winter, I fainted.</span> <span id="s5114">I felt so bad!!</span> <span id="s5115">I told my friend I don’t want to die in the house of these people.</span> <span id="s5116">Whatever you do take me back.</span> <span id="s5117">A friend of ours, she stayed with a Jewish family, she told them about me.</span> <span id="s5118">That family had no children so they took me in and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s5119">His mother came and put on “banchas” (hot cups) on my back (WS assisted Abe and RF in identifying this fairly ancient way of treating inflammations) I was very sick and they fed me well including honey.</span> <span id="s5120">I had truly felt that I was going to die.</span> <span id="s5121">That this would be the end of me.</span> <span id="s5122">So, I said that I wanted to die in a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s5123">I didn’t want to die in a non-Jewish home.</span> <span id="s5124">So I stayed there for a long time.</span> <span id="s5125">I missed school for several weeks.</span> <span id="s5126">My friend went to school regularly and brought all her notes home and I could study at the home of these people.</span> <span id="s5127">By then it was already March.</span> <span id="s5128">I received a package.</span> <span id="s5129">At that time the war was already being fought in Germany.</span> <span id="s5130">It was a beautiful package which my sister sent me.</span> <span id="s5131">She was with the army.</span> <span id="s5132">I went to the marketplace and I sold everything and I bought cheese and eggs and sour cream etc.</span> <span id="s5133">That was truly like medicine and I returned to normal.</span> <span id="s5134">My face cleared.</span> <span id="s5135">My eyes got clear.</span> <span id="s5136">I was just like brand new, like with a new skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s5137">Q: Was that March of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s5138">A: Yes, March of 1945.</span> <span id="s5139">I went to school during that winter except for the few weeks when I had to stay home.</span> <span id="s5140">They were afraid that I would catch pneumonia.</span> <span id="s5141">So they made me stay home.</span> <span id="s5142">My whole system weakened because I had typhus in October.</span> <span id="s5143">So you see it took me a very long time to get strength back and to recuperate.</span> <span id="s5144">It was not a pleasant time.</span> <span id="s5145">However I still was free.</span> <span id="s5146">My sister had been with the army in Czechoslovakia and Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s5147">She was in that direction.</span> <span id="s5148">Every army unit followed a different route.</span> <span id="s5149">My brother was in the middle of Germany.</span> <span id="s5150">She got into southern Germany.</span> <span id="s5151">After the war, she asked the army to release her.</span> <span id="s5152">She said that she wanted to go back home.</span> <span id="s5153">So she got discharged and came home.</span> <span id="s5154">She got home to Kurzeniez and I went there also during the summer of 1945, vacation time.</span> <span id="s5155">I went there and we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s5156">Q: You hadn’t seen her for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s5157">A: Yes, four years.</span> <span id="s5158">That is right.</span> <span id="s5159">In 1941, she went with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s5160">Q: How much older is she than you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s5161">A: Five years.</span> <span id="s5162">So we decided that there was nothing for us to stay for in Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s5163">Possibly there was something in Pskov.</span> <span id="s5164">That was a much bigger town.</span> <span id="s5165">She went there with me.</span> <span id="s5166">She had brought something with her.</span> <span id="s5167">Not much!</span> <span id="s5168">She brought some beautiful things with her but they stole it from her in Minsk on the train.</span> <span id="s5169">She gave her luggage to another girl from the army.</span> <span id="s5170">The other girl picked it up.</span> <span id="s5171">The other girl was on the train whereas my sister was on the lower step.</span> <span id="s5172">My sister lifted the big heavy suitcase up to the platform but instead of her friend picking it up, somebody else did.</span> <span id="s5173">It was dark.</span> <span id="s5174">A lot of army people were traveling.</span> <span id="s5175">So they stole the best things which she had been able to pick up to bring home.</span> <span id="s5176">The girls felt very bad about losing all of that.</span> <span id="s5177">So I said we have gotten rid of a lot of things over the time so this is nothing.</span> <span id="s5178">If we will live, we will have things later on.</span> <span id="s5179">I will finish school and we will both work so that we will make it.</span> <span id="s5180">That is how we two started out in Pskov.</span> <span id="s5181">She got a job although it was not all that easy to get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s5182">Q: How long did you stay in Pskov then?</span></p> <p><span id="s5183">A: Until May second of 1946.</span> <span id="s5184">Then we left.</span> <span id="s5185">We took a train to go to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s5186">Q: Were you working the whole time then or were you going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s5187">A: Yes, I went to school.</span> <span id="s5188">That second year I worked part time and went to school at night.</span> <span id="s5189">By then I had decided not to become a teacher since as a teacher I would be sent to a village because I was just learning to teach the first four grades.</span> <span id="s5190">So I decided to get out of that and I saw an announcement about an application for a dental school in Minsk.</span> <span id="s5191">When I got to Minsk, remember it wasn’t easy to travel, it was still during the war, it was too late so my applications was not accepted.</span> <span id="s5192">They promised me that if I continue school they will give me credits and next year I will be accepted.</span> <span id="s5193">That next year mine would be amongst the first of the applications.</span> <span id="s5194">I said, “Next year?</span> <span id="s5195">To hell with them and to hell with the school.</span> <span id="s5196">I better go out to the free world.’</span> <span id="s5197">After all we were free!</span> <span id="s5198">It was not as good in Poland as it had been but Poland was still a democratic country.</span> <span id="s5199">So, we went back to Poland (Pskov and Minsk are located in USSR) but that wasn’t free either since the government was communistic.</span> <span id="s5200">However we had agreed to go to Palestine by then.</span> <span id="s5201">It had gotten to be our dream.</span> <span id="s5202">I had already met Abe and we had decided to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s5203">Q: When did you meet Abe?</span></p> <p><span id="s5204">A: I met him in Pskov in 1945.</span> <span id="s5205">I went home for Christmas vacations.</span> <span id="s5206">You see, the Christmas vacations were two weeks.</span> <span id="s5207">Actually, in Russia, there is no Christmas.</span> <span id="s5208">It is the New Year’s vacation.</span> <span id="s5209">So I went back to Kurzeniez to be with my friends.</span> <span id="s5210">I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s5211">At that time Abe came back.</span> <span id="s5212">He came home to his mother.</span> <span id="s5213">In 1945, when I came back from my vacation, we met.</span> <span id="s5214">In May 1946, when we left Russia, we got married in that same month.</span> <span id="s5215">We left Russia together and got married in Poland.</span> <span id="s5216">We had the ceremony in Poland although we knew that we would not stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s5217">I got the things which I had and I sold what I could and made a small wedding.</span> <span id="s5218">We got married there and we got on our way to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s5219">Q: You didn’t get married in Pskov?</span></p> <p><span id="s5220">A: No.</span> <span id="s5221">You see, that was the time of the festival of Passover.</span> <span id="s5222">Between Passover and the holiday of Shavu’ot (consecration of the Torah) for six weeks we are not allowed to have any weddings except for one day and that is a holiday also, although a minor holiday.</span> <span id="s5223">On that minor holiday we got married.</span> <span id="s5224">On that day there is a specific time to get married that is prior to sundown.</span> <span id="s5225">After sundown the interval is over.</span> <span id="s5226">So, two of us couples got married on that day.</span> <span id="s5227">A second cousin of Abe’s and the Kurzeniez girl friend of mine.</span> <span id="s5228">We got married in Seczecin (former German city of Stettin which is now a Polish city).</span> <span id="s5229">A week later we went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s5230">We paid for a taxi to take us to Berlin (later she refers to a truck in which they hid).</span></p> <p><span id="s5231">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s5232">The taxi took us to Berlin.</span> <span id="s5233">We stayed in West Berlin for a few months.</span> <span id="s5234">In Berlin we registered to go as German Jews to a different camp.</span> <span id="s5235">It was not a camp like the concentration camps were but it was a DP (displaced person) camp in Eschweiler(or something like that).</span> <span id="s5236">It was in the English zone.</span> <span id="s5237">They transported us to the English zone by going through the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s5238">We were told not to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s5239">Not to speak any of it.</span> <span id="s5240">As a matter of fact, I was so afraid that I took all the pictures which my sister had brought back including some of her in the army.</span> <span id="s5241">They had told us to throw everything connected to Russia away especially things connected to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s5242">I kept only one picture of my brother as a soldier.</span> <span id="s5243">I folded it and I put it in my shoe.</span> <span id="s5244">I had never told him about that so when he came and asked me how do you have this picture, why is it cut?</span> <span id="s5245">I told him that it just got worn through and broken.</span> <span id="s5246">I had it restored.</span> <span id="s5247">This is how we got to Eschweiler.</span> <span id="s5248">That is actually a big town.</span> <span id="s5249">We stayed there through the summer.</span> <span id="s5250">In the fall we got a telegram that Abe’s sister was already in Germany.</span> <span id="s5251">My sister was also in Germany.</span> <span id="s5252">You see when my sister came back she got married and they also left for Poland.</span> <span id="s5253">They were in a different place in Poland and from there they went to a different place in Germany.</span> <span id="s5254">They were in Ulm in a beautiful place in a farm.</span> <span id="s5255">The farm was like a kibbutz (communal) village of the type used for Jewish settlements in Israel.</span> <span id="s5256">In 1946 we stayed in Hanover.</span> <span id="s5257">That is right!</span> <span id="s5258">Then we stayed in Eschweiler for a while and then we got to Bad Rausingen, close to Ulm.</span> <span id="s5259">Actually between Stuttgart and Ulm.</span> <span id="s5260">From there we went to the big city where they had the Denazification trials that was Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s5261">There Abe went to see his cousin and I went to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s5262">I wanted to see where the trials took place and also where the infamous anti-Jewish laws were proclaimed.</span> <span id="s5263">I also went to the Nuremberg Opera House.</span> <span id="s5264">It was a very beautiful and very historic.</span> <span id="s5265">We stayed in Germany for almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s5266">(Later on added references are made to a DP camp of something like Esche (?)</span> <span id="s5267">Such a city could truly be in the U.S. zone.</span> <span id="s5268">I opt for this as the answer [note by transcriber].</span></p> <p><span id="s5269">There is a city of Eschweiler located in the British occupation zone of West Germany.</span> <span id="s5270">That may possibly be the city in question although it is not at Hanover.</span> <span id="s5271">But that does not appear to be the camp which supposedly was in the U.S. zone).</span></p> <p><span id="s5272">A: Those two years lasted until late 1948.</span> <span id="s5273">I had my first child in May 1948.</span> <span id="s5274">I was teaching school in Germany.</span> <span id="s5275">That was Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s5276">In Nov 1948, my baby was then six months old.</span> <span id="s5277">Of course, the war in Israel was still going on, of course.</span> <span id="s5278">Israel had been established in May 1948 when I had my baby.</span> <span id="s5279">When we arrived in Israel life was hard.</span> <span id="s5280">Upon arrival they assigned us to a camp after landing in Haifa from our boat.</span> <span id="s5281">Right after arrival they assigned people to different places.</span> <span id="s5282">Where to settle in Ramla (that is a city immediately south, about three miles from Ben Gurion airport and the city of Lod).</span> <span id="s5283">When we got there the Arabs had just been driven out.</span> <span id="s5284">You could even still find some bodies which were still warm.</span> <span id="s5285">(Ramla is also about ten miles southeast of Tel Aviv).</span> <span id="s5286">We were afraid to go in or out.</span> <span id="s5287">Many people were wounded.</span> <span id="s5288">Everything was scattered all over.</span> <span id="s5289">It was just terrible to stay there.</span> <span id="s5290">We stayed there however, and decided to work in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s5291">We really didn’t want to stay there.</span> <span id="s5292">We couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s5293">It was difficult to adjust.</span></p> <p><span id="s5294">Q: Were some of the Arabs still around at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s5295">A: Not where we were.</span> <span id="s5296">They were in Jaffa (the older and Arab portion of Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s5297">Both cities are incorporated as one).</span> <span id="s5298">We went to Tel Aviv but Tel Aviv and Jaffa are one and the same.</span> <span id="s5299">They raised the Moslem flag in Jaffa, but most of the Arabs had fled before we got there.</span> <span id="s5300">Whoever had not fled before we got there stayed in their homes and they stayed quietly and lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s5301">Q: How long did you live in the state of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s5302">A: Oh we lived there for ten years from 1948 to 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s5303">Q: Did you come directly to Dayton at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s5304">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s5305">Actually we came by boat to N.Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s5306">Q: Did you know somebody in Dayton to make the connections to this city?</span></p> <p><span id="s5307">A: Abe’s sister.</span> <span id="s5308">That is why we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s5309">Q: Listening to the tape of two weeks ago, a short question occurred to me.</span> <span id="s5310">The man who replaced Mr. Ischkin as leader of your teacher’s school in Pskov, was he also Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s5311">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s5312">Q: Ischkin was Jewish, but some other teachers were Jewish also?</span></p> <p><span id="s5313">A: There were two other teachers who had been sent from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s5314">Q: The school operated under the Russian system?</span></p> <p><span id="s5315">A: Oh yes, on Russian territory and operating under the Russian system.</span> <span id="s5316">Pskov was in the old Polish territory which was taken over by Russia at the end of WWII.</span> <span id="s5317">This long time.</span> <span id="s5318">It had been German just for a little while (actually that border was moved back and forth in 1559, 1648, 1714, 1763, 1772, 1793, 1834, 1871, 1914, 1919, etc. so you couldn’t talk about well determined nationality).</span></p> <p><span id="s5319">Q: This was the fall of 1944 and what I was wondering about was: Ischkin was the head of a school!</span> <span id="s5320">Were there a lot of Jews who had jobs in education at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s5321">A: Yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s5322">At that time, a lot of doctors and people with the best qualifications were from deep in Russia because for a lot of the locals the Russian language was not their native tongue.</span> <span id="s5323">We didn’t have time to educate the teachers in Russian then.</span> <span id="s5324">However, in 1944 -- 1945 we felt that we were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s5325">Q: Different from the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s5326">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5327">We had always said that we were the Westerners as compared to Russia.</span> <span id="s5328">The White Russians were Westerners to the rest of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s5329">Q: I was wondering whether there had been a lot of Jews in the teaching profession and why they were replaced.</span> <span id="s5330">I gather that the replacement was not made because they were Jewish but because of the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s5331">A: No, this fellow got the job because he came back from the army and he had been wounded in the army.</span> <span id="s5332">He was like a hero.</span> <span id="s5333">He was not at all that bad but he was not as good as Ischkin.</span> <span id="s5334">Ischkin had been very good at his job, however, someone decided to make the replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s5335">Q: Did the Russian army have the choice as to who did what job?</span></p> <p><span id="s5336">A: No!</span> <span id="s5337">It had nothing to do with the army.</span> <span id="s5338">At that time we did not complain because the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s5339">He had been wounded in the army and he was discharged so they had to give him a job.</span> <span id="s5340">The real Russians liked to have a job in that part of the country.</span> <span id="s5341">There were more things available in our region.</span></p> <p><span id="s5342">Q: Another thing which I want to come back to: I didn’t hear any mention of anti-Jewish persecutions or pogroms or anything like that at that time at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s5343">A: You see the Russians had an anti-Jewish policy.</span> <span id="s5344">However, it wasn’t all that evident.</span> <span id="s5345">They would tell it in a joke imitating the way Jews talked.</span> <span id="s5346">For example, in 1939 when the Russians came over to our side of Poland and they took over, that was the time when my father had just died and we had a lot of worries.</span> <span id="s5347">They requisitioned rooms in our homes for soldiers.</span> <span id="s5348">One man, he was Jewish who was in the army, told my mother, “Wait and see what they will do to you yet.</span> <span id="s5349">They will analyze every human being and see what everyone is doing.</span> <span id="s5350">It won’t be all that easy.”</span> <span id="s5351">We didn’t think about that.</span> <span id="s5352">We were children and it was fine until the Germans came and we were happy.</span> <span id="s5353">We still much rather have had the Russians than the Germans.</span> <span id="s5354">Then in 1941, one good thing which they did that we Jews should never forget, they opened the door for anybody who wanted to come -- not like Americans who did not let in refugees -- including all the refugees who came from the western side of Poland who left for our part because they were being overrun by the Germans.</span> <span id="s5355">They gathered them.</span> <span id="s5356">As a matter of fact, we had some of them in our home.</span> <span id="s5357">A couple who were refugees.</span> <span id="s5358">It was in September 1939, the beginning of a cold winter.</span> <span id="s5359">In one place and I strongly believe this but I couldn’t swear to it, that place was one of the three synagogues and they plainly told the refugees, “Let us know where you want to go because we have to get you settled someplace.”</span> <span id="s5360">They were human beings who came even from Vilna and other parts of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s5361">They were afraid even at that time that the Germans would be coming so they ran away.</span> <span id="s5362">A lot of these refugees said they would be wanting to go back so that they would not make good citizens.</span> <span id="s5363">So they sent them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s5364">Siberia was considered to be a punishment (however it turned out to be a clear haven from the Nazis).</span> <span id="s5365">Two people from Vilna wound up in Siberia because of that they wanted to go back to Vilna as soon as it was settled.</span> <span id="s5366">Of course, eventually the Russians took over all of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s5367">So then later on, they were transported back home.</span> <span id="s5368">However, in the meantime they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s5369">Let’s not forget that these people are alive.</span> <span id="s5370">All of this could happen because we were under Russian regime for almost two years.</span> <span id="s5371">So it was much better for them.</span> <span id="s5372">Then, in 1941, when the Germans started the war by invading the Russian territory, my sister, she left us to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s5373">Even my mother and I wanted to go but we couldn’t because we waited for my brother to come back from school.</span> <span id="s5374">A lot of Jews left in June 1941.</span> <span id="s5375">A lot of Jews just packed up and whoever could get a horse and buggy left.</span> <span id="s5376">They left just like typical refugees.</span> <span id="s5377">They all survived the war and they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s5378">Q: They went pretty far east?</span></p> <p><span id="s5379">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5380">Even half of European Russia was taken over by the Germans but the Russians took all the refugees.</span> <span id="s5381">I have a friend of mine, here in Dayton, Mr. Schmeller, he is a Polish Jew and they ran away from Poland until they got to Russia.</span> <span id="s5382">He was really in an equivalent of a prison.</span> <span id="s5383">He went through a lot.</span> <span id="s5384">He went though not working because he had been an anti-communist before the German invasion.</span> <span id="s5385">However, in 1943, all the political prisoners were freed.</span> <span id="s5386">One thing they didn’t do to him, they didn’t draft him.</span> <span id="s5387">Jews or non-Jews were taken normally into the army.</span> <span id="s5388">All the young men went to fight for Russia during the war.</span> <span id="s5389">The Russians allowed everybody and really because of that a lot of Jews are alive.</span> <span id="s5390">Entire families survived the war and came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s5391">This was a very good deed which the Russians did for us Jews.</span> <span id="s5392">What was said about anti-Semitism, you could feel it because in the summer of 1945 my sister came back home from the army.</span> <span id="s5393">She had served in it for four years.</span> <span id="s5394">When she came back she got discharged.</span> <span id="s5395">Another woman who was in the army in charge of a group and had joined the party said, “That if you are in the army for so many years and come back with all the medals and you wouldn’t be a Jew it would be easy to get a job.”</span> <span id="s5396">We already felt this anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s5397">Q: It got worse after 1944 didn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s5398">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5399">You see, it is not like what they say now.</span> <span id="s5400">Although we don’t know what really goes on but we felt that.</span> <span id="s5401">As a matter of fact, I was young.</span> <span id="s5402">I was in school when a Jewish Soviet officer brought his family to Pskov to live.</span> <span id="s5403">I talked to them, about us western Jews, because prior to the war we lived in Poland, about the fact that we could leave the country.</span> <span id="s5404">We had a right to apply to leave.</span> <span id="s5405">In Russia normally you can’t leave just when you want to leave.</span> <span id="s5406">You can’t go any place you wish anyway.</span> <span id="s5407">You can move in Russia freely but you can’t leave the country.</span> <span id="s5408">We had been told that for the next six month whoever want to leave Russia, all the Polish Jews and non-Jews whoever; they can leave.</span> <span id="s5409">Having been Polish we could leave Russia if we wanted to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s5410">That was a rule which started in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s5411">Q: For a period of six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s5412">A: Yes, it was for a time and two years later they allowed it again but not for so long.</span> <span id="s5413">You had just a specific time to apply.</span> <span id="s5414">At that time, my friend who was a Russian sad, “I envy you for that, so that you can leave.”</span> <span id="s5415">And he added, “Go, go.</span> <span id="s5416">You are young.</span> <span id="s5417">Leave your school.</span> <span id="s5418">There is nothing for you here!!</span> <span id="s5419">Go to the free world.”</span></p> <p><span id="s5420">Q: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s5421">A: Because he had seen things.</span> <span id="s5422">He was in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s5423">He had been in Poland and Germany.</span> <span id="s5424">He saw that there is a different life elsewhere.</span> <span id="s5425">He was just as cooped up in a little cage.</span> <span id="s5426">As big as Russia is, we could travel.</span> <span id="s5427">Of course, I couldn’t because I didn’t have the money to go nor did I have any place I wanted to go to.</span> <span id="s5428">But for him he was already in Russia for seven years.</span> <span id="s5429">They couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s5430">So he repeated, “Now that you have the opportunity -- leave!!”</span></p> <p><span id="s5431">Q: When did you get the idea to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s5432">Was that always in the back of your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s5433">A: When the war was going on, no matter how bad we had it, my mind was being built up already and I felt that there was no place like going back there although at that time, there was no Jewish state.</span> <span id="s5434">It was Palestine.</span> <span id="s5435">We knew that somehow that is how we had been brought up.</span> <span id="s5436">There was a hope that someday there would also be a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s5437">Someday there would be a place to live.</span> <span id="s5438">At that time, when I was really young and went to Hebrew school, we knew one thing, “There is our home.”</span> <span id="s5439">Even though it was not a country yet.</span> <span id="s5440">During the time of the German occupation, we always hoped that if we lived we would go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s5441">Q: Was it just a religious idea or was it also a political idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s5442">A: It was our idea but we really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s5443">It is not really a religious idea.</span> <span id="s5444">It really has nothing to do with the religion.</span> <span id="s5445">It is something to do with Zionism.</span></p> <p><span id="s5446">Q: Was it organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s5447">A: Yes it was organized.</span> <span id="s5448">I did not belong to any organization because I was too young.</span> <span id="s5449">They had Zionist organizations in every small and every big town.</span> <span id="s5450">All over Europe.</span> <span id="s5451">They usually had the Mapai, which is the party of Begin now, and there was socialism like the labor group now.</span> <span id="s5452">We called Begin’s group “Ha Lou Ziv -- Pioneer.”</span> <span id="s5453">The object was to go to Israel and to build Israel and drain the swamps.</span> <span id="s5454">Even if there was no party.</span> <span id="s5455">My cousin couldn’t go because of her health.</span> <span id="s5456">But these pioneers they were being organized everywhere.</span> <span id="s5457">Their objective was to get the money needed and send a young man or young girl to Israel.</span> <span id="s5458">They took them to whatever places they were needed.</span> <span id="s5459">It might be a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s5460">It was idealistic.</span> <span id="s5461">It was not just that they had to.</span> <span id="s5462">As a matter of fact, they didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s5463">This is really what Zionism is all about.</span> <span id="s5464">“A dream which will come true.”</span> <span id="s5465">Even my father, whom I knew only as a child, I remember telling that he was in so many places, in so many countries while he was young but he had never been to Palestine.</span> <span id="s5466">He used to say that he hoped to send one of his children to Israel.</span> <span id="s5467">He hoped to send my older sister perhaps to Israel.</span> <span id="s5468">That never happened.</span> <span id="s5469">However, she is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s5470">Of course, when the war started in 1939, every endeavor to send anyone to Israel or Palestine had to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s5471">Q: The Russians were against all religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s5472">A: Yes, I guess so.</span> <span id="s5473">For example, if you joined the Cominsul, which is the Communist youth movement, you have to swear that you don’t believe in “G-d”.</span> <span id="s5474">that all you believe in is the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s5475">Q: Were there Jews in the Cominsul?</span></p> <p><span id="s5476">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s5477">I had to join it.</span> <span id="s5478">I had to be a pioneer which is the first step.</span> <span id="s5479">When I was ten or twelve years old.</span> <span id="s5480">Then when I was older the war was there.</span> <span id="s5481">I was actually not forced but I was told that it is a shame not to be in the party.</span> <span id="s5482">You see, if you want to get ahead you have to do whatever they say that you have to do.</span> <span id="s5483">But when I got back from the woods that was it and I had nothing to do so I left.</span> <span id="s5484">They asked me why I left so I told that I only want to go to the west.</span> <span id="s5485">That I had lost nothing there and that I just want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s5486">Q: Let me back up if I may.</span> <span id="s5487">I hate to reopen this question but some of these points are not clear.</span> <span id="s5488">Your mother was killed in 1943, then you finally came back to Kurzeniez in 1945.</span> <span id="s5489">Was it at that time that you went looking for her body in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s5490">A: No!</span> <span id="s5491">I brought her back but that is a long story.</span> <span id="s5492">In the Jewish tradition, a person who is killed has to be buried in a separate place.</span> <span id="s5493">That applies also to persons who commits suicide.</span> <span id="s5494">They are not to be side by side with the rest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s5495">Actually, when I got back to Kurzeniez they hadn’t even had the chance to put a stone up for my father so I could not find his grave.</span> <span id="s5496">But, anyway, I was not supposed to bury her in the same area.</span> <span id="s5497">So I did the best I could.</span> <span id="s5498">Nobody was there who could help me.</span> <span id="s5499">My sister was already back home from the army.</span> <span id="s5500">But at first she couldn’t break away from what she was doing.</span> <span id="s5501">Later, she felt that she hadn’t helped.</span> <span id="s5502">She had a job so she couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s5503">The husband of the woman who was killed with my mother in the same location, he went with me.</span> <span id="s5504">We hired help from the area of Margi, from Kurzeniez, but we got two people to help us from Margi.</span> <span id="s5505">You see, we couldn’t do it in one day.</span> <span id="s5506">We had to stay overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s5507">Q: Were there a lot of people at the funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s5508">A; There were not too many.</span> <span id="s5509">A lot of people had left for Poland of those who survived.</span> <span id="s5510">I also knew that I had signed up to leave for Poland and, of course, I knew that I would never come back.</span> <span id="s5511">In my mind I had always said, and I really meant it, when she was killed, if I will survive and I ever get back home, the first thing I will do is to give my mother a proper burial.</span> <span id="s5512">I couldn’t do it then of course, since at first it was not really safe to go back there.</span> <span id="s5513">So, I waited.</span> <span id="s5514">One winter went by, then during the second winter, it was actually in March 1946 but there was still ice.</span> <span id="s5515">I knew that I was going to leave from Poland before May.</span> <span id="s5516">So we went from Kurzeniez to Margi with a horse and buggy and the caskets.</span> <span id="s5517">They helped us but I did a lot with my own hands.</span> <span id="s5518">That is what I did for my mother so that she could rest in peace where she should be rather than in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s5519">Q: Millions of people were not that fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s5520">A: Yes, nothing could be done for many Jews who were killed in the forest.</span> <span id="s5521">Nobody even knows who lies where.</span> <span id="s5522">For me, that was a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s5523">Q: I wanted to catch clearly on the tape when you were able to do that.</span> <span id="s5524">Another question which I had was that you met Abe’s aunt in the woods.</span> <span id="s5525">You had already visited with her in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s5526">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s5527">I had met Abe’s aunt and his mother and his sisters.</span> <span id="s5528">They were all together in the woods.</span> <span id="s5529">You know the woods were very extensive.</span> <span id="s5530">It wasn’t like a little forest as we have here.</span> <span id="s5531">The woods occupy an area which altogether is bigger than the entire Dayton area.</span> <span id="s5532">There is a very big forest with little villages in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s5533">Q: Did people stay more or less in the same area all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s5534">A: The people often traveled because of the blockade (obviously RF is not referring to the natives of the villages who, as was described earlier build homes, including saunas, farmed and elected (?)</span> <span id="s5535">mayors).</span> <span id="s5536">They tried to stay in groups and move by groups.</span> <span id="s5537">Like for example, Abe’s mother remained with the same group.</span> <span id="s5538">She had something like a bunker together with her family.</span> <span id="s5539">She had help.</span> <span id="s5540">One daughter had a boyfriend who helped them.</span> <span id="s5541">She also had cousins who were with the partisans and came and brought food.</span> <span id="s5542">However, I had no relations.</span> <span id="s5543">After my mother got killed until my brother and I got together, so I traveled any which way I could.</span> <span id="s5544">However, none of us stayed in one place.</span> <span id="s5545">Families also stayed together whenever they could.</span> <span id="s5546">Two families, for example, stayed together and built a bunker together.</span></p> <p><span id="s5547">Q: Did it ever happen that a group of people stayed together the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s5548">A; Yes!</span> <span id="s5549">It happened that they stayed together without even being partisans.</span> <span id="s5550">Nobody had to be a partisan.</span> <span id="s5551">Most of the men, the young men especially, they wanted to do something.</span> <span id="s5552">They thought that even if they can’t kill a German, at least they can harm somebody who works for them or disturb the German army.</span> <span id="s5553">I am certain that you remember the group which I called the supply group which made things for the partisans.</span> <span id="s5554">They sewed.</span> <span id="s5555">They had a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s5556">That was needed also.</span> <span id="s5557">That is how everyone participated.</span> <span id="s5558">I, for example, I didn’t want to join the partisans.</span> <span id="s5559">I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s5560">I was afraid of being involved further than I wanted even though for some it was okay.</span> <span id="s5561">But one of the girls was shot by her own people.</span> <span id="s5562">Sometimes it was shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s5563">Q: Then in the spring of 1946, you had met Abe, You had gotten together and you began dating and then you decided to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s5564">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5565">Then we did not get married in Pskov.</span> <span id="s5566">We left together and got married in Szczecin (Stettin).</span> <span id="s5567">We stayed there for just a week after the wedding or ten days.</span> <span id="s5568">After that, we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s5569">We were then members of an organized group.</span> <span id="s5570">It was a Zionist group.</span> <span id="s5571">The main purpose of this group was to take young people out of Poland to the DP camps in Germany and eventually to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s5572">Q; Did this group have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s5573">A: I don’t believe that it had a special name.</span> <span id="s5574">it was a group organized to make it easier for young people to get out.</span> <span id="s5575">We paid money to join the group.</span> <span id="s5576">From Szczecin, they took us someplace else and put us on trucks.</span> <span id="s5577">We hid inside these trucks and they took us to Berlin in the French zone.</span> <span id="s5578">From this French zone of Berlin we went to West Germany by train.</span> <span id="s5579">Once we were in that zone of Berlin, they no longer were afraid of us being stopped.</span> <span id="s5580">It was illegal to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s5581">That was what the Polish government had decided.</span> <span id="s5582">The DP (displaced persons) camp we stayed at was probably an old army camp.</span> <span id="s5583">There were barracks.</span> <span id="s5584">(reference to French and British zones in Berlin are somewhat hazy as are other divisions of Germany).</span></p> <p><span id="s5585">Q: Could you work or did you just wait around?</span></p> <p><span id="s5586">A: We waited.</span> <span id="s5587">Other people worked.</span> <span id="s5588">I could have had a job.</span> <span id="s5589">I was offered a job by a fellow who was from Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s5590">I met him there and he offered me to go to school in West Germany and to be a teacher there.</span> <span id="s5591">You see, I knew Hebrew (besides Polish and Russian and German) and they tried to teach Hebrew to children.</span> <span id="s5592">However we did not stay in that camp very long.</span> <span id="s5593">We were fed.</span> <span id="s5594">We had a room for ourselves.</span> <span id="s5595">It was like a transit place.</span> <span id="s5596">From West Berlin to the British zone, we went by train through the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s5597">They made sure that we didn’t talk Russian.</span> <span id="s5598">They even gave us new passports.</span> <span id="s5599">In the English zone we were in Hanover.</span> <span id="s5600">We were on a farm near Arland (or in a place which sounds like that), that is a few miles from Hanover.</span> <span id="s5601">The only city is Hanover.</span> <span id="s5602">That is a big city.</span> <span id="s5603">It is beautiful.</span> <span id="s5604">The farm was a Jewish farm which had lovely orchards and we worked there.</span> <span id="s5605">It was like a little kibbutz (a kibbutz is a communal village where everything is owned in common and the decisions are made by the inhabitants together, generally as a result of a vote).</span> <span id="s5606">There were only young people on the farm.</span> <span id="s5607">A whole group of young people.</span> <span id="s5608">We stayed there until late fall.</span> <span id="s5609">Then we went to Ulm after receiving a telegram that both Abe’s sister and my sister were there.</span> <span id="s5610">So we went without asking anybody.</span> <span id="s5611">We just told them that we were leaving.</span> <span id="s5612">We had no passports with which we could travel so we were stopped at the border between the English and the American zones.</span> <span id="s5613">You see, we were traveling without proper papers.</span> <span id="s5614">I was caught and taken to prison.</span> <span id="s5615">You see, we were not supposedly man and wife.</span> <span id="s5616">We were each traveling under a different name since we had to have something to go through the border.</span> <span id="s5617">The Americans took me off the train and held me overnight in the station of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s5618">I had no passport.</span> <span id="s5619">I had nobody to talk to until I established a connection to Escheiler.</span> <span id="s5620">That was a Jewish DP camp.</span> <span id="s5621">We had been there already (this was mentioned on a previous tape).</span> <span id="s5622">So, until I received a name and a passport from the Escheiler people, which certified that I was from their group and that I was not doing anything wrong.</span> <span id="s5623">In the meantime, I was almost two weeks in prison, a regular prison!</span> <span id="s5624">I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s5625">I could only speak German and Russian so they got somebody to translate.</span> <span id="s5626">Still, I had to go twice to the Authorities.</span> <span id="s5627">They told me that until everything will be clarified, I would have to stay in prison.</span> <span id="s5628">After that, they got the information and they told me that I was free to go.</span> <span id="s5629">From Heidelberg, I went by train to Eschweiler which was in the U.S. zone (see the footnote for the previous tape about the towns of Eschwege and Eschweiler out of the picture.</span> <span id="s5630">Here it is identified as U.S. zone which leaves Eschweiler out of the picture).</span> <span id="s5631">Then we got permission and went to Ulm.</span> <span id="s5632">Then we heard that they just opened a new DP camp.</span> <span id="s5633">A whole transport of Jews had come from Russia, from Poland and or wherever and they brought them into Wasser-Rauschingen (this place could not readily be located during the earlier tape was made to Bad-Rausingen which supposedly is close to Ulm.</span> <span id="s5634">It is presumed that both are in the same place).</span> <span id="s5635">We settled in that camp.</span> <span id="s5636">We told people that we were from the same transport, after all,, who knew and what was going on, as long as you get a place to stay someplace.</span> <span id="s5637">There we got an apartment.</span> <span id="s5638">Actually, it was one room in a house but they were beautiful homes and there we got jobs.</span> <span id="s5639">I was teaching Hebrew school in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s5640">Actually the German government certified me to teach.</span> <span id="s5641">We had a bona fide German teacher who got the job.</span> <span id="s5642">So we made it.</span> <span id="s5643">We received food.</span> <span id="s5644">Actually we were well fed and everything we needed was paid for, so we really couldn’t complain.</span> <span id="s5645">I had my first baby while we were living there.</span> <span id="s5646">We had wanted to go to Israel earlier but we left only when the baby was six months old.</span> <span id="s5647">That is when we signed up to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s5648">It was Israel by this time., that was 1948.</span> <span id="s5649">It was in 1948 when the Jewish state was established.</span> <span id="s5650">I could have come here to the U,S. at that time because the same people who sent the affidavits to Abe’s sister would have sent them to us also.</span> <span id="s5651">If we had wanted to come.</span> <span id="s5652">However, in our minds there was no question that we wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s5653">That decision was in our heads.</span> <span id="s5654">We were afraid to remain in the Diaspora (that means the Jews living outside of Israel).</span> <span id="s5655">We didn’t want to take that chance.</span> <span id="s5656">Why should we change one Diaspora for another.</span> <span id="s5657">We were certain that we would stay in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s5658">Q: So you stayed in that camp near Ulm for about one and a half years?</span></p> <p><span id="s5659">A: We stayed there from the end of 1946 to the end of 1948, about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s5660">Q: Were people who were living there in that camp pretty hopeful?</span></p> <p><span id="s5661">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s5662">The people were free!</span> <span id="s5663">That was a good place really people were hopeful.</span> <span id="s5664">We all waited for something.</span> <span id="s5665">In the meantime, people had everything they needed.</span> <span id="s5666">Everybody was busy doing something.</span> <span id="s5667">There were all kinds of businesses.</span> <span id="s5668">Some of the people even opened shops up.</span> <span id="s5669">There were tailor and butcher shops.</span> <span id="s5670">Everything you needed for life.</span> <span id="s5671">However, you knew that it wouldn’t last, since the camp itself was only temporary.</span> <span id="s5672">Some people were truly happy to hear from relatives in the U.S. To get papers to immigrate here.</span> <span id="s5673">Of course, until the papers were complete, it always took time.</span> <span id="s5674">So they had to wait maybe even for a few years to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s5675">The same thing was true for Israel.</span> <span id="s5676">We had to sign up (however there never was a wait of “a few years” or even several months, once the state of Israel had been established).</span> <span id="s5677">We would have signed up sooner but we would have had to leave earlier.</span> <span id="s5678">As it was, we got to Israel in October 1948 (her baby was then five months old).</span></p> <p><span id="s5679">Q: By boat then?</span></p> <p><span id="s5680">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5681">We went to France from Germany.</span> <span id="s5682">We stayed in France for three weeks.</span> <span id="s5683">While they were organizing us.</span> <span id="s5684">They had al kinds of groups of people all with people in charge.</span> <span id="s5685">Then people told us in the evening, even at that time, it was illegal for boats full of immigrants to Israel to be leaving Europe.</span> <span id="s5686">We went by a terrible boat.</span> <span id="s5687">The boat was truly terrible.</span> <span id="s5688">We left from Marseille.</span> <span id="s5689">They took us again by trucks to the ship in the evening and loaded us up like cattle.</span> <span id="s5690">Actually the ship we got on was a cattle boat.</span> <span id="s5691">It took us six days to go from France to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s5692">Q: That was in Nov 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s5693">A: It was Oct or Nov. it must have been Nov because it was already cold.</span> <span id="s5694">Yes, we left Germany in Sep and we got to Israel in Nov.</span></p> <p><span id="s5695">Q: You landed where?</span></p> <p><span id="s5696">A; In Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s5697">Q: And then on to Ramla.</span> <span id="s5698">We didn’t stay there long.</span> <span id="s5699">We wanted to go to a bigger city.</span> <span id="s5700">We met Abe’s cousin not far from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s5701">Then we started to look for a place to stay there.</span> <span id="s5702">We went and stayed with that cousin for a few days.</span> <span id="s5703">We looked around and found a nice home.</span> <span id="s5704">That was the home of some Arabs who had run away.</span> <span id="s5705">it was empty so we settled there and started to work the land to farm.</span> <span id="s5706">It was just outside of Jaffa.</span> <span id="s5707">Jaffa was a big city by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s5708">Q: Did you rent the land you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s5709">A: We did not rent the land.</span> <span id="s5710">It was “Yetush Hamatush.”</span> <span id="s5711">That means that it was land taken from the Arabs who had abandoned it.</span> <span id="s5712">Occupied Land.</span> <span id="s5713">The Arabs ran away from all their lands and belongings.</span> <span id="s5714">It was only in Jaffa that Arabs remained.</span> <span id="s5715">However, most of the Arabs left.</span> <span id="s5716">Then a few of them who didn’t leave, they stayed and continued as before.</span> <span id="s5717">Some of these had orchards and especially orange groves.</span> <span id="s5718">They had beautiful homes in these orange groves, nearly palaces, truly beautiful.</span> <span id="s5719">These were the rich Arabs.</span> <span id="s5720">Poor Arabs lived in little shacks.</span> <span id="s5721">Something like tin cans which they would cut open out of which they made hovels about the size of half an orange.</span> <span id="s5722">There were some of these shacks scattered all around the fields.</span> <span id="s5723">They left because they were very poor.</span> <span id="s5724">They had been working for the richer Arabs.</span> <span id="s5725">Even these Arabs fled.</span> <span id="s5726">So, actually the land had been truly abandoned and lay fallow like a desert.</span> <span id="s5727">We didn’t have a lot of land to farm but what we had we really put it to use.</span></p> <p><span id="s5728">Q: You lived there for ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s5729">A: We lived there for eight years.</span> <span id="s5730">In the same home.</span> <span id="s5731">We operated a chicken farm.</span> <span id="s5732">Then we decided that the chicken farm was not good because of sickness of the chickens.</span> <span id="s5733">We decided to sell it.</span> <span id="s5734">To liquidate it and we bought a restaurant.</span> <span id="s5735">There we stayed for two years.</span> <span id="s5736">By then we had had enough and decided to leave altogether and come to America.</span> <span id="s5737">After all this dreaming and having a dream which we had when we left Europe.</span> <span id="s5738">We had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s5739">Q: The reality was not quite what the dream had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s5740">A: It is not that, that is not it!</span> <span id="s5741">You just get tired of war.</span> <span id="s5742">You get tired to be stabbed in the back.</span> <span id="s5743">We had two boys growing up and we thought, “Who knows, next year there might be another war.”</span> <span id="s5744">Even though at the beginning of the state, we had hoped it hadn’t really changed all that much.</span> <span id="s5745">Now (1978) it is worse.</span> <span id="s5746">Of course, since the 1967 war fighting has been endless.</span> <span id="s5747">Then, during the night someone else got killed or got injured and all the places were surrounded by Arabs.</span> <span id="s5748">Even more if you lived closer to the borders.</span> <span id="s5749">They didn’t have night and they didn’t have day for resting.</span> <span id="s5750">Somehow you get tired and you don’t want to wait.</span> <span id="s5751">That was particularly so after Abe’s sister arrived and told us how beautiful it was here.</span> <span id="s5752">She said that it would be easier for us and that our children would have more opportunity.</span> <span id="s5753">So we decided, “Let’s go!</span> <span id="s5754">Let’s try it!”</span> <span id="s5755">that is why we applied for the visa and we came to the U.S. in 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s5756">Q: Did people talk about the years back during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s5757">A: Always!</span> <span id="s5758">Even now, here where we have all of our friends here, you know the refuges of WWII, they are pretty well settled.</span> <span id="s5759">All our friends in Dayton are well to do.</span> <span id="s5760">They have beautiful homes.</span> <span id="s5761">When we come together we have everything which anybody could ask for.</span> <span id="s5762">It is nice!</span> <span id="s5763">You can’t ask for a nicer life.</span> <span id="s5764">However, whenever we talk, we find ourselves somehow recalling the concentration camps and about all of those who got killed.</span> <span id="s5765">We finish our conversations with the same theme and the same subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s5766">Q: So you ever find out something new?</span> <span id="s5767">Something you didn’t know before?</span></p> <p><span id="s5768">A: We find out that they had it worse than we did.</span> <span id="s5769">Everyone of our friends here who now live in Dayton went through so much that when they start talking and I realize that those two years, when I lived in the forest, as bad as they were, including the cold and living in the bunkers and not knowing what the next day would bring, even during the blockades, the villagers were kind of nice to us; at least we were free to go and move around; of course at times you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s5770">Most of the time we could go from one camp to the other camp.</span> <span id="s5771">We couldn’t always go far.</span> <span id="s5772">We could go further in one direction than in another because of danger.</span> <span id="s5773">However, within the forest we were free to move around.</span> <span id="s5774">Naturally winters were tough.</span> <span id="s5775">Then we had to stay in most of the time.</span> <span id="s5776">at other times, we did manage to get together.</span> <span id="s5777">Sometimes we played cards.</span> <span id="s5778">Sometimes we played musical instruments and sang songs.</span> <span id="s5779">Such as balalaikas.</span> <span id="s5780">The youth, especially the youth was somehow kept alive because of this interchange and being able to decide for ourselves.</span> <span id="s5781">We did not go to pieces.</span> <span id="s5782">It was not like in a concentration camps we talked about.</span> <span id="s5783">One of my closest friends here, she was in Auschwitz, we saw the number on her arm.</span> <span id="s5784">When she is talking about what she went through, what she had to do for a piece of bread!</span> <span id="s5785">They killed a child for a piece of bread!</span> <span id="s5786">You couldn’t hold on to a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s5787">If you did somebody would find it and would steal it.</span> <span id="s5788">We didn’t have that!</span> <span id="s5789">We truly didn’t have hunger.</span> <span id="s5790">At least not very much.</span> <span id="s5791">Of course, we went through our own hard times.</span> <span id="s5792">We had our own suffering.</span> <span id="s5793">It was different!</span> <span id="s5794">Although we have friends here who were not under the Germans but under the Russians.</span> <span id="s5795">They had their own problems.</span> <span id="s5796">It was a war.</span> <span id="s5797">A long terrible war!!</span> <span id="s5798">However, at least they were safe.</span> <span id="s5799">Nobody walked behind them to kill them!</span></p> <p><span id="s5800">Q: Such things remained on people’s mind.</span> <span id="s5801">It is hard to get around it!</span></p> <p><span id="s5802">A: Constantly!</span> <span id="s5803">We shouldn’t forget!!!!!</span> <span id="s5804">That is a thing which we cannot forgive and we cannot forget!!!!!</span> <span id="s5805">It is impossible to forgive or forget because so many families were lost.</span> <span id="s5806">There is no one alive to remember them and to tell about them.</span> <span id="s5807">And even just to remember their names.</span> <span id="s5808">For example, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s5809">My mother had three sisters and four brothers and no one of their children or their children’s children is alive except for one cousin who went to Israel prior to the war.</span> <span id="s5810">Today she is alive in Israel.</span> <span id="s5811">Not one of the others is alive to talk about their families like my brother and I talked when he was here.</span> <span id="s5812">Okay, my mother did not live in the same town with her sisters but she knew about all of them.</span> <span id="s5813">Her older brother was already a grandfather in 1941 when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s5814">Then, they were all exterminated.</span> <span id="s5815">All of them!</span> <span id="s5816">When we went to the Yad Vashem (this is part of Museum of Remembrance in Jerusalem dedicated to the memory of six million Jewish victims of Nazism next to Mt Hertzl and to the military cemetery) and we said the prayer for the dead for the entire family.</span> <span id="s5817">For all of those who were killed.</span> <span id="s5818">However, I don’t know how many of that particular family were killed since I didn’t know how many they were.</span> <span id="s5819">There were a lot of people of that family whom I had never met.</span> <span id="s5820">How many families in Kurzeniez did I know from which families, no one but no one survived.</span> <span id="s5821">That is true for some families even if you extend them to the most distant cousins.</span> <span id="s5822">That no one survived!</span> <span id="s5823">No one is around who may have even any ideas about some of these families.</span> <span id="s5824">Some of them have no trace from their families ever having even existed except the inscription on the walls of the Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s5825">During the war my sister, my brother and I were in different places and survived in different ways.</span> <span id="s5826">That is, until we got together again.</span> <span id="s5827">We were just lucky that was just luck.</span> <span id="s5828">How can you forget when you owe your life to just luck!</span> <span id="s5829">Even here in the U.S. where we all have it so good, we always wind up talking about the same thing.</span> <span id="s5830">We always come back to that time.</span> <span id="s5831">No matter what other problems we have and we all have problems, I still hope that one day my children will hear about it.</span> <span id="s5832">That they don’t forget because they should always remember what we suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s5833">Q: Do they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s5834">A: Yes, they know.</span></p> <p><span id="s5835">Q: In a general way or do they know all the things which you have been telling me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s5836">A: No!</span> <span id="s5837">I say no but they know a lot of things.</span> <span id="s5838">For example, a few years ago there was a paper in the Jewish Chronicle and in other publications about Dayton but that was only short.</span> <span id="s5839">Just an article about us that is Abe and I. My younger son, who is now a dentist, he said, “Mother, I never knew what you went through!!”</span> <span id="s5840">I told him you never listened when I talked.</span> <span id="s5841">I guess when they were growing up they never quite understood.</span> <span id="s5842">Now, they ask.</span> <span id="s5843">Now they know better.</span> <span id="s5844">Now they really want to know what went on including how many relatives were gone and about whom nobody knows enough to mention the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s5845">Q: Maybe they would like to go to WSU (Wright State University) to listen to the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s5846">A: Maybe they will someday.</span> <span id="s5847">I have a friend who is a native American, probably at least a third generation American with whom I was talking.</span> <span id="s5848">She said, “When I think that I saw the series ‘Holocaust’ that was terrible.”</span> <span id="s5849">So I answered, “Well for us that is just a toned down version of what happened.”</span> <span id="s5850">Yes, we also watched it but we went through so much more.</span> <span id="s5851">The Germans in the beginning were not as bad as they were later.</span> <span id="s5852">Later on, they had been so brainwashed with Fascism that they had to do it once; that they had to have a little blood on their hands.</span> <span id="s5853">Then nothing was too hard for them.”</span> <span id="s5854">And that is all true!</span> <span id="s5855">So then she said, ‘Now I can imagine what you went through” I told her, “You know what?</span> <span id="s5856">We went through even more because we used to live peacefully together with the Christian people.</span> <span id="s5857">Nobody used to care who used to be Jewish and who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s5858">After the Nazi’s came in these people did more against us than the German people and that is what hurts!!</span> <span id="s5859">Why did they do it?</span> <span id="s5860">We were so good to them!</span> <span id="s5861">We never did any harm to these people!</span> <span id="s5862">They could have saved us but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s5863">I don’t say that that was the case with all of them but most of them did not.</span> <span id="s5864">That hurts!</span> <span id="s5865">Even going back to the woods to run away.</span> <span id="s5866">On the day when the Holocaust hit us for real, the “liquidation day” as they called it, we didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s5867">Later on, because of the partisans, they helped us.</span> <span id="s5868">They did it but only them and far away from the towns.</span> <span id="s5869">But how did we know where to go?</span> <span id="s5870">To begin with, we didn’t know the forest but of course, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s5871">Anyhow, we wound up in the forest and there the people helped us.</span> <span id="s5872">These are the people we have to thank for us being here.</span> <span id="s5873">You see, my friend who helped get my brother out of the Vilna ghetto, she now sent papers in order to bring a gentile, a Christian family to the U.S. for a visit.</span> <span id="s5874">She wanted to do something good to compensate for what these people did for her.</span> <span id="s5875">She said that it would cost a few thousand dollars but she wanted to do it so they sent them the tickets.</span> <span id="s5876">She said let them come.</span> <span id="s5877">I want them to see it.</span> <span id="s5878">I also want the whole world to see what these people have done and to pay them back for a little of that they did.</span> <span id="s5879">I want people to see that these are good people, however, the Russians would not let them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s5880">Q: Were they worried that they wouldn’t come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s5881">A; No!</span> <span id="s5882">Not even that.</span> <span id="s5883">You know the Russians, they don’t want people to go out to see the free world.</span> <span id="s5884">The Russian people don’t understand, they don’t know that there is such a world where you are free people.</span> <span id="s5885">Where you can say what you want to say.</span> <span id="s5886">That you are free as long as you don’t kill, as long as you don’t do harm to others.</span> <span id="s5887">But then we didn’t realize that either before we came.</span> <span id="s5888">We didn’t know either!</span> <span id="s5889">They don’t know that there is a world like this.</span> <span id="s5890">Over there, you are always under somebody’s eyes.</span> <span id="s5891">That somebody is always watching over you.</span> <span id="s5892">Those , “My hat off to those people!”</span></p> <p><span id="s5893">Q: What made these people different?</span> <span id="s5894">Were they just worthy people?</span> <span id="s5895">Could they get something back from being kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s5896">A: No, what could they get back?</span> <span id="s5897">They didn’t have to do anything for us.</span> <span id="s5898">They gave us when we begged.</span> <span id="s5899">Most of these people didn’t see the city life.</span> <span id="s5900">They lived two lives really.</span> <span id="s5901">They used to live lives withdrawn from the city.</span> <span id="s5902">They went to the city every week to see whatever they produced such as butter, the milk, the cheese, the eggs and chickens, wood.</span> <span id="s5903">You know most of the Jews used to buy from them.</span> <span id="s5904">That is how they used to make their living.</span> <span id="s5905">However, in general these people were different.</span> <span id="s5906">Some of the people read the Bible better.</span> <span id="s5907">Maybe their churches were different?</span> <span id="s5908">You see the churches in the cities were to blame for many things really.</span> <span id="s5909">We have a friend who was a Protestant minister.</span> <span id="s5910">You see the Protestants were not divided into denominations as they are here.</span> <span id="s5911">There was a Protestant church and a Catholic church, that was it.</span> <span id="s5912">He didn’t live far from us.</span> <span id="s5913">As a matter of fact, this minister’s daughter dated my uncle’s son.</span> <span id="s5914">That was actually not allowed so they did it secretly.</span> <span id="s5915">You see, the city churches in their sermons constantly blamed the Jews.</span> <span id="s5916">That predisposed a lot of people to take things out on the Jews.</span> <span id="s5917">That was the start of many a pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s5918">Q: In the country churches there was not that kind of prejudice?</span></p> <p><span id="s5919">A: No.</span> <span id="s5920">Probably not because they didn’t even know about Jews.</span> <span id="s5921">Those of the country churches always used to call us during the war when we were in the forest, “Poor Jews!”</span> <span id="s5922">As if they were saying, “What do they want from them!”</span> <span id="s5923">They just felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s5924">On the other hand, the city people they couldn’t after all so much about it.</span> <span id="s5925">At least in the beginning before there were a lot of partisans.</span> <span id="s5926">The partisans came to take away things from them.</span> <span id="s5927">The Germans came and took even more.</span> <span id="s5928">So most of the villagers were just afraid that they would lose everything.</span> <span id="s5929">The Jews just came and begged.</span> <span id="s5930">As a matter of fact, once a couple (we always went by couples) came out of a house next door to where I was begging.</span> <span id="s5931">They gave me a can of peas.</span> <span id="s5932">To another one they gave a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s5933">To another, a potato.</span> <span id="s5934">People came constantly every day.</span> <span id="s5935">However, these people always gave something even though they didn’t have much to give to begin with.</span> <span id="s5936">In the city, on the other hand, the city people took all the goods which used to belong to the city Jews.</span> <span id="s5937">That was right until the time we came back (that was also the case in other counties that people took things from Jewish families, whom they knew, when the Nazis caused them to flee or arrested them).</span> <span id="s5938">The people from the villages didn’t do anything like that.</span> <span id="s5939">Who can explain the differences?</span> <span id="s5940">Of course, the villagers took chances whenever they kept us in their homes.</span> <span id="s5941">They were killed if we were found.</span></p> <p><span id="s5942">Q: When I reviewed the last two tapes again ending with the interview of Jan 2nd, 1939, I became pretty much aware of things up to the point when you came to the U.S.</span> <span id="s5943">What I remember from the tapes is that when I asked you why you left Israel to come here you said that part of the reason was that you wanted to get away from that tension and to improve the chances for the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s5944">A: Yes, I had two little boys.</span> <span id="s5945">One was ten years old and the other was six.</span> <span id="s5946">There did not appear to be any future for these kids.</span> <span id="s5947">Everyday there were small fights somewhere between the Fedayin, that is what they were called at the time -- they didn’t yet have the PLO -- and the Israelis.</span> <span id="s5948">Actually, they had such attacks every night and then we had the full scale war of 1956.</span> <span id="s5949">We came in 1948, and there was a war.</span> <span id="s5950">Actually we came during the war.</span> <span id="s5951">By the time the war of 1956 came we already had made out papers.</span> <span id="s5952">The war delayed the papers and then the time for the papers had run out so that we had to reapply.</span></p> <p><span id="s5953">Q: So you started the process to come to the U.S. before the war of 1956?</span></p> <p><span id="s5954">A: Yes before 1956.</span> <span id="s5955">Then we had to wait again for six months for my husband to come.</span> <span id="s5956">At that time, over twenty years ago, they didn’t let an entire family immigrate.</span> <span id="s5957">My husband could come just because his sister was here and she prepared papers for him, her brother.</span> <span id="s5958">(Actually there were no regulations against entire families coming but affidavit of support, or other proof of support were required for each individual and that required a fairly high level of taxes having been paid the previous year).</span> <span id="s5959">Then later, he had to prepare papers for me and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s5960">Q: So he came first?</span></p> <p><span id="s5961">A: Yes, he came here first.</span> <span id="s5962">He was here six months before the papers were processed.</span> <span id="s5963">That is why it was 1958 until we came.</span> <span id="s5964">so it was actually two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s5965">Q: I see but there was all that tension, were you in Jaffa then?</span></p> <p><span id="s5966">A: Yes, we lived in Jaffa.</span> <span id="s5967">We had it pretty good.</span> <span id="s5968">Not very good.</span> <span id="s5969">However, we just had gotten established during the first years we were there.</span> <span id="s5970">We worked very hard.</span> <span id="s5971">We were both young.</span> <span id="s5972">When we arrived in Israel, I had just one boy.</span> <span id="s5973">I worked very hard on the little farm while carrying the guns.</span> <span id="s5974">We made some money from everything we did and we were successful in a way but it wasn’t much and we couldn’t see a future for our children.</span> <span id="s5975">I was just afraid that something might happen to them.</span> <span id="s5976">Abe’s sister wrote us various letters in which she said that it would be easier in the U.S. and that we would be together.</span> <span id="s5977">That was in spite of the fact that my sister was in Israel.</span> <span id="s5978">But the deciding point influencing our move was the thought for the future of the children.</span> <span id="s5979">We finally, six months after Abe got here, we four were reunited and we started a new life.</span> <span id="s5980">It was not easy though to start all over because of the language.</span> <span id="s5981">My boys didn’t speak any English at all.</span> <span id="s5982">They had only spoken Hebrew.</span> <span id="s5983">My younger boy, age six, hadn’t started any school yet but the older one had had five years.</span> <span id="s5984">Of course, for the older one, it was strange.</span> <span id="s5985">After we got here, they asked us constantly for a few months, “Mom, when will we go home?”</span> <span id="s5986">They thought that we came just for a vacation.</span> <span id="s5987">Just to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s5988">Q: I guess at the ages of five and ten they were not ready to make a change.</span></p> <p><span id="s5989">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s5990">Q: Did you come directly to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s5991">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s5992">We just stayed in New York and New Jersey to visit with friends.</span> <span id="s5993">My sister-in-law with her husband came to take us to Dayton by car.</span> <span id="s5994">So that summer, we were driven from N.Y. to Dayton.</span> <span id="s5995">I have been here since.</span> <span id="s5996">This is a nicer place for us.</span> <span id="s5997">Really.</span> <span id="s5998">Because at that time, Israel was not as big as it is today.</span> <span id="s5999">It had about 700,000 inhabitants (she seems very conservative since the first 1948 official population for Israel included 758,702 Jews and an estimated 120,000 non-Jews) when we got there in 1948.</span> <span id="s6000">We lived in a small place.</span> <span id="s6001">At that time, Dayton looked to me, as NYC does today.</span> <span id="s6002">It is quiet and green.</span> <span id="s6003">We arrived here in August.</span> <span id="s6004">On our first morning here, I woke up to see it raining.</span> <span id="s6005">We never even heard of rain in Israel between May and November (they used to take the windshield wiper blades off in these months).</span> <span id="s6006">I loved that, I truly loved it!</span> <span id="s6007">Naturally there was a hardship with the language.</span> <span id="s6008">It was hard for the children.</span> <span id="s6009">I took English lessons privately from a teacher in Israel.</span> <span id="s6010">However, here when I got here, in the summer there were vacations and then in the fall I went to classes a few times but it was too hard for me.</span> <span id="s6011">We didn’t have a car, we didn’t drive.</span> <span id="s6012">I didn’t even know whom to ask to be a baby-sitter for the children while I went to classes.</span> <span id="s6013">.</span> <span id="s6014">so, I didn’t go often.</span> <span id="s6015">I just learned by myself with the television and then I learned with the children.</span> <span id="s6016">The children really learned fast because their teachers were so good.</span> <span id="s6017">It was amazing!</span></p> <p><span id="s6018">Q: They went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s6019">A: Yes, they went to public school, to Jefferson.</span> <span id="s6020">We lived not far from school.</span> <span id="s6021">We had rented an apartment at Lexington Avenue at first.</span> <span id="s6022">It was just a few blocks, maybe two, from the school.</span> <span id="s6023">The children’s teacher was a Mrs. Esterbrook.</span> <span id="s6024">She took my little one in first grade.</span> <span id="s6025">She took my little one and she babied him and she taught him privately.</span> <span id="s6026">The teacher for my older son, in the sixth grade, was good also.</span> <span id="s6027">It was hard for the first few months but the teachers, one especially, used to come half an hour before school actually started and she taught him and a girl who came from Poland, those two children privately.</span> <span id="s6028">After six months they knew English and they talked English and they even had begun to forget their Hebrew.</span> <span id="s6029">That is how fast they learned.</span> <span id="s6030">They were very good students.</span></p> <p><span id="s6031">Q: Did you continue to speak Hebrew at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s6032">A: Yes, we kept speaking Hebrew because we didn’t want them to forget.</span> <span id="s6033">My ten year olds would be Bar Mitzvahed soon and we didn’t want him to have to start all over again.</span> <span id="s6034">He, he didn’t forget.</span> <span id="s6035">As a matter of fact, by now he is 31 already and he still knows and remembers the prayers in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s6036">The younger one, he is the middle one now.</span> <span id="s6037">He forgot Hebrew except for the little bit which he took in college as a foreign language.</span> <span id="s6038">He took French and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s6039">As far as making a living here, I got concerned.</span> <span id="s6040">Of course, I knew that we would make a living when we came here because we were young and wanted to work.</span> <span id="s6041">We are not afraid of any kind of a job.</span> <span id="s6042">I was only afraid of how things were going to go for my children.</span> <span id="s6043">How they would take it.</span> <span id="s6044">Writing on the other hand, was not so simple.</span> <span id="s6045">In Hebrew you start writing from the right to the left contrary to what we are doing.</span> <span id="s6046">However, they adjusted without problems very fast.</span> <span id="s6047">Later on, my children were straight A students.</span> <span id="s6048">We had neighbors you know, Americans, and the kids of these neighbors came to ask for my children how to do this and how to do that in Math and even English.</span> <span id="s6049">After the first year of living on Lexington we moved to Cambridge where we bought a house.</span> <span id="s6050">It was really a pleasure to see how our kids had caught on to schoolwork.</span> <span id="s6051">The children really adjusted well.</span> <span id="s6052">They soon stopped asking me when we were going to go home.</span> <span id="s6053">They soon knew that this was our home.</span> <span id="s6054">That made it easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s6055">Q: You lived then on Cambridge for another couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s6056">A: Almost ten years.</span> <span id="s6057">Then we moved to another house, in another neighborhood.</span> <span id="s6058">I think in 1967 or 1968.</span> <span id="s6059">Then we moved to Denlinger Road.</span> <span id="s6060">We bought a simple house there.</span> <span id="s6061">Life went on and we, ourselves, adjusted.</span> <span id="s6062">As I told you we both only learned English by speaking to people.</span> <span id="s6063">We are not afraid to speak although I make mistakes as I am doing now.</span> <span id="s6064">I started to do a little sewing in my home.</span> <span id="s6065">I decided upon that since the children were small and I could not go out to work.</span> <span id="s6066">With this sewing at home, I could be there when the children came for lunch.</span> <span id="s6067">I was always there to serve them lunch.</span> <span id="s6068">So, I learned to speak from the ladies who brought me their work.</span> <span id="s6069">They spoke English and I had to answer in English.</span> <span id="s6070">I tried to speak Yiddish to some of them, they knew only a very little Yiddish.</span> <span id="s6071">Right away we also started to read.</span> <span id="s6072">First the newspapers and then books.</span> <span id="s6073">It is now easier to speak in English although I speak English with an accent and it is easier for me to read in English than in any other language which I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s6074">Q: Do you still keep up your Polish and your Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s6075">A: Yes, we speak Russian.</span> <span id="s6076">As a matter of fact, we meet the New Russian people who are coming over now.</span> <span id="s6077">We also have a friend who came the same time as I did; she came from Poland.</span> <span id="s6078">She is a Russian girl and we speak Russian together.</span> <span id="s6079">When we meet at gatherings, we speak Hebrew with people who are just coming over from Israel.</span> <span id="s6080">We try not to forget that language and we speak Yiddish and English at home.</span> <span id="s6081">The only thing is that I know nobody who speak German.</span> <span id="s6082">Actually, I am not all that anxious to speak German.</span> <span id="s6083">Sometimes, at night when you see an old movie you hear the Germans, then I start shaking.</span> <span id="s6084">I get the feeling that I hear them again and they are coming, they are running, they are going.</span> <span id="s6085">You DO RELIVE the same life as you did thirty three to thirty five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s6086">Q: The German language has been spoiled for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s6087">A: Yes, it brings back the yelling, the toughness.</span> <span id="s6088">The German language itself brings back memories which are painful.</span> <span id="s6089">Really!!</span> <span id="s6090">The other day I saw a movie on TV and their talking German upset me so much that I did not want to watch it.</span> <span id="s6091">It is not easy to adjust to the way of life in a new country.</span> <span id="s6092">For example, the way of life here is so different from what it is in Europe.</span> <span id="s6093">It is altogether different even with all the luxury, with everything we have.</span> <span id="s6094">You are missing something when you come here.</span> <span id="s6095">All the people who come even those who come now, they still say the same thing.</span> <span id="s6096">I am the one who has to comfort them and say that they will get adjusted.</span> <span id="s6097">It is not as bad as the loneliness and the emptiness.</span> <span id="s6098">People are staying home.</span> <span id="s6099">People don’t go outside.</span> <span id="s6100">People don’t even go for a walk.</span> <span id="s6101">You see the streets downtown.</span> <span id="s6102">They are busy during the business hours but in the evening in the city you see nobody unless there is a movie.</span> <span id="s6103">A special movie or theater.</span> <span id="s6104">You see in Israel, for example, the only entertainment is to dress up and to walk back and forth and go out into the streets and the parks.</span> <span id="s6105">Each city has parks.</span> <span id="s6106">It forms like a center of the city where people go and meet their friends and they go for a walk.</span> <span id="s6107">In Israel people can’t afford to go to a movie or to a restaurant and sit for a few hours.</span> <span id="s6108">They also can’t afford to drive to visit heir friends and their relatives; because of that, people in Israel walk a lot and that creates kind of an outdoor life.</span> <span id="s6109">When I came here everybody was inside.</span> <span id="s6110">The only time you see people is when you are out in the yard, walking in the yard and the neighbor comes into his yard.</span> <span id="s6111">Then you say “hello” to your neighbor.</span> <span id="s6112">Otherwise you don’t see them.</span> <span id="s6113">Over in Israel thy knock at the door and ask “May I come in?”</span> <span id="s6114">the neighbor is there then and you have a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s6115">Over here, unless you invite them, they don’t come.</span> <span id="s6116">That is actually what we truly need.</span> <span id="s6117">In the beginning, it took me a long time to adjust.</span> <span id="s6118">Now I am already a real American.</span> <span id="s6119">When I started to go to school for my citizenship, that of course means Abe and I, it didn’t take me all that long to study what I had to study for the questions which they are supposed to ask you.</span> <span id="s6120">I even had read all about some of these questions before.</span> <span id="s6121">The only thing was that with my teacher I had to call her on the phone a few times.</span> <span id="s6122">I just could not comprehend the two parties.</span> <span id="s6123">That is, the Democratic and the Republican parties.</span> <span id="s6124">What the teacher said did not satisfy me so I asked a lot of people.</span> <span id="s6125">Nobody could explain it to me.</span> <span id="s6126">I still don’t understand it now.</span> <span id="s6127">Okay, the teacher felt that I was rather inclined to be a Democrat and she was probably a Republican.</span> <span id="s6128">She just talked to me and talked to me and tried to talk to me about it.</span> <span id="s6129">Eisenhower was President then, a Republican.</span> <span id="s6130">She tried to tell me how good things were and that everything was beautiful.</span> <span id="s6131">And I somehow felt that I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s6132">I didn’t care for the President.</span> <span id="s6133">That made me speak to her and that was good.</span> <span id="s6134">She told me that I was “brilliant.”</span> <span id="s6135">That I was so “good!”</span> <span id="s6136">that I should read a lot and know what is in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s6137">I used to tell her, “I don’t know why everybody talks so well about the Republicans, they do the best they know for the people and so do the Democrats.</span> <span id="s6138">However we got along, we got to know more and two years later came the time for the elections and I said that I don’t know who gets elected as long as he is really a nice person who cares for the people.</span> <span id="s6139">Just as long as the President does good for the people.</span> <span id="s6140">That is how we got into the swing of the American system.</span></p> <p><span id="s6141">Q: Were you able to talk about all the experiences in the forest, about all the people being killed by the Germans to the people here?</span> <span id="s6142">To talk to them freely?</span></p> <p><span id="s6143">A: Yes, I could!</span> <span id="s6144">The only thing which I regretted to see was that here the young and the middle aged, I should say, people don’t appreciate what they have.</span> <span id="s6145">The age of the young kids who went wild.</span> <span id="s6146">I used to say that that happened because they had it too good.</span> <span id="s6147">If they had to go and serve their tour in the army and just to fight for survival they wouldn’t do what they are doing.</span> <span id="s6148">They would be glad that they have this beautiful country.</span> <span id="s6149">I heard that from friends who are not Jewish who got acquainted with our entire family.</span> <span id="s6150">We got talking a lot about my past.</span> <span id="s6151">About my going through life the way I did.</span> <span id="s6152">They invited us to their house for dinner.</span> <span id="s6153">Especially so that I could see her Christmas.</span> <span id="s6154">I also wanted her to see my life.</span> <span id="s6155">We were so close and we could speak about everything; about her religion, about my religion, what I think about, the only thing she said was, “Rachel, in a way I envy you the fact that you appreciate life in the U.S. more than all of us here.”</span> <span id="s6156">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s6157">Now they have moved to Centerville.</span> <span id="s6158">They are not here anymore.</span> <span id="s6159">We used to talk about our experiences to a lot of people because we as people, not I especially but all of us, of my age we didn’t have a youth.</span> <span id="s6160">The main youth of the three years where the Germans were there, for me between the age of fourteen and seventeen went for nothing.</span> <span id="s6161">From seventeen until nineteen, I went to school and I had barely made it to have something on my body.</span> <span id="s6162">That means something to cover my body and where to get the next meal from.</span> <span id="s6163">That was my life until I got married because at the time I left Russia to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s6164">So you see, my life wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s6165">Getting married so young.</span> <span id="s6166">Not having the youth.</span> <span id="s6167">Not having the fun which young kids have.</span> <span id="s6168">So, I missed a lot but I also learned a lot.</span> <span id="s6169">I grew up separately from my age.</span> <span id="s6170">When I was twenty I had had more experiences than many people have when they are forty.</span> <span id="s6171">My life is so full of everything in the world I went through.</span> <span id="s6172">It made me grow up faster than normal children do.</span> <span id="s6173">Normal children who live in an environment of everything, so called a normal environment.</span> <span id="s6174">Just as my children, for example, they grew up normal with everything.</span> <span id="s6175">Abe started out working when he first came here.</span> <span id="s6176">He started out making only $62.00 a week and it wasn’t easy work.</span> <span id="s6177">Out of that we had to pay rent and to buy things.</span> <span id="s6178">We came by plane from Israel so I didn’t bring much.</span> <span id="s6179">We had to buy new clothes and we had to buy things for the children to go to school.</span> <span id="s6180">Somebody called me from the Jewish Community and they said, “Somebody told them that my kids go to school without coats.”</span> <span id="s6181">By then it was already late in the fall.</span> <span id="s6182">I told them that I didn’t need charity that I would buy coats for the kids.</span> <span id="s6183">At that time my husband was without work.</span> <span id="s6184">They had fired him from his job after six or seven months.</span> <span id="s6185">So, I told these people from the Jewish community that what I needed was a job for my husband.</span> <span id="s6186">That I didn’t need charity.</span> <span id="s6187">I did not come here for charity.</span> <span id="s6188">The coats were not important.</span> <span id="s6189">My kids were still warm from Israel.</span> <span id="s6190">As a matter of fact we had coats.</span> <span id="s6191">We had bought beautiful coats at the rummage sale.</span> <span id="s6192">There were very beautiful coats.</span> <span id="s6193">Not winter coats but coats which were good for fall, as we have here.</span> <span id="s6194">People were very good to us and the kids.</span> <span id="s6195">Really, better than the family which brought us.</span> <span id="s6196">People brought us beautiful things.</span> <span id="s6197">A lot of people took us out for a drive to see something new, for the children to go on a merry-go-round.</span> <span id="s6198">I don’t remember where it was.</span> <span id="s6199">The children enjoyed that a lot.</span> <span id="s6200">Another couple used to come and take us out to get some ice cream.</span> <span id="s6201">The following week, I found out that I was pregnant wit the other son whom I had here.</span> <span id="s6202">So then I was busy again.</span></p> <p><span id="s6203">Q: You found a friendly reception?</span></p> <p><span id="s6204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6205">Friendly indeed!</span> <span id="s6206">I don’t think that any country could be so friendly.</span> <span id="s6207">First of all, people here have patience.</span> <span id="s6208">After all we were not talking the language.</span> <span id="s6209">The few words which I had learned were just broken English.</span> <span id="s6210">The people had so much patience with us.</span> <span id="s6211">For example.</span> <span id="s6212">When you go into a store because you have to buy something, after all, I was on my own, no one went for me or ran errands for me so I had to go.</span> <span id="s6213">I had to shop and I had to buy.</span> <span id="s6214">Naturally, I had to speak to the people there to get the salespeople to understand me.</span> <span id="s6215">Their patience was outstanding.</span> <span id="s6216">You would think that the people wouldn’t care what the woman who wanted to make a small purchase and couldn’t talk wanted.</span> <span id="s6217">Just the opposite.</span> <span id="s6218">They took me, they wanted me, they showed me, they talked to me, they explained to me.</span> <span id="s6219">You know, when you first come, it makes such a good impression to feel that you are not alone that you are not going to get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s6220">Q: Well, as you say, you have a lot of things behind you.</span> <span id="s6221">Things most people did not have to go through.</span> <span id="s6222">I am glad to hear that most of the people you met were receptive to you and your needs.</span> <span id="s6223">So, if you wanted to talk about your experiences, you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s6224">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s6225">We talked in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s6226">Q: Were people interested in hearing your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s6227">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s6228">We always talked about the experiences.</span> <span id="s6229">Even now, I have been here for twenty-one years and most of my friends are in the U.S. for over thirty years already.</span> <span id="s6230">They are all fairly well off.</span> <span id="s6231">We still talk about the event of these years but we keep these conversation private.</span> <span id="s6232">We know that we all went through hell, however, people who didn’t go through these experiences, they still understand what it is all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s6233">Q: For the most part I don’t believe that it was hard for you to tell all of the remembrances.</span> <span id="s6234">Of course, it was hard when you talked about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s6235">A: Yes, this was hard.</span> <span id="s6236">Particularly since recently we lost a grandchild, one of the twins.</span> <span id="s6237">It was just a month ago on Passover weekend.</span> <span id="s6238">A friend of mine called and asked.</span> <span id="s6239">“How are you taking it, Rachel?</span> <span id="s6240">Is it getting easier now?”</span> <span id="s6241">Yes, it is easier now.</span> <span id="s6242">Time takes care of a lot of things however, the pain is still there.</span> <span id="s6243">The baby was taken ill while they were here.</span> <span id="s6244">They took him to Children’s but they could not save him.</span> <span id="s6245">It is the same with my past.</span> <span id="s6246">The pain is there while we talk.</span> <span id="s6247">Of course, it is not as sharp, not as fresh as it was.</span> <span id="s6248">It is like putting a little salt on a wound.</span> <span id="s6249">It still makes it smart but since the wound is not as fresh, it does not really hurt.</span> <span id="s6250">It is not as fresh as it was thirty years ago.</span> <span id="s6251">It is easier since time takes care of much but you cannot forget!</span> <span id="s6252">As a matter of fact, we shouldn’t forget and even more, let our children not forget!!</span> <span id="s6253">We are not going to be here forever.</span> <span id="s6254">The middle age which we have, while our children are still young, we have to utilize to let them know.</span> <span id="s6255">To let them believe that it happened!!</span> <span id="s6256">Some don’t believe that it happened!</span> <span id="s6257">Some people just don’t believe.</span> <span id="s6258">You can’t say in words just what you have been through unless you can show it.</span> <span id="s6259">If you see the movies that show it, some of these movies may over dramatize it or at least you think that it is.</span> <span id="s6260">Actually it is not.</span> <span id="s6261">It was something that even now for us (who have gone through so much of it) is unbelievable!!</span> <span id="s6262">How could we live through all of it?</span> <span id="s6263">How could we have been so strong?</span> <span id="s6264">You see, this is what it is, talking.</span> <span id="s6265">I believe mentally, probably not physically, is good for us.</span> <span id="s6266">So that it does not remain inside of us.</span> <span id="s6267">I went just recently to a doctor and the doctor took me to the hospital for x-rays and tests.</span> <span id="s6268">I am happy that they didn’t see anything and didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s6269">My doctor said that it is the past which bothers me in my stomach., that is where the pain always is.</span> <span id="s6270">That it is the tension which comes when I think about it.</span> <span id="s6271">He says that it is better to write or to talk to someone about it than to think and pile it up inside.</span> <span id="s6272">After all these are private nerves and that is true.</span> <span id="s6273">That is why I say that it is not dead.</span> <span id="s6274">He said to me, “Write it down, write it in a letter to a friend and tell them whatever you have on your mind.</span> <span id="s6275">If you feel like crying, do cry.</span> <span id="s6276">It will make it easier.”</span> <span id="s6277">Q; It is better to cry out than to keep the pain inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s6278">A: Yes, that is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s6279">Q: Do you do that?</span> <span id="s6280">Can you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s6281">A: No.</span> <span id="s6282">I don’t do a lot of letter writing.</span> <span id="s6283">I went back to my doctor a few weeks ago.</span> <span id="s6284">I told him that I don’t do the writing but since the tragedy with my grandchild happened, the main thing is not to worry again.</span> <span id="s6285">If my constitution got over the Holocaust experiences, it will go over that now.</span></p> <p><span id="s6286">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s6287">Sometimes such very painful things can reawaken the feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s6288">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6289">It has done that.</span> <span id="s6290">Sometimes you wonder how many children, how many infant children like mine!</span> <span id="s6291">He was just seven months old, perished!</span></p> <p><span id="s6292">Q: What was the little boy’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6293">A: Josh!</span> <span id="s6294">Joshua.</span> <span id="s6295">And I think of the many children who died without doctor’s care just because they were babies born to Jewish parents.</span> <span id="s6296">Here, with my grandson, it was just a thing of “G-d”.</span> <span id="s6297">“G-d” meant it.</span> <span id="s6298">He didn’t give him life to live.</span> <span id="s6299">Something happened, who knows?</span> <span id="s6300">We had a doctor who did not recognize the symptoms.</span></p> <p><span id="s6301">Q: It probably would have been just as hard if you hadn’t had all the experiences when you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s6302">A: It is hard to lose a grandchild.</span> <span id="s6303">It is hard!</span> <span id="s6304">It is a terrifying experience.</span> <span id="s6305">The other grandparents, they are not Jewish, they came here.</span> <span id="s6306">It was Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s6307">We telephoned Chicago from the hospital and they arrived here Sunday.</span> <span id="s6308">Their hearts were just as broken as mine because it was their grandchild also.</span> <span id="s6309">However the other grandmother did not cry as much as I did.</span> <span id="s6310">I still do.</span> <span id="s6311">Maybe it was because she didn’t go through as much as I did, through so much pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s6312">Q: That is what I was wondering about.</span></p> <p><span id="s6313">A: You see, I am not crying now.</span> <span id="s6314">I do a lot of crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s6315">Q: I was listening to one of the earlier tapes.</span> <span id="s6316">You were telling me that sometimes you would wake up with a dream as if the Germans were chasing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s6317">A: I still do.</span> <span id="s6318">I do that even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s6319">Q: Is that coming out a little more now, after the loss of your grandson?</span></p> <p><span id="s6320">A: I still have the same dream and always somebody, either the Germans or the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s6321">Q: Is that a particular person who is running after you in the dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s6322">A: Yes, and I see the same people.</span> <span id="s6323">Do you know that not just in the dream, the same dream, I go up a stream which is so strong, and I am running so fast.</span> <span id="s6324">Here is a stream of water and here is a clearing, an empty space where there is no place to hide and I just want to reach a place where I can hide.</span> <span id="s6325">Here I jump over a big huge rock and again, there is water.</span> <span id="s6326">They are all the same places through which I have actually been.</span> <span id="s6327">They are chasing me and I see them running after me.</span> <span id="s6328">They want to catch me, however, they never catch me!</span></p> <p><span id="s6329">Q: There was the one time when you were by yourself going through the woods?</span> <span id="s6330">(Going back to Margi, etc. after being dismissed by the partisans).</span> <span id="s6331">Is that what it refers back to?</span> <span id="s6332">At a time when you had no friends around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s6333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6334">That and also when I went to look for my brother and before that, when I was living underground when we were eighteen people in one hole.</span> <span id="s6335">Within walking distance from there we could walk it but the place was wet, not a stream really just a swamp.</span> <span id="s6336">This is the same place which comes back to me.</span> <span id="s6337">It does look like it is the same place.</span> <span id="s6338">Then I go into the trenches and there I always get to a place where they no longer can find me.</span> <span id="s6339">It is not just me.</span> <span id="s6340">I see the same people whom I had seen alive and we knew each other.</span> <span id="s6341">These people are not alive any longer!</span> <span id="s6342">You are with them and then you are, all of a sudden, back by yourself!!</span> <span id="s6343">That is not only once in a great while, the dream happens often.</span> <span id="s6344">After that I wake up with a scream.</span> <span id="s6345">You wake up thinking, oh thank you, it was only a dream!!</span> <span id="s6346">I am here in a beautiful bed, comfortable.</span> <span id="s6347">Why am I so upset about it all?</span> <span id="s6348">It does make you kind of weak.</span> <span id="s6349">It makes you feel as if you were going through the whole thing in a few seconds.</span> <span id="s6350">That is all the time it takes for a whole life because of a few seconds is what the dream takes all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s6351">Q; You have probably told your doctor about this dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s6352">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s6353">That is why my doctor asks me to write about it.</span> <span id="s6354">He say, “Write about it.</span> <span id="s6355">Talk about it.</span> <span id="s6356">Don’t write and mail the letter.</span> <span id="s6357">Write it and read the letter to yourself then tear it up.</span> <span id="s6358">You don’t need to keep that letter and reread it.”</span> <span id="s6359">And then he tells me that I don’t have to read books which are depressing.</span> <span id="s6360">I tell him that I don’t read about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6361">That I read a lot of books and they are not really pertinent.</span> <span id="s6362">Most of the books are not really fresh as if they happened.</span> <span id="s6363">They are not interesting to read.</span> <span id="s6364">They are just about sex.</span> <span id="s6365">They are not real.</span> <span id="s6366">It is not a good book if it is not about troubles, if it does not include despair and you don’t have a love affair and you don’t have action.</span> <span id="s6367">Especially the latest of the books with nothing in it but cursing and expressions which I would never speak about.</span> <span id="s6368">I read these books and then I am ashamed of myself because I do, I read them.</span> <span id="s6369">These books may be fine for the younger people but they are certainly not fine for us.</span> <span id="s6370">We were raised differently.</span> <span id="s6371">However, now it is a different life and we get adjusted to it.</span> <span id="s6372">I also understand the young children, that they rebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s6373">Q: Should the younger people, your children, for example, or the grandchildren be told about that dream for instance or about this kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s6374">A: My children, they know!</span> <span id="s6375">Yes, we talk about that.</span> <span id="s6376">Our son is now moving to San Francisco from Chicago.</span> <span id="s6377">That is the oldest.</span> <span id="s6378">His company is moving him.</span> <span id="s6379">He calls me very often.</span> <span id="s6380">He wants to know, “Mom, how are you today?”</span> <span id="s6381">he knows about my pains, the pain I have inside myself.</span> <span id="s6382">He knows about what bothers me.</span> <span id="s6383">Maybe as the doctor says, I did mot achieve what I wanted for myself.</span> <span id="s6384">Maybe my goal was not fulfilled.</span> <span id="s6385">The doctor thinks so anyhow.</span> <span id="s6386">Truly, in a way, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s6387">in a way I missed out.</span> <span id="s6388">I had other dreams also.</span> <span id="s6389">I had a dream to become something so that I, myself, would be more successful than I am.</span> <span id="s6390">Actually, I shouldn’t complain.</span> <span id="s6391">I wish that a lot of American families would like the life I live.</span> <span id="s6392">It is a quiet life.</span> <span id="s6393">My children are very nice.</span> <span id="s6394">We are not poor, neither are we very rich but we are comfortable.</span> <span id="s6395">That means a lot!</span> <span id="s6396">I am grateful that I don’t have to count my pennies.</span> <span id="s6397">However, there is something which I missed.</span> <span id="s6398">Maybe that is why I have the dream.</span> <span id="s6399">The doctor also doesn’t know what.</span> <span id="s6400">I guess that I wanted more from my life.</span> <span id="s6401">I wanted to do something for myself.</span> <span id="s6402">I wanted to educate myself.</span> <span id="s6403">So now, I have pride in my children.</span> <span id="s6404">That my children achieved things.</span> <span id="s6405">That is easier for me.</span> <span id="s6406">I told that to the doctor.</span> <span id="s6407">You see one of my sons is with a big company.</span> <span id="s6408">The Battelle Corporation.</span> <span id="s6409">He is working with computers.</span> <span id="s6410">He has a very big job there.</span> <span id="s6411">The other is a dentist and he is doing very well.</span> <span id="s6412">The third one wants to be a dentist and he is in college right now.</span> <span id="s6413">So, I take pride in them.</span> <span id="s6414">That is nice.</span> <span id="s6415">It gives me a good feeling.</span> <span id="s6416">So, I say to my son, “My pain inside is what I have been through all my life.</span> <span id="s6417">It is not a cancer.</span> <span id="s6418">The doctor has assured me that it is not.</span> <span id="s6419">He tells me not to worry about it.</span> <span id="s6420">Just to take my medicine and to lead my life as normally as possible.</span> <span id="s6421">Not to think about the past.”</span> <span id="s6422">However, there is no way to do that.</span> <span id="s6423">For example, last night I had a dream about my father.</span> <span id="s6424">My father never comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s6425">Last night he came to me in my dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s6426">Q: He came to you in your dream for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s6427">A: For the first time in a very long time.</span> <span id="s6428">The last time was when the baby got taken ill.</span> <span id="s6429">That night we had a lot of guests.</span> <span id="s6430">Two of my sons are married and one has a girl friend.</span> <span id="s6431">My oldest son’s in-laws from Milwaukee WI.</span> <span id="s6432">were there also.</span> <span id="s6433">They were all in the house.</span> <span id="s6434">I had a very full house.</span> <span id="s6435">It was beautiful for the young people and they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s6436">Abe and I slept in the basement.</span> <span id="s6437">We have a bed there.</span> <span id="s6438">I gave up all the rooms and all the beds.</span> <span id="s6439">Then I had a bad dream.</span> <span id="s6440">Somehow, I shouldn’t believe it and I know that it is nonsense.</span> <span id="s6441">I woke up in the morning from a hard bed with very hard feelings.</span> <span id="s6442">I remembered that during the night I dreamed something unusual, with a train going by.</span> <span id="s6443">That someone stole a suitcase from me.</span> <span id="s6444">He took it away from me and I was yelling.</span> <span id="s6445">“Why are you taking this away from me?</span> <span id="s6446">It is mine!”</span> <span id="s6447">Then I held on to the other package.</span> <span id="s6448">You see that was Friday night and on Saturday morning the baby was very sick and we took him to the doctor.</span> <span id="s6449">He didn’t say much of anything.</span> <span id="s6450">He just said that the baby had bronchitis.</span> <span id="s6451">Actually the baby had double pneumonia and that evening he died.</span> <span id="s6452">There is something in a dream that is real.</span> <span id="s6453">The same thing is true with the dreams I have had, by my running in front of the same soldiers and the same police.</span> <span id="s6454">Wearing the German Swastika (she speaks about Hagenkreuz which is the German name) and I am running away from them.</span> <span id="s6455">.</span> <span id="s6456">I am running so fast that sometimes when I wake up it feels like I have been exerting my body.</span> <span id="s6457">Like I am at the end of my strength.</span> <span id="s6458">So many times, I feel that I cannot run any more.</span> <span id="s6459">That I will have to give up.</span> <span id="s6460">However, I never actually give up and I run fast so that they never catch me.</span> <span id="s6461">This is something which reoccurs because it is something which is in my mind, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s6462">Q: I believe so.</span> <span id="s6463">I can’t explain it any other way.</span> <span id="s6464">Telling about it does not seem to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s6465">A: I talk about it.</span> <span id="s6466">We talk about it.</span> <span id="s6467">However, it still comes back.</span> <span id="s6468">We talk about it with our friends who have been through similar experiences.</span> <span id="s6469">Through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6470">They all have dreams.</span> <span id="s6471">Not exactly like this but they all still have nightmares.</span> <span id="s6472">They all dream things from the past, from running away from camps.</span> <span id="s6473">A lot of people really dream.</span> <span id="s6474">Maybe they all think a lot about it.</span> <span id="s6475">Then at other times such as the Holy Days we relive and miss our past, our homes.</span> <span id="s6476">Even though they were poor.</span> <span id="s6477">It was so beautiful (at least in our memories).</span> <span id="s6478">It is something which I cannot explain!</span></p> <p><span id="s6479">Q: When your father comes into your dreams, what kind of feeling do you have for him?</span> <span id="s6480">Is he calm or is he agitated?</span></p> <p><span id="s6481">A: He is fine.</span> <span id="s6482">He is calm and I don’t remember what he say to me but he is in such a good mood.</span> <span id="s6483">I see him and I am so glad about it.</span> <span id="s6484">My father died now over forty years ago.</span> <span id="s6485">Just on the day which the war started, September first.</span> <span id="s6486">Of course, he had been sick the entire summer.</span> <span id="s6487">He was in bed and I was the only one at home.</span> <span id="s6488">I was young, only twelve years old then.</span> <span id="s6489">Of course, I saw him a lot.</span> <span id="s6490">At that time, in Poland.</span> <span id="s6491">It was not like here.</span> <span id="s6492">You had to lay in bed and someone had to take care of you.</span> <span id="s6493">I was so glad that he came (to me, in my dreams) and that I saw him.</span> <span id="s6494">That I didn’t forget his face.</span> <span id="s6495">It was so good!</span> <span id="s6496">It was something out of the blue!</span> <span id="s6497">I hadn’t even thought about my father recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s6498">Q: Was this dream after the child died?</span></p> <p><span id="s6499">A: The dream with my father was just last night!</span></p> <p><span id="s6500">Q: Oh, just last night?</span></p> <p><span id="s6501">A: Yes, just this past night.</span> <span id="s6502">I had just that dream.</span> <span id="s6503">I was just so glad.</span> <span id="s6504">It made me feel good, that I see him.</span> <span id="s6505">That I miss him and that I love him.</span> <span id="s6506">That I didn’t forget his face when he appeared to me.</span> <span id="s6507">For example, speaking of dream.</span> <span id="s6508">When I went from Germany to Israel on the ship and I am not a deeply religious person.</span> <span id="s6509">I had never had time to pick up the religion except for what I remember from my mother.</span> <span id="s6510">This dream about which I am talking was in Marseille, France where we were waiting for the ship.</span> <span id="s6511">I met a man with a long beard and I could not recall what my grandfather looked like.</span> <span id="s6512">Anyhow, somebody, a man with a long beard came to me in my dream and said, “Child, why don’t you kindle the Shabbos candles?</span> <span id="s6513">It is Friday.”</span> <span id="s6514">It was actually not Friday but I ran right away to the man who was in charge of our group and told him about my dream.</span> <span id="s6515">The man gave me a box of candles.</span> <span id="s6516">After that, even on the ship and the ship was going up and down and front-wards and backwards, so badly that everything slid over.</span> <span id="s6517">I lit candles every Friday evening.</span> <span id="s6518">I have never stopped.</span> <span id="s6519">It is a religious custom to light candles on Friday evening and I will not do otherwise, and maybe because of that dream I still kindle Sabbath lights.</span> <span id="s6520">I believe that I would do it otherwise also.</span> <span id="s6521">After all, it is not a big deal to do and it looks beautiful in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s6522">Q: As you know, your father’s name is on the tape.</span> <span id="s6523">It is Avraham Avarowicz.</span> <span id="s6524">So, when someone goes to the library and listens to the tape sometimes or consults this transcript, his name will be there.</span> <span id="s6525">I believe that that is important.</span> <span id="s6526">I am so glad that you told all these things on the tape so that we have a complete story.</span> <span id="s6527">Now, what should we tell the children?</span> <span id="s6528">That is, to the children for whom all this is new.</span> <span id="s6529">So new that they will hardly be able to believe it.</span> <span id="s6530">Perhaps all they know is the TV show “The Holocaust” and maybe they don’t even know that.</span> <span id="s6531">What shall we tell the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s6532">A: The children should be told the story the exact same way we are telling it now.</span> <span id="s6533">I say it in plain language, not just dramatized from a television show.</span> <span id="s6534">The people who went through that period, they can’t tell it exactly.</span> <span id="s6535">I, myself, as being a young person then, could not recall or tell about each single day.</span> <span id="s6536">In one day you could tell a story for hours to relive it.</span> <span id="s6537">Actually not just in one day, during one day so many things happened so that you cannot recall it exactly and tell it.</span> <span id="s6538">However, life went on and we struggled to survive.</span> <span id="s6539">The drive to live was so keen that you try to live no matter what in order to see your sister or your brother or your mother, father or relatives dying, and you run away to hide just to survive.</span> <span id="s6540">You just didn’t go with them if you could.</span> <span id="s6541">A mother pushed her children away so that they may remain alive for another hour or another day.</span> <span id="s6542">Just something to tell the enemy, “I got you, you didn’t get me!</span> <span id="s6543">I got you!</span> <span id="s6544">You didn’t kill me although you wanted so much to do it but I am alive and I will stay alive.”</span> <span id="s6545">This is something which the children should know.</span> <span id="s6546">Then they would know what life is all about!</span> <span id="s6547">No matter how and no matter how bad it is, as each day went by we only hoped that the next day maybe, maybe something will happen.</span> <span id="s6548">This is what kept us alive if at night we heard just an airplane flying we thought, “Maybe something is happening somewhere!</span> <span id="s6549">Maybe somebody is going to come!</span> <span id="s6550">Maybe something good is going to happen!”</span> <span id="s6551">it was just like a good dream for a while and then something else happened and the hope had to be deferred.</span> <span id="s6552">The children should know about that from us.</span> <span id="s6553">Only we, who went through this can tell them the truth.</span> <span id="s6554">Even we won’t tell all of it because you can’t recall everything in detail.</span> <span id="s6555">If I could write I would add things in order to share more experiences with the children.</span> <span id="s6556">I would share with the children the experiences about what I went through.</span> <span id="s6557">If I would give and describe all my experiences a year or two years after they happened that would be different.</span> <span id="s6558">Now, after all, thirty-five years have passed since these things happened.</span> <span id="s6559">As you said, “Time heals a little!”</span> <span id="s6560">We don’t forget, but it heals a little.</span> <span id="s6561">I had different problems in life with different things.</span> <span id="s6562">Even now, we have problems, a lot of problems which wake up the old pain.</span> <span id="s6563">However, our children should not forget!</span> <span id="s6564">The main thing is that the children should not forget.</span> <span id="s6565">Not just our children but al the children of the world.</span> <span id="s6566">Future generations, let them realize that it was truly something unbelievable.</span> <span id="s6567">In a world of culture, in a century which it happened, it is impossible to comprehend!</span> <span id="s6568">Especially from people, not from animals.</span> <span id="s6569">Especially from intelligent, educated people like the Germans!!</span> <span id="s6570">After all, the Germans are beautiful people.</span> <span id="s6571">It was Hitler, the fascism which made them behave like that.</span> <span id="s6572">They went wild.</span> <span id="s6573">(If there had not been dormant anti-Semitism and anti-humanitarian feelings, it would not have been possible to create such bestial behavior.</span> <span id="s6574">Not only against the Jews, many of whom had been family neighbors for centuries from thin air in less than one decade, but also for all Slavic people.</span> <span id="s6575">After all, Hitler and his people did not reach power until 1933).</span></p> <p><span id="s6576">Q: One of the things which comes to my mind now is a reaction to one of the earlier tapes.</span> <span id="s6577">It was about that neighbor, I believe that it was the same lady who used to say to you when you were twelve or thirteen, “Oh, if I could only help you.</span> <span id="s6578">If I could only save you.</span> <span id="s6579">If I could only do something.”</span> <span id="s6580">Wasn’t she the same one who when you were hiding in the house or those two days attempted to give your hiding place away?</span></p> <p><span id="s6581">A: No, the lady who said that was the lady who used to take care of us when we were small children while my mother was busy in the shop.</span> <span id="s6582">She was from a village not far from us.</span> <span id="s6583">We could walk over a little stream and we were there.</span> <span id="s6584">It was a small village with a different name.</span> <span id="s6585">it was a tiny village, just all on one street.</span> <span id="s6586">However, they had farms and land suitable to be farmed.</span> <span id="s6587">This lady had a truly beautiful orchard.</span> <span id="s6588">She lived in a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s6589">She had seen us growing up and kind of nurtured us.</span> <span id="s6590">She was so very good to me!!</span> <span id="s6591">She felt that if she could save me it wouldn’t be all lost but she could not even do that!</span> <span id="s6592">She was afraid of her own neighbors.</span> <span id="s6593">She did not have a place where she could hide me.</span></p> <p><span id="s6594">Q: I am glad I asked because I had confused the two ladies.</span></p> <p><span id="s6595">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s6596">The other one was our next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s6597">She lived just next door and whose son worked for the police.</span> <span id="s6598">She is the one who said, “The Jews are in the attic.”</span> <span id="s6599">But who fortunately could only say it in White Russian dialect.</span></p> <p><span id="s6600">Q: Do you know whatever happened to the lady who took care of you when you were small?</span></p> <p><span id="s6601">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s6602">When I came back to Kurzeniez I went through that village but I didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s6603">They were not there then.</span> <span id="s6604">I never did find out what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s6605">Q: She was not Jewish was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s6606">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s6607">I don’t remember what kind of religion they were.</span> <span id="s6608">Thinking about it, she was Protestant and her husband was Catholic.</span> <span id="s6609">You see, then it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s6610">You see, at that time when I was very small child it didn’t matter that much.</span> <span id="s6611">Things were still quiet in Poland.</span> <span id="s6612">Religion was not an issue then.</span> <span id="s6613">People were neighbors and even if they were not neighbors, we were living in harmony.</span> <span id="s6614">Nobody really cared as to which church you went to.</span> <span id="s6615">However, later which I vaguely remember as I was getting older after Pilsudski died (in May 1926 Marshal Pilsudski seized power in Poland after a two day military revolt and made himself dictator.</span> <span id="s6616">He had a new constitution drawn up in 1935 shortly before Pilsudski’s death.</span> <span id="s6617">He was followed as dictator by Marshal Smigly-Rydz who governed with Josef Be?</span> <span id="s6618">and a group of colonels).</span> <span id="s6619">Starting in 1936 and 1937 the anti-Semitism started.</span> <span id="s6620">( At that time, there were more than three million Jews in Poland.)</span> <span id="s6621">It was under the influence of Germany.</span> <span id="s6622">Germany had their people working in Poland.</span> <span id="s6623">Then it started already but still with neighbors it wasn’t all that bad.</span> <span id="s6624">At least in our part of Poland.</span> <span id="s6625">Remember that the entire Kurzeniez was a Stetl.</span> <span id="s6626">A little place in which relatively many Jews lived.</span> <span id="s6627">There were very few Jews living in the area around Kurzeniez.</span></p> <p><span id="s6628">Q: Were these people able to erase the dream of those Germans coming in to a Judenrein area (area clean of Jews) Is that dream still in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s6629">A: You see, the problem was that they didn’t have too many good people.</span> <span id="s6630">If we had had good people like we had at the memorial for the six million Jews (three million Polish Jews were among the victims of the Nazis’) recently, many would have been saved.</span> <span id="s6631">A young lady from Belgium, I believe (the transcriber believes that she was from Holland) she had been young in 1940 talked.</span> <span id="s6632">If we had had ten percent of the people of Poland like her, a lot of Jews and a lot of other people would have been saved.</span> <span id="s6633">This young lady got involved because of small children.</span> <span id="s6634">She had been the teacher of a nursery school.</span> <span id="s6635">The SS came and took the children away.</span> <span id="s6636">That is when she got involved and since then she has been involved with Jewish problems.</span> <span id="s6637">She spoke and told why and her speech was heart moving, even though she had a strong accent.</span> <span id="s6638">It was just beautiful!</span> <span id="s6639">She was a beautiful lady.</span> <span id="s6640">You see, this was the problem in Poland and in other countries also.</span> <span id="s6641">People helped the Germans as if it was a job for them.</span> <span id="s6642">As if they were proud to do it.</span> <span id="s6643">The few people who helped the victims were overshadowed by all those who didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s6644">Q: As I look back on the questions which I was going to ask for this session I really believe that you talked about it all.</span> <span id="s6645">And you did it very much better than I could have asked the questions.</span> <span id="s6646">Do you feel, after all, you have told me and told the people who will listen to this (and who will read it) that the children will benefit by this ordeal.</span> <span id="s6647">That all the bad memories which you have had to call upon will have been worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s6648">A: Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s6649">I think so.</span> <span id="s6650">I think that if they will listen to it, it will serve as a reminder.</span> <span id="s6651">Some of them, maybe a few, since there are always bad fish in the sea, maybe will spoil it for the rest of them.</span> <span id="s6652">However, on the whole, I believe that the future generations will learn from it.</span> <span id="s6653">It was a big mistake.</span> <span id="s6654">Nothing was accomplished by it.</span> <span id="s6655">They will never, no matter who tries, destroy the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s6656">If “G-d” had wanted to destroy the Jewish people he would have done it a long time ago.</span> <span id="s6657">He probably wouldn’t have created them in the first place.</span> <span id="s6658">No matter who will try to do it, there will always be Jews around and people who care for them and go along with them.</span> <span id="s6659">even help them.</span> <span id="s6660">Especially in comparison with non-Jews, we are just a few.</span> <span id="s6661">Really, just a handful.</span> <span id="s6662">It is just like a drop in the bucket.</span> <span id="s6663">There are not enough of them to make such a noise about.</span> <span id="s6664">I could not understand why, of course, at that time, I was a child, they picked on the Jews.</span> <span id="s6665">What did they do wrong?</span> <span id="s6666">Hitler didn’t originate his policy because we were Jews and because, as the fables said, the Jews killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s6667">That is a falsehood which has been repeated for so many decades, even centuries.</span> <span id="s6668">Why should I suffer for something which supposedly happened two thousand years ago in a completely irrelevant environment and circumstance.</span> <span id="s6669">Why should a baby today be killed by such a horrible death because of some political intrigues?</span> <span id="s6670">We are all “G-d’s” children, after all!</span> <span id="s6671">(The Nazis managed to kill over three million non-Jewish Poles besides the three million Jewish Poles all in concentration camps and more than twenty million Russians killed or wounded during WWII according to figures listed in the World Book Encyclopedia.</span> <span id="s6672">Some of these killings were described earlier in this story when RF talks about the machine gunning of the Russian prisoners which caused the survivors to escape and become partisans).</span> <span id="s6673">Look how they killed our Rabbi in the centerplace of Kurzeniez.</span> <span id="s6674">What had he done wrong?</span> <span id="s6675">He also was a man dedicated to serve “G-d” as Jesus Christ was.</span> <span id="s6676">We are all G-d’s-” children, even those who don’t believe in Christ or who are not Jews.</span> <span id="s6677">Even people who don’t believe in anything or those who are idol worshippers.</span> <span id="s6678">They all have their lives and are entitled to live them.</span> <span id="s6679">Why should anybody be able to kill someone else just because they don’t like them.</span> <span id="s6680">If you don’t like me just don’t associate with me.</span> <span id="s6681">That is all you need to do.</span> <span id="s6682">So maybe children, the future generations will learn.</span> <span id="s6683">The whole thing was not the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s6684">Q: I certainly hope so!</span></p> <p><span id="s6685">A: Let’s hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s6686">Q: I am not certain that this will be the last tape we will make.</span> <span id="s6687">I think that it will be, but please before this tape runs out, please say your father’s name.</span> <span id="s6688">Your mother’s name and also the last name of each of your children and then the name of your grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s6689">A: My father’s name was Avraham, Abraham in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s6690">My mother’s name was Channamaya Gunemovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s6691">I am Rachel and my husband is Abe.</span></p> <p><span id="s6692">My children are Maurice, Isaac, Lewis.</span> <span id="s6693">Maurice is married to June and Isaac is married to Jean.</span></p> <p><span id="s6694">My grandchildren are Jason, the son of my older son whose twin brother Joshua died and Sarah is the daughter of my second son.</span></p> <p><span id="s6695">Q: Now the names are part of the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s6696">A: That is fine.</span> <span id="s6697">Maybe someday Sarah will read it or listen to it.</span> <span id="s6698">Maybe some day Jason who was just three years old last week will say, “I want to see what happened to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s6699">What her life was like.”</span></p> <p><span id="s6700">Q: Then he will have these tapes.</span> <span id="s6701">They will be part of your family’s possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s6702">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6703">They may want to know.</span> <span id="s6704">That is like my daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s6705">She is not really a writer but she is writing professionally as a journalist.</span> <span id="s6706">She reads books.</span> <span id="s6707">Their entire house is just filled with books.</span> <span id="s6708">She said that someday she might write a book.</span> <span id="s6709">Her parents are newcomers to the U.S. also.</span> <span id="s6710">They also are survivors.</span> <span id="s6711">Two babies of her parents died during the war and my daughter-in-law was born after the war.</span> <span id="s6712">They are Maurice’s in-laws.</span> <span id="s6713">Maybe someday June will write a book about life in general.</span> <span id="s6714">I believe June’s mother has been interviewed for this project by someone else.</span> <span id="s6715">She gets very upset about it.</span> <span id="s6716">So it may not have happened.</span> <span id="s6717">We all get nervous about it and that is truly not a wonder.</span> <span id="s6718">I am left with the pain and I cannot get rid of it no matter what I have and how beautiful it is.</span> <span id="s6719">It truly couldn’t be any better and I never expected all of this but still it is truly overshadowed by the past.</span> <span id="s6720">We try to get over it.</span> <span id="s6721">We try to do what we can for our children.</span></p> <p><span id="s6722">Q: I guess we were able to finish this just before the tape ran out.</span></p></body></html>
