Before you go on with the story of the war, tell us a little more about your childhood.</span> <span id="s27">What was the community like?</span> <span id="s28">What was your schooling like?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We um...we lived in a very Jewish neighborhood in Antwerpen.</span> <span id="s30">As I said, my grandmother took care of me.</span> <span id="s31">She was a very religious woman.</span> <span id="s32">And so she lived in a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s33">And I had lots of little friends.</span> <span id="s34">And um...we played.</span> <span id="s35">I remember playing in the streets in our neighborhood; and...and there was a very Jewish comm...um, um community there, with shuls and everything.</span> <span id="s36">And everything was open and free, and I was very very happy there.</span> <span id="s37">And um...it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:02:23</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: And I went to school in kinder... I remember going to kindergarten, and then into the elementary school.</span> <span id="s41">And then when um my grandmother got sick, my...and died...my mother had to come and get me from Brussels.</span> <span id="s42">Um, my mother took care of my brother and my sister, who were older of...of me, in Brussels.</span> <span id="s43">Being that my father was here in America--he came here before the war--um, my mother had a hard time raising the three children.</span> <span id="s44">So I was split up; and my grandma took care of me, being that I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s45">And my mother took care of my brother and my sister in Brussels.</span> <span id="s46">There in Brussels, my mother had um an apartment.</span> <span id="s47">Uh, we lived right in the heart of Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">And um my mother had a atelier, which means like a working...a workshop.</span> <span id="s49">And um she made raincoats.</span> <span id="s50">Um, in Belgium it rains a lot; and um a lot of people used to make raincoats there.</span> <span id="s51">And we made it from scratch, from... And um we sewed and we glued; and they made raincoats.</span> <span id="s52">And that's how she made a living.</span> <span id="s53">And um when I came there in 1939, um I was a year with my mother.</span> <span id="s54">When one morning in 1940, I woke up early in the morning hearing um noises and didn't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">01:04:04 And I heard: pouff.</span> <span id="s56">Um, like explosions.</span> <span id="s57">And um we went to the window and we looked up in the sky, and there I saw white um clouds--like puffs, like snowballs.</span> <span id="s58">And um I realized it was like from um cannon balls.</span> <span id="s59">Or whatever, I don't know.</span> <span id="s60">We ran down the street; and people came down and we were all in the streets.</span> <span id="s61">And we found out that the um Germans were invading um Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">01:04:40 And um it was early spring.</span> <span id="s63">In May.</span> <span id="s64">And um mid-afternoon, the Germans walked down, in parade, into the main street of Brussels.</span> <span id="s65">And this is how they came in and invaded Belgium.</span> <span id="s66">And that's when our troubles started, with the Jewish people in Brussels.</span> <span id="s67">They started very slowly with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s68">Because they were afraid um to start very hard on us, because they were afraid of rebellion.</span> <span id="s69">They did not know how the reaction would be from the Belgian people.</span> <span id="s70">So they started the curfew, and with um yellow patch- -we had to wear the yellow patch, which meant...which said "Jude.”</span> <span id="s71">And we had um to give ...um all information about ourselves we had to give them.</span> <span id="s72">And um we had to give up um our um... I don't know if we had to give up our passports or not; but um I knew there was...I know that there was curfew.</span> <span id="s73">And um they started asking for volunteer jobs.</span> <span id="s74">People should volunteer, and give um um for jobs to go to um Germany to work.</span> <span id="s75">And a lot of people thought that if they would um go and volunteer, that they um would be safe.</span> <span id="s76">So a lot of people volunteered and went away, and we never heard about them again.</span> <span id="s77">So the people were scared.</span> <span id="s78">After that, when they saw they didn't get any volunteers, they started raiding sections of um neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s79">And this was um in 1942.</span> <span id="s80">At that time, I was very very lucky; because um I developed... I..</span> <span id="s81">.</span> <span id="s82">I was a little girl who always suffered of tonsillitis, and being the condition of...um the situation the way it was, my mother was afraid if anything should happen to me that um I would get very sick, and I would... Um, God knows what would happen.</span> <span id="s83">She says, "Lilly needs her tonsils out.”</span> <span id="s84">So she put me in the hospital to take my tonsils out.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">01:07:12 And um in the meantime, she had made arrangements with a lady who worked in mother's um atelier--in her shop--that she knew.</span> <span id="s86">She was a Belgian lady.</span> <span id="s87">She worked for my mother many, many years.</span> <span id="s88">And um she said she was going to help my sister, Marja, find a place to hide.</span> <span id="s89">Because the Germans were getting very um um--how should I say?</span> <span id="s90">They tried to pick up people in the streets, and um and they were already um grabbing people everywhere to put them into transports and send them away.</span> <span id="s91">So my mother wanted to um save my sister; and this lady said, um, "I will help find a place for her.”</span> <span id="s92">And sure enough, one day she came and she says, "I have an address where Marja can go and hide.</span> <span id="s93">It is out in the country.</span> <span id="s94">And this man is a farmer, and he will keep Marja until after the war.”</span> <span id="s95">So my mother was very grateful.</span> <span id="s96">She made um a suitcase ready for her, and sent her off to that farm with this woman.</span> <span id="s97">And while I was in the hospital, one day my mother came to visit me.</span> <span id="s98">And I could see that she had been crying, and she was very sad.</span> <span id="s99">I says, "Ma, what's the matter?</span> <span id="s100">Why are you crying?"</span> <span id="s101">So she broke down, and she told me that Marja had been taken.</span> <span id="s102">I says, "How come?"</span> <span id="s103">I said, um, "You put her away to be hiding in...in...in a farm.”</span> <span id="s104">She says, "The man denounced her.”</span> <span id="s105">"How did he...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Why?</span> <span id="s107">," I asked.</span> <span id="s108">And um later, I found out as I got older from my family, he tried to um force my sister they should have relationships with her.</span> <span id="s109">And my sister was young, and...and she said, "No.</span> <span id="s110">I'd rather go to the Germans.”</span> <span id="s111">She said, "I'm...I'm...I'm not going to have any of that.</span> <span id="s112">And um I..</span> <span id="s113">.</span> <span id="s114">I will not let you do this to me.”</span> <span id="s115">And he threatened her; and he says, "If you don't," he says, "I'm going to denounce you!"</span> <span id="s116">And sure enough, he did denounce her.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">01:09:40 And the reason how we know it is because a postal card came to us.</span> <span id="s118">When she was um taken out of um to transport from Belgium to um the camp, she had slipped a postal card through...through the cracks of the cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s119">And um early in the morning as people were going to work and the farmers were going to work in their fields, they would pick up notes and cards that people dropped from the um wagons.</span> <span id="s120">And um this is how we got our card from my sister, saying, "Beware of this woman, because she she took me to this man who wanted to have relationship with me.</span> <span id="s121">And I wouldn't give in, and I got denounced.”</span> <span id="s122">So my mother being very naïve about it; and um she seeked that woman out and made problems for her.</span> <span id="s123">And sure enough, that woman denounced my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s124">And how she did it is this way.</span> <span id="s125">I had a grandfather, who--in those days, in 1942, they didn't bother with the old people.</span> <span id="s126">They wanted the young people.</span> <span id="s127">So my mother and my brother, who was left, they um went and took um a furnished room someplace and hid.</span> <span id="s128">And they left my grandfather in the apartment where my mother lived originally.</span> <span id="s129">But she knew my...my um Zayde--which is my grandfather--had no food, and she worried over him.</span> <span id="s130">So she went and cooked him some soup, and she was going to bring it to him to eat.</span> <span id="s131">And as she turned around the corner from the street and our apartment building was right at the corner, she saw the Germans waiting there for her.</span> <span id="s132">This woman knew that my mother was bringing soup to my [grand]father; and um my mother was caught right there and then.</span> <span id="s133">My...my mother and my brother ran across the street into a grocery store.</span> <span id="s134">And the Germans came after her in that little store, and they took her away.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">01:12:10 The reason I know about this is because--um I have to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s136">When um I came out of the hospital, I had an aunt who was hiding out in the country.</span> <span id="s137">She said to my mother, "Bring Lilly to me, so she can recuperate from her tonsil um operation.</span> <span id="s138">And let her stay with me a few days.”</span> <span id="s139">So while I was recuperating and staying with my mother-- um, with my aunt--excuse me--a..</span> <span id="s140">.</span> <span id="s141">a call came to us from neighbors from our street.</span> <span id="s142">From gentile people.</span> <span id="s143">And told my aunt, "Do not bring Lilly back to this address, because her mother and brother were just taken away.”</span> <span id="s144">And this is how I stayed with my aunt and my uncle, and in hiding in, out in the country.</span> <span id="s145">Which is the outskirts of Brussels.</span> <span id="s146">And um um...and I was hiding there until 1944.</span> <span id="s147">In the meantime, the rest of my family were taken.</span> <span id="s148">Little by little, they picked them up; and they were all caught.</span> <span id="s149">Except this aunt of mine who kept me, and another aunt.</span> <span id="s150">Another aunt, she had two little girls and she gave them to um um...not an orphanage...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: A convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: ...um, a convent.</span> <span id="s153">And um the convent kept them for a little bit.</span> <span id="s154">Then they got very very nervous about it; and they called my aunt, and um my aunt had to place the children someplace else.</span> <span id="s155">So she finally hired a lady who was willing to um take care of those two children while my aunt was um doing housework for gentile people and pretending she was Christian.</span> <span id="s156">She would do housework, and she would pay that lady every month.</span> <span id="s157">And she kept those two children.</span> <span id="s158">And um so I was in hiding with my other aunt.</span> <span id="s159">And in order to survive--because the money was running out a little bit--and um...and to make ends meet, the people who um we lived with in our apartment building um knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s160">And um they said, "Lilly, let's call you Lilliane from now on.”</span> <span id="s161">They were very, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s162">And they liked me very much, and they helped me as much as they could.</span> <span id="s163">And um and life was really not that bad while I was in hiding with my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:15:02 There was a little factory right next to us.</span> <span id="s165">And um when the Germans um came into Brussels and raided us, they um took over that factory and they started making camouflage for the army.</span> <span id="s166">So this man um knew that I was hiding.</span> <span id="s167">And he says, "Lilly, come in and work for me.</span> <span id="s168">Nobody will know that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s169">And whatever you make will help you to buy groceries.”</span> <span id="s170">And so I did this.</span> <span id="s171">And um...so one day--I'll never forget--one day, um the owner of these people said, um, "Lilly, I'm entertaining um German people tonight for dinner.</span> <span id="s172">And they're big to-do people, and I would like you to come and do um the dishes and help us in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s173">You won't have to come in the living room, but you'll be just in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s174">In the meantime, while I was doing the work during the day in that little factory, I also was doing part-time um...I was doing manicuring in a beauty shop up the street.</span> <span id="s175">And I was making tips.</span> <span id="s176">And all this helped me in that I could give that money to my aunt and my uncle for food.</span> <span id="s177">So I learned to make manicuring.</span> <span id="s178">And so I um couldn't say no to the people, because I was grateful that they were giving me the job.</span> <span id="s179">But I says, "I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s180">I'm scared to be near them.”</span> <span id="s181">He says, "Lilly, I assure you that nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s182">I will not tell the Germans that um you are there, that you... I'll just say that you're a little girl helping me.”</span> <span id="s183">So I did.</span> <span id="s184">And um while I was doing the dishes and after dessert time, the owner comes into the kitchen and he says, "Lilly, I have a request.”</span> <span id="s185">I says, "What is it?"</span> <span id="s186">He says, "I told them that you are an apprentice in um...in a beauty shop, and that you do manicuring.</span> <span id="s187">And one of the officers wants you should do him...give him a manicure.”</span> <span id="s188">Well, I almost died from fright.</span> <span id="s189">I says, "How can I?"</span> <span id="s190">He says, "You pretend that you're...you don't have to speak to them.</span> <span id="s191">Just give them a manicure, and you get out.”</span> <span id="s192">So I um...I was there, I couldn't say no.</span> <span id="s193">And believe it or not, I sat down and I gave this German a manicure.</span> <span id="s194">How I didn't cut his fingers, I don't know.</span> <span id="s195">But I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s196">How I said to myself, "You should only know that a Jewish girl is giving him a manicure!"</span> <span id="s197">And he was so happy, and he so was...that I gave him his manicure that he even gave me a tip.</span> <span id="s198">But this is just a sideline of a little story of what went on in my life, that I want to bring that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">01:18:14 As the the years...in...in 1940...from 1942 to '44, at the end it was getting real tough on us.</span> <span id="s200">And um as we were struggling to survive, one day I came home from work and the people downstairs told us that we have to get out.</span> <span id="s201">Why?</span> <span id="s202">There was a new tenant that moved in and found out that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s203">And they were going to denounce us.</span> <span id="s204">And they said they know that the Germans are going to come and pick us up at night.</span> <span id="s205">So my aunt and my uncle had to leave.</span> <span id="s206">And the owners from the um factory said, "Lilly, you are going to stay with me until your aunt and uncle find a place.”</span> <span id="s207">So that night, I went and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s208">It so happens that their apartment was next door to us.</span> <span id="s209">Their side of the wall was our side of the wall from our apartment.</span> <span id="s210">And that night, sure enough, the Germans came with the trucks and came into our apartment.</span> <span id="s211">And they were so angry to...not to find us there.</span> <span id="s212">They threw furniture.</span> <span id="s213">They opened drawers.</span> <span id="s214">I heard them scream and I heard them knock; and I heard the apartment, the wall was shaking from um...from the noises and the...the things they were throwing around in the apartment.</span> <span id="s215">And I was shaking in bed.</span> <span id="s216">And I was laying there; and um the owner jumped to look out the window.</span> <span id="s217">The woman laid next to me, and she held my hand.</span> <span id="s218">And she kept saying to me, "Lilly, please... Lilly, pray to your God that they don't find us.</span> <span id="s219">Pray to your God that they don't find us; because they're going to kill us, shoot us, and they'll take you away.”</span> <span id="s220">And she kept screaming at her husband to get away from the window.</span> <span id="s221">"They'll see you, and they'll come here.”</span> <span id="s222">But sure enough, nobody told them where I was.</span> <span id="s223">Nobody from the um apartment.</span> <span id="s224">And um they took off.</span> <span id="s225">And they um put a seal on the apartment door, so that we should not come in.</span> <span id="s226">Because they were going to confiscate whatever there was in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">01:20:40 I did not know where to go.</span> <span id="s228">One of the girls that I acquainted while I was working there in the factory liked me very much.</span> <span id="s229">A Belgian girl.</span> <span id="s230">And she said to me, "Lilly, you come and stay with me.</span> <span id="s231">While your aunt and uncle will stay in an apartment wherever they will live, but you'll stay with me.</span> <span id="s232">And nobody will ever know that you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s233">And my aunt was so happy that um this girl had um offered for me to stay that she let me do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Well, after um two weeks I was so worried about my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s235">I didn't know how they were coming along.</span> <span id="s236">One Sunday morning, I decided to um um go and visit them.</span> <span id="s237">So I took the streetcars, and I went in to their neighborhood where they were hiding.</span> <span id="s238">And they had a small two bedroom--um, two room um little um um apartment.</span> <span id="s239">It was just two little rooms--a kitchen and a bedroom.</span> <span id="s240">And I stayed with them, and I had dinner.</span> <span id="s241">And um I wanted to go back to the girl's house.</span> <span id="s242">And my uncle said, "No, Lilly, stay over and sleep.</span> <span id="s243">Because it's getting late.</span> <span id="s244">I don't want you to go through that section where you...um where we live here, because the um the men are just sitting out in the streets and drinking beer.</span> <span id="s245">And I don't want you to walk through them.”</span> <span id="s246">Because it was like um a low-graded neighborhood where they were hiding in, and he was afraid for me to walk there by myself.</span> <span id="s247">And it was getting dark.</span> <span id="s248">My aunt encouraged me to go; and she was arguing with my uncle.</span> <span id="s249">And my uncle said, "No, I don't want her to go.”</span> <span id="s250">Finally my aunt let in, and... "Where is she going to sleep?"</span> <span id="s251">"She is...I'm going to make a bed for her on the floor near the kitchen door.</span> <span id="s252">She'll sleep there on the floor.”</span> <span id="s253">Sure enough, I deci...they decided I should sleep there.</span> <span id="s254">So I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s255">And early in the morning, I heard this terrible banging at my door, on...at the head of my door.</span> <span id="s256">And I jumped up, and I looked out of the window.</span> <span id="s257">And there were the Germans standing with the um rifles up high like this, shooting in case somebody wants to jump out of a window.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">01:23:08 And I had to open up the door, and there they came in.</span> <span id="s259">And they took us away with a..</span> <span id="s260">.</span> <span id="s261">with a truck.</span> <span id="s262">And they put us in a jail, where they gathered us together with people.</span> <span id="s263">We were crammed into a small little jail.</span> <span id="s264">I don't know how many people were there.</span> <span id="s265">We couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s266">We hardly could breath.</span> <span id="s267">We couldn't go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s268">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s269">We heard screams from other cells.</span> <span id="s270">And finally, by dawn, they took us with another truck and they brought us to another place called Malines, which is a small town between Brussels and Antwerpen.Malines is a place that used to be a caserne [Trans: "barracks"].</span> <span id="s271">A caserne is like um um...an army place, where um they--an armory.</span> <span id="s272">Years ago they used to have horses there, I found out.</span> <span id="s273">The reason I found out is because five years ago, for the first time, I went back with my husband to Belgium.</span> <span id="s274">And I..</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">and I found out about that.</span> <span id="s277">And um...and they made a jail...um they made a um um--how should I say?</span> <span id="s278">A..</span> <span id="s279">.</span> <span id="s280">a camp for...a place for to keep all the people they gathered together from Belgium, from Brussels.</span> <span id="s281">And when they had enough of a transport, they transported us from there to the camps.</span> <span id="s282">And so we were kept in that place, in Malines.</span> <span id="s283">Maybe I was there about six weeks.</span> <span id="s284">We were sleeping on straw um pads, bags like that.</span> <span id="s285">And um...and we had rationed food.</span> <span id="s286">And um...and we were...we weren't doing anything.</span> <span id="s287">Every once in a while, even there when a transport would come in, I would hear screams and carrying on from they were torturing people next door for them to find information.</span> <span id="s288">But um until they had enough people--maybe about three, four hundred people, the most five, I think-- they made a transport and they sended us off.</span> <span id="s289">And that was in 1944, when I was deported 1 Also: Mechelen (Flemish), or Mechlin (English).</span> <span id="s290">This was a police detention camp (Polizeihaftlager) used as a transit camp (Durchgangslager) for Jews between August 1942 and July 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">out of Brussels--I mean, Malines.</span> <span id="s292">And what I found out afterwards, that I was the second um last transport.</span> <span id="s293">I was the twenty-fifth transport that left Malines.</span> <span id="s294">And after that, there was one more transport; and then Belgium was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">01:26:01 When I was um...when I went into the transport, they gave us bread; and the younger children received a can of milk.</span> <span id="s296">I remember my aunt would not let me drink the milk, in case I needed it for later.</span> <span id="s297">And she just let me have a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s298">We were pushed in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s299">And our cattle car happened to be a coal cattle car.</span> <span id="s300">So in no time, we were black and dirty.</span> <span id="s301">And we were pushed in like sardines into that cattle cars, with buckets for to um...do our urine in and um bowel movement.</span> <span id="s302">And it was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">There was a small little window with barbed wire over it, and we had no air except what came from that little window.</span> <span id="s304">And we travelled like this, I think...I think, for three or four days.</span> <span id="s305">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s306">And sometimes they would stop in between sirens, and...and we would just sit there.</span> <span id="s307">We were all cramped.</span> <span id="s308">And people would um lose control of themselves; and we laid in that dirt.</span> <span id="s309">It was just horrible.</span> <span id="s310">And one time there was such a commotion, because people became so tired and exhausted and lost of their patience.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">They started to um get angry at one another, and people started screaming.</span> <span id="s312">So all of a sudden, one German... They...because they were um guarding the um cattle cars from the outside for people who escaped.</span> <span id="s313">So um he took his rifle and he shot a bare blank; he shot at two people, and he screamed to be quiet.</span> <span id="s314">So we...we thought we were going to die right there and then.</span> <span id="s315">And this is how we arrived finally in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">01:28:07 A camp called Birkenau.</span> <span id="s317">And it was like dawn.</span> <span id="s318">And I saw lights, and um we saw fire from far away.</span> <span id="s319">And um like a chimney, with fire going.</span> <span id="s320">And um we thought they were factories.</span> <span id="s321">And I said, "Good.”</span> <span id="s322">I says, "We will be able to work.”</span> <span id="s323">And I see um little...saw barracks with lights burning; so I said, "Oh, maybe now I'll be at peace at least.”</span> <span id="s324">They told us to leave our luggage.</span> <span id="s325">And whatever our packages we had with us, we had to leave at um on the ground.</span> <span id="s326">And we had to go and stay in line as we came off the um cattle cars.</span> <span id="s327">And they separated the men from the women.</span> <span id="s328">As they separated us, I didn't even have time to say goodbye to my uncle.</span> <span id="s329">And um...and my aunt and I were standing, one next to each other.</span> <span id="s330">And as we came close to um... One by one, to...in front of the Germans, one tall fellow--I didn't know who he was--which later I found out was Mengele, Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Mengele.</span> <span id="s332">He guided us to go to the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s333">And at that time I did not know what that meant.</span> <span id="s334">And he told me to go to the right, and he told my aunt to go to the left.</span> <span id="s335">I thought my aunt was going to the left to give information about our names and birth, and...and that I would see her later, and to give our passports away.</span> <span id="s336">But I never saw her 2 The last transport of Jews apparently left Malines on July 31, 1944.</span> <span id="s337">Belgium was liberated at the beginning of September 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">after that again.</span> <span id="s339">Because I..</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">once I came into the camp, I found out from the inmates what the left meant.</span> <span id="s342">The left meant crematoire [NB: crematorium], which meant the ovens that I saw burning.</span> <span id="s343">Instead of factories, they were ovens.</span> <span id="s344">And they were gassing and burning the people what went to the left.</span> <span id="s345">I don't have to say how I felt.</span> <span id="s346">I thought it was the end of of us all then.</span> <span id="s347">I was fifteen years old, and I was all alone in this Hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">01:30:36 They told us when we came in, they told us to undress and that we were going to be showered and that they were going to give us clothes.</span> <span id="s349">The place was so cold.</span> <span id="s350">It...it...it was in early winter; and um it...in Birkenau, this...which is Poland, it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s351">We stayed there for hours to um to wait for our clothes.</span> <span id="s352">They um took our clothes away, and they gave us inmate clothes.</span> <span id="s353">And it was paper thin.</span> <span id="s354">And no towels to dry; and um for hours they let us stay there.</span> <span id="s355">And people were crying and carrying on.</span> <span id="s356">We had no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">We were starving hungry.</span> <span id="s358">And finally they gave us the clothes, and then they put us in barracks.</span> <span id="s359">They put us in barracks; and we were packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s360">The barracks were um...the beds were bunks, three layers.</span> <span id="s361">I was on the top layer.</span> <span id="s362">And we were like sardines packed.</span> <span id="s363">I think there were...we were um about fourteen people, if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s364">If one person wanted to turn, we all had to turn.</span> <span id="s365">So that we could move around.</span> <span id="s366">And at early dawn, they um ...they whistled, and we had to get up and stay in "Appell.”</span> <span id="s367">"Appell" means like roll call.</span> <span id="s368">And for hours we stayed in "Appell.”</span> <span id="s369">And it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s370">And the...and it was mud.</span> <span id="s371">The roads were out of gravel and mud.</span> <span id="s372">And our feet were ice cold.</span> <span id="s373">And um the next day, they came after roll call; and they called us back to the same place where they um...where we had showered and um ga..</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">they gave us the clothes.</span> <span id="s376">And they tattooed me.</span> <span id="s377">They tattooed me; and they told us from now on, this is my name.</span> <span id="s378">My name is A-5143.</span> <span id="s379">This was the second time.</span> <span id="s380">The first time, they made a mistake with the whole transport.</span> <span id="s381">So they called us back and they scratched the first number out, and then they gave us the second number.</span> <span id="s382">And they said, "From now on, you do not answer by your name.</span> <span id="s383">Your name is your number."</span></p> <p><span id="s384">01:33:26 And the delusion, the disappointment, the discouragement that I felt.</span> <span id="s385">I felt like I was not a human person anymore.</span> <span id="s386">They had shaved our heads; and I felt so ashamed.</span> <span id="s387">And also when they told us to undress and to shower, they made us feel like...like we were animals.</span> <span id="s388">The men were walking around, and laughing and looking at us.</span> <span id="s389">And you take a young girl at that age, who was never been exposed to um a person...to a man, and you stay there naked... I wanted the ground should open, (crying) and I should go in it.</span> <span id="s390">(Pause - crying) It took me many many years for me to get over this.</span> <span id="s391">My husband always wondered why I would go into the bathroom and get undressed, and come out in my nightgown.</span> <span id="s392">And I never told him why, except recently.</span> <span id="s393">It took all these years to tell him why.</span> <span id="s394">Because I could never see anybody staring at me while I was naked.</span> <span id="s395">And I think that's what it was.</span> <span id="s396">Because it is a just...it was just terrible for me, what we had to go through at that age.</span> <span id="s397">And I didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s398">All because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s399">And I used to say to myself, "What did I do to deserve this, to be here for the Germans to do this to me?</span> <span id="s400">What did we do to them?"</span> <span id="s401">The answers were never an...the questions were never answered.</span> <span id="s402">And I had to make the best out of everything.</span> <span id="s403">Try to survive in that jungle.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">01:35:43 They gave me, finally, little rations of hard, dried-up bread which was half mildew.</span> <span id="s405">I could hardly eat it.</span> <span id="s406">And a tin can of soup; which was so rotten and vile, when I tasted it I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s407">I put it down, and I didn't eat it.</span> <span id="s408">I just ate the bread and drank a little water, which was just rust running out from the um sink that they had over there.</span> <span id="s409">We couldn't wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s410">We had no soap.</span> <span id="s411">We had only that dirty water that ran out from that um sink hole where they had over there.</span> <span id="s412">And finally when I got so hungry and I knew I had to eat the soup, I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s413">It was so vile.</span> <span id="s414">It was so terrible.</span> <span id="s415">I never ate anything like that in my whole life.</span> <span id="s416">I said, "If I want to survive, if I want to go back to my aunt, ...” Because I knew I still had one aunt in Belgium. "</span> <span id="s417">...I have to eat the soup.”</span> <span id="s418">So I started eating the soup.</span> <span id="s419">And I re...I remember forcing the soup down my throat, and big tears coming down my face.</span> <span id="s420">Eating and crying, eating and crying.</span> <span id="s421">And this is how I was in Birkenau for six weeks.</span> <span id="s422">Then, word came around; and we said, "We have to work.</span> <span id="s423">If we don't work, they're going to take us to the gas chamber.”</span> <span id="s424">So anytime there was work for volunteers, we volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">01:37:29 We stood up.</span> <span id="s426">The young girls, we all stood together as a group.</span> <span id="s427">That the girls came out of Belgium.</span> <span id="s428">We had made a pact that we should stick together, because all the parents was taken together in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s429">So they said, "Let us stick together, and let's try and survive.”</span> <span id="s430">So one day...we were doing over there very hard labor work.</span> <span id="s431">We were doing roads.</span> <span id="s432">Or they told us to pick up rocks and...and...and carry them from one hill to the other hill.</span> <span id="s433">What we accomplished, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s434">They just wanted us to do something.</span> <span id="s435">And they were going with the um whips and hitting us, while we were doing that.</span> <span id="s436">In the cold.</span> <span id="s437">One day...we were always looking for other jobs, because that would kill us if we would do this everyday.</span> <span id="s438">So one day they came, and they volun...and they said, "There is a new camp opening up.</span> <span id="s439">And we need volunteers to work in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s440">And we grabbed that opportunity.</span> <span id="s441">And there was about um twenty-five, thirty girls.</span> <span id="s442">And um we were lucky enough to be taken to take that job.</span> <span id="s443">So they took us.</span> <span id="s444">And we showered, and they gave us new clothes.</span> <span id="s445">And we went to work into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s446">And we found out that that was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">01:39:05 Auschwitz is maybe like um a mile, a mile and a half, away from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s448">And the camp I was in was called 2-B Lag...um Lager.</span> <span id="s449">Zwei-B Lager.</span> <span id="s450">And that was a new lager that they had opened up there.</span> <span id="s451">And we started working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s452">Well, the work was so hard.</span> <span id="s453">It was even harder than the other work.</span> <span id="s454">Because we had to get up before the camp um got um woken up, so that um we should make the coffee ready.</span> <span id="s455">And cut the bread, the um um the rations.</span> <span id="s456">And prepare the soup.</span> <span id="s457">So we worked very very hard, dragging these heavy things.</span> <span id="s458">And I was a young girl, I had no food.</span> <span id="s459">And I had to drag those heavy um cans of um soup and coffee liquids out.</span> <span id="s460">And um...like in the army.</span> <span id="s461">And it was only two people per...per barrel, whatever they called it.</span> <span id="s462">We had to carry it all the way out from the kitchen to the outside, so that the inmates could come and pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">And I cried myself to sleep because of the hard work.</span> <span id="s464">And over there, that's the way I was for six months.</span> <span id="s465">In Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s466">In the meantime, while life was going on over there, it was very very rough for all of us.</span> <span id="s467">We were trying to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">01:40:47 Transports were coming in every day, from all different countries.</span> <span id="s469">People with all kinds of different languages--Hungarian, Poles, Czechoslovakians, from Holland, from France, from Belgium, from Germany... They were from ever...Italy... There were eve...Poles, Russians... They were from everywhere.</span> <span id="s470">It was a melting pot.</span> <span id="s471">And everybody spoke in different languages.</span> <span id="s472">And one day--I'll never forget--a whole transport of Hungarian people came in.</span> <span id="s473">Women and children.</span> <span id="s474">And...into the camp... I was surprised--even children; because um they only had adult people there.</span> <span id="s475">And then I found out that these...that transport, that Hungarian transport--it was two...two um barracks that they filled up with--that they were going to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s476">And they had no food.</span> <span id="s477">So I took a bucket of boiled potatoes, and... At night, I had made up my mind to do this.</span> <span id="s478">And I was going to sneak into one of the barracks, and give as much as I can to each person.</span> <span id="s479">I would give them a bowl of potato.</span> <span id="s480">Because we cooked always one day ahead, and we um made um...to make the soup.</span> <span id="s481">So that's how I was able to take um a bucket of boiled potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Well, in the beginning it went nice and quietly.</span> <span id="s483">But then as people find out they were getting...somebody was giving them food, I..</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">I come...made a whole um commotion with all this.</span> <span id="s486">And all of a sudden the lights turned on, and the blockälteste--which is the um the lady in charge of that barracks--op...opened up the lights and saw me.</span> <span id="s487">And um she saw what I was doing; and she says, "You know, I could denounce you where you could be shot right there.</span> <span id="s488">And then what you're doing?"</span> <span id="s489">She says, "Give me that bucket, and get back to your barrack where you belong!"</span></p> <p><span id="s490">01:43:05 And um the next day they were all liquidated, all these people.</span> <span id="s491">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s492">And I could have lost my life.</span> <span id="s493">I didn't realize what I was doing.</span> <span id="s494">But I felt in my heart that I wanted to help these people, and this is all I could do.</span> <span id="s495">And one day I had to take out the coffee early in the morning.</span> <span id="s496">It was my mine um time to take out the coffee.</span> <span id="s497">And I took a woman who um...from...from the camp who was going to help me; and she was inexperienced.</span> <span id="s498">There was a um way to um carry it in order not to spill it.</span> <span id="s499">You ...you pick up something heavy, you...you... I was told you pick it up, and you go straight with it.</span> <span id="s500">If you bend and you...then you have the whole weight of the um...of the um...of the um can, and it weights you down.</span> <span id="s501">But if you go straight, then you carry it with your whole body.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">So you can walk with it straighter.</span> <span id="s503">So this poor woman was a weak person.</span> <span id="s504">She didn't know how to carry it, and she was wobbling back and forth.</span> <span id="s505">And this was boiling coffee.</span> <span id="s506">And she finally dropped it on me, and then she took off and ran; and I got burned.</span> <span id="s507">I got burned on my leg, and um was severely burned on my left foot.</span> <span id="s508">And they took me to the infirmary.</span> <span id="s509">The infirmary was all the way in the end of the camp.</span> <span id="s510">Nobody ever wanted to go to the infirmary; because, first of all, there was no medication there anyhow.</span> <span id="s511">But in...people who were almost really dying would go to the infirmary; and from there, they carried them out to be burned.</span> <span id="s512">Not only that, they would take out um people and...and...and to be gassed.</span> <span id="s513">But I went there to have just my bandage changed; because where the um big um can fell on my foot, it scraped all the skin off.</span> <span id="s514">And um so I needed bandages on...on my foot.</span> <span id="s515">So as I was being waiting for my um turn to um change the bandage, all of a sudden a jeep stopped and in came Dr. Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">01:45:44 And I saw death in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s517">And he wanted to know what I was doing there.</span> <span id="s518">So I said to him right away, "I am working.</span> <span id="s519">And I'm working in the kitchen, and I had an accident.”</span> <span id="s520">And I told him what happened.</span> <span id="s521">"And I'm just waiting to have my um bandage exchanged.”</span> <span id="s522">And he said, "OK.”</span> <span id="s523">And he let me exchange my bandage; and I went right out and I had two girls helping me walk back to the camp, to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s524">And as I was walking back with the two girls, I was putting my heel down into the ground and I was hopping that way back.</span> <span id="s525">But being that the pavement was always full of mud...there was no dry pavement.</span> <span id="s526">We were always in mud up in to our ankles.</span> <span id="s527">All of a sudden, I heard the brakes.</span> <span id="s528">And I looked behind, and there is the jeep with Dr. Mengele and two guards right next to him.</span> <span id="s529">He always had two guards, just in case somebody wants to kill him I presume.</span> <span id="s530">So he had two guards with their rifles; and he had a sho...a revolver in his waist.</span> <span id="s531">So the um driver stopped, and he started screaming at me in German--how dare I jump...how dare I walk with my heel on...on...with my bad foot in the mud when my bandage has just been changed.</span> <span id="s532">He said, "What do you think we do here, exchange bandages for you so that you can make them muddy?</span> <span id="s533">Jump on one leg, or else!</span> <span id="s534">," he said.</span> <span id="s535">Well, I started jumping on that one foot.</span> <span id="s536">And if it wouldn't have been for those two girls who were holding me, I would have collapsed.</span> <span id="s537">And I thought any moment he was going to shoot me or tell me to get on the jeep.</span> <span id="s538">I thought he was going to put...take me away.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">And how I walked into that kitchen, I'll never know.</span> <span id="s540">We were all three of us exhausted.</span> <span id="s541">He followed me and trailed slowly behind me; to make sure that I was going into the kitchen for one, and also that I jumped on one leg.</span> <span id="s542">And that's how I..</span> <span id="s543">.</span> <span id="s544">he took off, I know it.</span> <span id="s545">And that's how I escaped his death claws.</span> <span id="s546">I'll never forget that, with this Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s547">And finally it healed up.</span> <span id="s548">I still have a scar in my leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">01:48:19 And um every day was um a struggle to survive.</span> <span id="s550">Every day, I woke up and I would find one or two people who wanted to end their lives and couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s551">They would throw themselves to the electric wires and make a end of it, because the electric wires would electrocute them.</span> <span id="s552">And every once in a blue moon, I wouldn't...I couldn't take it any more.</span> <span id="s553">I would try to sneak out of the barracks at late at night, when we were not supposed to be; because we could have been shot right there if a German would see us at night out in out of the barracks.</span> <span id="s554">But I would sneak behind the barracks and I would go all the way in the back.</span> <span id="s555">And I would try and look at the sky.</span> <span id="s556">And I would see the sky...I would see the stars.</span> <span id="s557">And I would talk to myself; and I would say, "I can't believe that these stars are looking down at us in this Hell, in this camp, and the same stars are shining at the outside of the world.</span> <span id="s558">And other people are looking at the same stars, and they are free.</span> <span id="s559">And they are free to do what they want to do.</span> <span id="s560">And they are living a good life.</span> <span id="s561">And we are here in Hell--human beings worse than animals.</span> <span id="s562">And nobody is doing anything about it.”</span> <span id="s563">And I couldn't believe it, and I would say...and I would... As young as I was, I..</span> <span id="s564">.</span> <span id="s565">I was asking myself these questions.</span> <span id="s566">And I would say, "Where is the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Why isn't the world doing anything about this?"</span> <span id="s568">And then I would question God; and I would say, "Where is God?</span> <span id="s569">How can he let us being killed like that?"</span> <span id="s570">Naturally, I had no answer.</span> <span id="s571">And after I cried myself out real good, I would go back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">01:50:23 And face the morning, and stay in "Appell" for hours again in the cold, and then go to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s573">Finally, one day, one morning, I heard that Belgium was liberated.</span> <span id="s574">Somehow, somehow--I don't know how it came, um maybe from the underground--but the news came to me that Belgium was liberated.</span> <span id="s575">And I was still in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s576">And I was so happy; and I had such terrible mixed emotions, because I was happy.</span> <span id="s577">I said, "My aunt is liberated.</span> <span id="s578">My Aunt Sarah did not get caught.”</span> <span id="s579">It never dawned on me that she could have been caught and gone into another camp.</span> <span id="s580">I never...never even thought of that.</span> <span id="s581">But in my mind, she was liberated; and in another way, I was so sad that I was still in camp and I was still here.</span> <span id="s582">And then one morning again, world...word came to us that we were going to evacuate Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s583">Why were we evacuating Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s584">It is because the Russians were coming close by.</span> <span id="s585">And so we...we all walked out of Auschwitz, and we started walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">01:51:56 And we started walking, we walked for days.</span> <span id="s587">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s588">I don't know how many days we walked.</span> <span id="s589">We walked, and then we took cattle cars, and then we walked again.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">And as we walked, we heard gunshots.</span> <span id="s591">And they told us to keep on marching.</span> <span id="s592">We heard gunshots; and they were shooting people in the back who couldn't keep up with the walking.</span> <span id="s593">It ended up being called the "death march," because the ravines and the...and the gutters, they were all red from blood.</span> <span id="s594">From people... Some people who spoke Polish--we were walking through Poland, and some people who thought they could escape would try and escape.</span> <span id="s595">Some people who couldn't keep up with the walking anymore--they got weak, they threw all their bundles away, and they walked until they couldn't keep up anymore.</span> <span id="s596">They fell behind, and the Germans just shot them.</span> <span id="s597">We saw people being shot in the front, in their chest, in the back.</span> <span id="s598">They were laying all over: on top of hills, behind trees... It was really like a war zone.</span> <span id="s599">And this is how we finally arrived in a camp called Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">01:53:15 Bergen-Belsen were...was just the opposite of a camp from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s601">In Auschwitz, at least there we worked.</span> <span id="s602">And every once in a blue moon, we...we went into the showers.</span> <span id="s603">As much as we were afraid to go to the showers, because we didn't know if the showers would give us water or gas; but we showered once in a blue moon.</span> <span id="s604">Over there [NB: Bergen-Belsen], we had no showers.</span> <span id="s605">We had no toilets.</span> <span id="s606">In Auschwitz, we had a barrack which was nothing but a toilet.</span> <span id="s607">One long toilet.</span> <span id="s608">How was the toilet made?</span> <span id="s609">The toilet was um a plank with two holes.</span> <span id="s610">One opposite the other.</span> <span id="s611">Two rows.</span> <span id="s612">And people would have to use those...those um um holes to...to do their business.</span> <span id="s613">And one person would walk right in the middle of those...those holes with a whip in their hand.</span> <span id="s614">God forbid if you missed the hole.</span> <span id="s615">They would hit us.</span> <span id="s616">And when we came into Bergen-Belsen and I was looking for the toilet barracks, there was none.</span> <span id="s617">So I found out that they had made a ditch, and we had to go in the ditch and do it.</span> <span id="s618">The decay and the filth in Bergen-Belsen was undescribable.</span> <span id="s619">The conditions, the food... We had no...um my barrack had no...no um um...not bunks to sleep on.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">01:55:24 They gave us straw mats.</span> <span id="s621">We slept on straw mats.</span> <span id="s622">After a month, the straw mats got rotten, and we had to throw them away.</span> <span id="s623">So I slept on the bare floor.</span> <span id="s624">I had nothing to sleep on.</span> <span id="s625">The little girl that I was with, that was the only one that I was able to um um keep with on the death march, her name was Christiane.</span> <span id="s626">And I ...I stuck with her.</span> <span id="s627">She was the only girl from...she was from France, and I was from Belgium.</span> <span id="s628">But we both spoke French, so we ...we...we stayed together.</span> <span id="s629">She was a year younger than I am.</span> <span id="s630">She never knew why she came into the camp.</span> <span id="s631">She didn't even know she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s632">I don't even know how she was caught.</span> <span id="s633">And she was a very young, naïve little girl; and I kind of protected her, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s634">She...I had promised the other girls that I was going to take care of her, because we were separated from the other group, from the other Belgian people.</span> <span id="s635">So I felt like a duty, that she was part of me; and I kind of protected her.</span> <span id="s636">And um I guess that gave me the strength to carry on, because I kind of worried about her.</span> <span id="s637">And the life in Bergen-Belsen was just terrible.</span> <span id="s638">We had...the...the rations were the same.</span> <span id="s639">And the people just died like flies over there, because there was nothing.</span> <span id="s640">We had...we had no work over there.</span> <span id="s641">We just sat around.</span> <span id="s642">And we walked around--in the decay, in the dirt, between the...the um um ditches from the bathrooms.</span> <span id="s643">The smell was horrible; and...and people were...got sick.</span> <span id="s644">People got diphtheria, the runs; and it was terrible catching.</span> <span id="s645">And um finally, the little girl got sick.</span> <span id="s646">I..</span> <span id="s647">.</span> <span id="s648">you would go and stay in front of kitchens, hoping that somebody would see me that knew me from Auschwitz, maybe.</span> <span id="s649">I was hoping would give me something.</span> <span id="s650">And finally, um twice some people gave me--one time a little bit of coffee and one time a little bit of soup--that I ran back to Christiane to give it to her.</span> <span id="s651">And Christiane died in my arms while I was feeding her a little bit of the coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">01:57:53 I wanted her to have a little bit of hot um coffee, and she died in my arms.</span> <span id="s653">But before she died, she had gotten delirious from the fever.</span> <span id="s654">Afterwards, I found out it was typhus that she had.</span> <span id="s655">And she got delirious.</span> <span id="s656">It was the middle of the night, and she saw her family in her fever.</span> <span id="s657">So she started...she got up, and she wanted to run to her family.</span> <span id="s658">She cried in French, "Mama!"</span> <span id="s659">And she wanted to go to them.</span> <span id="s660">And, naturally, she was stepping on the sleeping people, and she made a commotion.</span> <span id="s661">So I tried to calm her, and lay her down.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">And while I was trying to calm her, the Blockälteste--which is the woman in charge of the um barrack-- came down on me with a stick.</span> <span id="s663">And she started beating me.</span> <span id="s664">She beat me so much, until the the stick broke.</span> <span id="s665">And I laid there for two days.</span> <span id="s666">I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s667">I was so bruised and broken up.</span> <span id="s668">And it was right after that that Christiane died.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: We'll stop here, and they're going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s670">01:59:17</span></p> <p><span id="s671">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s672">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 02:00:10</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: We're on.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: So Christiane died in my arms.</span> <span id="s675">When Christiane died, I did not let know...I didn't tell the Blockälteste that she was dead.</span> <span id="s676">I pretended she was asleep.</span> <span id="s677">I put her down and covered her up.</span> <span id="s678">And I pretended she was asleep, because I received her ration of bread.</span> <span id="s679">And I took that ration and soup, and ate it for two days.</span> <span id="s680">And then after that, I was afraid that she would start smelling, and that they would discover and they would hurt me again.</span> <span id="s681">So I said to the woman, the Blockälteste, that she had died.</span> <span id="s682">When Christiane...when they found out that she was dead, they took Christiane.</span> <span id="s683">And they took her out, and they threw her on top of a pile of dead people.</span> <span id="s684">I said, I compared the two differences of the two different camps.</span> <span id="s685">Auschwitz, they took away the dead people.</span> <span id="s686">They gassed them and they burned them; and in the camps we didn't see any dead people.</span> <span id="s687">We only saw the um people being hit or being dragged away, but we never saw any dead people laying around.</span> <span id="s688">In Bergen-Belsen, was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s689">Bergen-Belsen was nothing but dead people.</span> <span id="s690">Skeletons.</span> <span id="s691">Skin and bones.</span> <span id="s692">They piled them up as they died.</span> <span id="s693">Every day, five people would be dead from...from one barrack.</span> <span id="s694">And they just piled them up, like a mountain, outside in front of the um door of the barrack.</span> <span id="s695">And the piles got as high--I would say um six, seven feet.</span> <span id="s696">Because I remember when they... First, in the beginning, I couldn't look at her.</span> <span id="s697">I was afraid to look at Christiane on top of that pile.</span> <span id="s698">I knew where she was.</span> <span id="s699">And I knew what she had on.</span> <span id="s700">Christiane had a skirt--a little skirt, a thin little skirt--and a navy blue jacket.</span> <span id="s701">And finally my guilt couldn't take it any more.</span> <span id="s702">I said I had to go and look at Christiane.</span> <span id="s703">So I went out, and I looked at Christiane.</span> <span id="s704">And one thing puzzled me...and I didn't understand what was wrong.</span> <span id="s705">Christiane's skirt was taken away, and she was bare from the waist down.</span> <span id="s706">Nothing but bones and skeleton.</span> <span id="s707">Just like you see in the...in the pictures, or in the movies they show.</span> <span id="s708">And she had a white jacket on.</span> <span id="s709">I says, "Why is her jacket white?</span> <span id="s710">Why would somebody take off the blue jacket, and put a white jacket?"</span> <span id="s711">So I went closer by of the pile...to the um skeletons, the dead people.</span> <span id="s712">And I looked up; and underneath that white, I saw the navy blue.</span> <span id="s713">And the outside of the white was lice.</span> <span id="s714">Big white lice, like the size of black ants that you see sometimes, the black ant crawling in the dirt.</span> <span id="s715">That's as big as those lice were.</span> <span id="s716">And they covered that navy blue little jacket; and it made the jacket look white or grayish.</span> <span id="s717">And it shocked me so that I almost fell on the... under the dead cadavers.</span> <span id="s718">And I ran away and I never looked at Christiane again anymore.</span> <span id="s719">I was so...it...it...it just took everything out of me.</span> <span id="s720">I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s721">They were eating Christiane up, this... From...from...from the terrible--the lice, the decay, the filth.</span> <span id="s722">And this is how she ended up, a young fifteen year old girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">02:04:19 And after that, I was so disillusioned.</span> <span id="s724">I had nothing to fight anymore.</span> <span id="s725">My morale was so down.</span> <span id="s726">And I think I came down with the typhus what Christiane had.</span> <span id="s727">And I couldn't work anymore, and I couldn't get up anymore.</span> <span id="s728">And I laid there; and one day I had to go to the um bathroom.</span> <span id="s729">And I had to go at night.</span> <span id="s730">And they...and I fell; and coming back from the bathroom, somebody pushed me and bruised me on my leg.</span> <span id="s731">And from the bad nutrition and the bruise developed into a terrible big bruise.</span> <span id="s732">And I don't know what happened to my leg, but it was like on fire.</span> <span id="s733">And no medication, and no um um medicine.</span> <span id="s734">It...it was like um um a fire was on my leg, and a bump; and um I would not let nobody touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">And I was very weak with the typhus, and I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s736">And I laid there like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s737">And this is how I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">02:05:49 When I was liberated, I couldn't um lift my head up.</span> <span id="s739">Finally, after two days, I asked two inmates to pick me up.</span> <span id="s740">And I could look out the window and see what a soldier looked like.</span> <span id="s741">And then they laid me down again.</span> <span id="s742">And then I found out, after the um... probably days, told the um...the um army... They took all these sick people, the ones that were the worst off for um give them immediate help.</span> <span id="s743">So one um Red Cross came, and they said they were going to take me away the next day.</span> <span id="s744">And so they took off all my clothes that I had on; and they wrapped me in an army blanket, and they took me.</span> <span id="s745">And they um took and put me in um a bathing house; and they took the Germans who were the Nazis, they made them put on white uniforms and they took care of our...of the inmates who were very bad off.</span> <span id="s746">And they washed me and shampooed me, and um then they put me in a hospital.</span> <span id="s747">In the outskirts of Bergen-Belsen, they made um...they set up an emergency hospital.</span> <span id="s748">And in that hospital, I remember an Englishman...I could see in his face that my leg was bad.</span> <span id="s749">And I had a translator tell me that he was going to do the best to save my leg.</span> <span id="s750">And um he operated on me; and um I understand that gangrene had set in the leg from um the um pus, and had reached the bone.</span> <span id="s751">Anyhow, I was two months in that hospital fighting for my life.</span> <span id="s752">And then, they um...finally after two months and I got some of my strength back, they took me back with the Belgian Red Cross.</span> <span id="s753">I remember, one day I saw some soldiers going from bed to bed, from bunk to bunk.</span> <span id="s754">And on the lapel, I..</span> <span id="s755">.</span> <span id="s756">I recognized the Belgian flag.</span> <span id="s757">I star...I started talking French to them.</span> <span id="s758">And they were very excited to find a Belgian girl.</span> <span id="s759">And um they made all the inquiries about me, and they um called the Belgian Red Cross.</span> <span id="s760">And sure enough, all the information I had given them was correct.</span> <span id="s761">So they sent me back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s762">Because a lot of inmates after their liberation, they all wanted to get out and wanted to go back to um neutral zones.</span> <span id="s763">They didn't want to stay in Russia or Poland.</span> <span id="s764">So um they had to check it real closely; and when all the information was correct, they sent me back.</span> <span id="s765">Finally, the Belgian Red Cross took me back to um Brussels by um airplane.</span> <span id="s766">Ao I traveled back with a army airplane; and I was one of the very very few who were very very injured and weak, and couldn't travel, that was sent back by plane.</span> <span id="s767">And when I came back into Belgium, the Belgian um Red Cross asked me where I should go, where...who they could notify.</span> <span id="s768">And I didn't know where my aunt was, so I told...I gave the address of the people where I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s769">The Belgian people who took care of me.</span> <span id="s770">And they came right away and got me.</span> <span id="s771">And I stayed there two days, when word came to my aunt from that lady who had saw my name that um...that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">02:10:01</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span> <span id="s774">How...how did your aunt discover where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Well, um this very good friend of mine...um...of my mother, knew my aunt.</span> <span id="s776">She was a friend of the family.</span> <span id="s777">And she saw my name on...on the board.</span> <span id="s778">When um the people who survived the camps...um as they came back home, the Belgian Red Cross and the Jewish um society wrote down the names of the survivors.</span> <span id="s779">And they listed them.</span> <span id="s780">They made posters, and listed them.</span> <span id="s781">And as people in the streets, everyday they were running to those um posters to see who...who of their families came back.</span> <span id="s782">So that woman saw my name, and knew who I was; and she ran to my um aunt to tell that Lilly survived.</span> <span id="s783">And the Belgian...um she got in touch with the Belgian Red Cross, and the Belgian Red Cross told them where they had put me.</span> <span id="s784">And so this way she knew where I was, where... And they went over there to get me.</span> <span id="s785">Also, at that time, that same lady had met this gentleman in the cafe when she went in....</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: You need to tell this on the tape.</span> <span id="s787">You told me before, but we weren't on tape.</span> <span id="s788">Tell me the story again about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">02:11:29</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: OK.</span> <span id="s791">This same lady, after the war she um was trying to um make a living.</span> <span id="s792">And after the war, a lot of different nationality um um armies was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s793">And so a lot of people were dealing in the black market in um...in Brussels, with um the currency.</span> <span id="s794">And this woman was um um doing business with currency.</span> <span id="s795">And she was walking into a cafe, when she saw this gentleman at the table having coffee.</span> <span id="s796">And she sat next to him and started a conversation.</span> <span id="s797">And she wanted to find out all about this um gentleman, for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s798">And she was a very inquisitive person, and she kept asking him questions.</span> <span id="s799">And so she said, um, "What do you do to um make a living?"</span> <span id="s800">And he says, "I'm right in the middle of going to America, so I gave up all my businesses.</span> <span id="s801">And um me and my two sons, who survived um concentration camp... Um, I have family in um New York, and um they are making papers for me to go to America.”</span> <span id="s802">Well, this lady wouldn't give up; and she kept asking questions to him.</span> <span id="s803">And she said, um, "Well, who is your family?"</span> <span id="s804">He says, "I have a sister.”</span> <span id="s805">"And what is her name?"</span> <span id="s806">, she said.</span> <span id="s807">And he says, "Lublin.”</span> <span id="s808">And she got all excited, because she said, "My God, Lublin!</span> <span id="s809">I know of a girl who just now survived concentration camp.</span> <span id="s810">She just came back from Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">And she is a Lublin.</span> <span id="s812">And maybe it is your sister's husband, or a brother of his.</span> <span id="s813">Please send a telegram to him saying that there is a daughter that is here who survived.”</span> <span id="s814">And so he did, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s815">02:13:28</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Do you want to tell how your father came to be in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Well, my father came here in 1928.</span> <span id="s818">Um, way before the war.</span> <span id="s819">He had left my mother in 1928; and my mother was seven months pregnant with...with me.</span> <span id="s820">I had a brother and a sister; and my sister was two years old and my brother was one year.</span> <span id="s821">And I was supposed to come in the world.</span> <span id="s822">My father was married only in the Jewish religion to my mother, so that the um Justice of the Peace never recognized the marriage.</span> <span id="s823">And because of that reason, I was an Applebaum--my mother's name--and my sister and my brother were Lublin.</span> <span id="s824">And um when um I came to this country, my father had to prove that I was his daughter.</span> <span id="s825">And, naturally, he had a hard time.</span> <span id="s826">It took a year, but he finally did...was able to arrange it.</span> <span id="s827">And um by proof, by showing letters and money that he sent once in a blue moon to...to um Belgium.</span> <span id="s828">And um the reason he said he couldn't do it too often is because, he said, there was also a..</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">a Depression here.</span> <span id="s831">But anyhow, that's the only um...the only reason that um...the excuse he had why he couldn't help us before.</span> <span id="s832">And he also said that um he inquired with the Belgian Red Cross to find out if any of us survive, but he said we were all gone.</span> <span id="s833">That um the Germans had all killed us; and I don't know if he ever inqu...um requested about Applebaum.</span> <span id="s834">Because I was still under Applebaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Maybe he requested about Lublin.</span> <span id="s836">I never asked him that question.</span> <span id="s837">It never even dawned on me.</span> <span id="s838">But um anyhow, he came here in 1928; because he was um a cook on the ships.</span> <span id="s839">And when the um his ship came into America, he jumped ship and he came and settled in New York.</span> <span id="s840">And that's how he got to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">02:16:01</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: And this lady in the cafe...?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: And so this lady in the cafe said, "There is a Ignatz Lublin"--that was my father's name then--"who went to America in 1928, and had a wife here with three children.</span> <span id="s844">And one of his daughters just now was liberated.</span> <span id="s845">And you must write to your sister and find out if there is any relationship with that man, because um you have to help that girl.</span> <span id="s846">She is over...um a aunt of hers from her mother's side.”</span> <span id="s847">And um I didn't even know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">And so, when my um...when this man sent a telegram to his sister, they knew right away who um was this man and um wanted to say.</span> <span id="s849">And they knew it was my father.</span> <span id="s850">And they got in touch right away with my father, which was my um...that...that woman's um husband's brother.</span> <span id="s851">My uncle.</span> <span id="s852">And he...and... But...in the meantime, my father had changed his name to Israel Lublin.</span> <span id="s853">And he had moved to Washington.</span> <span id="s854">So he called up Washington and said, "Israel, there is a daughter that survived.</span> <span id="s855">And um...and this is the address where she's staying at.”</span> <span id="s856">And I received a telegram to...um right away from my father.</span> <span id="s857">And when I received a telegram, I wasn't even willing to come here then; because my papers were already made to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s858">I was going to aliyah.</span> <span id="s859">But my aunt who took care of me, and she brought me back to health... And I loved her very much, because she was the only one that I have had that survived.</span> <span id="s860">And um I felt a duty to her.</span> <span id="s861">And she helped me; and I loved her very much.</span> <span id="s862">And she wanted very much for me to go to America, because her dream as a child was always to go to America.</span> <span id="s863">And I said, "I don't want to go to America.</span> <span id="s864">I want to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s865">And she convinced me.</span> <span id="s866">She says, "You don't know Israel.</span> <span id="s867">You don't know America.</span> <span id="s868">What difference does it make where you start your life?</span> <span id="s869">Go to America for me, and help me and bring me down to America when you will be able.”</span> <span id="s870">And so I felt so bad, I..</span> <span id="s871">.</span> <span id="s872">I said, "OK.”</span> <span id="s873">And that's how I came to America to be with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">02:18:45 And it's funny.</span> <span id="s875">There um was a play last winter called "Shayne Maydel.”</span> <span id="s876">And I found out about that play.</span> <span id="s877">I went to see it; and it's almost like my life, that um play.</span> <span id="s878">And I went and I spoke for the people who were in the play, and for the...and the audience, one night; because it was parallel just like my story.</span> <span id="s879">And um except that the sister who was in that play--and I have um a half-sister here from... from my father and my step-mother, who...she was very very young and didn't understand what I was all about--while this sister in the play wanted to help the new um sister who was the survivor.</span> <span id="s880">And with me, it was just opposite.</span> <span id="s881">And um my step-mother didn't help me at all when I was young and...and came here, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s882">But anyhow, I was just one year with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">And met...um married um my husband after I met him for three months.</span> <span id="s884">And thank God, it's already...yesterday was 42 years that we are married together.</span> <span id="s885">And we have three wonderful sons, and three beautiful grandchildren and a fourth coming on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">02:20:18 And they know.</span> <span id="s887">Um we've talked to them many times, my children, about the Holocaust and what we have gone through.</span> <span id="s888">And um I think they understand what makes us tick and what makes us different people, because of what we went through in life.</span> <span id="s889">We tried to be as normal as we can be.</span> <span id="s890">And I think we are normal.</span> <span id="s891">But inside of us, we will never be the same as any other person who has never been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s892">It isn't possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Because of what we went through.</span> <span id="s894">Because there's not a day that does not go by that we don't think of camp or of death.</span> <span id="s895">And of what we had to go through in life, which was then.</span> <span id="s896">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s897">How we lived.</span> <span id="s898">It was so inhuman.</span> <span id="s899">Animals were taken care... better...had better love and care as...than we did.</span> <span id="s900">I remember when we...when I came into Auschwitz, it...it...it was such a Hell place.</span> <span id="s901">And when it rained, and...and the ashes flew down from the crematoire on us.</span> <span id="s902">We were living with death all the time.</span> <span id="s903">And the smell, and the odor.</span> <span id="s904">It was im...impossible to describe it.</span> <span id="s905">And I cannot believe to think that the people in the outside of the camps, who lived around there, who claimed that they didn't know.</span> <span id="s906">I cannot believe that they say they didn't know what went on.</span> <span id="s907">Because they must.</span> <span id="s908">If we smelled it, they smelled it; and if the ashes fell on us, it must have fallen on them, too, when the wind carried it away.</span> <span id="s909">And...and...and... and this is in um Hell that we lived in.</span> <span id="s910">And each time I hear a siren ring, to this day--even after forty-five years--I still am right back in the war.</span> <span id="s911">And each time, when I go into New York and when we drive the car--even if it is for pleasurable things--but before we get into New York and we hit New Jersey, and I see the...the factories with the chimneys, with the fires burning, I'm right back in the ovens of the crematoire.</span> <span id="s912">(Crying) It is always in my heart.</span> <span id="s913">It always will be.</span> <span id="s914">'Til I die.</span> <span id="s915">This is how we lived, from the death.</span> <span id="s916">And the world was quiet.</span> <span id="s917">And never said a word.</span> <span id="s918">And this is why I am here today to talk about it.</span> <span id="s919">To let the world know, for them to know that it should never happen again.</span> <span id="s920">That my children and grandchildren and their children should never know from a life like that.</span> <span id="s921">And the world should speak up when another Hitler should come, God forbid.</span> <span id="s922">Because then it will be doomsday.</span> <span id="s923">I hope it never happens again.</span> <span id="s924">Because too many people died.</span> <span id="s925">Six million for nothing; just because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s926">I hope the world will never forget what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">02:23:56</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I'd like to say I'm very very grateful to America.</span> <span id="s930">As much I didn't want to come here, I am very very grateful.</span> <span id="s931">Because America made me feel like a human being again.</span> <span id="s932">Because America was wonderful.</span> <span id="s933">And I have to say it is the best world... the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s934">And it gave us opportunity to be people and human beings again.</span> <span id="s935">We worked very very hard in this country.</span> <span id="s936">We were young.</span> <span id="s937">It's true.</span> <span id="s938">We couldn't speak the language when we came, but we learned real fast.</span> <span id="s939">As much as we could.</span> <span id="s940">We were not lazy, and we built a new family and a new life.</span> <span id="s941">And I'm grateful every day.</span> <span id="s942">I say thanks.</span> <span id="s943">And every day, I cannot believe what happened to me in my life.</span> <span id="s944">I will never forget; and always will look with the future and be grateful to America, that America gave me that opportunity to live as a human being again.</span> <span id="s945">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">02:25:24</span></p> <p><span id="s947">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
