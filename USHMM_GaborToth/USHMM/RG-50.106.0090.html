Garret on August 24, 1997, in Washington, D.C., Tape 1, Side A.</span> <span id="s13">What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Thomas Brown Gardiner.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And what was the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: March 26th, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And the place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: St. Louis County, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Could you talk about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Well, perhaps.</span> <span id="s21">I was born just two months before my father passed away and was raised by my widowed mother, along with two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s22">We grew up during the Depression and unemployment times and all of those things.</span> <span id="s23">We were a happy family led by a devoted Christian mother.</span> <span id="s24">And there was nothing terribly unusual.</span> <span id="s25">I guess we were probably a typical Depression family.</span> <span id="s26">I went to school through the first year of high school and then due to economic problems and so forth I had to drop out of school.</span> <span id="s27">And we moved to a small very small farm down in the Ozarks, near Salem, Missouri.</span> <span id="s28">I lived there two years and then moved back to St. Louis and were able to find some employment.</span> <span id="s29">And that was in 1935, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So you were 15 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I was 15.</span> <span id="s32">Yes, ma'am.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And you were working, at 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I went to work at age 15 as a helper for a painter and paper hanger, and then when I left his employ I went to work for a newspaper carrier delivering papers via old Model T Ford truck.</span> <span id="s35">And then I was working for $0.10 an hour in both jobs, I think.</span> <span id="s36">And then in 1936 midyear I went to work for a manufacturing company at age 16 out in a suburb of St. Louis.</span> <span id="s37">And I worked for that company for 16 years and worked up through an apprenticeship and became a certified tool and die maker.</span> <span id="s38">And then I went to work for another company as a tool and die maker.</span> <span id="s39">And then I During this time I was going to trade schools and night courses at Washington University and other vocational schools in the St. Louis area.</span> <span id="s40">I changed to a job as an engineering assistant and a product designer, attending more and more night school and so on.</span> <span id="s41">I took a correspondence course in electronics and operated a parttime radiotelevision repair business during the early '50s.</span> <span id="s42">I was married in 1940 to my wife Rachel, to whom I'm still happily married 57 years later.</span> <span id="s43">And I changed jobs after another 14, 15 years.</span> <span id="s44">I held about four jobs, I guess, four or five jobs in my lifetime and worked my way up into semiexecutive position.</span> <span id="s45">Again, a happy career, a very interesting career.</span> <span id="s46">And we've had a very, very happy, sometimes turbulent life.</span> <span id="s47">With God's help, we always kept it all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Now, backing up, what led up to your going into the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I was 26 years old at the time, and they were getting ready for the invasion of Europe and the DDay invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Now, you were born in 1920?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: 1920.</span> <span id="s52">No.</span> <span id="s53">I was 24.</span> <span id="s54">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s55">I went in in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: When you were 24?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: When I was 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And were you drafted, or how</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, I was drafted.</span> <span id="s60">I had a responsible position and had had a couple of deferments.</span> <span id="s61">But at the time I was drafted and they were getting ready for the invasion, anybody under age 26 that was healthy, there was no more deferments.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What was your position when you were deferred?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, I was a tool and die maker and engineer assistant.</span> <span id="s64">I was our company was doing some very precise and important war work, and I was a nighttime supervisor.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Do you know exactly what your company was manufacturing?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, we manufactured some small parts for the M1 rifle.</span> <span id="s67">And I designed the tools and built them for that job.</span> <span id="s68">We were making a lot of plug gauges and ring gauges for the cartridge for rifle and pistol cartridge cases.</span> <span id="s69">The smallarms plant in St. Louis was manufacturing the product, and we were making tools and gauges for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So you were very directly involved in production for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s72">Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: So in 1944 when you were 24, you were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I went through Jefferson Barracks, was held there a couple of weeks and in the hopes that they would have a request for some Army engineer candidates or something like that.</span> <span id="s77">But all they were getting was requests for infantry replacements.</span> <span id="s78">So after a couple of weeks I was shipped down to IRTC training camp by let's see.</span> <span id="s79">It was Camp Robinson, Arkansas, down by Little Rock.</span> <span id="s80">And I was in a training program there for 17 weeks.</span> <span id="s81">And then I was given a short delay in route and then shipped over to England and went across the channel in I think it was probably September of '44 I'm not terribly sure now.</span> <span id="s82">August, September.</span> <span id="s83">And I was held in replacement camp in England for a while and then sent to across the channel to a front area replacement camp in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you remember where in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I think it was a town called Epinal, EPINAL, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: And from that point then I was assigned to the 45th Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s88">And we had I think I joined that division a day or two before or maybe a week, I don't know, before Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s89">And we had early Thanksgiving dinner at the camp or wherever we were.</span> <span id="s90">We were in reserve then.</span> <span id="s91">And then we went up into the action into the Vosges Mountains and AlsaceLorraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So that was the first action that you ever saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And could you say a little bit about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well, I guess I couldn't say anything good about it.</span> <span id="s96">I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s97">We saw some quite a bit of action during that fall and winter, in the spring.</span> <span id="s98">But I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s99">I never received a wound in combat at all.</span> <span id="s100">The only wound I received was at one time when we were off the lines picking up replacements, and I had a bazooka blow up in my face, knock me down.</span> <span id="s101">And I didn't even qualify for a Purple Heart.</span> <span id="s102">I was blessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What was your injury at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I had a lot of powder burns on my face.</span> <span id="s105">It stunned me.</span> <span id="s106">When I picked myself up, I had blood all over my face.</span> <span id="s107">But like I said, I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s108">It really didn't do a permanent injury.</span> <span id="s109">I had some scars that showed here for a while, but I suppose they're gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Were you out of action for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: You just kept going?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Just kept going.</span> <span id="s114">We had been pulled off the lines for a few days to pick up some new replacements.</span> <span id="s115">The 45th Infantry Division had a lot of casualties throughout the war.</span> <span id="s116">And they were one of the divisions the first divisions, as I understood it, over in South Africa.</span> <span id="s117">And then they came all the way up through Sicily and Italy and southern France.</span> <span id="s118">And of course, I had joined them way up in northern France up in AlsaceLorraine.</span> <span id="s119">They had seen a lot heavier action before I even joined the unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So how did that period end?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, our unit was I don't know exactly how to We were up in the mountains on the 7th Army front at the time that the socalled Battle of the Bulge took place over on another front.</span> <span id="s122">And our unit as well as some of the other units had to pull back from the position we were in because we were being surrounded.</span> <span id="s123">We spent Christmas Day or Christmas Eve up in the foxholes up there.</span> <span id="s124">And we were actually I think had crossed over into Germany.</span> <span id="s125">And then just a day or two or a short time after Christmas, we had to pull back during the night and take new positions further back.</span> <span id="s126">A short time after that and this gets real fuzzy there I was sent back to headquarters, suffering from battle fatigue.</span> <span id="s127">I was all stove up with, I guess, arthritis or something.</span> <span id="s128">We had been in the snow and the water and everything up there.</span> <span id="s129">And during the time that I was the days that I was back, three or four days, I guess, my unit was actually cut off and captured or killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s130">I'll never know why I was spared that.</span> <span id="s131">But as a result of this, our unit I think our whole battalion and parts of another battalion were rendered inoperative, I guess you'd say.</span> <span id="s132">A lot of the men were taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s133">We were pulled back then and attached to some other units.</span> <span id="s134">And I don't know I don't remember what units.</span> <span id="s135">But then we were reorganized, and still then the 157th Infantry, Colonel Sparks was still our battalion commander.</span> <span id="s136">And we then started to move forward</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s138">I'm going to move the microphone a little closer.</span> <span id="s139">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: We started moving rapidly then into Germany.</span> <span id="s141">This is during the latter days of the war then.</span> <span id="s142">We were traveling on tanks and other vehicles and heading across I don't remember.</span> <span id="s143">I think they call it the Saar Valley, but I'm not now of that.</span> <span id="s144">Some country plains in that farmland probably.</span> <span id="s145">We participated in the capture of Schaffenburg, which was an industrial town; Nuremberg; and then moved our next objective then was Munich.</span> <span id="s146">And as Colonel Sparks' narrative in the one book that I was reading down in the library, it was on our way to objective in Munich that the division came across the Dachau Concentration Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: So by then, you had seen quite a bit of combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Enough.</span> <span id="s149">Enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s151">So your next objective was Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Or Munich.</span> <span id="s154">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Our next objective was Munich.</span> <span id="s156">However, we were diverted then to liberate the Dachau.</span> <span id="s157">And I think, as I mentioned earlier, our sister company our battalion was given the objective of liberating the camp.</span> <span id="s158">Our sister company, "I" Company was in went to actually they were one of the first into the camp.</span> <span id="s159">"L" Company, which I was in, moved on in to occupy the town of Dachau.</span> <span id="s160">And then we were as soon as they saw the situation there and</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: The situation in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: In the camp.</span> <span id="s163">and the seriousness of it and all, then as I understand it our Munich objective was delayed and the colonel was told to fully liberate the camp and guard it until the military police could come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So what specifically did you experience in the liberation of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, like I say, it was a few hours or the next morning after the gates were crashed that our company was pulled in there.</span> <span id="s166">We were billeted in some apartment buildings outside of the camp where the Nazi officers had lived.</span> <span id="s167">And we were put on guard shifts I don't remember several hours at a time inside of the camp and around the camp was orders for no one to go in or out.</span> <span id="s168">There was a lot of typhus in the camp.</span> <span id="s169">There was all kinds of sickness.</span> <span id="s170">My understanding and my numbers may or may not be right.</span> <span id="s171">But my understanding was that at the time we got there there were about 17,000 prisoners in the camp and that they were dying at the rate of about 300 a day.</span> <span id="s172">They didn't obviously didn't want them out in the countryside.</span> <span id="s173">So while I was in there doing guard duty, we talked whenever possible.</span> <span id="s174">A lot of the prisoners in there would come up to our guard post and want to talk.</span> <span id="s175">They were overjoyed.</span> <span id="s176">And they would tell their personal stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Now, what language were they speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, some of them could speak English, but some of them were strictly speaking their German or Polish or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Did you understand any of the</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: At that time, I could understand some German.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: How did you know German?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Just from picking it up and talking to people and prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So from being in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s185">I never studied German.</span> <span id="s186">No, ma'am.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: One or two of the prisoners then insisted on taking myself and another buddy for a tour of the barracks where they were where they slept in these boxes that the pictures all show.</span> <span id="s189">I guess had we known then about all this typhus and everything, we probably wouldn't have gone.</span> <span id="s190">But anyway, they took us through there and they took us through the</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s192">Your hands are making a noise.</span> <span id="s193">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s195">I'm a little nervous, I guess.</span> <span id="s196">Took us through the barracks.</span> <span id="s197">Of course, there was a lot of the prisoners still in the boxes.</span> <span id="s198">Took us through the shower room where we saw these emaciated men being given showers and taking showers.</span> <span id="s199">We then went back to our guard posts.</span> <span id="s200">And this sort of thing was repeated for several days.</span> <span id="s201">And I think we were there four days altogether.</span> <span id="s202">And we had some interesting and some sad stories.</span> <span id="s203">There was one man came up to me and was speaking English.</span> <span id="s204">And come to find out, he had been a musician with one of the Dorsey bands, and he had gone over to Germany to settle a family estate or something and he'd been captured.</span> <span id="s205">Now, whether he was Jewish or not, I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: He was American?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: He was an American, but a musician.</span> <span id="s208">But anyway, he of course he was wanting to tell us his story.</span> <span id="s209">And he was really overjoyed because he had family back here.</span> <span id="s210">But some of the sad stories.</span> <span id="s211">One young Polish boy tell me in I guess in broken German, English, whatever we understood it that saw his parents butchered in front of his eyes.</span> <span id="s212">And another one told us about seeing the Nazis take these infant babies and throw them up in the air and shoot at them.</span> <span id="s213">Things of that sort.</span> <span id="s214">That's where it's hard to visualize, really, anything or anybody being that animalistic, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Let's go back to what you actually saw yourself.</span> <span id="s216">When you went into the camp the first day, did you go in with other men on a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Uhhmm.</span> <span id="s218">Went in probably marched in.</span> <span id="s219">I'm not sure of that.</span> <span id="s220">And then what we saw, of course, was the bodies laying out by the fence such as in that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Now, could you describe the picture?</span> <span id="s222">Because this is just an audiotape.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s224">Well, here on the back of this picture it describes just a few of the bodies which had been carried out of the barracks, dead, and not hauled to the crematorium yet.</span> <span id="s225">And these bodies were just laid out like sticks of wood out by the high barbed wire fence, and they were waiting to be burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Now, this is a photograph that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: This is a photograph that yes, with a camera that I had taken from a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: From a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: From a German soldier prisoner.</span> <span id="s230">Yes.</span> <span id="s231">And these bodies were just almost like skeletons.</span> <span id="s232">And then there was a boxcar on the siding, probably more than one boxcar.</span> <span id="s233">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s234">But there were bodies still piled in there that had been the Germans brought these people from some other camps that didn't have crematoriums, and they hauled them there and then they burned them.</span> <span id="s235">This photo is one of the boxcars with the side door open.</span> <span id="s236">Here is another photo of that.</span> <span id="s237">And after we got in and were given duty assignments, we were given a tour by some of the prisoners which included the they showed us the gas chambers where they lined up the concentration prisoners and had them undress and go through the what they thought was going to be a shower, a delousing shower.</span> <span id="s238">And they marched them into these gas chambers and gassed them.</span> <span id="s239">And then right in the room next to the gas chambers was a large room that had the bodies just thrown helterskelter, just mounted up like cord wood, again waiting to be burned in the furnaces which were in an adjacent part of that building.</span> <span id="s240">The fires were still going at that time because they were I suppose it was important to dispose of these bodies that were diseased and had died of disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So after the gates were opened, the bodies were still being cremated?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: So far as I remember it was, yes.</span> <span id="s243">That's a detail I don't remember for sure.</span> <span id="s244">I'm pretty confident they were because the fires were still burning and the bodies were piled up.</span> <span id="s245">There would have been probably more disease, danger and all.</span> <span id="s246">Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s247">I guess that's that and our visions of the barracks and talking with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Let's go back to what you were doing.</span> <span id="s249">You marched into the camp.</span> <span id="s250">And what was the next thing that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I'm not terribly sure, ma'am.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Well, you said that you were on guard duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s254">We were I don't know whether they took us in through the gates immediately or whether we marched to the outside and then were farmed up and assigned duty or what.</span> <span id="s255">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s256">But I know that within a matter of minutes or hours of our arrival, we were actually inside of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So your guard post was inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, ma'am.</span> <span id="s259">Most of them were.</span> <span id="s260">There was some I think out of the gates and that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: But you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s263">Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And what specifically were you told to do at your post?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: You know, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s266">I think probably just to make sure that there was no going in or out and no probably no fights or anything like that.</span> <span id="s267">There was so much turmoil then and there was so many ethnic groups, prisoners and all.</span> <span id="s268">I'm not terribly sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Do you remember anything that you had to do as far as your guard duty?</span> <span id="s270">Any fights you had to break up?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s272">No.</span> <span id="s273">There were some cases where I think some of the prisoners perhaps tried to call attention to some of the maybe some of the Nazi guards who had put on a prisoner uniform to try to get out.</span> <span id="s274">But I don't remember a specific case where this was where they pulled my attention to that or it was just so much confusion at that point.</span> <span id="s275">And these men these prisoners were so joyed to be liberated and eager to tell their stories.</span> <span id="s276">I guess it was probably all we could do to keep them off of us, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s277">Just picture a crowd pushing.</span> <span id="s278">Like this one photograph here.</span> <span id="s279">Here is a group of them that were this is a small group of the prisoners expressing their feelings at being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: In looking at the picture, what feelings do you see that they're expressing?</span> <span id="s281">How would you describe the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Well, most of them seem to be smiling.</span> <span id="s283">I see one man there making a face of some sort.</span> <span id="s284">Here is an old man sitting down in front here that's head down, probably maybe not even he might not even have been normal emotionally at that time.</span> <span id="s285">Because I'm sure a large percentage of them who had been in there very long, it would have been hard for them to keep their mental stability.</span> <span id="s286">It was hard for us to keep it.</span> <span id="s287">It happened and you may be aware of this that when our sister company went in there first, they were so upset about what they saw that they actually lined up about 40 or 50 of these Nazi guards and just mowed them down with machine guns.</span> <span id="s288">And another eager officer from another unit that was there almost got courtmartialed for killing these guards.</span> <span id="s289">But it was the sort of thing you would really expect because our soldiers were so torn up emotionally at seeing this type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: We have to stop and turn over the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Thomas Gardiner, Tape Number 1, Side B.</span> <span id="s293">Mr. Gardiner, you were talking about your sister company and how difficult it was for them and for your company to deal with all of the emotions that were involved.</span> <span id="s294">You mentioned when they first entered they had lined up some of the German guards and machinegunned them.</span> <span id="s295">Did anything like that happen with your company?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No.</span> <span id="s297">Because within the few hours that it took us to get in there, I think all of those guards that they'd found had been eliminated, probably, either killed or taken prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So the circumstances were a little different?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s300">Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: But you said that you were billeted in the quarters of the German officers.</span> <span id="s302">What were they like, the quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: They were some pretty deluxe apartments.</span> <span id="s304">Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Could you describe more specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Well, they were wellfurnished and seemed to have be welldecorated and and I suspect there were probably maybe nicer than what the equivalent officers in our military would be furnished.</span> <span id="s307">There was nothing second rate about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So after about four days, your company moved on?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s310">And then we moved on into Munich.</span> <span id="s311">And we saw very little action between there and Munich because Germany was falling apart at that point.</span> <span id="s312">I think some of the other units, maybe in other parts of Munich, may have had some combat getting in, but our entrance into Munich was pretty peaceful.</span> <span id="s313">And so we moved into Munich.</span> <span id="s314">We were We took over a section of middleclass family apartments and were billeted in Munich for I think about a month and guarding important installations, utilities and things of that nature, I guess water supplies and everything there in Munich, until a military government unit could move in and take over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Well, then we were packed up and shipped from Munich out to a town called Augsburg, AUGSBURG, I think.</span> <span id="s317">It was not too far from Munich, I don't believe.</span> <span id="s318">But we were put out there and billeted in some farmhouses.</span> <span id="s319">This was kind of a farm village.</span> <span id="s320">And we were there I think about a month, just marking time, waiting for reassignment orders, and were taking some exercise and routine training while we were there.</span> <span id="s321">And not anything really exciting.</span> <span id="s322">I myself and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby before the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the local cabinet shops on military materials exercise equipment, I guess.</span> <span id="s323">I don't remember what all we did make, but we had the free use of these cabinet shops and it was kind of a pleasant break from military life.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, then we were packed up and put on trains on the socalled 40 and eights, 40 horses or 40 men or eight horses.</span> <span id="s326">The boxcars.</span> <span id="s327">And we were shipped to a tent camp near Le Havre, France.</span> <span id="s328">I think we traveled several days there.</span> <span id="s329">And we were in this tent camp then, awaiting reshipment back to the States.</span> <span id="s330">And our division was scheduled to come back to the States for a short leave and a couple of months amphibious training.</span> <span id="s331">And then we were scheduled to be shipped over and participate in the invasion of Japan.</span> <span id="s332">While we were in a tent camp, the A bombs were dropped, much to our happiness because that eliminated the need for us to be invading Japan.</span> <span id="s333">So that's That was it.</span> <span id="s334">We were shipped back to the U.S. then on some of the victory freighters or victorysized ships.</span> <span id="s335">They hold about 2,000 troops, I think.</span> <span id="s336">And we got back to the States.</span> <span id="s337">We were given 45 days leave.</span> <span id="s338">And then those that didn't have enough points for discharge had to report to some other camps down in Texas.</span> <span id="s339">And I was one of those.</span> <span id="s340">I wound up down in well, two different camps down in Texas.</span> <span id="s341">And from that point I wound up being able to negotiate a discharge.</span> <span id="s342">My company was still doing some critical work, and they interceded for my release and returned to my job.</span> <span id="s343">And my wife had become pregnant during my 45 days leave, so I headed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Was that your first child?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s346">Yes, ma'am.</span> <span id="s347">And we had been married six years when he was born.</span> <span id="s348">And he was very much wanted.</span> <span id="s349">That's the heavyset fellow that was with us out here in the hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: So how was your readjustment to civilian life after all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Well, in a way I think it was much easier than a lot of the fellows had because I had a job to go to.</span> <span id="s352">I had a loving family.</span> <span id="s353">I wasn't hanging loose like so many soldiers were.</span> <span id="s354">It took some months, I think, to overcome the emotional part of it because I've always been sort of an emotional person anyhow.</span> <span id="s355">And I used to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s356">I'd stay up sometimes until 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock in the morning, working in my hobby shop just until I could get sleepy enough to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s357">I don't know.</span> <span id="s358">I guess gradually the trauma went away.</span> <span id="s359">I still 50 years later sometimes get a little bit emotional when I get to talking about it or if we see a war movie or something.</span> <span id="s360">But I guess that's quite normal too.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And what about your experience at Dachau?</span> <span id="s362">Is that something that you have thought about?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I have, yes.</span> <span id="s364">I was never a racist.</span> <span id="s365">Never in my life.</span> <span id="s366">I was brought up to not be.</span> <span id="s367">But through my experiences in the Army and then in Europe and then especially at seeing Dachau and seeing what racism could do to people, I came out with an obsession of not letting myself or any of my family ever become racist towards any ethnic group or color of people or whatever.</span> <span id="s368">And to this day, that's held pretty true.</span> <span id="s369">Because that's what caused most of that turmoil in Europe.</span> <span id="s370">The Nazis had to pick out somebody to blame the world's troubles on, and it happened to be the Jews and the non other nonGermans.</span> <span id="s371">And I don't see that.</span> <span id="s372">I believe very much in judging people as individuals.</span> <span id="s373">And I think it it helped me.</span> <span id="s374">Those memories has helped me be a stronger Christian.</span> <span id="s375">I was led to be a Christian on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s376">I had a battlefield conversion.</span> <span id="s377">I've tried to live it all my life.</span> <span id="s378">And I think being an active Christian, one must work actively against any kind of discrimination activity or anything.</span> <span id="s379">I've never been an activist in terms of joining any group because that's a form of hate itself.</span> <span id="s380">There's things like these Klu Klux Klan and some of these militia groups in the U.S. now and all that.</span> <span id="s381">Well, they're hate groups that if they were allowed to be out of control, they would be just as heartless as the German Nazis.</span> <span id="s382">Some of the things they've done have been very similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Just before this interview, I understand that you saw the exhibit in the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And why did you want to come to see the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Well, I guess partly to refresh my own memory.</span> <span id="s387">But I think more than anything because my oldest son had been here once before and had been kind of shocked by it.</span> <span id="s388">And I had talked to him about the things that I saw.</span> <span id="s389">And I had let my children see these photographs that we took and had emphasized to them that they must appreciate that it was real, the holocaust.</span> <span id="s390">It wasn't propaganda and so on.</span> <span id="s391">And my son really wanted me to come out with him.</span> <span id="s392">And I guess that's the primary reason.</span> <span id="s393">I guess if he hadn't come out here initially I probably never would have.</span> <span id="s394">But he brought a book back from here and I read it.</span> <span id="s395">And then we both bought the book, the Schindler's List book, saw the movie, and then there was the sequel to the Schindler's List, the Schindler Legacy or something.</span> <span id="s396">And I guess it just refreshed memories.</span> <span id="s397">And then my son developed a friendship or a business relationship or something with this Jewish man down in Houston who was from a survivor family or something, and they got to talking about collaborating on writing a book or something.</span> <span id="s398">I guess my involvement then has been more a matter of trying to support my son in a worthy endeavor than any personal desire on my part.</span> <span id="s399">It didn't open my eyes to anything new here, I think.</span> <span id="s400">It maybe just emphasized the immensity of the things that went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s403">Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s405">Well, thank you very much for telling us your story.</span> <span id="s406">It's very important, and we appreciate your giving your testimony.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I hope that it's somehow, some way maybe helps to prevent a reoccurrence at any time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s409">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Tom Gardiner.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
