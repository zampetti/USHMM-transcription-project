printing business in the city of Vilna.</span> <span id="s39">We used to print few newspapers, daily papers and weekly and other...other things.</span> <span id="s40">And then before the war, we my brother was killed in France.</span> <span id="s41">He was a part of the printing business and we under our name Central Printing Company and this was till the end and then Germans came in the

the time bringing us, delivering us milk, and she came from a part of the Ponari.</span> <span id="s45">When she came she say that she saw a lot of people, Jewish people were...were brought over to Ponari and they were shot them, shoot them.</span> <span id="s46">When she told us to our people and nobody wanted to believe this what she said she saw.</span> <span id="s47">But I was among the only few what I believe it what she said.</span> <span id="s48">So I know already what we can expect from the Germans and therefore I tried something to do about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What did you try to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I..</span> <span id="s51">.</span> <span id="s52">I have...I belong to all my years to the organization Betar, Zionist Betar organization.</span> <span id="s53">So I tried to contact all...a few other people what I know very well that she had something together organize an underground movement so we can go against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Tell me...tell me...tell me who is in this movement?</span> <span id="s55">How did you get to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I contacted one...one of them is Dor Schneider, Dof Schneider, and a girl Rifka Karpikes.</span> <span id="s57">We three start planning to do something.</span> <span id="s58">And we do...we did all kind of preparation work to organize an underground.</span> <span id="s59">In the meantime came the head of the Lithuanian organization from Betar, the Betar, Joseph Glassman.</span> <span id="s60">So we told him what we did till now, and after he came to Vilna, to Vilna ghetto, we decided to give just to him he should be in charge of the whole preparation work.</span> <span id="s61">And he did so and I..</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">he took over the whole organization work and he contacted other Vilna organizations and they organized altogether a movement by the name, name is United Partisan Organization.</span> <span id="s64">After a lot of work...</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What work?</span> <span id="s66">What kind of work?</span> <span id="s67">What did you have to do to organize?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: We first organized to get...to get the rifles of the ghetto, ammunition to get...to get all kind of weapons to be able to resist the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: How did one get rifles and weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: The first thing we have to do to have money.</span> <span id="s71">But then we tried to buy from Germans, from Polish, from Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s72">Whoever want to sell, we have to be prepared to be able to buy.</span> <span id="s73">And to this reason we need a lot of money.</span> <span id="s74">So one time already...when we were already in the business...uh... organizing the underground, I came up...uh...with a project to print underground false paper...false cards, red cards.</span> <span id="s75">And this we can see the products and have money.</span> <span id="s76">And that's what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How did you... Explain.</span> <span id="s78">These were false cards of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I printed false cards and we got almost a million marks.</span> <span id="s80">Like now would be a million dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Is this false money you printed?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No.</span> <span id="s83">No.</span> <span id="s84">False cards.</span> <span id="s85">For these cards, we got from the Germans we get produce, products and we sold them.</span> <span id="s86">And that's for us the main ... the main income ... income for the organization.</span> <span id="s87">Before we did all kind of things.</span> <span id="s88">We made collections among themselves.</span> <span id="s89">Everybody give what they can.</span> <span id="s90">Even the gold rings, the wedding rings, other things but that wasn't enough to get for the ammunition what we need to buy because it was very expensive.</span> <span id="s91">But after this with my project, we got a lot of money.</span> <span id="s92">We were able to buy everything what we get until the end to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Tell me about the printing press?</span> <span id="s94">Where did you keep it?</span> <span id="s95">How did you physically do this with the Germans there?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: We...I..</span> <span id="s97">.</span> <span id="s98">I was working in a..</span> <span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">in a printing...Lithuanian printing place what I know before.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">He...he did for me a favor and he talked for me to...to work in his place.</span> <span id="s102">No...No Jews were...were allowed to work in no place...no printings.</span> <span id="s103">I was the only one to work in a printing place.</span> <span id="s104">And the reason was this because he went to...to the Gestapo to say that in the ghetto lives one guy, a Jew, Isaac Kowalski, and he can help me to...to publish the book...the...the magazines.</span> <span id="s105">If...if he'll not be able to come to my place to work, I will not be able to...to publish the magazine.</span> <span id="s106">And this was... uh...in their best interest there should be printed their...their publications what he is printing.</span> <span id="s107">So they give him a pass...special permission, so Isaac Kowalski can work in their printing.</span> <span id="s108">And I went with...with the intention to be able to steal material for our printing.</span> <span id="s109">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s110">I..</span> <span id="s111">.</span> <span id="s112">everyday...I stole all kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s113">When I completed...it took a few...few months, one, a Polish man what he was in the underground, the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s114">He was living in the city.</span> <span id="s115">He came to me every day and throughout the organization.</span> <span id="s116">As the connection, he came to me every day 12 o'clock past lunch time and I used to give him...uh... uh...what...what the army was wearing.</span> <span id="s117">The...they had to eat, you know, the soup.</span> <span id="s118">How you call it...you know, by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: By bowls of soup.</span> <span id="s120">Bowls of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Uh...the soup...the soup you know.</span> <span id="s122">So he came with that thing like this, and I used to exchange them.</span> <span id="s123">I used to give...I used to give him a full type, and he used to give me an empty one.</span> <span id="s124">I everyday 12:00.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: A pail of some kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: A pail.</span> <span id="s127">Yes.</span> <span id="s128">For the army, special pails what the army was wearing.</span> <span id="s129">And he exchanged the same thing.</span> <span id="s130">I give him a full one and he give me a empty one.</span> <span id="s131">In this way took for months, 6 months, til he got all the material what he needed to be able to...to establish a little printing plant.</span> <span id="s132">One time he didn't came to me 12 o'clock.</span> <span id="s133">I was having...everything what I have my...on myself.</span> <span id="s134">So I was really supposed because I couldn't...I couldn't wait to go in back with the stuff so I went later on the ghetto with the stuff I have on myself and later on I found out why he didn't came because he felt that the Gestapo or some...somebody's going after him and look at him.</span> <span id="s135">So he decided not to come to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">This was for me a big...a big hardship, you know, to...to bear this all over the city and in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s137">But later on they...they catched him and they...they find him and they tortured and tortured him for death...to death.</span> <span id="s138">But not this time, and he didn't have a chance to say about me nothing because I was in the partisans.</span> <span id="s139">So otherwise, I would be together with him.</span> <span id="s140">Uh...The...the one ghetto...in ghetto I have also brought over material ...uh ...printing, so I decided in case something happened to the ghetto printing, I have another reserve printing in the city or if something happened to the city printing, I have something reserved in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s141">So we have...there were two printing press...two printing places.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Explain...explain a little more.</span> <span id="s143">You had yours in the ghetto...in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I..</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">I..</span> <span id="s147">.</span> <span id="s148">I have a printing place equipped in the ghetto and have a printing place equipped in the ghetto...in the outside, and not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s149">Sometimes I was working in...in this place and sometimes I was working in by the...by the Polish in his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How did you get from one to the other through all the guards and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Only the people what they were in the ghettos, they cannot understand what I mean.</span> <span id="s152">If I have to go to the city as a..</span> <span id="s153">.</span> <span id="s154">as a not a Jew and to go...when I was there, I was not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: You had false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s157">But this was a very dangerous thing to do, but I..</span> <span id="s158">.</span> <span id="s159">I managed to...to...to get where all these things, and we printed all kind of leaflets, publications against the Germans.</span> <span id="s160">Here...I have in my book a big writer, a famous writer, he wrote the story about my...my printing presses cause he...he find out these leaflets posted on the Gestapo's houses.</span> <span id="s161">And when they came out from their home, they find leaflets against the Germans.</span> <span id="s162">So they were looking...trying to find the printing for...for all kind of money.</span> <span id="s163">They offered a lot of money if somebody can point for them who did it.</span> <span id="s164">They didn't expect it that Jewish people are doing this cause they couldn't imagine something like...like this.</span> <span id="s165">But this writer, he...he positioned a airplane cut us off, in the 1950s, so he wrote the...the story about this.</span> <span id="s166">That all over the Gestapo houses where even their houses are posted our leaflets and was for them a big surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: How did you feel doing all of this work?</span> <span id="s168">What was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: You see we were then a big organization.</span> <span id="s170">Very, very organized.</span> <span id="s171">There were some...a lot of people.</span> <span id="s172">We send them out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s173">They distributed the leaflets all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">They...they posted them.</span> <span id="s175">They put them on the floors on the sidewalks, and Gentile people pick these up and this was a big sensation in the ghetto, but everybody was ...was thinking the Polish was being doing this, some...some...some other thing, but not the Jewish people are going to be able to do so.</span> <span id="s176">And the truth is this was complete a Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s177">I..</span> <span id="s178">.</span> <span id="s179">I did the project.</span> <span id="s180">I organize the help of all kind of people.</span> <span id="s181">But this was a Jewish enter...enterprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you...how did you feel...you were in danger all the the time.</span> <span id="s183">How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: In danger, everybody...every Jew that was in the ghetto was in danger.</span> <span id="s185">.</span> <span id="s186">in danger, but I was 10 times more in danger because if...if they would catch me, they wouldn't give me.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">This...all the time I expected this.</span> <span id="s188">One time even I..</span> <span id="s189">.</span> <span id="s190">I asked they should give me, poison.</span> <span id="s191">I should have in case I needed so I got it because I figure if I fall in their hands it's better to kill myself than...than ...than fall in their hands.</span> <span id="s192">And I..</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">I..</span> <span id="s195">.</span> <span id="s196">I described this in my book where very, very...everything in detail what I am saying here.</span> <span id="s197">So I was...uh...lucky and I am alive.</span> <span id="s198">I am 91.</span> <span id="s199">I am

<span id="s202">You did all kinds of other illegal things.</span> <span id="s203">You had a conversation at one point with a Sergeant Schmidt.</span> <span id="s204">Can you tell us about this?</span> <span id="s205">Who was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Our organization came across of a guy, a German...a German officer which was for the Germans working, and we find out he's against...he's against the Germans.</span> <span id="s207">He's against the Gestapo, against the Third Reich...Third Reich.</span> <span id="s208">So we tried to...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s210">I am going to stop you and ask you to say it again for the cameras, but I want you to say it and use his name.</span> <span id="s211">Okay?</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s216">He was a sergeant in the German army and he was coaching them and he was anti...anti-Hitler.</span> <span id="s217">So we tried to find...I engaged him in our...in our organization, and he was happy to do this and did us...for us a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">He gave us the and he was taking it from one place to another.</span> <span id="s219">He endangered...he endangered his life very much until he got one day caught.</span> <span id="s220">He got caught and...uh...they killed him.</span> <span id="s221">They killed him.</span> <span id="s222">They killed him.</span> <span id="s223">They sent later on they sent his shirt to his wife.</span> <span id="s224">They were living in house there.</span> <span id="s225">So they send his shirt to the wife to show that your husband betrayed the title and the...the shirt from your husband.</span> <span id="s226">But he was very helpful for us, and we remember him all...all the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: What was Antone Schmidt like as a person?</span> <span id="s228">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What kind of a person was Antone Schmidt?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: He was a very nice person.</span> <span id="s231">He was a..</span> <span id="s232">.</span> <span id="s233">he was a anti-anti Hitler, anti-Hitler.</span> <span id="s234">He was...he was delivering the milk, the German milk to the farms, so he got trucks and he got the ability to move one place to the other.</span> <span id="s235">And this was very good for us.</span> <span id="s236">He was able to take us all kind of places with his truck til one day they caught him and they grabbed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: But he was a very nice person, and I am respecting him all the...all the years.</span> <span id="s239">Q: As the massacres began in Vilna...</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: From 1941 on really... A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s243">How did you and your organization respond?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Before we were driven in the ghetto came out a Polish newspaper.</span> <span id="s245">He was a Polish...his paper under German control.</span> <span id="s246">And this paper the editorial was...the first day of the editorial was...there's a Jew...when he is laying...when he is laying unconscious, you can still...still hit him and not have pity on him.</span> <span id="s247">So with words like this, I can right way imagine what we can expect from them.</span> <span id="s248">So this was...this was one of the...one of the driven motive to...to do something against the propaganda what the German were putting up to the people, the Polish and the Lithuanian that were living in Vilna.</span> <span id="s249">Let's tell the story the other side from the coin.</span> <span id="s250">We didn't have much for to say because the fronts were terrible.</span> <span id="s251">The Germans were going very fast and they were...they were...there were...uh...killing a lot of soldiers all over, so we didn't have what to say too much about this.</span> <span id="s252">But later on, we tried to...to bring news from the fronts to tell them that it's not entirely true what they say.</span> <span id="s253">They have all over just the...the...the right way for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">There was a lot of people were dying from their side and we called to the...to the population not to enlist in the armies...in the German Army and to the Germans we put out leaflets they should desert from the army or should go in the ...in the...to the partisans.</span> <span id="s255">Later on came out a lot of times, the Germans looked in the barracks and they find the leaflets but the Germans in the pockets and this was come out one side, this was a terrible blow to the Germans to find the leaflets inside this.</span> <span id="s256">On the other side, it's a good thing the Germans tried to keep the leaflets in case something happened they should be able to go to the...to the partisans to show for them a they didn't throw away the leaflets even when it dangers our lives because we really want one day to come to the partisans.</span> <span id="s257">And this... I was very proud and I heard it's a lot of times happen like this how the leaflets came to the Germans in the pockets.</span> <span id="s258">And this was my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s260">What happened after the famous massacre at Ponar.</span> <span id="s261">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: We did all right away like I say from the milk woman, this was from the fields they...they in the ghetto when they came in, in...in September, in June...uh...1941, so we have know right away what they are doing.</span> <span id="s263">But later on was in a massacre when before was few thousands, later on was a few...10 thousands.</span> <span id="s264">Right away, they brought them over and they shoot them.</span> <span id="s265">But the ditches...ditches...but they dig ditches where they...uh...in Ponari.</span> <span id="s266">And this is today a very well known story all over, like other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What did you as a member of the resistance do after that massacre?</span> <span id="s268">Did you print more leaflets?</span> <span id="s269">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s271">We...we printed leaflets.</span> <span id="s272">We with a..</span> <span id="s273">.</span> <span id="s274">to the people whoever doesn't believe is a fool.</span> <span id="s275">You can see what is happening.</span> <span id="s276">They took out a lot of people and they never came back.</span> <span id="s277">So don't make illusions.</span> <span id="s278">You should know that ...that they're taking away the people to Ponari or some place else.</span> <span id="s279">You never come...they will never come back.</span> <span id="s280">So we to...to put up a resistance.</span> <span id="s281">This was our main work.</span> <span id="s282">We want to have all the masses behind...behind us, and this was very complicated because one day they find it...one of our coworkers, Polish or Lithuanian, they grabbed him.</span> <span id="s283">From them...them came out...they find out they are in contact with the commander of the partisan organization, and he...he was caught from them, and they killed him too.</span> <span id="s284">But we to the people that when we will make their work in the ghetto, they should stay behind us.</span> <span id="s285">But really didn't work out exactly they way we want put up a resistance in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s286">We decided to leave the ghetto to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s287">And up there to be put the...the resistance because more favor of...to the...to the...for us, for the partisans we can put up a better fight.</span> <span id="s288">So we decided the organization to move to the forest and this is another chapter in our organization because...uh...we...we have a..</span> <span id="s289">.</span> <span id="s290">a code word.</span> <span id="s291">We were to put up a resistance in the ghetto, in the walls in the ghetto, but after what was happened to when we say this...the masses, they are not sure they will go behind us so we decided to leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s292">On one part we went to the forest, 680 miles from Vilna, far away and up there was Glassman, Joseph Glassman.</span> <span id="s293">We told our 10 people...30 people were there and they were apprehended on the way from the Germans, when they have to cross a little bridge and a lot of them fell in battle but half of them managed to come to the forest, and up there they were in the partisans movement organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Excuse me, but which forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: forest.</span> <span id="s296">And there they were a few months, and they were fighting the Germans til they were caught...came across a big...a big offensive when the Germans with airplanes, with tanks and muscle and most of them fell again in this... in this battle with Joseph Glassman and...and...and...was among them.</span> <span id="s297">I was in another part of the forest with.</span> <span id="s298">This was closer to the...to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s299">We managed to...to leave in the last moment when the ghetto was surrounded from the Germans from Lithuania, from Estonia, all kind of army, SS, we were surrounded.</span> <span id="s300">Nobody could leave the ghetto and everybody was taken away in last moment to Estonia, Latvia, and we didn't know exactly what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s301">But that's the last final moment from the Vilna people.</span> <span id="s302">We managed to go to the canals.</span> <span id="s303">We went to the canals.</span> <span id="s304">We have this organized before.</span> <span id="s305">We...we...we have another couple of places, openings, and we went through the canals.</span> <span id="s306">I was among them.</span> <span id="s307">We went through almost half a city we have to go out.</span> <span id="s308">And we went out when ... in a place what was one block from the the main police station.</span> <span id="s309">Was an empty story...was an empty store and there we came out from the canals.</span> <span id="s310">This is a big chapter and I have this written in all details in my book too.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Were these the canals or were they sewers.</span> <span id="s312">Were they sewer lines?</span> <span id="s313">A: Sewers.</span> <span id="s314">Sewers.</span> <span id="s315">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Sewers.</span> <span id="s317">You came up a block from the police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: From...from the police station.</span> <span id="s319">There was the...the exit place for us, but we went all the way from the...from the ...from the canal through the city.</span> <span id="s320">I will never forget the first impression when I came in...in the hole to go in...in the canal.</span> <span id="s321">It was a fear here is my...my place where I am going to die.</span> <span id="s322">Shoes.</span> <span id="s323">I had a big mouth, shoes...I see mice...not mice...how you call?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Rats.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Rats.</span> <span id="s326">Big rats like...like cats.</span> <span id="s327">Cats they be so big.</span> <span id="s328">They were sitting over all and they were looking at...on us.</span> <span id="s329">We were coming down.</span> <span id="s330">I figured they're coming to jump on us But they...they have mind their own business.</span> <span id="s331">They were looking at us like under...they understand what is going on that these people are going to go through the canals.</span> <span id="s332">We don't have to touch them.</span> <span id="s333">They were sitting quietly and they let us go to all the way to canal.</span> <span id="s334">To me this was the biggest impression what I have made in this time.</span> <span id="s335">And was sometimes I have to...to swim in...in the filth until my health...half of my...my...til...til my face was full with what I have to jump in the filth.</span> <span id="s336">We went all kind of places.</span> <span id="s337">Other places were less filth.</span> <span id="s338">Other places were only to the knees.</span> <span id="s339">But other places we have to go to half of the stomach in the filth.</span> <span id="s340">And this way we have to move forward a half a city like this.</span> <span id="s341">And we came out...we came out like I say in...in the exit place was very close to this police main office.</span> <span id="s342">We chose this place because we figure whatever they will try to find, they are not going to find behind...in their own back yard.</span> <span id="s343">So there...we chose this place should be the...the exit place.</span> <span id="s344">There we have a place...people what we are waiting for us, she's a Vilna partisan, and, a Lithuanian, a policeman...a regular policeman from the...from one of the police.</span> <span id="s345">He was working with us.</span> <span id="s346">He was...uh...watching that nothing should happen to us.</span> <span id="s347">And this used to come to me in my printing.</span> <span id="s348">His...his task was to look on the...on the...on the woods because we have to go with woods to the forest.</span> <span id="s349">So one time he came to say the roads on the...are full with the army...people with...with trucks.</span> <span id="s350">We can't go.</span> <span id="s351">So this we have to stay another day.</span> <span id="s352">And when he say the trucks are not running there, so we were able to go.</span> <span id="s353">So this was a big story you know to go through the city...uh...for us to write the full story about it, but here I can't...just to say a few words about this.</span> <span id="s354">So we managed to come to the forest.</span> <span id="s355">Up there we found some other partisans, and we were regular partisans became and we were fighting the Germans whatever we can whenever we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: How did you set up in the forest?</span> <span id="s357">A: In the forest...</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In the forest we have...in the beginning it was very hard to live.</span> <span id="s360">With food we are a problem.</span> <span id="s361">With food but we managed to get it from...from the villages around, we got our food what we need, and we have our ammunition and rifles what we brought over from the...from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s362">With this, we... we went all kind of actions for...against the Germans.</span> <span id="s363">We killed the Germans.</span> <span id="s364">We took away their rifles, their ammunition from time to time.</span> <span id="s365">Every time we got bigger ones and more successful and we blow up bridges and railroads and we gave the Germans really a hard time.</span> <span id="s366">And we have...to this we have a lot of luck, because the Germans considered us much, much stronger than we really we were.</span> <span id="s367">They were very much afraid.</span> <span id="s368">They have posters all over.</span> <span id="s369">Be careful.</span> <span id="s370">Go with your...with your...uh...with your rifles ready because here is...the forest infested with bandits, with Jewish bandits cause they know they are going in this...in this neighborhood they have to expect everything from the Jewish bandits.</span> <span id="s371">The Jewish bandits were partisans from the Vilna ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Did you ever go on these raids to blow up bridges and things?</span> <span id="s373">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Did you ever go on a raid to blow up a bridge or attack a German?</span> <span id="s375">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s376">I was a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Can you tell us about one of those raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: We were...one time we went to...was a village, a very strong village, a big village.</span> <span id="s379">The Germans give them...give them rifles everybody and say listen, "Your task is when you see going through the partisans, you have to kill them to...to kill the partisans.</span> <span id="s380">You don't have to wait to call for the Germans to do the job.</span> <span id="s381">First, you will protect yourselves this way from the partisan, and on the other side, if you are not going to do the way what we...we like, you'll get killed from us.”</span> <span id="s382">So they didn't really have another choice, and they...they took the...the rifles from them and they...that's what they did.</span> <span id="s383">When we were...have to go to this village, they used to apprehend us and...uh...we have to fight with them.</span> <span id="s384">We have all the time a little...uh...people...were...were fell in battle and...uh...the Germans were...were very happy with their work so they give them all kind of ...uh... sugar, things, other things what there were shortage and but we decided if you are working with the Germans, then we'll ...we'll give you a lesson what we have to do.</span> <span id="s385">So one day we for fuel places and we apprehended the village and we killed a lot of people there and we...we destroyed the village.</span> <span id="s386">And this...all the villages around saw what happened if you take ammunition, if you take weapons from the Germans, then the partisans...partisans will go behind you...after you.</span> <span id="s387">So they...they rejected to take the weapons from the German, and from this time we were able to go wherever we want without having losses of partisans.</span> <span id="s388">This was one operation.</span> <span id="s389">Another time we were....the Germans used to travel on the front on the...from the locomotive assigned to victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">They were traveling to the...to the front with weapons, with tanks, with other things.</span> <span id="s391">So we know already this...all the time in this time...and this how he is passing by a special point close to us.</span> <span id="s392">We went there and we mined...put our mines and we blow up the...the train.</span> <span id="s393">One time.</span> <span id="s394">Another time.</span> <span id="s395">They have a lot of casualties the Germans with a lot of dead, and we have...sometimes we have also casualties, but most of the time we was very successful.</span> <span id="s396">They were very afraid to go passing by.</span> <span id="s397">They first they discontinued to the town in the nights because we...for us it was much better in the night.</span> <span id="s398">We saw what you're doing.</span> <span id="s399">We know the...the neighborhood and everything.</span> <span id="s400">So the first thing what they did, they discontinued to travel in the nights.</span> <span id="s401">They were traveling only in the days.</span> <span id="s402">So this way we already accomplished something you know.</span> <span id="s403">They couldn't travel 24 hours like they want.</span> <span id="s404">And then we...we did our work in the days.</span> <span id="s405">We...we</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s407">Let's stop for a minute.</span> <span id="s408">You might want to take a Kleenex and wipe your mouth and take something to drink.</span> <span id="s409">You can use the towel here if you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Take something cool to drink.</span> <span id="s412">No.</span> <span id="s413">You want to keep going?</span> <span id="s414">Just fine.</span> <span id="s415">Give Mr. Kowalski a chance to breath.</span> <span id="s416">Let's just fix your jacket a little bit.</span> <span id="s417">There you go.</span> <span id="s418">Uh...What other raids did you go on or partisan attacks did you go on?</span> <span id="s419">What other kind of fighting did you do with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: We did like...that what I told you, we blow up bridges.</span> <span id="s421">We blow up...uh...trains.</span> <span id="s422">We blow up...uh...electric poles...poles we cut it down...we cut it down the poles, and they were disrupted in the telegraphic...in the electric, in the telegraphic contacts.</span> <span id="s423">This was our main thing we blow up factories where they were working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s424">And then we...uh...after...after German they posted the Germans, we used to fell...came after them and we used to kill them.</span> <span id="s425">One episode is what to tell is a..</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">a village where 10 Germans were posted there to...to...to watch our...our section in the forest so they know what they can expect from the partisans.</span> <span id="s428">So they contacted the partisans.</span> <span id="s429">They told them, "Let's make a deal.</span> <span id="s430">We will not touch you.</span> <span id="s431">You don't touch us.”</span> <span id="s432">We made a deal.</span> <span id="s433">We made with them the deal, and we didn't touch them and they didn't touch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: That's quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s436">Was...was...was a big surprise to me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s438">Stand up.</span> <span id="s439">I just want to fix your jacket a little bit.</span> <span id="s440">There we go.</span> <span id="s441">Okay.</span> <span id="s442">Uh...You did some printing in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: You did some printing in the forest, didn't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s446">Then...then...then after awhile I was in the forest, we decided the...the...the main...the main command.</span> <span id="s447">There were…there were people that were dropped from Moscow.</span> <span id="s448">They were dropped from the...the airplanes.</span> <span id="s449">They were in the command of the old partisan forest...the partisan.</span> <span id="s450">We belonged to them.</span> <span id="s451">And they decided to bring the printing...the printing from the city to the forest because in the city was very...but they didn't find out the printing.</span> <span id="s452">So we...we managed to bring the printing in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s454">Let's stop a minute.</span> <span id="s455">You get whatever you want to get out of your pocket.</span> <span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s458">You're comfortable?</span> <span id="s459">A: This is not going to be shown.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: No.</span> <span id="s461">No.</span> <span id="s462">Nobody is going to show this in public.</span> <span id="s463">This is just raw tape.</span> <span id="s464">A: Thirty years ago I didn't have to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Thirty years ago we didn't have to do a lot of things, you and I. Okay.</span> <span id="s466">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s468">Let's...uh...stand up a minute will you and just...we're going to sit you...stand up a minute and we're going to sit you down in your jacket again.</span> <span id="s469">Okay, sit up straight and...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Are you comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s472">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: No.</span> <span id="s476">No.</span> <span id="s477">No.</span> <span id="s478">What I want to do is ask you to tell us... A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: How...who brought the printing presses in the forest and how were they brought in?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: They have...like I told you at the printing place in my...in...in...in the city and they command given to contact with the people in the city and they told them to bring over the printing.</span> <span id="s481">They brought us over for...of a village cart...in a village cart.</span> <span id="s482">Uh...You know what the villages ...are are using.</span> <span id="s483">A cart which was on top was potatoes...I don't know what was on top and under was the printing.</span> <span id="s484">And there was on the printing and they gave it to and they told me, "Now, you are again the business.</span> <span id="s485">You do again what you can do.”</span> <span id="s486">And I published all kind of newspapers.</span> <span id="s487">All kind of newspapers and our partisans event all over, all kind of missions, the letters on the...on the highways.</span> <span id="s488">I put a little stone on this and when the people used to passing by, used to pick it up in the villages and we distribute among the villages, and there we told the story on the...on the fronts that the Germans are getting a lot of casualties and so on.</span> <span id="s489">And then was open the 7th front.</span> <span id="s490">All the commanders were away.</span> <span id="s491">Happened like...like that that all the commanders were away, but I was still there with the printing press.</span> <span id="s492">So I decided on a thing like that, a second front is well to make it a big...a big story.</span> <span id="s493">So I..</span> <span id="s494">.</span> <span id="s495">I give up a position to publish the communique what was about the opening of the second front.</span> <span id="s496">So they told me...the commander told me, "You take care of this.”</span> <span id="s497">I should be...be able to...to publish this.</span> <span id="s498">So I..</span> <span id="s499">.</span> <span id="s500">I went in place to the Jewish group of the partisans.</span> <span id="s501">I know of a couple of people they know perfect the German language.</span> <span id="s502">One was Dr., who died a couple of years ago and one is.</span> <span id="s503">He is still alive here in the United States.</span> <span id="s504">I decided to...to give them the...the... the mission to write a communique in German language, and he wrote in a perfect English.</span> <span id="s505">I printed this and we distributed this and a lot of copies all over among the Germans...among the Germans.</span> <span id="s506">And this was...for this I was really commended later on after the war when the command was in order to get a very high medal for this, but I didn't wait to get the medal.</span> <span id="s507">I went right away.</span> <span id="s508">I left Vilna, but anyway there were very happy with...with this accomplishment from the German leaflet.</span> <span id="s509">I have this...I have the photostat from this...to this day in my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: The communiques were printed in German?</span> <span id="s511">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s513">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: We were printing in Lithuanian and in Polish, but the main thing was this one made a very big impression cause it was stated to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Where was the printing press hidden and how?</span> <span id="s516">How did you keep it hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We were...we have sleeping cots.</span> <span id="s518">We were sleeping in bunkers, and like you...you saw this from you know in the forest in the jungles, we have bunkers under the... under the...under the...under the soil, and this was, but not like apartments, but you could...this was very good.</span> <span id="s519">We have our places where to sleep, and you could...we could...we have ovens from...the ovens what gave us the heat what we need from the cold weather.</span> <span id="s520">We have ovens...ovens, ovens, and we could live there.</span> <span id="s521">And there we have the mainstay...main stop which was sleeping there, and we have a radio.</span> <span id="s522">We have a contact with the...with the other parts of the partisans, with Moscow.</span> <span id="s523">I was sleeping next to the guy, the radioman, and he was all the time talking with Moscow.</span> <span id="s524">He was so I was all the time...we were...we know exactly what is going on with the weather and things like that.</span> <span id="s525">But we...that.</span> <span id="s526">But there we have other...our printing press, and I used to work like I used to work in the ghetto like I used to work in the city.</span> <span id="s527">We printed a lot of publications and we distributed them.</span> <span id="s528">And the command, the main command was very pleased with this because they thought it worked of things like it because some of the population, they figure if we have a printing, we can print like things like this then we should be very...very strong which can make...not a big people can do this.</span> <span id="s529">So this was for us a big propaganda for us.</span> <span id="s530">Because we are a organization, the partisans which have their own printing, own presses because the Polish paper one day we show up the Polish people because they have behind the masses...all the masses from the city, the people buying them so they figure out.</span> <span id="s531">So they...for them was a big ...a big accomplishment to have a printing press.</span> <span id="s532">So if...then... then Jewish couldn't...couldn't accomplish this.</span> <span id="s533">To them it's a surprise that we have a printing place.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Did you ever have to move the printing press?</span> <span id="s535">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: One time.</span> <span id="s538">One time we find out...uh...our intelligence group find out that Germans going to attack us.</span> <span id="s539">They are marching a lot of tanks and airplanes.</span> <span id="s540">Our intelligence find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">They're going to...to make a big...a big...a big...uh... offensive against the partisans.</span> <span id="s542">So we decided to move towards the whole store, all the printing place in another part of the city...of the forest.</span> <span id="s543">I was myself moved maybe 30 miles from there, but really never materialized the...the big offensive.</span> <span id="s544">What they did they bombard...they bombard with artillery and with airplanes, but they was afraid to go with the...with the what we were really 20, 30 miles away.</span> <span id="s545">We didn't have nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s546">After we find out that the Germans disappeared, we come back.</span> <span id="s547">This was the only time when we have to move the printing press.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Of all the people you worked with in the resistance...uh... perhaps one of the most famous of the resistance leaders was Abacostner.</span> <span id="s549">Did you know Abacostner?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I know him very well because we were in the same group.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Okay, let's stop a minute for the tape.</span> <span id="s552">When you go back, would you say, "I knew Abacostner very well.”</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I know very well Abacostner very well.</span> <span id="s554">He was really close.</span> <span id="s555">We were working very close.</span> <span id="s556">And I'll tell you even a piece.</span> <span id="s557">After the war we start organizing the...the escape of the Jewish people from Russia.</span> <span id="s558">So we...we organized an organization by the name Brichah.</span> <span id="s559">And this is how...later on it came out a big organization with the help all the people whoever want to go...to leave the place, to leave Lithuania...Russia to go to Israel, we helped them to do.</span> <span id="s560">So I was the number two...the number two man.</span> <span id="s561">With Abacostner, I was the second and this...and he helped me with the...in the Committee of the organization to...to move the people from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s562">I was the...his...very much in contact with him.</span> <span id="s563">We were working very much together.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s565">Can you tell us...before we get to after the war in Brichah which is a special chapter, during the war...during this period in the forest...first in Vilna and then in the forest, can you tell us about working with Abacostner during this period?</span> <span id="s566">Give me an incident where you worked with Abacostner during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I was working with him...</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Again, say it again, I was working with Abacostner...</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: I was working with Abacostner together because he was in the main...the main...uh...command from the partisan organization and the first time I came with my project to make a printing press, I came to the command of the partisans and he was among them.</span> <span id="s570">And I know him even...from even before the war, so whenever I saw him the street, we were talking like...like two friends.</span> <span id="s571">Not just because of the business, but later on he...we were winter times together in all kind of involvements which have to do with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Give me an example.</span> <span id="s573">What kind of things were you involved with with Abacostner?</span> <span id="s574">What did you do with him?</span> <span id="s575">Did you fight with him?</span> <span id="s576">Did he help you with the printing presses?</span> <span id="s577">Give us an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: He...he know everything.</span> <span id="s579">He was only from the few what really know what is going on with the printing press.</span> <span id="s580">Nobody know from the...from all the partisans didn't know.</span> <span id="s581">But the command people know about this, and he appreciated it very much because he know that I am printing the...the cards, and that we are getting a lot of...a lot of money.</span> <span id="s582">We are...we are buying weapons for this.</span> <span id="s583">So he told me a couple of times he is very proud of my work what I am doing because I'm...I'm...I'm the most what I am responsible for...for getting the weapons and everything on the outside.</span> <span id="s584">I made it possible to...to get all kind of money for this...for this thing.</span> <span id="s585">So I..</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">I..</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">and then...and then I have a lot of times with him to do everyday things and then when I was in the forest I was in another...uh... by the Lithuanians...the main...the main organization.</span> <span id="s590">I was...have station...my station was ...was there.</span> <span id="s591">But I used to come very often to them few months...few months away and Abacostner was the commander...was all the partisans altogether there and I used...when I have a little free time, I used to come over to them and we used to sing songs together and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s593">Uh...When you were in the forest and...and the war is drawing to an end, are there any other incidents that stand out in your memory?</span> <span id="s594">Did any...any...anything happened in the forest beside what you've told me that...that stands out, that's important, that should be told?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: With the Abacostner or in general?</span> <span id="s596">Q: In general.</span> <span id="s597">Anything at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Uh...We have...This was our daily bread.</span> <span id="s599">Every day we used to rest a day and then a day to go on all kind of missions and fight the Germans, blow up trains, and blow up rears and this was...and blow up...uh...poles, electric poles.</span> <span id="s600">This was our life all the day...all the days, and we came from operations we didn't have casualties and death...but for us a..</span> <span id="s601">.</span> <span id="s602">a big holiday.</span> <span id="s603">And we left...one time...one time we destroyed a train.</span> <span id="s604">Was maybe 200 German...German casualties.</span> <span id="s605">We have a big...big press with this.</span> <span id="s606">This was our life.</span> <span id="s607">To be killed, to get killed.</span> <span id="s608">This was the life of partisans.</span> <span id="s609">We did it work every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Can you tell us about liberation?</span> <span id="s611">When the war ended, how did the war end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: When we...we...when we got the message when the war was close to Vilna, we got an order from the main command.</span> <span id="s613">We must...uh...all the partisans have to go to...to liberate Vilna.</span> <span id="s614">And everybody...whoever is not without a foot, without...without a hand, he had to go...to go to...to ...with the partisans to liberate Vilna.</span> <span id="s615">But I was left behind because I was printing leaflets to...to the population of Vilna they should...the partisans they should honor them and they should help them whatever they can.</span> <span id="s616">They are a friend of them.</span> <span id="s617">A leaflet I was working, and one leaflet was from...from the main command written by...written by command, which...whom I meet later.</span> <span id="s618">I meet later cause he know about my activities, so he want to see me.</span> <span id="s619">So one day I have a big story of this, but this is a private thing.</span> <span id="s620">I don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s621">Anyway, when I came in in the city, I find my leaflets that I printed on the walls all over posted from the partisans recalling to the population they should...they should be happy and friendly to the partisans because we are not enemies from the population.</span> <span id="s622">We are friends of the population.</span> <span id="s623">We are...we are destroying the Germans.</span> <span id="s624">And this was my leaflet that I was working...working the last moment.</span> <span id="s625">And they came in...the Germans I don't know why...for why kind of reasons, they put up a stiff resistance in the city, with tanks, with airplanes, with airplanes, and they lost ten thousand people, just...just in a..</span> <span id="s626">.</span> <span id="s627">in a city like Vilna.</span> <span id="s628">The civilians was a big...big surprise because if they have to put up a resistance like this with each city, then they have...they need another 10 million soldiers.</span> <span id="s629">But after like this...in Vilna they put up a big resistance the Germans and they lost...they lost heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s631">After liberation, what did you and your printing press do?</span> <span id="s632">Did you bring your printing press back to Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s634">Yes.</span> <span id="s635">We were disbanded.</span> <span id="s636">All the partisan movement was disbanded.</span> <span id="s637">Everybody had to do something else work, and we were by the commanded appointed to do all kind of...I was...I was appointed to be the main...the editor, the director of the printing business all over, not on the front, for Vilna, for Lithuania, all the Baltic, all the printers and they entrusted all the...like a union all the printers the Baltic I was appointed.</span> <span id="s638">This was my work after the war in the beginning.</span> <span id="s639">I was there a short time and I left.</span> <span id="s640">And then we...we organized printings in the city.</span> <span id="s641">I..</span> <span id="s642">.</span> <span id="s643">I retired to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s644">Everybody...whoever was a doctor, whoever was an engineering, a bookkeeper, retired.</span> <span id="s645">They appointed him his...to his branch of work.</span> <span id="s646">That's a lot of people went to the other...other government functions, but all in all, we were appointed from the government.</span> <span id="s647">They have the amnesty list and they give us all kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Tell me about organizing Brichah?</span> <span id="s649">How was Brichah organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: The Brichah we know right away, we have no future in Vilna anymore because it was so much before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s651">We have a big synagogue.</span> <span id="s652">The...the...the synagogue was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s653">Only few synagogues was torched and destroyed They destroyed the biggest synagogue in the city, because the Germans were holding their pharmacy...pharmacy supplies so survived the...the synagogue.</span> <span id="s654">After this comes the Rosh Hashanah, and all the people what they were survived come...come to the Rosh Hashanan to the...to the schul.</span> <span id="s655">So I know the schul before the war used to be 5 or 8 thousand people used to take in, so we were maybe 500 people all in all what survived after the war.</span> <span id="s656">From the partisans were hiding.</span> <span id="s657">So all the people were around the Bema• just in front of them, so we were talking to...to ourselves.</span> <span id="s658">What's left of us in Vilna.</span> <span id="s659">It was a pity to look around the Bema the people what survived the war.</span> <span id="s660">So we know this right away there's no future for us to stay there.</span> <span id="s661">We don't have t be a Zionist all the time.</span> <span id="s662">We dreamed to go to Israel to Palestine this time, so I..</span> <span id="s663">.</span> <span id="s664">I apprehended Abacostner.</span> <span id="s665">I told him let's do something to move our people there.</span> <span id="s666">He was very, very, very happy to hear this because he was of a mind to...then he called another.</span> <span id="s667">He was over the main command from the partisans before and we quickly...quickly organized the beginning of the Brichah.</span> <span id="s668">And this is not natural.</span> <span id="s669">Again a big, big story.</span> <span id="s670">We were sent up to people to find out how to...how this works.</span> <span id="s671">We sent away.</span> <span id="s672">She became in Israel a very popular person.</span> <span id="s673">We sent out from Vilna she should go to...to Rumania then to Israel to...to tell the story of the regards from our people.</span> <span id="s674">And she accomplished this.</span> <span id="s675">She went over from...from Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">From Vilna I gave her a..</span> <span id="s677">.</span> <span id="s678">a document, and that she's an editor of a newspaper and I'm sending her to Rumania and with these papers she came to Rumania uninterrupted and from there she came to Israel and she gave a report to...to a high...to Ben Gurion, other people from Israel, and they have a very good information what was going on during the war in Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s680">I think you have told us the important...</span></p></body></html>
