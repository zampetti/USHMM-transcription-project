that he has saved for 50 years as a memento of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">HK: I was in Birkenau and on the Death March.</span> <span id="s12">I marched from Birkenau to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s13">Every January 19th, Norbert Wollheim and a group of us – we go out to dinner to celebrate the day we left Birkenau.</span> <span id="s14">I’ve only gone in the last several years but there are about six or eight of us.</span> <span id="s15">Before the last few years we didn’t go because everyone was busy with their own things.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: When you get together, what do you usually talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">HK: Mundane things but sometimes you make references to the camps.</span> <span id="s18">We remember, for example, how three fellows who ran away were hung.</span> <span id="s19">One of them was Freddy Diamet’s brother.</span> <span id="s20">He lives in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">HK: In Leipzig, Germany, in 1926.</span> <span id="s23">On October 28, 1938, along with other Jews of Polish origin, my father was sent back to Poland.</span> <span id="s24">My mother fainted at the border and so they moved her ahead.</span> <span id="s25">If not for this, we might have been sent back to Germany and perhaps from there we might have escaped to America.</span> <span id="s26">They gave him two hours to pack.</span> <span id="s27">We ended up in his home town, Tarnow.</span> <span id="s28">My grandfather was born in Lancut.</span> <span id="s29">I was in the same camp as Abe Krieger’s father.</span> <span id="s30">I stayed four weeks in Birkenau because it was basically a transit camp.</span> <span id="s31">Everyone went there first to be quarantined.</span> <span id="s32">The old-timers were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s33">If you survived the first few weeks in Birkenau, you had a good chance.</span> <span id="s34">Anyway, we had the idea that we would be big heroes and it was nothing.</span> <span id="s35">Only my brother and I survived.</span> <span id="s36">We were in Paris after the war and came to America because my uncle sent us papers.</span> <span id="s37">We left from Cherbourg on the SS Marine Floyd.</span> <span id="s38">And no one helped us, so we did some black market business to pay for our passage.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WH: Where did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">HK: In Baltimore on July 4, 1946.</span> <span id="s41">No one was there to pick us up.</span> <span id="s42">It was very hot and we were wearing these heavy suits.</span> <span id="s43">There was a mix-up and my uncle wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s44">So we took the train ourselves to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: How did you manage to get there by yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">HK: A katzetnik gibt sich an eitzah.</span> <span id="s47">You also have to be able to improvise.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: Do you ever say that when something goes wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">HK: You don’t want to think about the past.</span> <span id="s50">You want to forget it and look to the future.</span> <span id="s51">But I’m basically a pessimist.</span> <span id="s52">You know why?</span> <span id="s53">Because in my life, whatever could go wrong, did.</span> <span id="s54">Nothing ever went right.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: On the other hand, you’re here.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">HK: That’s right.</span> <span id="s57">And we brought up three lovely children.</span> <span id="s58">My daughters went to public school through high school and Stern College.</span> <span id="s59">Each one married a very religious boy.</span> <span id="s60">My son went to Y.U.H.S. and then N.Y.U. and has an M.A. in Business Administration and works for Phillip Brothers in the Metals Division.</span> <span id="s61">One son—in-law works for Phibro Energy and the other is a financial analyst for Texaco.</span> <span id="s62">My oldest daughter lives in Hillcrest and my other daughter lives in West Hempstead.</span> <span id="s63">My son lives in Forest Hills.</span> <span id="s64">All my children are observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: How does one adapt to life after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">HK: First, it’s a blessing that people can forget.</span> <span id="s67">Also, you’re often so busy that you don’t have time to think.</span> <span id="s68">You’re trying to make a living.</span> <span id="s69">Sometimes when things bother me, I say, why should it bother me?</span> <span id="s70">Like now, I’m going through a hard period.</span> <span id="s71">And I say to myself, why am I worried?</span> <span id="s72">I worked very hard physically since I came here in ’46.</span> <span id="s73">But it’s human nature.</span> <span id="s74">The setbacks bother me more lately than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HK: I always said to my children I’d have loved to go to college.</span> <span id="s76">As a matter of fact, I went to night school when I came here.</span> <span id="s77">And I went to City College (downtown) for two years at night.</span> <span id="s78">They wanted me to matriculate, but I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s79">I went to George Washington H.S. at night and graduated from there.</span> <span id="s80">There we had a group of survivors and we hung out together.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: What were your first impressions of America in Harrisburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HK: We were overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s83">My uncle had a house and put us in the attic and we were so impressed, but subsequently when we went back to Harrisburg, this house got smaller and smaller and the neighborhood got lousier and lousier.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: Were you observant then?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">HK: No.</span> <span id="s86">It was very hard then.</span> <span id="s87">We were observant in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: What about the religious questions people raised about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">HK: I still ask them.</span> <span id="s90">I returned because of my wife who came from a very religious home.</span> <span id="s91">She wouldn’t have married me unless I promised to keep Shabbos.</span> <span id="s92">She’s from Berlin.</span> <span id="s93">I didn’t mind because we were brought up like this.</span> <span id="s94">But I have my doubts.</span> <span id="s95">I do it because it’s a way of life.</span> <span id="s96">But if I wouldn’t do it, I could live just as well.</span> <span id="s97">My brother is not observant.</span> <span id="s98">He lives in Bellmore.</span> <span id="s99">He’s traditional.</span> <span id="s100">He says he’d love to keep Shabbos if it fell on Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: It seems that for many people, religion is more a form of community.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">HK: But I find that today’s children are more religious than the parents.</span> <span id="s103">I tell my children, it’s not whether this or that is kosher.</span> <span id="s104">You have to see the whole picture.</span> <span id="s105">It’s not such a terrible thing if you put on the light on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s106">In the realm of things, what difference does it make: When I got married and my wife told me she doesn’t answer the phone on Shabbos, I thought it was the stupidest thing I ever heard.</span> <span id="s107">And I still believe so, even though we have a machine.</span> <span id="s108">But I do it because it gives sholom bayis a certain way of life.</span> <span id="s109">But it wouldn’t bother me to pick up the phone on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s110">Okay, now, I’d probably feel terribly guilty picking up the phone on Shabbos, out of habit.</span> <span id="s111">But when you think about it, what terrible sin is it?</span> <span id="s112">All these little things.</span> <span id="s113">There are certain rabbis who make it their business to out-frum each other.</span> <span id="s114">They think of nothing else and don’t see the whole picture, to live with menschlichkeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HK: I don’t care what anybody says.</span> <span id="s116">There was no camp worse than Birkenau.</span> <span id="s117">We had to lie in those big rooms, 500 people to a room, 7 to a bunk, three tiers.</span> <span id="s118">And they had this big oven in the middle where they used to put your head in to punish you and then give you fifteen lashes.</span> <span id="s119">And during the day, we had to carry big rocks.</span> <span id="s120">And every evening we would come back and fifteen people would be dead, shot by the S.S., beaten by the dogs.</span> <span id="s121">How old was I, fifteen?</span> <span id="s122">Seventeen?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WH: How could you retain your humanity in the face of that assault?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">HK: Right.</span> <span id="s125">You try to survive.</span> <span id="s126">And what did we eat?</span> <span id="s127">A little bowl of soup and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s128">And you traded it for socks because you couldn’t walk with the Buna shoes they gave you.</span> <span id="s129">And you had to put rags on your feet so you didn’t have too many boils.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH: Did you see instances where people rose above this and tried to help each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">HK: No.</span> <span id="s132">Very little.</span> <span id="s133">Everybody tried to survive by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: How were you able to trust people afterward when you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">HK: You’re right.</span> <span id="s136">That’s why we were very disappointed when we came here.</span> <span id="s137">One of my first jobs was going door to door working for someone who had a junkyard.</span> <span id="s138">Then my brother and I got jobs in the fur market through people who knew my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WH: What did you do in your spare time?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">HK: I went to night school and on the weekends I went out with girls.</span> <span id="s141">I hung out with a group of other survivors on the West Side at a place called Tikvath Israel.</span> <span id="s142">It was in the Herzeliah Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WH: Would you buy a German car?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">HK: No, but we probably have Rosenthal dishes.</span> <span id="s145">I don’t think I’d go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s146">We were invited by my wife’s hometown, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s147">I was in Switzerland last year and it bothered me seeing all those German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">WH: When you first came and you had time to yourself, did you ever think: ‘What’s the point in going on living?’</span></p> <p><span id="s149">HK: Yes, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: Wasn’t there a feeling of being totally defenseless?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">HK: Yes, that’s why I hate to sit in traffic.</span> <span id="s152">I can’t stand waiting in line.</span> <span id="s153">I feel so helpless.</span> <span id="s154">I’m trapped.</span> <span id="s155">As long as I feel I’m in control, I don’t mind driving much longer.</span> <span id="s156">But this may not have anything to do with being a survivor.</span> <span id="s157">In general, if you follow other people, that’s the end.</span> <span id="s158">It was that way in the camps.</span> <span id="s159">You had to think for yourself.</span> <span id="s160">When I got to Auschwitz, I said my father and I fixed typewriters even though I had only cleaned typewriters.</span> <span id="s161">In general, I don’t like it when people say this is the way it has to be.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t accept that.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">WH: You went to Israel in 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">HK: Yes, because I thought I might want to settle there.</span> <span id="s165">I was very Zionistic, already in Europe before the war.</span> <span id="s166">It was about eight months after the war.</span> <span id="s167">We went on the SS Marine Carp.</span> <span id="s168">We had a wonderful time on the boat, all nice Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s169">I have a movie of it, how we’re singing Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s170">I had a brother here, so I didn’t go on aliya.</span> <span id="s171">I just went to look.</span> <span id="s172">We stayed on different kibbutzim, my friend and I.</span> <span id="s173">We sailed into Haifa.</span> <span id="s174">But when I came back here, I felt more at home in America, because my brother and friends were here.</span> <span id="s175">And relatives had come here from South America.</span> <span id="s176">Altogether, I stayed in Israel two and a half months.</span> <span id="s177">I didn’t like the kibbutz as a place to live because the regimentation reminded me of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: Can you ever trust people again after what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">HK: I’m very distrustful.</span> <span id="s180">Most people do what’s good for them.</span> <span id="s181">I don’t know how many Jews would do what some Christians did when they saved Jews.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t know if I would.</span> <span id="s183">If I had a situation where a colored fellow runs into my house, he’s being persecuted, I don’t know if I would put my life on the line to save him.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">WH: Do you think Jews are less altruistic than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">HK: Depends on the individual.</span> <span id="s186">That’s why the Israelis are so cocky.</span> <span id="s187">They think no one will help them.</span> <span id="s188">I like Israel; I don’t like the people.</span> <span id="s189">The taxi drives are rude.</span> <span id="s190">They try to beat you for a dollar.</span> <span id="s191">The people there annoy me terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WH: What was your wedding like?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">HK: Shimon Wincelberg, my wife’s brother, lives in California.</span> <span id="s194">So we flew to California to get married.</span> <span id="s195">It was a small wedding.</span> <span id="s196">We make big weddings for our children.</span> <span id="s197">But I always feel guilty about being happy, about letting myself go.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">WH: Where did you live after the wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">HK: In Forest Hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">WH: What do you do today?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HK: I sort skins within garments.</span> <span id="s202">It’s a specialty.</span> <span id="s203">It’s hard work because I’m on my feet all day.</span> <span id="s204">But with the Korean imports, business became very slow.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">WH: How come you moved to Great Neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">HK: We were looking for a shul and the house cost me $36,000 in 1959.</span> <span id="s207">I liked the house.</span> <span id="s208">They had a day school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">WH: Do you have long-term effects from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">HK: I have a terrible reaction to Clorox.</span> <span id="s211">I hate it because it reminds of when they used to put the bodies, stacked one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s212">But when I think of what I went through, I think: “Why should I be annoyed that I’m not working now?”</span> <span id="s213">But there are a lot of things that bother you and you weren’t in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">WH: What did you learn from the whole experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">HK: People are selfish and have to be to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">WH: Does that mean that those who weren’t selfish didn’t survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">HK: Most of the time, yes.</span> <span id="s218">Also luck.</span> <span id="s219">If the war had lasted another three months, I probably wouldn’t have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">WH: Were religious people more inclined to help each other or others?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">HK: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s222">The only thing you though about was to make it through the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WH: How does one overcome tremendous suffering?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">HK: Try to live your life as normally as possible because if you try to live in the past, you can’t live your life.</span> <span id="s225">People who can’t sleep, they still live in the past.</span> <span id="s226">I dread retirement.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">WH: Do you dream about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">HK: Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">WH: Do you talk to your children about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">HK: Yes, I have no trouble talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">WH: What do you think of psychiatrists?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">HK: After the war, I went to one from the German government in 1952.</span> <span id="s233">They didn’t know about survivors then.</span> <span id="s234">How come they don’t interview me now?</span> <span id="s235">Maybe I’m entitled to a bigger pension.</span> <span id="s236">At that time, I got $1,200 - $1,500.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">HK: Another thing that bothers me is why don’t the survivor organizations open homes for people that didn’t do well, who are suffering, old and didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s238">Everybody talks about the past.</span> <span id="s239">How about the present?</span> <span id="s240">There should be an old age home for survivors.</span> <span id="s241">It would be much better for them if they were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">WH: Do you ever regret that you didn’t go into business for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">HK: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s244">Also my uncle said to go to college.</span> <span id="s245">I’m sorry I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">WH: Do you think Americans understand what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">HK: Not really.</span> <span id="s248">But, on the other hand, people read about Cambodia in the paper today and then they turn to the sports or financial pages and forget about it.</span> <span id="s249">I can see that that’s what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s250">People want to know if the Yankees won.</span> <span id="s251">Unless you’re personally involved and had, maybe, relatives there, who gives a damn?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
