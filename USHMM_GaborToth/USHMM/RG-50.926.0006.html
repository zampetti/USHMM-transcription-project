I’ve started speaking a lot, because there are less and less people alive from the period that I was from.</span> <span id="s8">The more people die, the less availability there is to connect with the past.</span> <span id="s9">I speak for the people who can’t speak for themselves.</span> <span id="s10">I speak to kids, who have never heard about it.</span> <span id="s11">I speak because I think it’s very important to speak so it doesn’t happen again, and because the world is still not healed.</span> <span id="s12">The world needs healing.</span> <span id="s13">I speak at all kinds of places.</span> <span id="s14">I’ve even spoken in churches, Masonic halls, different celebrations, synagogues, but my favorite are still the children, because I want to reach them, because I think there is so much that they need to hear and so much that they’re interested in listening to.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">I come from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s16">Transylvania is a little area between Hungary and Rumania, which was, when I was being persecuted, it was Hungary, and then it became Rumania.</span> <span id="s17">It is still Rumania now.</span> <span id="s18">I come from a small town call Nagyvarad, which is a Hungarian name, and it is now called Oradea.</span> <span id="s19">It was a very nice little town.</span> <span id="s20">It was relatively civilized.</span> <span id="s21">You know, it was like—the “Little Budapest,” they used to call it.</span> <span id="s22">There were synagogues and churches, and we even had an opera house, and cinemas, cafes.</span> <span id="s23">It was quite a vibrant little community.</span> <span id="s24">It had a very large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s25">Not particularly religious, but it was sort of the hub of Transylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">My parents, in those days, were unusual, inasmuch as my father was Jewish, and my mother was Catholic, which, in itself, didn’t happen very often.</span> <span id="s27">My father’s parents came from Russia, from the Pale of Settlement, and they were survivors of a pogrom, which is when they used to ride into a small village and kill everybody—all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s28">You know, it was a small Jewish village.</span> <span id="s29">My grandparents were found in separate houses.</span> <span id="s30">My grandfather was still trying to nurse his mother, who was dead, and my grandmother was a tiny, little baby in some hay in a haystack.</span> <span id="s31">The people who saved them brought them over to Hungary, and the Jewish community took them in, and, obviously, they educated the men.</span> <span id="s32">The women didn’t get educated.</span> <span id="s33">These two people married each other.</span> <span id="s34">Although they were from the same village, they were not related, and they got married.</span> <span id="s35">My grandmother had nine children, two pairs of twins.</span> <span id="s36">When Grandpa was about forty-five years old, he fell through some ice and climbed out and managed to get home and had pneumonia and died.</span> <span id="s37">Grandma raised the nine children.</span> <span id="s38">Every single one of them went to school.</span> <span id="s39">She was very poor, but at night she would wash and iron their clothes dry, so they could go to school in clean clothes the next day.</span> <span id="s40">Mercifully, she died before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s41">She did not see all her children destroyed, which was a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">We had a very large Jewish family.</span> <span id="s43">I remember, when they would come to dinner, there was like two very long tables pushed together, and there was like twenty-eight members of the family all sitting there.</span> <span id="s44">You know, with the usual family things going on, people not talking to each other, this one was angry with that one, and that one didn’t like who the other one married, but it was a normal, nice, big, loud Jewish family.</span> <span id="s45">I’m the only person who survived out of that whole family.</span> <span id="s46">So my parents were relatively old when I was born.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was thirty and my father was forty, which was late for those days to have children.</span> <span id="s48">My mother converted to Judaism to please my father’s big Jewish family, but neither of them was very religious.</span> <span id="s49">My mother had a big dressmaking business.</span> <span id="s50">In those days, people used to buy cloth and go to a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s51">There were no ready-made clothes.</span> <span id="s52">She had forty girls working for her.</span> <span id="s53">It was a big business.</span> <span id="s54">My father had a wholesale fishery.</span> <span id="s55">In the river that went through the town, he had big cages of carp.</span> <span id="s56">They were swimming in these big, big, big cages, and he would wholesale them.</span> <span id="s57">I remember as a child there was always a carp in the bath, because we had a lot of carp.</span> <span id="s58">I used to walk up to this carp and talk to it and apologize for eating them.</span> <span id="s59">You know, they look like old peasants, with long whiskers.</span> <span id="s60">I would apologize to this carp and say I’m so sorry, we’re going to eat you, but you know, you’re going to taste very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">I had a golden childhood, because my parents were very well off for those days.</span> <span id="s62">I mean, they used to go abroad every year, which was unheard of.</span> <span id="s63">We had servants, and maid, and gardeners.</span> <span id="s64">No car.</span> <span id="s65">Nobody had a car.</span> <span id="s66">We did have a phone, which was a big deal.</span> <span id="s67">I had everything.</span> <span id="s68">I was a spoiled, spoiled little girl.</span> <span id="s69">I was so loved.</span> <span id="s70">I thought I was a princess.</span> <span id="s71">I had the most beautiful bedroom, with silk hangings on the walls, and my bed was like a palace.</span> <span id="s72">I had every toy imaginable.</span> <span id="s73">I was cherished, and loved, and everybody always told me how beautiful and clever I was, and I fully believed it.</span> <span id="s74">I was a princess.</span> <span id="s75">I remember, every Christmas, because my parents didn’t want to deprive me of the excitement of Christmas, although my mother had converted, we had a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s76">We had a very, very tall Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s77">They used to have little candles on it, with little clips on it, and every Christmas we had a fire.</span> <span id="s78">It was the Christmas fire.</span> <span id="s79">They always had a big bucket of water that they would pour on the tree, but this was just one of the things that happened at Christmas.</span> <span id="s80">One day, one of the maids took me to the local church to look at the nativity scene, and I stole Baby Jesus.</span> <span id="s81">I stuck him under my little coat and came home.</span> <span id="s82">My mother finds Baby Jesus under my coat, and she says, oh, my God!</span> <span id="s83">They’re going to say the Jews stole Jesus.</span> <span id="s84">What’s going to happen now?</span> <span id="s85">So I was made to go back and confess to the priest, who was a very tall, very skinny-looking man with a long, long bony finger poking at me and telling me I was going to Hell, because I was a thief and I stole Jesus.</span> <span id="s86">I was crying, and I had to say all kinds of prayers, and I was terrified.</span> <span id="s87">I thought, this is it, I’m going to Hell.</span> <span id="s88">I sort of associated Hell with the Catholic Church, because nobody ever told me about Hell before.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Anyway, so after I stole Baby Jesus, my parents decided that they had a four-and-a-half-year-old out of control on their hands, and they had to do something about this child, who was a total, total out-of-control person.</span> <span id="s90">So they brought Fraulein.</span> <span id="s91">Fraulein was a governess.</span> <span id="s92">She was actually also Austrian, and she was a very, very strict-looking lady.</span> <span id="s93">She was tall and skinny, with a bun on her head, and she really, really was very good at what she did, because in a mere four or five months, she taught me to read and write and speak German, which was a big deal for a little kid.</span> <span id="s94">But she really led me a terrible life, because she—I wasn’t allowed to eat on the street.</span> <span id="s95">I wasn’t allowed out without gloves and a hat.</span> <span id="s96">I wasn’t allowed to play with the kids in the street anymore, because they were not the right sort of children, and good girls from good families didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s97">I wasn’t allowed to run around and make noise, and I had to finish everything on my plate.</span> <span id="s98">I had to wash my hands all the time.</span> <span id="s99">I had to sleep in curlers, so that my hair would be perfect.</span> <span id="s100">I was only allowed to play with rich children.</span> <span id="s101">There was one little boy that I used to be allowed to play with, and that was great.</span> <span id="s102">His name was Istvanka.</span> <span id="s103">He was a sweet little boy, with blonde curls, big blue eyes.</span> <span id="s104">His daddy was a doctor, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom.</span> <span id="s105">I was allowed to play with him, because they were rich and they lived down the street.</span> <span id="s106">I remember being very envious, because he had a bust made of his head, and it was on their mantelpiece, and I thought this was the most glamorous thing I’ve ever seen.</span> <span id="s107">I loved Istvanka.</span> <span id="s108">We used to go and play together, and we had a game where we used to run up and down in front of the opera house.</span> <span id="s109">There was a circular driveway, and we used to run up and down this driveway.</span> <span id="s110">The game was that if I caught him, I kissed him, and I kissed him a lot, and I ran a lot, and he hated it.</span> <span id="s111">Lovely little kid.</span> <span id="s112">Unfortunately, he didn’t come back either.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">You know, I was my daddy’s little girl.</span> <span id="s114">Anybody who has had a daddy and the relationship like mine would understand that incredible safety—that incredible peace, and love, and safety that you feel in your daddy’s arms is something that you never recapture.</span> <span id="s115">I’ve looked for it all my life and it never came back to me, because that is gone forever.</span> <span id="s116">I absolutely adored my daddy.</span> <span id="s117">He was the center of my universe.</span> <span id="s118">He was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s119">When I went for walks with Fraulein, he always gave me money, and he told me to give it to the poor, and I said, oh, what if the poor don’t want it?</span> <span id="s120">He said, well, it’s not up to you to judge or to question.</span> <span id="s121">If somebody’s begging, you give them the money, because you are fortunate that you have what you have.</span> <span id="s122">You’re no better than those people, and you have to help everybody.</span> <span id="s123">Then he’d check to make sure that I didn’t steal any of the coins and put them in my pocket when we came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">TRACK 03 – HUNGARIAN NAZIS Life was good in those days.</span> <span id="s125">We had everything.</span> <span id="s126">We had wonderful food, and lots of music, and my parents would go out at night.</span> <span id="s127">They were very glamorous.</span> <span id="s128">I remember them in eveningwear, and they would come and kiss me goodnight, and they smelled so good.</span> <span id="s129">I still remember my daddy, who was tall and very dark, and he had a big laugh, and he had a big, silk scarf around his neck, which I still have.</span> <span id="s130">That’s the only thing I have of him.</span> <span id="s131">He would throw his head back and laugh.</span> <span id="s132">He was a happy, happy man.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Around this time, they decided that perhaps they should let me know a little bit about my Jewish heritage, so they sent me to kindergarten, a Jewish kindergarten, two days a week.</span> <span id="s134">Istvanka went there too.</span> <span id="s135">We sang little songs, and they told us some stories.</span> <span id="s136">It didn’t make much of an impression on me, because religion was not part of our life, very much.</span> <span id="s137">It was fun.</span> <span id="s138">I remember there were fifty-two children in this kindergarten, and only two were alive after that war.</span> <span id="s139">Eventually, I met the other person, years and years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">And then things started changing.</span> <span id="s141">My golden childhood started becoming different.</span> <span id="s142">People would stop talking when I came into a room.</span> <span id="s143">My mother had red eyes from crying.</span> <span id="s144">There were whispers going on.</span> <span id="s145">People always talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s146">They think it suddenly happened.</span> <span id="s147">It didn’t.</span> <span id="s148">It was in small increments.</span> <span id="s149">Small rights were taken away from you.</span> <span id="s150">First, the Jews couldn’t go to university, and then they couldn’t go to high school.</span> <span id="s151">Then the kids could only go to Jewish school.</span> <span id="s152">Jewish doctors weren’t allowed to treat non-Jews.</span> <span id="s153">Jews were not allowed to employ any female under the age of forty-five.</span> <span id="s154">So a lot of the people that my mother and father had employed had gone.</span> <span id="s155">They were not there.</span> <span id="s156">There was an unease.</span> <span id="s157">You know, children feel these things, and there was a sort of doom and gloom around.</span> <span id="s158">My parents weren’t laughing anymore.</span> <span id="s159">Then, Fraulein, who used to read horrible stories to me—the Grimm Brothers, who should be banned, because I think they hated children—those horrible, horrible, scary stories—Fraulein was scaring me with these stories.</span> <span id="s160">One day she was gone, and I was so happy.</span> <span id="s161">I didn’t wash my hands for three days.</span> <span id="s162">I was delighted Fraulein was gone.</span> <span id="s163">It was the best day of my life, and I was able to run around in the streets again.</span> <span id="s164">I was very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Still, things weren’t right.</span> <span id="s166">Then my mother came to see me and she says, listen, I have something for you.</span> <span id="s167">I have a present for you.</span> <span id="s168">She brought out this beautiful yellow star, made of very shiny gold material.</span> <span id="s169">She put it on my little blue coat, and she sewed it on, and she says, look at this beautiful star.</span> <span id="s170">You’re going to be wearing this star now.</span> <span id="s171">We went to have some pastries.</span> <span id="s172">She took me by the hand, and we were walking down the street.</span> <span id="s173">I was very proud of my star.</span> <span id="s174">Little girls love shiny things.</span> <span id="s175">A man came opposite, and I sort of looked at him, sort of expecting him to say something nice about my star—he’s going to like my star—and he spat in my face.</span> <span id="s176">The spit was running down my face, onto my star, and I was horrified.</span> <span id="s177">How can a man not like stars?</span> <span id="s178">Never occurred to me that it was me he hated.</span> <span id="s179">I looked at my mother, who was always a very feisty woman, and I expected her to do something, and she said nothing.</span> <span id="s180">She sort of shushed me and took me by the hand and started pulling me home.</span> <span id="s181">I said, but, but, but—she said, just come home, we’ll talk it about it at home.</span> <span id="s182">Don’t say anything, just come.</span> <span id="s183">We went back, and I was horrified, because this was my mother, who did not protect me.</span> <span id="s184">I thought if that had been my dad, this wouldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s185">I mean, a man spat on my star.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Then things started getting worse.</span> <span id="s187">The Hungarians, who, by the way, were all the persecutors in our town—I’ve never met a German Nazi, I’ve only met Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s188">They were very, very efficient, very gleeful collaborators.</span> <span id="s189">They took a couple of blocks in a poor part of town.</span> <span id="s190">They put a big, big brick fence around it, and all the Jews had to go there.</span> <span id="s191">I remember looking out the window and seeing people being put on trucks and on carts.</span> <span id="s192">They were sort of bullying them onto these.</span> <span id="s193">They had little suitcases, and they were pushed and they were screamed at, and all these poor people had to go away.</span> <span id="s194">It was so sudden that they had no time to take care of their pets, and there were dogs and cats running around, without food.</span> <span id="s195">That really upset me more than anything, as a kid.</span> <span id="s196">I felt bad for the dogs, and I would go downstairs and feed the dogs.</span> <span id="s197">Then the dogcatcher came and they were gone, too.</span> <span id="s198">Then my father had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s199">I remember my parents standing next to each other, holding each other.</span> <span id="s200">He had a little suitcase and they were sobbing, holding each other.</span> <span id="s201">I sort of climbed between them, and we all cried, and I said, where is Daddy going?</span> <span id="s202">My mom said, well, he has to go away for a while, but he’ll be back.</span> <span id="s203">I wasn’t worried, because my dad always came back.</span> <span id="s204">Daddy wouldn’t leave me.</span> <span id="s205">Obviously, everybody went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">I was supposed to go, because if you even had one grandparent who was Jewish, you had to go, let alone me, being half Jewish.</span> <span id="s207">But my mother kept me home.</span> <span id="s208">She hid me under a bed.</span> <span id="s209">Every time anybody came to the house, I was supposed to scoot under the bed.</span> <span id="s210">I wasn’t supposed to go near the window.</span> <span id="s211">I wasn’t supposed to be seen or heard.</span> <span id="s212">I didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s213">So my mother was very worried, but she would not let me go to the ghetto and tried to hide the fact that I was there, which was illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">During this time, a woman came to see her.</span> <span id="s215">She used to bring our milk.</span> <span id="s216">She used to come with a horse and cart, with a big vat of milk, and people would go downstairs with dishes and buy the milk there.</span> <span id="s217">This woman, who was delivering our milk, had been an orphan, and my mother made her a wedding dress when she got married.</span> <span id="s218">This simple peasant, simple, Hungarian peasant woman, decent woman, came to see my mother and said, I heard they’re taking the Jews and I know you have a child.</span> <span id="s219">Let me take your child.</span> <span id="s220">I will take her to my farm and she’ll be safe there.</span> <span id="s221">Have you still got your child here?</span> <span id="s222">My mother said yes, and she quickly put me on that cart, and I remember being so excited going to the country, and I’ll be able to play outside.</span> <span id="s223">I hopped on this cart, and on this bench, and she even let me hold the reins for a while.</span> <span id="s224">I was very happy we were going to the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">I remember, it was on the hillside, when we got there, and the house was straight across from the road.</span> <span id="s226">She didn’t take me to her house.</span> <span id="s227">She took me to the barn, which was to the left.</span> <span id="s228">She had a small barn with two stalls, one for the cow and one for the horse.</span> <span id="s229">She said to me, no, you’re not going to the house.</span> <span id="s230">And I said, but I don’t want to go to the barn.</span> <span id="s231">She says, no, no, you don’t understand, you have to go to the barn.</span> <span id="s232">You have to hide here, because otherwise they’re going to kill you.</span> <span id="s233">You know, this whole concept of ‘kill me’—I mean, killing is a very abstract thing.</span> <span id="s234">I mean, I’m seventy-six and I still have a hard time understanding death now, which I’m close to.</span> <span id="s235">But when you’re a child, you can’t understand that.</span> <span id="s236">I was very upset, so she took me up on these rickety stairs to this little attic area that was full of hay.</span> <span id="s237">She told me that if anybody came, I had to scooch under the eaves and not say a word, not breathe.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t exist, because if people find me, they will kill me.</span> <span id="s239">It was very hard for me to understand, and I was very upset.</span> <span id="s240">I was crying for my mommy and for my daddy, and it was dark.</span> <span id="s241">I was not yet five years old, and I was scared.</span> <span id="s242">There were big, black spiders there.</span> <span id="s243">You know, after a while, you get used to it and you stop crying.</span> <span id="s244">I cried, cried, cried, and then she came and brought me food.</span> <span id="s245">Sometimes she would smuggle me out to her kitchen and give me a bath and give me warm soup, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">I got used to being in the attic.</span> <span id="s247">I stopped crying, and I even made friends with one of the spiders.</span> <span id="s248">I tied a piece of cotton thread onto his leg and he was my friend.</span> <span id="s249">But then his leg came off.</span> <span id="s250">Anyway, you get used to things.</span> <span id="s251">I was there for three months—three whole months, on my own, as a little kid.</span> <span id="s252">I remember she told me, no matter what, no noise if anybody comes.</span> <span id="s253">I remember one morning, very early, I looked through the cracks in the barn in the attic, and I see these three soldiers.</span> <span id="s254">They were wearing green uniforms and they had black rooster feathers in their hats.</span> <span id="s255">They had guns with bayonets, and they were slapping her around.</span> <span id="s256">They were slapping Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s257">Her name was Erzsebet - but Elizabeth—they were slapping her around.</span> <span id="s258">Where is the Jew bastard?</span> <span id="s259">Where is the Jew bastard?</span> <span id="s260">She says, there is no Jew here.</span> <span id="s261">Go look in my house, there’s no Jew.</span> <span id="s262">So they went to look in the house, and, of course, I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s263">They were on the way out when one of them had the bright idea to come and look in the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">TRACK 04 – THE RUSSIAN ARMY So they came up these stairs, and I did what I was told, and I scooched under the eaves and pulled the hay over me, and I made myself very, very small and very quiet.</span> <span id="s265">I wasn’t even breathing.</span> <span id="s266">They started poking the bayonets in the hay, to make sure there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s267">All three of them were poking the hay with the bayonets, and one of the bayonets landed about an inch from my face and got stuck in the wood.</span> <span id="s268">As he pulled it out, I remember the twang it made, and I think I grew up that day.</span> <span id="s269">I think I realized what it meant to die.</span> <span id="s270">Basically, it means that somebody is going to stick a bayonet in you, so that’s what dying means, and that’s what these people were trying to do to me.</span> <span id="s271">So then I started being afraid of death, because I thought, uh-oh, that must hurt.</span> <span id="s272">Because it hurt the wood, it must have hurt the person much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Then, my mother was arrested, because somebody realized that I wasn’t in the ghetto, and they tortured her.</span> <span id="s274">She never told me what they did to her, because she said it was far too humiliating and she wouldn’t let me know about it.</span> <span id="s275">She managed to smuggle my father out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s276">She wanted him to escape to Rumania, because they weren’t rounding up the people yet in Rumania, and she thought that she could save him.</span> <span id="s277">She bribed some people with some gold Napoleon coins and told him that he had to leave.</span> <span id="s278">He said, listen, before I go, I’ve got to go and see the kid, because I don’t want her to feel that I’m abandoning her.</span> <span id="s279">It might be years before I see her.</span> <span id="s280">I want her to know that I’m coming back, that I’m her daddy and that I love her, and that I’m not leaving her, so I have to go and say goodbye to her.</span> <span id="s281">He was on the road to this village, walking at night, when they caught him.</span> <span id="s282">They deported him the next day to Auschwitz, and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s283">You know, to this day, I have tremendous guilt about this, because I feel that perhaps if he hadn’t loved me so much, he wouldn’t have come.</span> <span id="s284">I mean, obviously, you know, it’s stupid, but guilt is like love—it comes unbidden.</span> <span id="s285">You don’t have a choice about these feelings that come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">I remember at that point I was very happy, because the war broke out.</span> <span id="s287">You wouldn’t believe how happy we were, when the war came, because the Russians are coming and the Germans are leaving, and the Hungarians are giving up, and nobody’s going to kill us anymore, and it’s going to be wonderful.</span> <span id="s288">My mother came and got me and took me home.</span> <span id="s289">This was wonderful.</span> <span id="s290">The bombs were falling, and it was very exciting, because when you’re a kid you don’t expect the bomb to be for you.</span> <span id="s291">It’s a bit more abstract.</span> <span id="s292">There was only one problem: we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s293">Literally nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s294">There were some potatoes in the basement—you have no idea how many ways you can cook a potato.</span> <span id="s295">I still like potatoes, though.</span> <span id="s296">The bombs were falling, and there was some sort of a casino nearby, and it took a direct hit, and there were playing cards raining down all over the street.</span> <span id="s297">I still remember that.</span> <span id="s298">I was scared, but I wasn’t scared.</span> <span id="s299">At the same time, I was quite excited, because things were happening, and I was with my mother.</span> <span id="s300">We were cold and we had no food, and I remember looking out the window.</span> <span id="s301">After a while, we stopped even going down to the shelter, because the bombs were just falling all over the place.</span> <span id="s302">I was looking out the window, and there was a horse and a cart, with somebody’s pathetic belongings on it, and the horse dropped dead in front of our house.</span> <span id="s303">It was quite cold, and I remember, within minutes, doors opened and people ran out with dishes and knives, and they started skinning this horse.</span> <span id="s304">As they pulled off the skin, I remember it was steaming.</span> <span id="s305">Within minutes, that horse was pretty much stripped.</span> <span id="s306">Even the bones were taken for soup.</span> <span id="s307">There was nothing left of that horse.</span> <span id="s308">Everybody was eating that horse.</span> <span id="s309">The whole street was eating horsemeat.</span> <span id="s310">Horse and potatoes.</span> <span id="s311">You know, when you’re hungry, you eat.</span> <span id="s312">You eat anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">The war was going on.</span> <span id="s314">There was a frozen river opposite our house, and the Russians were coming across the frozen river, linking arms and singing.</span> <span id="s315">They were singing and singing, and coming up the bank, and they were being machine-gunned, and another load came singing, they came up the bank, they were shot again.</span> <span id="s316">They must have been drunk, because nobody is that brave.</span> <span id="s317">They were coming and coming, until the corpses built up to a huge sort of berm, and the last load that came over the top were not shot, because people had run out of bullets, and we were under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s318">Now that, in itself, was not fun, but they didn’t persecute children.</span> <span id="s319">They didn’t hurt me.</span> <span id="s320">They were raping the women, and my mother made a false wall in our bathroom, and all the women from the area lived in that little hidey-hole.</span> <span id="s321">Everybody was scared, and the women were hiding from the rapists.</span> <span id="s322">There was a lot of shooting, and screaming, and yelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">At that point, my mother decided to do something about it.</span> <span id="s324">So she put some white flour in her hair, or chalk, whatever it was, put a scarf on her head, put a big pillow on her back, pretending to be a hunchback, wore some rags, and painted some black on her face.</span> <span id="s325">She blacked out her teeth, and she pretended to be an old hag.</span> <span id="s326">She found someone to translate for her and went to see the commander of the town.</span> <span id="s327">She said something had to be done, so she was going to fix it.</span> <span id="s328">She went to see the commander.</span> <span id="s329">To her surprise, it was a woman, a young woman.</span> <span id="s330">By this time, the Russians had lost so many people that young people and young men and women were taking very important roles.</span> <span id="s331">My mother said to this woman, through the interpreter, come to my house.</span> <span id="s332">I’m a very good dressmaker and I can make you look beautiful.</span> <span id="s333">I mean, you shouldn’t be looking like that.</span> <span id="s334">Your hair is all wrong.</span> <span id="s335">Come and I’ll make you pretty.</span> <span id="s336">She came and my mother fixed her hair, and she yanked one of the drapes off the window and draped it around this woman and made her a pretty dress.</span> <span id="s337">This woman was delighted.</span> <span id="s338">Then other Russian ladies came, and we had food.</span> <span id="s339">We had so much food.</span> <span id="s340">We had ham, and butter, and cheese.</span> <span id="s341">And all the women behind the false wall were busy unpicking cloth, because there was no cloth to be had, so they were unpicking old dresses to make enough cloth for my mother to make dresses for all these Russian women.</span> <span id="s342">We even got a guard outside our house, and nobody was being raped, and it was really quite fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Then the Russian commander decided to give us our own special guard, and Ivan came.</span> <span id="s344">Ivan was about seventeen.</span> <span id="s345">He was a captain.</span> <span id="s346">By this time, he had been promoted again, because there were so many losses.</span> <span id="s347">He was a very pretty boy, and he had a sidekick, an old man who was playing the accordion.</span> <span id="s348">Ivan and his sidekick were constantly drunk.</span> <span id="s349">I mean, they drank, and drank, and drank.</span> <span id="s350">They drank cologne, they drank anything they could get their hands on.</span> <span id="s351">But I wasn’t afraid of him, because he was very nice to me, and he was always singing, and I was dancing, and I loved Ivan.</span> <span id="s352">You know, one day Ivan brought us a goose liver, which was a big delicacy.</span> <span id="s353">They took this goose liver and it had a bit of blood on it, so he decided to wash it in the toilet, because he’d never had a toilet where he came from.</span> <span id="s354">He stuck it in the toilet and pulled the chain, and the goose liver went away, and he shot the toilet.</span> <span id="s355">That was the kind of person he was.</span> <span id="s356">They would take pot shots at the moldings in the ceiling, and they would shoot at things.</span> <span id="s357">When we ran out of fuel, they would break up the antique furniture and burn it.</span> <span id="s358">All this time, they were singing and playing with me.</span> <span id="s359">We had such fun, Ivan and I. Ivan told me that when I was seventeen, he would come back for me and marry me.</span> <span id="s360">Well, God knows what happened to the poor man.</span> <span id="s361">I remember, I was sick and he brought me an orange.</span> <span id="s362">You have no idea what an orange means to a child who had been hungry.</span> <span id="s363">He brought me this orange and it was wrapped in this crinkly white paper.</span> <span id="s364">I remember opening the paper and seeing this orange.</span> <span id="s365">It was like the sun rising out of the night.</span> <span id="s366">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s367">The smell of it was amazing.</span> <span id="s368">My mother gave me pieces of it to eat, and then she candied the peels.</span> <span id="s369">I was only allowed to eat orange when I was sick, and I wanted to be sick all the time, so I could have more orange peels.</span> <span id="s370">That orange meant more to me than anything.</span> <span id="s371">I still marvel every time I see an orange.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">TRACK 05 – THE END OF THE WAR Then I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s373">Ivan was gone.</span> <span id="s374">I don’t use historical dates, because I want to keep my memory, that of a child, completely clear of any other influence, because the more you learn about history and dates, you incorporate it, and then your own memory gets tainted by it.</span> <span id="s375">I just remember that they were gone.</span> <span id="s376">Ivan was gone.</span> <span id="s377">My mother came to see me, and she says, I think Daddy’s coming home tonight.</span> <span id="s378">She dressed me, and she washed me and did my hair.</span> <span id="s379">She got all dressed up, and we went to the local station, because there were people coming back from the camps, apparently.</span> <span id="s380">We had a picture of my father, which we held up when the train came in, and we waited for all the people who came off the train, and my daddy wasn’t there, so my mother and I went home crying.</span> <span id="s381">We did this several nights, and the people who came off the trains looked terrible.</span> <span id="s382">They scared me.</span> <span id="s383">They were shuffling, and they were bent over, and they had no hair.</span> <span id="s384">You couldn’t tell if they were men or women.</span> <span id="s385">They were in rags.</span> <span id="s386">They were ghosts.</span> <span id="s387">They were shuffling, scary ghosts.</span> <span id="s388">My mother took them home to our house, and she would bathe them and give them her clothes, if they were women, and men’s clothes, if they were men.</span> <span id="s389">They would tell stories and I would hide behind the sofa, because I wasn’t supposed to hear this.</span> <span id="s390">They were telling us horrible, horrible stories about what happened to them and what happened to their families.</span> <span id="s391">It was heartbreaking and very scary, because it was horrible.</span> <span id="s392">There was one young girl who my mother brought home.</span> <span id="s393">She had a big tattoo on her chest, and it said “field whore” on it in German.</span> <span id="s394">So basically, they would take some of these beautiful young girls and turn them out into the battlefields for the soldiers to use, and then they would kill them when they were used up.</span> <span id="s395">This girl escaped and joined the partisans somewhere.</span> <span id="s396">She had this huge tattoo, and my mother made her a dress that would cover that.</span> <span id="s397">I remember her very distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">One of the times when we went to the train, one of the last times, a man came off the train, came up to my mother, and said to her, don’t wait for him, he’s not coming back.</span> <span id="s399">She says, well, who are you?</span> <span id="s400">He says, don’t you remember me?</span> <span id="s401">You and your husband used to come and play cards at my casino every Saturday night.</span> <span id="s402">He’s not coming back.</span> <span id="s403">He’s dead.</span> <span id="s404">I saw him.</span> <span id="s405">So she says, what, he was ill?</span> <span id="s406">What happened?</span> <span id="s407">He said, never mind, he’s not coming back.</span> <span id="s408">He died.</span> <span id="s409">She brought this poor man home to us.</span> <span id="s410">He had been the owner of this huge hotel-casino.</span> <span id="s411">He was also a musician.</span> <span id="s412">He was a violinist, and his hands were crippled, because when the guards found out he was a violinist, they broke all his fingers and they never set it, so he had hands like claws.</span> <span id="s413">I was scared of him at that point.</span> <span id="s414">He looked terrible.</span> <span id="s415">He had a wife and a little daughter.</span> <span id="s416">When they got to Auschwitz on the train, the wife and the daughter were sent to one side and he was sent to the other.</span> <span id="s417">He said to a guard, where are they going?</span> <span id="s418">What’s happening to them?</span> <span id="s419">The guard pointed to a chimney and said, up there.</span> <span id="s420">He didn’t understand at that point.</span> <span id="s421">Her name was Dita, short for Judith.</span> <span id="s422">She was eleven years old, and a lovely little girl.</span> <span id="s423">I didn’t know her personally.</span> <span id="s424">She used to play the piano, and she was a dancer.</span> <span id="s425">She wanted to be an actress when she grew up.</span> <span id="s426">She was a happy little girl, and she died in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s427">I think of her often, because I have a photograph of her.</span> <span id="s428">When I speak in schools, I show it to the kids, because they relate better to a child.</span> <span id="s429">I explain to them that this little girl, once I’m dead, nobody will remember her, because there won’t be anyone to remember her.</span> <span id="s430">One of the classes decided to make that a project, an eighth-grade project, and they printed five hundred copies of her photograph, with her story on the back, and they sent it to five hundred middle schools.</span> <span id="s431">The project is “Remember Dita.”</span> <span id="s432">I still get letters from schools all over.</span> <span id="s433">I got a letter from an American school in Guam saying we’re not going to let Dita die again by forgetting her.</span> <span id="s434">I was very touched by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Then this poor man went to see his family’s housekeeper, where they left everything.</span> <span id="s436">He knocked on her door, and she opened the door wearing his wife’s dress.</span> <span id="s437">She looked at him and says, ah, so they didn’t kill all of you—anyway, the Russians took everything, and she slammed the door in his face.</span> <span id="s438">He came back to my mother and he kind of stayed.</span> <span id="s439">Out of two broken families, we cobbled together one.</span> <span id="s440">He became my stepfather.</span> <span id="s441">I always felt guilty because I took Dita’s dad, because life somewhat—it wasn’t fair that I had all that and she didn’t, because she was dead and here I am alive.</span> <span id="s442">Her father is my father.</span> <span id="s443">I think about her a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">TRACK 06 – REMEMBER DITTA Eventually, he brought his mother from Romania.</span> <span id="s445">She was an old Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s446">She came and lived with us.</span> <span id="s447">My mother’s Catholic mother came too.</span> <span id="s448">These two women, who hated each other, fought for my soul.</span> <span id="s449">My grandmother, the Catholic one, would take me to church every Sunday, and I had to pray for my mother, because she kept marrying Jews, and she was going to Hell.</span> <span id="s450">My Jewish grandmother dragged me off to the synagogue every Saturday.</span> <span id="s451">I preferred the church, because it smelled better.</span> <span id="s452">At the synagogue, I had to sit upstairs with the women, whereas in the church, I was allowed to be with everybody else.</span> <span id="s453">To tell you the truth, I had so much religion thrown at me that I don’t do any of it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Then, one day, my stepfather, who was a very good stepfather—he was not a nice man, but to me he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s455">You know, we always judge people by how they are to yourself.</span> <span id="s456">He wasn’t a particularly nice man.</span> <span id="s457">He was a victim, but that doesn’t sanctify you.</span> <span id="s458">He was a very good stepfather to me.</span> <span id="s459">He sat me down, when I was about twelve, and told me how my father died.</span> <span id="s460">We never told my mother, because there was no need for her to know this.</span> <span id="s461">My father and another friend from our town stole a piece of bread, and they caught them.</span> <span id="s462">They were made an example of.</span> <span id="s463">This was like early spring.</span> <span id="s464">It was cold, and they stripped them naked and beat them half to death, and put each of them in a dog cage, in the big area where—the appelplatz, where people would have to line up every morning to be counted—as an example.</span> <span id="s465">It took him two days and a night to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">One of the reasons I speak is because I don’t want anybody else’s father or, as a matter of fact, I don’t want anybody else to die like that, because the cruelty to these people was unimaginable.</span> <span id="s467">It is one thing if you just kill somebody, but to reduce human beings to nothing, to take away their dignity to this extent, to have a man shivering, naked, half dead in a dog cage, dying slowly, is wrong.</span> <span id="s468">You know, I have no grave.</span> <span id="s469">I have nowhere to go and connect with my father at all.</span> <span id="s470">There is nothing.</span> <span id="s471">You know, he’s gone.</span> <span id="s472">Dita is gone, my father is gone, my whole family is gone.</span> <span id="s473">There is nothing of them.</span> <span id="s474">Nothing left.</span> <span id="s475">No grave, no closure.</span> <span id="s476">I sometimes look up at the sky and look at the stars, and I remember how he used to hold me on his lap and tell me all about the constellations.</span> <span id="s477">I still know all of them in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s478">When I look up at the stars, I have this feeling of closeness.</span> <span id="s479">I still feel there is some kind of a presence, but that’s all I have.</span> <span id="s480">You know, I feel safe in a barn.</span> <span id="s481">I have a barn at home, and there is hay in it.</span> <span id="s482">When I feel insecure, I go in there and I breathe in the hay, and it gives me a feeling of security, because the hay saved my life.</span> <span id="s483">The problem is that when my stepfather was dying, he had Alzheimer’s, and he didn’t realize that I was not his daughter.</span> <span id="s484">He kept calling me Dita.</span> <span id="s485">I was holding his hand while he was dying, and he was talking to me as if I was Dita.</span> <span id="s486">I never corrected him.</span> <span id="s487">I was so happy to be able to give him the feeling that his daughter was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">You know, I always think about The Merchant of Venice, for some reason, which is considered very much an anti-Semitic play, which it isn’t, really.</span> <span id="s489">It’s very much a play of those times.</span> <span id="s490">You know that wonderful speech about ‘am I not a man?’</span> <span id="s491">You know, I have same feelings as you.</span> <span id="s492">Don’t I bleed when you hurt me, don’t I feel the same cold, the same heat as you?</span> <span id="s493">And what people don’t realize is that when you persecute a whole group of people, they are just like you.</span> <span id="s494">They hurt the same way as you.</span> <span id="s495">They suffer the same way.</span> <span id="s496">This is what I keep telling children—that bullying is the same as what happened there, and it didn’t happen overnight.</span> <span id="s497">It was a slow progression.</span> <span id="s498">By hating somebody sitting next to you, because they smell different, or they eat different food, or they are of a different color, or pushing them, that’s the beginning.</span> <span id="s499">The Holocaust was bullying on steroids.</span> <span id="s500">That’s what it was.</span> <span id="s501">I talk to the kids and I explain to them that it’s terribly corrosive.</span> <span id="s502">Words hurt.</span> <span id="s503">Actions hurt.</span> <span id="s504">Terrible things can happen if you don’t make sure that you don’t do this to another human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">It took me fifty years to get over my hatred.</span> <span id="s506">Because when I was a child, I was full of hatred.</span> <span id="s507">I was so full of hatred I wanted to kill the people who killed my father.</span> <span id="s508">I had these fantasies about how I would flay them alive and eviscerate them, and kill them slowly.</span> <span id="s509">It was very sick, and it took me fifty years to get over it.</span> <span id="s510">I realize that as long as my soul is full of hatred, there is no room for anything else.</span> <span id="s511">I slowly emptied my soul of hatred.</span> <span id="s512">No, I don’t forgive, because it is not for me to forgive.</span> <span id="s513">I can only forgive my own debts, not somebody else’s.</span> <span id="s514">I still have a lot of sorrow, but there is no more hatred.</span> <span id="s515">I have embraced love as a religion, if you like.</span> <span id="s516">I’m a very happy person now, because I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s517">I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s518">People say to me, well, what do you do for revenge?</span> <span id="s519">And I said, well, I live.</span> <span id="s520">Every time I gave birth to a Jewish child, it was giving the finger to Hitler.</span> <span id="s521">I have four sons, and I have four granddaughters, and I have a very multicultural family.</span> <span id="s522">My eldest son married a girl whose father was in the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s523">When they first told me that, I sort of swallowed, and I said, well, yeah, the sins of the fathers we don’t visit on the children.</span> <span id="s524">When they had a baby, I went over—they live in Canada—and I was holding this beautiful baby.</span> <span id="s525">This is the baby, the child of a perpetrator and a victim, and the tears were running down my face, and I was thinking, oh, my God, this is perfect.</span> <span id="s526">This is how it should be.</span> <span id="s527">We have to go forward.</span> <span id="s528">We cannot go back.</span> <span id="s529">We cannot change things, but we can make things better for the future.</span> <span id="s530">This beautiful child closed the circle for me.</span> <span id="s531">It was such a healing experience.</span> <span id="s532">I’ll never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">I speak for the dead, because they cannot speak for themselves.</span> <span id="s534">Unfortunately, ten percent of people are pretty evil, and ten percent are wonderful.</span> <span id="s535">There are wonderful people in the world.</span> <span id="s536">Eighty percent are sheep.</span> <span id="s537">I’m afraid of the sheep, because it’s the sheep who are the dangerous ones.</span> <span id="s538">The sheep will follow either one or the other.</span> <span id="s539">It’s much easier to follow the evil, because all you have to do is stand behind the evil person and giggle and not do anything.</span> <span id="s540">If you follow the good people, you have to actually do something.</span> <span id="s541">You have to perhaps stand up for someone.</span> <span id="s542">You have to speak out.</span> <span id="s543">You have to take some kind of action.</span> <span id="s544">You have to be counted.</span> <span id="s545">The danger is the sheep.</span> <span id="s546">I always tell the children.</span> <span id="s547">If you cannot find yourself to be the ten percent either way, make sure to follow the right shepherd, because boy, is that a danger.</span> <span id="s548">And stand up and be counted, because if you don’t this could happen again.</span> <span id="s549">There is genocide going on the whole time.</span> <span id="s550">People looked away.</span> <span id="s551">It’s not so much people who perpetrated everything, but the people who looked away—the look-away people, and that is a terrible thing to do.</span> <span id="s552">I always ask, just remember, remember Dita.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">STORY PRESERVATION INTIATIVE KATHY PRESTON TRANSCRIPTION OF AUDIO PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT
