father changed his profession and he got involved with tobacco leafs, and was very happy and successful.</span> <span id="s79">We decide to st -- decided to stay in Kavála.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So, when you were born, were you -- was your family already living in Kavála?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span> <span id="s82">I was born in Kavála, and I went back to Salonika,

there?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: No, that was Germany before Hitler.</span> <span id="s90">I’m talking the 40 -- yeah, talking about 1920’s.</span> <span id="s91">When Hitler came, we were already in Kavála, that was 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So, can you tell me a little about the personalities of your parents?</span> <span id="s93">I want to try to get a -- a sense of them, you know, just describe to me, you know, maybe as a youngster, as a childhood, from that perspective, what your parents personalities were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, my father was community minded.</span> <span id="s95">He was the president and the representative of [speaks Greek here] in Kavála.</span> <span id="s96">He used to take care of the poor Jews in the community.</span> <span id="s97">They used to call him [speaks Greek here] de Kavála.</span> <span id="s98">The Jewish counsel of Kavála.</span> <span id="s99">My mother was very, very religious, and I was raised in a religious environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So tell me a little bit more about that, maybe -- maybe what were some of your favorite holidays as a child, and -- and were you, you know, were you particularly interested in religion yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s102">We used to go with my father every Saturday to the temple, and we used to observe all of the holidays.</span> <span id="s103">And up today, myself and my wife continue to follow our religion and celebrate our holidays with our whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Do you have -- do you have memories as a child of favorite holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Not exactly.</span> <span id="s106">Mostly Purim, was a very joyous holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And what were the languages that you were learning as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I was born as a Sephardi Jew, and automatically our language was Ladino.</span> <span id="s109">Then, in high school, I learned French.</span> <span id="s110">After high school I took English and I mastered, more or less, the language of the time.</span> <span id="s111">Spanish came automatic.</span> <span id="s112">Greek was amassed.</span> <span id="s113">So, actually, between one year old and 20 years old, I mastered five different languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And were you ar -- also studying or familiar with Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s116">That was automatic on the f -- on the s -- on the Jewish, you know, the community school that I attended the first six years, from age six to 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Now what about your Bar Mitzvah, what kind of memories do you have of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Very joyful, but not like here.</span> <span id="s119">Not spending like crazy, just have the family, have the friends, and celebrate in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And at that time you were -- you still had mostly non-Jewish friends around that time of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">As I told you, we lived in the more or less Greek neighborhood, Orthodox neighborhood and all my friends, up to today, most of them were Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Do you remember the address, by any chance, of either one of your homes where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s125">It’s a very funny thing, as I told you, our city was 10 kilometers from Philippi, and the street name wher-where we had our home was Bucephalus Street, the name of Alexander the Great’s horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Is that where you had both of your childhood homes, on the same street?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: No, no, no, this was after we moved in our own home.</span> <span id="s128">Originally I was born in a -- we were in a -- in an apartment, and as I told you, then we went to k -- Salonika, and after the few years we moved to Kavála, and we had our home in Bucephalus, or Bucephalus Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Do you remember the actual address of the home, the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I think it was number 10, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And what about, did you go to one particular synagogue during your childhood in Kavála?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: There’s only -- there was only one synagogue in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Beth El, as far as I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Okay, now are there any other sort of childhood memories, anything in particular, any fond memories, anything that really stands out for you when you think of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: In 1935 or 1933, I’m not sure about it, there was a revolution in Greece, where part of them and their -- the Prime Minister Venizelos was democratic and part of them was Royalist.</span> <span id="s137">Kavála choose part of the democratic part of it, and the Royalists won the civil war, they bombed the city and they destroyed our synagogue.</span> <span id="s138">What I remember is that after 1935 or ’36, when there was a dictatorship in Greece and this Metaxas, my uncle kiv -- came from Salonika and rebuilt the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What was your uncle’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: My uncle’s name was Maurice Ashkenazi.</span> <span id="s141">He -- he was my mother’s first cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So how did the synagogue get destroyed, it was intentional to destroy --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, no it -- Kavála was bombed, and part of the bombs destroyed the synagogue.</span> <span id="s144">Was not intentional.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So were your parents involved or active in any political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Not Greek political organizations.</span> <span id="s147">They were involved very much in Zionist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Any in particular, the names of them, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Not exactly.</span> <span id="s150">I just remember [speaks Greek here] because my father represented them in Kavála and used to raise money, funds for them.</span> <span id="s151">I don’t remember another organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And then were you active already as a, I don’t know, teenager, or even before?</span> <span id="s153">When did you -- did you get active with a Zionist organization as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, not til after the war.</span> <span id="s155">At the age of 18 I went to Athens at the university and then the war came, th-the German occupation came and everything was --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And also I just wanted to find out, the community, the Jewish community in Kavála, was it entirely Sephardic or a combination?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Entirely Sephardic.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And your -- you kept kosher at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s161">So now, before you actually left for Athens, just to think about the year 1933 when Hitler and the Nazis came to power, did you know anything about this?</span> <span id="s162">You were still in Kavála, and how old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Are you talking about 1933?</span> <span id="s164">I was 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you hear anything, or were your parents talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, we knew everything in Greece.</span> <span id="s167">As a matter of fact, most of the Greeks were against it -- against Germany, and against the dic-dictatorship, especially my city, that even in 1933, as far as I can remember, had a Communist mayor.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So what do you remember?</span> <span id="s169">What were some of your earliest impressions, what you heard at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Everything that was happening to the Jews in Germany, and we were very much worried about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And did you hear a few years later, in 1938, did you hear anything about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes, we knew about everything, and more or less we were ready, because we knew that Greek’s turn was coming, that one way or the other, we’ll be invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: How did you get the information?</span> <span id="s174">Was it through radio, or how were you learning things?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Through radio, through free newspapers, through contacts with the outside.</span> <span id="s176">We were free to vo -- to -- to travel, where there were no restrictions at all.</span> <span id="s177">We were free people, and we’re very happy people.</span> <span id="s178">We had also a ki -- a king who is so pro-Jewish.</span> <span id="s179">And the -- the government nek -- never took any measures against the Jews or made any discrimination.</span> <span id="s180">As a matter of fact, we had at the Greek congress, a Jewish representative, and also a Jewish senator.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: But you did feel some concern that maybe some of these anti-Jewish measures might eventually come to Greece.</span> <span id="s182">Did your family ever talk about wanting to leave Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No, we never thought of leaving Greece, except 1938, when we decided to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s184">But as I told you before, we were aware what’s happening all around the world, we were very much worried about the problems in Palestine where the Arabs has revolted against England and against the Jews.</span> <span id="s185">We knew what was happening the Jews of -- of Germany, and we had decided at the time maybe it was time to come to the States.</span> <span id="s186">What did happen is that we got our quota for our -- or our visa to come to the United States 1939, and at that time the war had started already, so we couldn’t move any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So tell me about when exactly did you go to Athens to study?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I went to Athens in October 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So this is after the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, it was before the war.</span> <span id="s191">The war in Greece started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: I-I’m sorry, I wanted to just talk about for a moment, just the beginning of World War II with Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: They just -- the war had started in Poland already.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: And what did you hear and what did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Now we were always talking and were always very, very enthusiastic and hopeful that the French and the British would take good care of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So then it’s October, you said, of ’39 when you left for Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And tell me what you were going off to Athens to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I was studying medicine.</span> <span id="s200">I was in the first year of medicine, at the ye -- University of Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And what was that experience like?</span> <span id="s202">Did you make a lot of friends again, mostly Jewish, or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Like everybody else, I was very happy about it.</span> <span id="s204">I was grateful that my parents could afford the e -- the expense to send me there.</span> <span id="s205">I had no qualms about my future.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did you know what kind of doctor you wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No.</span> <span id="s208">The first year the main thing that we learned was anatomy and chemistry.</span> <span id="s209">It was a preliminary for the medical profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And did you ha -- were there other Jewish students with you at medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: There was only one Jewish student with me at medical stool -- school.</span> <span id="s212">The name was Mittrani, and she was killed during the German occupation up in the Greek mountains, as a partisan.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And while you were in Athens did you -- was there any anti-Semitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s215">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s216">What it was was a fear of the Greek -- of the war that was coming very close to Greece.</span> <span id="s217">As a matter of fact, the year after, 1940, October 28th, 1940, the Italians attacked Greece.</span> <span id="s218">Greek defended -- Greece defended itself, and to a certain extent we were able to win against the Italians.</span> <span id="s219">That prompted Germany, in April of 1941 to conquer the whole of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s220">And how you call -- and occupy Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So what was -- what were you seeing and experiencing directly about all of this in Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: In Athens, nothing.</span> <span id="s223">We were very happy, and we thought it’ll never happen.</span> <span id="s224">As a matter of fact, it’s well known historically that the night before the Italians attacked Greece, there was a big party given by the Greek government where the ge -- the Italian ambassador was part of the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: But you were still in Athens, I believe, when -- did the Germans come into Athens, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No.</span> <span id="s227">I left Athens in 1940 with -- when the war started against the Italians.</span> <span id="s228">The Germans came to Greece in 1941, six months later.</span> <span id="s229">The university was closed, there was no reason for me to stay in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: I actually thought that you had stayed in Athens until the Germans came, but you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So you -- you had chosen -- the school had not yet closed, but you chose to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No, the school closed as soon as the Italians attacked, because almost everybody went to the army, were drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And you were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No, I was not drafted, I was too young.</span> <span id="s236">To be drafted in Greece you have to be 21 years old, and at that time I was hardly 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So tell me what it was like when you returned.</span> <span id="s238">At that time did you return to Kavála?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s240">Everybody was afraid, everybody was making plans, and everybody was trying more or less, to save his family, to stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So what happened next?</span> <span id="s242">You returned to Kavála and then what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: After that the Germans came in, and we figure that Kavála was a very small city, we might as well go to Salonika and we went to Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: You made that decision after the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: My father made the decision, yes, after the Germans came.</span> <span id="s246">In 19 -- in April 1941 we went to Salonika.</span> <span id="s247">Salonika was occupied by the Germans already.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And what about -- had Kavála been occupied by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well, the Germans divided Greece in three parts.</span> <span id="s250">Part of gre -- of Greece, the southern part was given to the Italians.</span> <span id="s251">The northern part of was kept for the Germans and the part of the north of Greece that was an exit to medi -- t-to the Mediterranean was given to the Bulgarians, who at the times were allied with the Germans.</span> <span id="s252">That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one who could leave Kavála, left, because we were afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Because there was an experience from World War I that the Bulgarians had occupied the city, and th-the -- i-it was only torture and -- and -- and fear, and [indecipherable] killing people.</span> <span id="s255">So everyone who had an experience from before -- not us, before, in ’21 we were not in Kavála, was telling us what it means to be under the Bulgars.</span> <span id="s256">So we decided to go to Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So at that time you actually thought it may have been better to be under the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We figured at the time we’d much better to be in the Greeks -- in the big city so we’d be more protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And that was not just a fear of what the Bulgarians might do to the Jews, that was the general population’s fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No, no that was the fear that the Bulgarians insisted that this part of Macedonia belonged to them, and we shoul -- we shouldn’t be Greeks, we shouldn’t speak Greek, we shouldn’t have our own associations.</span> <span id="s261">We should turn around and more or less be like a -- like a secret police, and denounce our fr -- our Greek friends.</span> <span id="s262">That we were not ready to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So describe to me what it was like when you arrived to Salonika and where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: We rented an apartment next to my uncle, and my father started from scratch all over again, doing his business with the tobacco people.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: And when was this that you made the move?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: We made the move in the end of April 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And it was possible at that time for you to move around and do these things on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes, it was just the beginning of the occupation, moving was still free.</span> <span id="s269">I think the restrictions came sometime in June of ’41, but don’t quote me, I’m not sure about the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So in Salonika, tell me a little bit about the neighborhood there, was it a mostly Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Was mostly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And can you give me a sense of the size of the Jewish community in Salonika?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, I think at the time were about 70,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s274">It was a big community and more or less we had our own neighborhoods without being a ghetto.</span> <span id="s275">We were free to move, we had Greek Orthodox living with us, but mostly were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And do you remember the street where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, the name of the street was, street Saron de Poru 18, was exactly i-in front of the Salonika Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s279">And what part of the -- is there a name to this district or part of Salonika that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Right now, I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: At that time nobody touched it til the deportations started.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So, what were the very first things that you were aware of that the Germans were doing in Salonika and specifically, you know, anti-Jewish meas -- measures.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Re-Restriction of traveling.</span> <span id="s285">Taxes that we couldn’t afford, restrictions in business, and the most important, something that even today I cannot explain, there were about 150 German Jews that’s came to Salonika at the expense of the Jewish community that took over the functioning of the community, where the community council was jailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Sorry, what was the last thing you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Was the elected Jewish community council was jailed the t -- by the Germans, including the chief rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: You’re saying these were German Jews who already were living in Salonika?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: No, these were German Jews that came in Salonika after the German occupation and I still in my mind say they were not Jewish, or they were part of a -- I don’t know what, because we were forced to maintain them, to feed them, and when the deportations started, they were the shupos, the -- the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Jewish police that the German imposed.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: They -- they didn’t tou -- they did not touch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: What was the name?</span> <span id="s295">Was there one?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick Levi.</span> <span id="s298">This is tape number one, side B. Just want to continue to find out a little bit more from you about your family’s financial situation.</span> <span id="s299">How -- were you well off as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: We was well off in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s301">My father had two associates who were Greek Orthodox, and one of them was very, very influential in the local government.</span> <span id="s302">As a matter of fact, in 1941, when the Germans were ready to attack Greece, my father was able, with his associates, to rent a ship and transfer all our assets to Athens because we were sure that if something happens there, Athens will not be touched, will not be bombed.</span> <span id="s303">So our luck was that when the boat arrived in Piraeus -- the name of the boat Stiliani -- Piraeus was bombed, the boat was sunk.</span> <span id="s304">All our asset were destroyed.</span> <span id="s305">We had insurance with Lloyd of London, however the insurance was in Greek dol -- mon -- drachmas.</span> <span id="s306">So after the war, one billion Greek drachma wasn’t even worth an dollar.</span> <span id="s307">So we lost everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: When was this that this ship was taken with all your assets?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: In April 1941, when the gi -- Germans attacked Greece, they bombed the port of Piraeus, because it was an expeditionary force of British, who had come to help -- to help the Greeks.</span> <span id="s310">As a matter of fact their stand was in Thermopylae and then they did [indecipherable] into Crete, and from Crete, when they lost Crete, they went back to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s311">So the Germans were bombing all the ports of Greece at the time, and our luck, which ship had to be sunk there.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Is this a very unusual story?</span> <span id="s313">Do you know other families who did anything like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, it’s very, very unusual, because at that time to get a ship was more than [indecipherable], it was influence, and you know, having people help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So this was actually a ship full of money, your money?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: This was a ship with all our assets.</span> <span id="s317">In other words, all the merchandise that we had in Kavála, we transferred to Athens and we were left without anything.</span> <span id="s318">That’s why it’s said when we went to Salonika, my father had to start from scratch because we were penniless.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Do you remember this being a very difficult time?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Very.</span> <span id="s321">Very difficult because at that time is -- the only business in Greece was the black market.</span> <span id="s322">There was no food, there were no utilities, and everybody had to fend itself, and we used to live on coupons.</span> <span id="s323">But my father had many acquaintances from the past and he was able to start his business all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And he was doing the same kind of business in Salonika?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Exactly the same business.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So, I asked you this a little bit before, but I was wondering if you remember more details about the very earliest measures that the Germans took.</span> <span id="s327">You said there were restrictions on business.</span> <span id="s328">If you remember any details --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: As soon as they came, there were restrictions on business, and restrictions in traveling, about two months after they came.</span> <span id="s330">In 1942, they started giving -- imposing taxes to the Jewish community that was very hard to be kept -- to be.</span> <span id="s331">And then, on, as I told you, in July or August 1942, we had the concentration at the Liberty Place, where people were cheated -- were t -- was, you know, t -- tortured, and most of the yonkers -- youngsters were taken for hard works in the south of -- of Greece, and were separated from their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Can you -- can you walk me through a little bit more of the details of that incident, because it is a -- a well known incident, and I want to know your memories.</span> <span id="s333">What do you first remember?</span> <span id="s334">Were you told that you had to go to this -- this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I didn’t have to go personally.</span> <span id="s336">The people that I knew, my cousins, my parents, my friends, had to go on a Saturday morning in this particular place, called Liberty Place, stand in the sun in August, for a whole day, beaten and humiliated, segregated, and then sent back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And how -- why was it that you did not have to go that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Number one because of my age, and number two because as a Spanish citizen, I was neutral, and supposedly the Germans expected our neutrality.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Well, first of all, can you tell me what your age was at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: 1941, I was 20 years o -- no, that was 1942, I was 21 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And what were the -- so you said that the ages of the men who were brought there, what was the ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: The ages was from 21 to 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: I just want to back up a moment, because you referred to being a Spanish citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Can you tell me, in whatever details you remember, when exactly did you get this citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Well, we left Spain in 1492.</span> <span id="s347">We kept our citizenship since then.</span> <span id="s348">One of my relatives -- and I don’t want to brag about it, happened to be Don Isaac Abravanel.</span> <span id="s349">He kept his citizenship, he left Spain, he kept on being representative of the Spanish government, even during the Inquisition.</span> <span id="s350">And through him we kept our citizenship til we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s351">I came to the United States with a Spanish passport, and I changed my citizenship when I became an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: So does that mean that both of your parents, as well as you, were always Spanish citizens in Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: My parents wer -- yes, both my parents, by marriage, were Spanish citizen.</span> <span id="s354">My father was Spanish citizen, my mother was -- Ashkenazi was one of the part of Jews that came 600 early -- 600 years earlier to Salonika from Poland, and they kept the name Ashkenazi to distinguish themselves from Sephardi.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So -- so your mother was not Sephardic?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, wa -- my mother was Sephardic, after 600 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: S -- and -- and so your -- your citizenship, you were never Greek citizens, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s359">No, I was always a Spanish citizen.</span> <span id="s360">I had the right to choose a citizenship when I became 21, but at that time, Greek was o -- Greece was occupied already by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: So you were born with Spanish citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I was born Spanish citizen, and I be -- it was always Spanish citizen all my life, til I change my citizenship when I came to the United States and became a u -- a U.S. citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: I was just wondering if you can explain, since it’s hard for me to understand, was there a reason that your parents knew all along that they wanted to keep Spanish citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No, a family tradition.</span> <span id="s365">Just a family tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Even though they felt very Greek, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s368">They knew nothing about Spain, except the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: And can you tell me, and anyone else who might listen to this, a little bit more about this famous Abranel?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The Spanish what?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Abra -- Abravanel?</span> <span id="s372">I’m sorry, I may not pronounce it correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Okay, a little bit of history.</span> <span id="s374">When Isabella and Ferdinand conquered Spain, they had two councilors that were Jewish.</span> <span id="s375">One was Hasdai ben Shiprut and one was Don Isaac Abravanel.</span> <span id="s376">They were very high on the ca -- ca -- in the Spanish government and they were very appreciated by the kings.</span> <span id="s377">From this too, isibi -- Isaac -- Hasdai ben Shiprut decided to convert and stay with Spain.</span> <span id="s378">Isaac Abravanel decided to leave the country.</span> <span id="s379">He didn't want to convert, he didn’t want to live under the Inquisition.</span> <span id="s380">So Isaac Abravanel up til today is being honored by the whole Jewish community, where the name of Hasdai Shiprut almost disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And your -- was it on your father’s side or mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: My father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And this is something that was long established, so nobody needed to prove the relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s385">Was never questioned.</span> <span id="s386">As a matter of fact [indecipherable] documents from the Cortez, the Spanish congress, signed by the king of Spains, testify the citizenship of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: So now we go back to 1942, Liberty Square, I believe you were telling me about this, and was your -- was it obvious -- when did it become obvious that your Spanish citizenship might help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: From the beginning, that is, the Germans entered Greece, they always made a difference between the Italian citizens, and the Spanish citizen and the Turkish citizens because the [indecipherable] neutral and the Italians were allies.</span> <span id="s389">So the Italian citizens, the Spanish citizen and the Turkish citizens were not touched at all.</span> <span id="s390">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: -- but we still couldn’t travel, and we still couldn’t choose our own profession or our own status.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Was your father’s business interrupted by the German’s measures at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, my father’s si -- business started all over again after the occupation.</span> <span id="s395">We had lost everything with the sinking of the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: But was he still able to work when the Germans were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Well, his bi -- his business was privilege for the Germans because they were stealing all the tobacco from Greece, and sending them to gr -- to Germany for -- for free, and my father was the business that provided the materials to [indecipherable] and export the tobacco.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: So he was able to continue his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah, he continued til 1943, that we were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What were some of the things you saw about other Jewish families who could not continue working?</span> <span id="s401">What did you see happening around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Their hardships, that they have what to eat, they couldn't move, they couldn’t congregate.</span> <span id="s403">They were slaves that were in -- th-that were occupied, they were not free.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And they had to give up their jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Most of them had to give their jobs, yes.</span> <span id="s406">Have to give their jobs, and the Germans took all their proceed -- all their merchandise and everything they had.</span> <span id="s407">It was a terrible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Did you -- so tell me, since you did not have to go to the Liberty Square, tell me what you learned from -- you said -- did your father go, and what about your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: My father didn’t go, my uncle was too old, my cousins went.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And what did they tell you about their experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: They didn’t have to tell it because we were in the middle of a city, we saw it happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You saw the gather -- the round-up?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s414">We saw everything that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: So that day you were somewhere close by, but you didn’t have to be part of it.</span> <span id="s416">Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well, I was not part of it, and I was part of it, because personally I was not, but family-wise, my whole family was part of it.</span> <span id="s418">There was no distinction.</span> <span id="s419">The citizenship was, how you call that?</span> <span id="s420">[indecipherable] something happen.</span> <span id="s421">We didn’t choose it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And what happened to your cousins?</span> <span id="s423">Were they taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Well, they all re -- perished in Auschwitz, from the first to the last one, and my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Now, I read about -- when this roundup occurred, I read about the fact that the Germans requested a large sum of money as ransom.</span> <span id="s426">Can you explain this?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I don’t remem -- I don’t remember how many billions of marks they requested at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Can you tell me a little bit from the start what -- what that was about?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Well, what was about, it’s one way you oppress the Jewish population, because they thought they wouldn’t be able to make their demands.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Well, what was the ransom for?</span> <span id="s431">What were they saying to the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No explanation.</span> <span id="s433">No explanation at all.</span> <span id="s434">They needed the money, they should raise the money for them, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Was this supposed to, in return, save some of the men from being sent to labor battalions?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: That was in a way thought, but right away they started with the -- the extreme measures, with putting the[indecipherable] on the Jews.</span> <span id="s437">By moving the whole population into ghettos, and a few months later, in March, the deportations started.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Well, before we get to that stage, about the ransom, I also read something about the Jewish cemetery in Salonika.</span> <span id="s439">Do you remember what happened with the cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: That was completely different.</span> <span id="s441">The Germans said that they needed materials to fortify the city.</span> <span id="s442">And being that the German -- the Jewish cemetery was full of marble, and good materials -- was a cemetery that was six or 700 years old, they decided that they needed the materials.</span> <span id="s443">They contacted the Greek government that was -- at the time was at quixli -- a quisling government.</span> <span id="s444">And the government said that the f -- you destroy the cemetery, will be a good favor for us because we can expand our university.</span> <span id="s445">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s446">Today, where the Jewish cemetery was, is the University of Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you see the destruction of the cemetery at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I saw the destruction of the cemetery and I was part of it in a way, because they gave the Jewish community a small place for a cemetery outside the city, and the people that could afford to do it, had to move the remains of their relatives to the new cemetery.</span> <span id="s449">Part of my family contributed into removing the remains of my grandmother from this cemetery to the new one, and the graves at the time was meant to have six people, six remain of people in one grave.</span> <span id="s450">My grandmother is still buried on the new cemetery in Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: And I had read, but it sounds like you’re saying it was not connected, I had read that the destruction of that cemetery was related to the ransom that the Germans wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: It happened way after the ransom.</span> <span id="s453">The loot that they took from the cemetery was not part of the money that we told to -- to raise and pay the Germans.</span> <span id="s454">Com-completely different.</span> <span id="s455">It was not even at the same time, was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Now, I also read and was wondering if you were aware of this at the time, the Jewish archives and libraries in Salonika were confiscated, were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s458">[indecipherable] it’s true, but I don’t know when was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And I also heard about the threat of starvation and many people were -- were suffering a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: The -- the starvation was general.</span> <span id="s461">Was not just the Jewish.</span> <span id="s462">As I told you, we had coupons in order to get certain amount of food every week and quite a few families, Jewish and Orthodox, no distinction there, chose many times not to report a death, to go to the cemetery and drop there the corpse, in order to save the coupon, so they can have some extra measure of food.</span> <span id="s463">To tell the truth, I mean, you cannot describe what was happen, but this was not just the Jews, was general.</span> <span id="s464">Was the whole population.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And -- and why had these conditions come about?</span> <span id="s466">How did they come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Lack of imports, lack of commerce, lack of cultivation, bef -- por -- people were afraid to go to the -- to the fields.</span> <span id="s468">Lack of fear.</span> <span id="s469">The -- the partisans [indecipherable] if you left the city you expose yourself, because they were there to -- to hit and kill as many Jews as they could -- that’s many Germans as they could.</span> <span id="s470">There were many, many, many reasons for it.</span> <span id="s471">I could keep on enumerating to you an awful lot of reasons why the population was starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Now, you mentioned partisans, were you contact with, or did you know any partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Was in contact with parti -- no.</span> <span id="s474">We knew about them, but personally I didn’t know any.</span> <span id="s475">I knew my friend that I told you were in medical school, who went to the mountains as a partisan and was killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And the ransom that was required fro -- by the Germans, did your family have to pay anything personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: We participated, but we did not have to.</span> <span id="s478">After all, we were not Spaniards, we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: What was your -- at -- at this stage, before you are taken and moved, as I understand, to the ghetto, which we’ll come to, but at this stage, what was your daily life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: As Spanish citizens, we did not have to move to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s481">What happened is that where we lived became part of the ghetto, but we did not have to move.</span> <span id="s482">We kept our apartment, we did not move at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Well, before that happened, what were you doing?</span> <span id="s484">You were a young man, but you were already over 20, what were you doing on a daily basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I had a business with a friend of mine who was also a Spanish citizen, name is Zaga Tenyo, who used to produce --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Some drinks, tea?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Dri -- drinks.</span> <span id="s488">And the name of the factory we had was called Olympic.</span> <span id="s489">There was drinks in envelopes that we used to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And this is something --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Soft drinks.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And this is something that was going pretty well, considering the circumstances, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Considering the circumstances, it was doing very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And had you already -- were you hoping someday to go back to medical school?</span> <span id="s495">What was your state of mind like?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes, definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s497">I was thinking to continue my studies, but it couldn’t happen, because when it ca -- when I was ready to go to school, I was already 30 years old.</span> <span id="s498">I had lost 10 years, between the concentration camp, going to Morocco, going to [indecipherable], going to the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s499">1939 became automatically 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Now, before the ghetto was established, what -- what do you remember?</span> <span id="s501">Were there increasing measures, you know, th -- against the Jews, and when -- when is this now, what year and approximately what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: We’re talking about ninet -- beginning of ’42, and beginning of 1943.</span> <span id="s503">The Jews could not move into their own city, could not travel, could not work.</span> <span id="s504">At night they had to go back, they couldn’t go out at night.</span> <span id="s505">They couldn’t even go from one borough to the other because they were prohibited to take the tramways.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did this apply to you or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, this did not apply to me, I never wore a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s508">I was never told to live in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s509">I happened to live in a ghetto because that’s where I lived when they established the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So -- so you were saying you never had to wear the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And then neither did your parents, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Neither my parents.</span> <span id="s514">That’s why we were able to take the bus and to take the tra -- the tramway, because nobody could distinguish us as Jews unless they knew us from before.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: So tell me about what you remember in any sort of details when the ghetto was created.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s517">What I remember is that they created the ghetto, they were the conquerors, and they created the Jewish police to more or less supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans had imposed and also in a way, take care of -- so there’d be no crime.</span> <span id="s518">Actually, we were a population very pacific.</span> <span id="s519">We never rioted, we never stole from our -- from one to the other.</span> <span id="s520">We live pacifically there, waiting to see what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you have interactions with the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, we were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: No, I mean did you personally have any, you know, communication or interactions with Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s525">My cousins were Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Well, they probably treated you well because they were your cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: They didn’t have to treat me, I was free, as a Spaniard.</span> <span id="s528">I was not treated as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So was there anything throughout this period of time --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: And -- let me explain something more.</span> <span id="s531">The reason that many people paid money and tried to become Jewish police, because there was a rumor flooded by the Germans that the Jewish police will not be touched, will remain where they were, and will not be deported.</span> <span id="s532">So people were [indecipherable] were fighting to became Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: How did your cousins become th -- Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: And what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: My great cousin was David, my second one was Solomon, the third one was Henry, and I don’t remember the name of the fourth one.</span> <span id="s537">This was on my uncle’s side.</span> <span id="s538">On my aunt’s side, there was only one that was her -- his name was Maurice -- Maurice Seedis.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So none of the -- none of the restrictions applied to you at -- at this stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: And yet, just by virtue of where you were already living, you were included in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Was include in the ghetto because we happened to be there, and we were there [indecipherable] Jewish because all the [indecipherable] family was part of our life.</span> <span id="s543">We were living with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So did your -- did anything change about your living conditions once this became a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well, the salvation was there, as I though it was part of the Jewish life and the Christian life.</span> <span id="s546">The traveling from one city to the other was not permitted.</span> <span id="s547">Traveling at night we were afraid.</span> <span id="s548">We tried to help as much we could our Jewish families and the whole Jewish community, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: -- [indecipherable] period.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: -- was there anything -- so you were able to help others who -- you know, did not have the Spanish citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: We were able to help them money-wise because both my friend and myself continued in our business of the so -- of the soft git -- drinks.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So what did you see -- what was changing around this time, if anything, for the other Jewish families, once they were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: [indecipherable] what can I say -- tell you.</span> <span id="s555">What was changing was the fear, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And were you also fearful, or were you feeling that, with your citizenship you would be okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: No, there was no guarantee, as a matter of fact, even with the citizenship, finally we were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Was that something you were worried about at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes, everybody worried about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: When did you first hear about -- the -- the first deportations, when -- do you remember hearing about those?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: First deportation was in March 1943, I think it was the 23rd of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And you knew about it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: We knew about it because we saw people pi -- taken from the ghetto and sent to the railroad station in order to be deported.</span> <span id="s564">It was not a secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: The -- if you can explain to me -- cause I looked at a map and it looked like it’s not just one area that was a ghetto, that was in a few different sections.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: There -- there were five ghettos and each ghetto went to the railroad station one at a time and sometimes half of the time because there were 23 deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Is there a name to the section, the district you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And were you close by to -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick Levi.</span> <span id="s571">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s572">You were just telling me about this situation with the partisans and the Germans.</span> <span id="s573">Can you tell me again?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, the situation in Greece, like every occupied country, people were against the Germans and most of them became partisans in the mountains.</span> <span id="s575">When the Germans had to travel by railroad, they used to brought -- put in front of the locomotive, a wagon with Greek hostages, just in case there was a bomb in the railroad tracks, so the wagon of the Jewish -- of the hostages will be blown up, and not the Germans.</span> <span id="s576">Also, when they had any skirmishes with the partisans, and one of two Germans were killed, in the morning of the [indecipherable] they used to have lorries, and [indecipherable] the city, and pick up for every German that was killed, six people that peacefully will go into work in the morning, and execute them.</span> <span id="s577">So, it’s impossible to describe the fear we lived in, regardless of citizenship.</span> <span id="s578">When they picked up cit -- when picked up hostages, they didn't ask you what citizenship, they didn’t ask if you were Jewish, you’re just one of the hostages, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did this happen to anyone you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes, quite a few of my friends were killed this way, were executed this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And were any of the non-Jewish Greek population able to help Jews at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: It was impossible.</span> <span id="s583">The only h-help they could give to us, it’s either to hide a Jew, or to take their belongings and hide them, hopefully to give them back to them when they come back, after the war.</span> <span id="s584">That’s the only thing they could do for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And did you know of situations like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yes, I know a situation like that, where quite [indecipherable] precious things were given away to Greek friends, who unfortunately, after the war, they didn’t -- not all of them gave them back to the Jews.</span> <span id="s587">Most of them had a famous saying; I’m sorry they didn’t kill you too.</span> <span id="s588">So they were [indecipherable] not anti-Semitics, but they were humans.</span> <span id="s589">Whatever they could loot and keep, they kept.</span> <span id="s590">Maybe we’re Jews who would have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s591">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Did you ever i -- did you ever experience anti-Semitism from the Greek population?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: No, not even today.</span> <span id="s594">As I told you, I still correspond with Greek friends that, as in Athens, or in Salonika were very good friends, and we keep in touch with their families and with our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Now, while you were still living in your home, were you able to continue observing, you know, holidays and did -- wer -- were you able to go to synagogue any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No.</span> <span id="s597">The synagogues were closed and occupied.</span> <span id="s598">Most of them became stables of the German army.</span> <span id="s599">We could not, of course, bake matzohs or things like that for Passover.</span> <span id="s600">We kept it quiet in the house, we used to do our prayers, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about, and did you ever have any interaction at all with this -- with this Rabbi Koretz?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: No, I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Did you have strong feelings about his role?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yes, I do, but I keep them for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And what about the Germans, did you have any interactions with the Germans occupying at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I had interaction with the Germans that were sent to us from Germany, the 150 people I told you before, because they were part of the shupos, and they used to interfere with our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: In what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: In all ways.</span> <span id="s609">We were not free.</span> <span id="s610">We had to do what they told us to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So -- and that was usually coming from the German Jews, not from the -- the Germans in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: From the German Jews.</span> <span id="s613">You know, it’s a funny thing.</span> <span id="s614">The Germans sent to Salonika six people, only six people.</span> <span id="s615">And these six people recruited the Jewish police, and the 150 people that come th -- came there before, and did the whole job of deporting close to 100,000 people, just with six of them.</span> <span id="s616">It’s fantastic, the way they were organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Did you ever see the six who were in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes, we saw them, they circulate.</span> <span id="s619">As a matter of fact, was a fat one named Vincent -- Vincent Cheni, who after the war was executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Did you know the names of the others at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No, I’m afraid I don’t.</span> <span id="s622">If I knew them, I don’t remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: So now, back to the deportations.</span> <span id="s624">When -- when these began, what else were you seeing?</span> <span id="s625">What -- what -- were the people immediately around you being taken, or was it different groups of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: They were taken in groups of people, and when the time came for the people around me, they were taken like all the others.</span> <span id="s627">There were no exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So, at that time that the people around you were taken, you were taken with them, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No.</span> <span id="s630">We were not touched, because we didn’t wear the [indecipherable] and we were Spanish.</span> <span id="s631">We were left in our apartment without being touched at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So do you remember when the people in your section were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: That must have been sometime before Passover, between April and May, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What were you hearing and what were -- what was everybody being told as to where these deportations were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: They were told to bring the money with them, to exchange the money to zlotys because they were going to Poland, where Germany had decided to establish a Jewish state and were concentrating all the Jews of Europe there.</span> <span id="s636">And people believed in that because the Chief Rabbi was the first one to disseminate the -- the rumor, and they were going like sheep to the new place, where they go -- were going to have a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Were they told where in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: They didn’t say the location.</span> <span id="s639">I th -- I think they mentioned the word Kraków, I’m not sure about it.</span> <span id="s640">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s641">They gave all their money, they came happy back with zlotys and then they were put into -- into wagons, animal wagons, locked there and transported.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: What was your impression of -- of this idea?</span> <span id="s643">Did you believe this?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I had a good friend who was the secretary of the Greek governor of Macedonia, who kept on telling me all the time, don’t believe what they’re telling you, try to escape.</span> <span id="s645">Go away.</span> <span id="s646">Don’t stay here.</span> <span id="s647">I didn’t listen to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: You -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: The -- the Greeks knew what was going to happen, but they couldn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s650">They were afraid of their own lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So did -- was there some part of you that did believe what the Germans were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I believed what the Greeks were saying.</span> <span id="s653">I didn’t believe what the Germans were saying, but by Jewish tradition, I couldn’t leave my father and mother, so I had to stay with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Did you at all discuss with them the idea of escaping?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s656">We didn’t know about the crematoria.</span> <span id="s657">Don’t misunderstand me.</span> <span id="s658">We didn’t know about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s659">But we knew that where they’re sending them was nothing good.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: So you had not yet heard of the name Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: We heard the name Auschwitz when we arrived at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s662">When we arrived at the camp, there was a group of Polish Jews that are concentrated there because they were Argentinean citizens.</span> <span id="s663">They told us what happen.</span> <span id="s664">They told us the extermination, we never believed them.</span> <span id="s665">It was impossible to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So when you saw others around you being deported, and you were not being deported, did you think for awhile that you would never face the deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, we were told by the Spanish consul that they were making arrangements to take them to Spain.</span> <span id="s668">So we were looking for them, we were given passports.</span> <span id="s669">We -- part of our money we gave to the Spanish embassy to keep for us, and we were waiting the day that we’ll be sent to Spain.</span> <span id="s670">Then it came in July 1943 that we were called -- actually our parents, the heads of families were called to a -- a synagogue named Beth Saul in Salonika with instructions, and instead of instructions, they were taken to the railroad station and we were told to follow them and join them there.</span> <span id="s671">So I took my mother and myself and we went to this place, called Baron Hirsch, to join my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: He had already been taken there earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So you knew that he was going to be there at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: We knew he was going to be there because we were told from the embassy to be there.</span> <span id="s676">But the thinking was that we’ll be given our passports back and we’ll travel to Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You -- you gave your passports to the Spanish embassy?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes, we gave the passport to the Spanish embassy.</span> <span id="s679">We were deported, we were put in cattle wagons like all the other Jews.</span> <span id="s680">And at the end of July --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Do you want to take a break?</span> <span id="s682">You want to take -- you want some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: If I knew this will be the -- the interview, I would never agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: I think you were starting to tell me about the time when you were taken from Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yes, we’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Oh -- sorry.</span> <span id="s687">Something happened to the recording.</span> <span id="s688">I think it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: We were put in cattle wagons like all the other Jews that went with us, and we were transferred from there to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s690">It took about three weeks from Salonika to arrive to Bergen-Belsen, and of all the hardships that I remember and the -- and the hungers that we went through, one date remains in my mind, and this is the 13th of August, 1943.</span> <span id="s691">Our convoy had stopped in Nuremberg, and at that time Nuremberg had a raid from the British and American af -- air force.</span> <span id="s692">What I remember is a miracle.</span> <span id="s693">The Germans locked the wagons, went to shelters, and the bombs kept on falling on the railroad station all around us, and miraculously our wagon was not touched.</span> <span id="s694">August 13, 1943, and three days later we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: And you had told me earlier that you believe you were something like the 22nd deportation from Salonika?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I think it was the 23rd deportation from Salonika.</span> <span id="s697">The very last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: How many other Greek Jews -- I guess they all -- everybody had Spanish citizenship with you?</span> <span id="s699">How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: We were about 300 all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And this was a group you already know -- knew many of these individuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah, we were acquainted during the -- the German occupation.</span> <span id="s703">This happened ’43, and we knew each other from 1941, when we arrived Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And the three weeks journey you were in -- you were always in the -- the train, the cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: [indecipherable] the train, locked in, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: What kind of food were you eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Don’t ask.</span> <span id="s708">The best ans-answer is, don’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: I also wanted to ask if you knew anything -- I -- I was reading about in the s -- back in the Salonika ghetto, there was a doctor who escaped.</span> <span id="s710">Was that something that you knew about?</span> <span id="s711">His name --</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: You talking about Dr. Matarasso?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: This -- I don’t know if -- this name is spelled C-u-e-n-c-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Oh, yeah, I -- for God’s sake, of course.</span> <span id="s715">He came to the United States, he wrote a book, the name of the book is Birkenau.</span> <span id="s716">His name was Dr. Manashay.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Is this -- is this the same one?</span> <span id="s718">I -- I read about somebody -- I read about this, on March 18th, that Dr. Cuenca -- C-u-e --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Doct -- Dr. Cuenca was one of the doctors of Salonika, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Did you know about his escape in March of ’43, from the ghetto, apparently?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I know about Dr. Manashay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And -- and what happened with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Dr. Manashay wa -- survived, came to the United States and died in New York.</span> <span id="s726">But he wrote a book, the book is named Birkenau, that unfa -- unfortunately, I gave it to somebody, never returned it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Now, when you -- when you were taken from Salonika, you didn't know where they were taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s729">We knew -- we knew that we’re going to Poland.</span> <span id="s730">We didn’t know we’re going -- we’re being taken to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: And you no longer thought you were being taken to Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, that was finish because we didn’t have passports, we had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And did you have the ability to take anything at all with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Only what we had with us, period, nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You just had to walk away from your home and just leave everything there?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And you never saw any of those items again?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Not any more because I didn’t go back to Greece after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So, were you -- were you familiar with the negotiations that I guess were going on a great deal, about the Jews like yourself with Spanish citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: We heard about the negotiations after we were liberated from the camp.</span> <span id="s741">We were told that j -- the Joint Distribution Committee was trying through the Spanish government, to liberate as many Jews as possible.</span> <span id="s742">Being that our names were known, because of our passports and our ci -- citizenship and everything, we were selected as the ones to be taken out of the camp.</span> <span id="s743">When we went to the -- to germ -- to Spain, we learned that the whole thing was done through the Portuguese Red Cross, through a gentleman who was in charge at the time, a representative of the Red Cross in Spain.</span> <span id="s744">His name, I think was Sakura, who took good care of us when we arrived in Spain and was responsible for taking us from Spain to Morocco, because the agreement with the Spanish government was that only a certain amount of Jews will be allowed to stay in Spain, and in order to accept new Jews, they had to leave.</span> <span id="s745">And the funny part of it is that out of Spain we were Spanish citizens.</span> <span id="s746">In Spain itself, we were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s747">We didn’t s -- have a -- have a citizenship.</span> <span id="s748">We were not recognized as Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Now, to go back to Bergen-Belsen, what was it like when you -- what are your first impressions when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No impressions at all.</span> <span id="s751">Confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Well, let me just phrase it differently, then.</span> <span id="s753">If you could just tell me what you saw when you first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: When we arrived to Celle, the city of Celle, Bergen-Belsen’s full name is Bergen-Belsen by Celle-Hannover.</span> <span id="s755">When we arrived in Celle, they took us out of the wagons and they marched us for about two or three kilometers to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s756">We did not know where we were going, we did not know the name of the place.</span> <span id="s757">All we saw is barbed wire, barracks and towers with people with machine guns, and do -- and fiercely dogs.</span> <span id="s758">When we got there, we was separated from the families.</span> <span id="s759">The women went to different barracks, the men went to different barracks and that’s it, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Were you able to stay with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No -- with my father, yes, but not in the same barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Do you remember any name or section that you were in in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Do you thi -- I have a map, do you think you’d recognize?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes, I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Let me see.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t know, this is from ’45, I don’t know if it’s the same layout.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: No, we lived in 1943 -- 1944 actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did it look this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, we were not at the crematory.</span> <span id="s771">The camp commander was here.</span> <span id="s772">I’m trying my best, maybe I’m wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: That’s fine, whatever you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No -- oh, no, no, no, no, no, now I remember.</span> <span id="s775">When I see the latrines, I remember where we were.</span> <span id="s776">The latrines were here, our barracks were here.</span> <span id="s777">Yeah.</span> <span id="s778">I remember the cellar, where they used to bring the vegetables that were feeding us.</span> <span id="s779">I remember the latrines, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s780">Our barracks were here.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: And was there a -- a name to the section --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: -- that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No, that I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Cause I -- I read about the group of -- of Jews with Spanish citizenship, that they were in the neutrals camp.</span> <span id="s786">Does that make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Neutrals camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: That you were considered neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Probably, because there, as I told you were the ger -- the Argentineans also.</span> <span id="s790">So maybe that was called neutral camp, but nobody ever told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Who else was immediately around you in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: People that we came together, the 300 from Salonika.</span> <span id="s793">About 50 people from Argentina, or Argentineans, but actually from Poland, who unfortunately they must have gotten that citizenship through paying money or whatever, they -- and very few of them survived.</span> <span id="s794">They were not recognized as Argentineans by the Germans, whereas we, from Salonika, were s -- survived from the first to the last one.</span> <span id="s795">There was no doubt about our citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: How were you treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: We were not treated, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: I mean, how -- did your -- did the treatment of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners in the camp.</span> <span id="s800">The food, I don’t want to mention it.</span> <span id="s801">We had to eat it one way or the other.</span> <span id="s802">One day a week, usually every Friday, we used to go to the showers to be cleaned and to have our -- our cl-clothing been disinfected.</span> <span id="s803">We went to the showers, we took our clothing, men and women together in the same place, naked.</span> <span id="s804">We had about five minutes of shower, and 75 minutes naked waiting for our -- our -- our clothing to come back from the -- I don’t know how they used to call, the place where they disinfected them, and then take him back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And besides Fridays, what else do you remember about the daily routines?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: What I remember, twice a day we used to have what they call the appel, or the appelle.</span> <span id="s807">That’s five o’clock in the morning and the evening, where the German commandant would come with his shi -- with his ga -- dog, and ask from the [indecipherable] -- from the [indecipherable] out of the camp, how many died tonight, how many died today?</span> <span id="s808">Count them, make sure that nobody was missing and taken back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Were people dying right around you, where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: People were dying, but not in our section, because in our section we didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s811">People that had to work, with the -- with the food they were given, couldn’t rest too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: What were you doing -- you weren’t working during the rest of the day, were you staying in the barracks?</span> <span id="s813">Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Abso -- absolutely not, I think, staying in the barracks, period.</span> <span id="s815">And I was lucky enough to have a book with me, and I read this book maybe 10 times.</span> <span id="s816">10 or 20 times.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Do you remember -- do you remember what the book was?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Oh yeah, it was a Bible.</span> <span id="s819">The Bible in Greek.</span> <span id="s820">I’m an expert on the Bible now, you can ask me anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.</span> <span id="s821">I memorize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Did that help you in any way in terms of praying, or in terms of religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Not in praying, it helped me very much in making sure I don’t go crazy.</span> <span id="s824">It helping -- it helped me in spending my time sane instead of, you know, depressed and -- and whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s825">Yes, it helped me a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Was that unusual?</span> <span id="s827">Did you know anybody else who had a Bible with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s829">Not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: And was that one of the only things you brought with you, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: That was the only thing I happened to have with me by -- by coincidence or mistake.</span> <span id="s832">How very surprised [indecipherable] today, that they didn’t take it away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And did you pray while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Everybody prayed without hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Did you have a sense that you were being treated differently than some of the other prisoners at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: That we knew because we saw the other prisoners going to work every morning and coming back every evening.</span> <span id="s837">And we knew that we were not working.</span> <span id="s838">And that’s help us a lot, except that we were living with the fear that we’ll never get out of it, because from the amount of food that they give us, we couldn’t last forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Are you able to tell me what you did have to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: What we did where?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Wh-What you ate.</span> <span id="s842">What -- what they gave to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Stuffed cabbage.</span> <span id="s844">Every week, half a potato.</span> <span id="s845">Five grams of bread, and a little bit of butter and milk that we did not eat ourselves or drink ourselves, they gave it to the young children that’s happened to be with us, because among the 300 of us, there were infants.</span> <span id="s846">And we tried to preserve them as much as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Now when did you -- were you able to see your parents at times?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Oh, we saw each other every day.</span> <span id="s849">We did not live together the same barrack, whether we saw each other every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: They were close by and you were able to go over and see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: They’re close by and also my father in a way, was privileged at the camp because my father was a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young, World War I, and the German help him a lot.</span> <span id="s852">This is part of [indecipherable] like to say about the Jews of Greece.</span> <span id="s853">As long as you want to know what happened to them, it’s a disaster.</span> <span id="s854">The Jews from Greece were deported to Poland exactly when the crematoria were established in 1943.</span> <span id="s855">Before that the Germans used to execute the Jews.</span> <span id="s856">They didn’t have the crematoria ready yet.</span> <span id="s857">When they arrived in ger -- in Auschwitz, they had three things against them.</span> <span id="s858">Number one, that the Germans wanted to feed and drive the crematorium.</span> <span id="s859">Number two, that because there was Ladino, they didn’t know it -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick Levi.</span> <span id="s861">This is tape number two, side B. Okay, please -- please continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: So the third part of it was that -- not being able to communicate.</span> <span id="s863">The people that were on top of them took the bread away to serve the -- to forced labors.</span> <span id="s864">Was slow -- steady but steadily they were exterminated.</span> <span id="s865">That’s why part of them, they became Sonderkommando, because the moment they arrived there, the Germans were looking for people to use in the crematory.</span> <span id="s866">Of the population of Europe, or Jewish population of Europe that perished during the Holocaust, the percentage of Greek Jews that perished is the most elevated, the maximum one.</span> <span id="s867">I think about 86 percent of the Jews from Greece perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Did you -- did you know any German, and did that help you in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s870">I didn’t know one word of German.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: But your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah, my father used to communicate with them, not that it help him, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So, did you ever communicate with the Germans at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Absolutely no contacts at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: And so do you even have memories of particular commanders there at -- at the time, or SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: [indecipherable] I remember the commander with his dog.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s878">Hauptman Spherer or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: What would have been -- so the language you were speaking most of the time while you were there was Ladino, or what was the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I used to speak most of the time Greek.</span> <span id="s881">Ah -- my language was Greek.</span> <span id="s882">Forget that we were Spanish citizens, we were Greeks after all.</span> <span id="s883">We were born in Greece, and we deported from Greek.</span> <span id="s884">We knew Ladino among our families, but outside our homes we used to speak Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: What’s the language you speak today the most, at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Here at home?</span> <span id="s887">Five languages at the same time.</span> <span id="s888">Ladino, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, French, and who knows what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: And probably English.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Hebrew -- and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s891">English I’m not gonna mention.</span> <span id="s892">[off camera remarks].</span> <span id="s893">We’ve been here more than 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: You were telling me about the crematoria at Auschwitz, but what did you -- did you learn about at Bergen-Belsen --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I’m not going to answer to that.</span> <span id="s896">I know about the crematory in Bergen-Belsen, but most of the people -- the crematoria there were -- were Russian citizen -- occu -- pri -- prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s897">They executed an awful lot of Russians there.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: So in your -- in your barracks, as far as communicating with others, were they -- were they all Greek in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s900">Our barrack was only Greeks.</span> <span id="s901">Spanish Greeks.</span> <span id="s902">The whole barrack of ours was isolated.</span> <span id="s903">We never -- we did not get in touch with the other Greeks in Bergen-Belsen and we did not go to work.</span> <span id="s904">The only way we had a contact with them is when they used to come and bring us the food in the morning and we were forbidden to talk to each.</span> <span id="s905">The Germans didn’t want them to know what was happening in the other camps, because maybe they knew that sooner or later they had to send them to Greece, to send us to Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: So you weren’t hearing that much, or did you hear from other places about what else was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: We heard from other places what was happening through the Argentineans that came from Poland, and we never believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: How -- how was your health during the time you were at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Except for colds, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: And were your parents healthy, relatively speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Same thing, same thing.</span> <span id="s912">Same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: And were you required to wear the uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Did you continue any religious observances while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: What were you thinking about at this stage for the future?</span> <span id="s918">Were you at all hopeful in any way, or -- or -- or not?</span> <span id="s919">Did you somehow remain hopeful?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I gave you the answer before.</span> <span id="s921">We were positive we’ll never get alive from the camp, so we never gave it any other thought, what’s going to be our future.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: So, tell me then how it came about when you learned that you were going to leave the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Well, one day a Spanish consul came to Bergen-Belsen, and told us that they made arrangements to take us back to Spain.</span> <span id="s924">He gave us our passports and he said because transportation was very limited, he was going to be in two -- two convoys.</span> <span id="s925">So I happened to be on the second one.</span> <span id="s926">First about 150 people went ahead of us to Spain, and then the remaining of us went to Spain about two weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: That was 1944 already.</span> <span id="s929">I don’t remember exactly the month.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: You were in Bergen-Belsen approximately for how long, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: About eight to nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: And do you know -- did you later learn why you were there for that period of time?</span> <span id="s933">Do you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes, we were told from the Spanish government, that they had no choice.</span> <span id="s935">The Germans wanted us to be isolated for a certain amount of time so we couldn’t communicate with the allies and tell them what was happening in Salonika [indecipherable] fortifications and other strategic things.</span> <span id="s936">We didn’t swallow it, but that’s the answer we were given.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: In other words, we were told after the fact, that we were not in a concentration camp, we were in a transient camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: But at the time it didn’t feel that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s941">Of course not.</span> <span id="s942">Who knew what was happening in the outside?</span> <span id="s943">We were completely isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: And were there times where you were worried that you might be sent specifically to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s945">You had heard about Auschwitz at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s947">We were always worried about what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s948">We knew about Auschwitz, and you knew out -- about the crematories in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s949">So what was there to think about?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: So when you then heard that you were going to Spain, did that give you a certain amount of hope?</span> <span id="s951">A: Not til after we transferred from there and we were in Spain.</span> <span id="s952">We couldn’t believe it and we didn’t believe it til we actually passed Port Bo into the Pyrenees and arrived in Barcelona.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: What was the journey like?</span> <span id="s954">How long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Very long.</span> <span id="s956">I think it took about two and a half weeks.</span> <span id="s957">And then we waited for about two days at the Pyrenees in the frontier because two our people had died, and the Germans wanted to make sure that we sign affidavits that they didn't kill them, that they were natural deaths.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Who was transporting you then, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s960">Everything was done by the Germans.</span> <span id="s961">We -- we sp -- went through the whole of France, from Hannover all the way down to Port Bo in the Pyrenees with Germans.</span> <span id="s962">And we signed affidavits before we entered Spain to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: So each one of you, you had to sign personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I think the -- the man in charge is the one who signed, who, being a Jew -- his name was Izrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war, and during the war, the consul of Spain in Salonika.</span> <span id="s965">He was traveling with us and he is the one who certified that they were not killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: I -- I just remembered reading that -- that also this Rabbi Koretz was at Bergen-Belsen, were you aware of him being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s968">We were of it.</span> <span id="s969">We were very aware of it and that’s why we hate him much today.</span> <span id="s970">I’m positive he was a collaborator, that’s why he survived.</span> <span id="s971">His family survived, all of them.</span> <span id="s972">He is the only one who died.</span> <span id="s973">And he died from typhoid and maybe from old age.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So, during the transport, were you with your parents the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s976">We were with our parents, we were well fed.</span> <span id="s977">We had no complaints, except what as I told you before, to the last minute, we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s978">The fear was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: So, if you could tell me now, what happened next?</span> <span id="s980">You got to this point where somebody had to sign these affidavits and then you actually entered Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: When we entered Spain, we were under the auspices of joice distri -- Joint Distribution Committee, under the [indecipherable] or whatever it is, of Samuel Sakura, who happened to be also the representative of the Portuguese Red Cross in Spain.</span> <span id="s982">We were distributed into hotels.</span> <span id="s983">We were taken bi -- care of it.</span> <span id="s984">We were, all of us examined to find out if health-wise we were bis -- perfect, that nothing was wrong with us, and we were given as a matter of fact, pocket money, so we won’t suffer.</span> <span id="s985">We stayed in Barcelona about six months, and if it wasn’t for Barcelona we wouldn’t be alive today.</span> <span id="s986">We were treated royalty.</span> <span id="s987">No complaints at all.</span> <span id="s988">Now, the reason that we left Barcelona is because, as we found out later on, there was an agreement that General Franco will not accept too many Jews in Spain, there had to be a certain amount.</span> <span id="s989">So they organized a convoy, they took us from Barcelona through Spain to Cadiz, and from Cadiz with a convoy, we were took into Casablanca, that other time we was liberated from the Germans, and the Americans were occupying Morocco.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Who -- who’s they?</span> <span id="s991">Who is taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: What do you mean, who’s they?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Well, you were saying they took you from Barcelona to Casablanca --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Joint Distribution Committee, the f -- Samuel Sakura.</span> <span id="s995">Everything was happen in Spain, happened through the Portuguese Red Cross, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: A-And the Joint, you’re saying, both --</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: The Germans were not there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: No, no, no, but the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: The Joint was financing the whole thing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: How large a group were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: We were 300.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: So you were all together again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: The same group.</span> <span id="s1004">Always the same group.</span> <span id="s1005">We’re 300 there, we’re 300 in Morocco.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And where did you stay in Morocco, what was the situation there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: In Morocco we was taken to a beach outside Casablanca called Fidella, where there was a refugee camp of the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1008">We stayed in this camp, in the tents, I believe for about seven or eight months, and then from this camp, we were taken with a convoy through Argeus, from Argeus to Italy, from Italy to Gaza in order to be repatriated to Greece.</span> <span id="s1009">By that time it was already 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Do you know the month when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No, the only thing I remember is that when we got to the concen -- to the refugee camp in Gaza, the name of the camp was Lucerite, Greece was not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s1012">The Greek army in exile with a -- with the King George was still in Palestine, they were not in Greece yet.</span> <span id="s1013">The exact month, I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: So that’s why you were sent to Palestine, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Were sent there in order to be repatriated to Greece, yes.</span> <span id="s1016">We went to a Greek refugee camp, but was under the -- not the command -- under the auspices of the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1017">The camp was called Lucerite, and the name of the camp -- the name of the people that were running the camp for the United Nations was URRA, United Nations Rehabilitation and Refugee Administration.</span> <span id="s1018">One thing I have to say that being that I knew English, I was [indecipherable] and hired by the United Nations to help the administration [indecipherable] living constantly in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Well, the first -- the first U.N. camp that you were at in -- in Casablanca, near Casablanca, what were the conditions like there?</span> <span id="s1020">Who else was living there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: The conditions were excellent except that we lived in camps, and we lived in tents.</span> <span id="s1022">Our guards were Italian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1023">They were the -- the best people you can ever see in your life.</span> <span id="s1024">They were human, they were good, they helped us in everything.</span> <span id="s1025">We had no choice at -- but to say thanks to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And you were there for a long time, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Oh, we were there at least six months, I don’t remember exactly how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And -- and who else was part of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I try to forget that.</span> <span id="s1030">There were some people that we did not associate with them, who were liberated from Spain and came with us to the camp that were part of the Lincoln brigade that fought Franco during the chi -- during the Spanish Civil War, and they were imprisoned from 1936 til ninet -- til 1936 yes, til 1943 or ’45, that they were sent with us to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Was this a large group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes, there was a large group, and I’m not going to say a word about them.</span> <span id="s1033">They were good people, good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: And there were others already at this camp in clasa -- Casablanca?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: It was created basically for your group, you think, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Maybe there was a group before us, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1038">But the maximum were there, we must have been about a thousand people, no more, no less.</span> <span id="s1039">I doubt it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What was your state of mind when you were at that place?</span> <span id="s1041">Did you have a good deal of hope at this stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: We were liberated, we were hopeful, we were told we are going back to Greece.</span> <span id="s1043">What will be my state of mind?</span> <span id="s1044">We were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: The war wasn’t over yet, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No.</span> <span id="s1047">I’m talking 1944.</span> <span id="s1048">There where wa -- the war was not over yet.</span> <span id="s1049">We left Casablanca -- we leave Morocco in 1945, where at that time the -- the [indecipherable] has taken -- had taken place and the Germans were no place to be seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: So you think it was approximately -- you’re not sure exactly when in ’45 you would have left Morocco?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: No, we left the camp -- no -- May, June of ’45, something, I don’t -- it was before the end of the war, that’s -- I’m sure it was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: And what about -- so then tell me about the next journey that you went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: The next journey was by train all the way from Morocco to Algiers.</span> <span id="s1054">In Algiers we stayed for a few days, and with the convoy we were -- that’s why I said the war was not over yet, and with the convoy would take you to Taranto in Italy at the military camp of the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: You mean Torino in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Taranto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Taranto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Taranto, not Torinto -- Torino.</span> <span id="s1059">It’s the end of the -- of the boot.</span> <span id="s1060">It’s -- one side it’s Taranto and the other side I think is Bari, something.</span> <span id="s1061">Taranto, where we were.</span> <span id="s1062">In Taranto we stayed a few weeks, and when they had a convoy for the Middle East, we were part of this convoy.</span> <span id="s1063">I remember it was a convoy of Australia -- Australian soldiers who went to Port-Siad.</span> <span id="s1064">From Port-Siad we are taken with trucks to can -- el Cantara.</span> <span id="s1065">From el Cantara we cross the Suez Canal, and we were taken to Gaza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Did you know where you were going at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1068">We knew we were going to Gaza, bepo -- because we thought we’ll be repatriated to Greece.</span> <span id="s1069">We knew we were going to a refugee camp of the United Nations, to be assembled and sent back to Greece as soon as Greece was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: How large was that camp?</span> <span id="s1071">Who else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: The camp in [indecipherable] was a large camp.</span> <span id="s1073">Quite a few thousand of people.</span> <span id="s1074">Quite a few Greeks had escaped from Greece, and I do think there were quite a few from Cyprus and Libya, but I’m not sure about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: These were all Jewish refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: No.</span> <span id="s1077">No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1078">We were the only Jewish refugees there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: So, it’s while you’re at this camp that you begin working as a translator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Not as a translator, I was working -- working at the b -- at the administration of the camp, and occasionally because they were all Greeks, I used to translate for them, but my main function was in the office.</span> <span id="s1081">Actually, it was bookkeeping to a certain extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How long did you stay at that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: The camp was dismantled at the end of 1945, I think it was November, where Greece was complete liberated.</span> <span id="s1084">And they started sending refugees back to Greece.</span> <span id="s1085">I did not leave the camp.</span> <span id="s1086">I stayed there for only one reason.</span> <span id="s1087">At the time there was a civil war going in Greece, the Communists and the Royalists, and I did not go -- or want to go and get involved in a civil war.</span> <span id="s1088">So when my tame -- time came to be repatriated to Greece, I decided to stay in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Is that -- did your parents stay with you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: And just to back up, do you remember where you were when the war actually ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I was in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: I was in Gaza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: And was that a -- a big moment.</span> <span id="s1096">Do you remember hearing the news?</span> <span id="s1097">Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: There were no big moments for us, we suffered so much, we didn’t have the strength for nothing.</span> <span id="s1099">We were -- we were not there to celebrate.</span> <span id="s1100">We were thinking of constantly, what happened to our people?</span> <span id="s1101">Who is alive, who is gonna come back?</span> <span id="s1102">How could you celebrate?</span> <span id="s1103">How could you think differently?</span> <span id="s1104">For God’s sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Well, I wasn’t suggesting celebrating.</span> <span id="s1106">I was just wondering if it was sort of a turning point --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: No, our thoughts were always with the Jews that we knew went to Bergen-Belsen and we were always thinking, who is going to come back.</span> <span id="s1108">That was our only thought.</span> <span id="s1109">There were no future for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So what happened next?</span> <span id="s1111">You stayed at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Nothing except I stayed in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn’t go back to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: You’ve never been back to Greece to this day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Once I was as a tourist in 1972.</span> <span id="s1116">But I never went back to Greece to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Did you find anything in Greece of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: I didn’t go looking for anything in Greece.</span> <span id="s1119">In 1972 it was too late to find something.</span> <span id="s1120">There was nobody left, there was nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: So, can you tell me about your time in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: What’s there the time in Palestine?</span> <span id="s1123">I left the camp when the camp moved from Gaza to a different place.</span> <span id="s1124">They used to call them [indecipherable] the twe.</span> <span id="s1125">[indecipherable] Mo-Moisis river, in the Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s1126">We were given the choice to go to Palestine or to go with them, with the camp, with the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1127">I decided to stay in Palestine, I didn’t want any more part of refugee’s camp, and I parted from the United Nations, went to Tel Aviv and with my parents started to make a living and find a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: What did I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: What kind of work, that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I was a worker on a company that used to make perambulators, they used to call them in English, babies carriages.</span> <span id="s1132">I used to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: And how long did you do that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Til I was drafted into the Israeli army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: That was in 1947, the end of ’47, when the United Nations established the petition of Palestine and the State of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: So, can you tell me about your army experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I was in the army before [indecipherable] in Israel.</span> <span id="s1139">I was helping other organizations save people from Europe.</span> <span id="s1140">I smuggle refugees into the land because be -- the British would not allow -- did not allow any more Jews to come into Palestine.</span> <span id="s1141">I helped as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1142">When the petition was made, like everybody else, I was draft in the ar -- drafted in the army, and I was in the army from the beginning of 1948 til July 1949, a year and a half.</span> <span id="s1143">In 1949, when we -- truce was proclaimed and the legitimate state -- government of Israel was established, when the elections took place, I was released from the army.</span> <span id="s1144">I was married in the army, because my wife happened to be also a soldier.</span> <span id="s1145">And in 1949 I left Israel and went back to cu -- went to Cuba to a cousin of mine, hoping that from there I would be able to join my parents in the United States, because my parents were given a visa for the United States, where I did not get one myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: How come?</span> <span id="s1147">Was there a reason why you didn't get one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1149">There was a quota for it in every country in Europe.</span> <span id="s1150">My father was born in Yugoslavia, the quota was free.</span> <span id="s1151">The Greek quota was filled for the next 30 years.</span> <span id="s1152">I was born in Greece, so I didn’t qualify for a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: At this point what was your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Spanish.</span> <span id="s1155">But the quota for the United States was not based on citizenship, it was based on the country where you were born.</span> <span id="s1156">It’s a funny thing, at the time there were about 30,000 Greeks asking for a visa, and the quota for the -- for Greece was 308 a year.</span> <span id="s1157">In other words, there was a quota for about a hundred years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And when did your parents leave Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: They left the beginning of 1946, and they came here in th-the beginning of 1946, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: And were you usually living with and around other Jews from Salonika while you’re in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: No, I rented a place, and I was living on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: And -- and how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: We met in the army, we were both soldiers.</span> <span id="s1164">We happened to g -- were both from Greece, and we worked together from the end of 1947 til 19 -- til 1949 where a law came that every woman that was married would get a discharge from the army.</span> <span id="s1165">So in April of 1949, we were married and she was able to start her civil life, where I continued to the army -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick Levi.</span> <span id="s1167">This is tape number three, side A. I just wanted to correct one thing, if you can tell me about your time, I believe, in Torino in Italy, and then just explain -- I think you went to the Middle East by ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: [indecipherable] a few weeks, maybe two weeks tops.</span> <span id="s1169">There’s nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1170">We used to have the same rations as the Spanish -- as the British soldiers, very good treat.</span> <span id="s1171">We were was -- were taken care.</span> <span id="s1172">We had medical facilities and we were waiting, we were told, to go back to Greece.</span> <span id="s1173">So our stay there d-doesn’t leave an -- an impression on me, it was a very short one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: And where were you staying while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Well, there were -- there were tents, like the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1176">We’re there in tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: What you were saying before was a British army camp, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: In the British army camp, yes.</span> <span id="s1179">All the time in Torino was the British army camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: And you -- sorry.</span> <span id="s1181">And I just wanted to make sure, since earlier we -- you were talking about Taranto, but this was Torino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Torino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1184">And from there you were taken by ship, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Today with a convoy were taken by ship to Egypt, to ca -- to Port-Siad.</span> <span id="s1186">And we -- Port-Siad by trucks.</span> <span id="s1187">We crossed the Suez, we went to el Cantara, and by railroad from el Cantara to Gaza.</span> <span id="s1188">We went the whole -- the whole Sinai peninsula to Gaza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: And can you tell me -- I know you were telling me how you met your wife, can you tell me her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Her name is Flora.</span> <span id="s1191">Her Hebrew name is Shoshanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And what was her maiden name before marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Cohen.</span> <span id="s1194">C-o-h-e-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: And where -- can you tell me where she was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: She also was born, I think in Greece or Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1197">Now -- now it’s -- now it’s Macedonia.</span> <span id="s1198">She was born in Macedonia, and lived all her life in Salonika.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Okay, now did you -- so now if you could tell me how you wound up going to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Very simple.</span> <span id="s1201">As I explained to you, my quota to come to United States will take about a hundred years.</span> <span id="s1202">We had a good cousin in Cuba who lived there -- went there after the first World War.</span> <span id="s1203">And we had a cousin there who was able to obtain for us a residency in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1204">So we left Palestine in November of 1949.</span> <span id="s1205">We spent one month with a cousin of ours in barce -- in geno -- Genoa in Italy.</span> <span id="s1206">And from Genoa we went to Columbia and by plane from Columbia -- from Barankia, we went to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: How long were you in Cuba and what was it like living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: We were in Cuba 1950 to 1953, three and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And can you tell me what it was like to live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Was a paradise.</span> <span id="s1211">I’m talking to you before Castro.</span> <span id="s1212">We had a good business, we used to do business.</span> <span id="s1213">We used to import textiles from the United States and sell them in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1214">We had no complaints, we made very good friends.</span> <span id="s1215">We had our family, our cousins and uncles there.</span> <span id="s1216">Unfortunately, in 1952 there was go -- they were going to have elections in Cuba, and the next dictator decided that he wanted to be the president.</span> <span id="s1217">His name was Fulgencio Batista.</span> <span id="s1218">He made the coup in March of 1952, took over the government, insta -- installed a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s1219">From the experience we had with dictators, our only way -- the only thing left for us was to leave Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Before that it was -- you didn’t experience any -- any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Are you kidding, no, nobody ever asked us if we were Jewish or where we l -- where we were living, where we came from.</span> <span id="s1222">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1223">I can tell you off the record, you can take it -- no, you can take it off later on, that the situation was so good in Cuba that the man who wanted to be [indecipherable] senator offered us money -- we were there only six months -- offered us money to give us -- no, no -- yeah, to give us a Cuban citizenship so we can vote for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: But you did not become Cuban citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1226">We were not crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1228">And so tell me -- tell me what happened next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: What happened next is that we were lucky, for once in our life.</span> <span id="s1230">Presidents Tru-Truman passed a law in Congress admitting 50,000 deported people from the war to the United States on top of the [indecipherable] the -- the quota.</span> <span id="s1231">Being as I was one of the deportees, I qualified, and in May of 1953, I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: And that was to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: And that’s my life, that’s was to New York where my father and mother were living.</span> <span id="s1234">They were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: What kind of work did you do in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Insurance.</span> <span id="s1237">I was selling insurance because I knew Spanish.</span> <span id="s1238">I was selling insurance to the Puerto geetans -- portag -- port -- to the Puerto Ricans, to the Dominicans, but I didn’t stay too long because a friend of my father had a furniture store and he needed somebody to speak spa -- Spanish so he ca-can attract the Spanish clientele.</span> <span id="s1239">So I went to work for him as a -- as a -- not bookkeeper, how you call that?</span> <span id="s1240">The people they give mortgages, and things like that there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Broker, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No, no, no, it’s -- it’s -- the people they approve the pr -- they approve the mortgages, how you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Not a lender?</span> <span id="s1244">No?</span> <span id="s1245">I don’t know, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Anyway, we went there to took over the store and I work for him til -- til -- was 1950 -- ’54 and -- til 1955.</span> <span id="s1247">In 1955 he sold the store and the company that financed -- oh, financed, financed -- the company that financed the store saw the quality of approval I was given, asked me to work for them.</span> <span id="s1248">So I went to work for them, and I stayed with them til 1956 - ’57, something like that.</span> <span id="s1249">Then I decided that I wanted something better than that.</span> <span id="s1250">I went to another furniture company for about six months that decided to -- the man in charge decided to make his own company, so I went with him, always in the same kind of business, as a finance manager, and I stayed with them til -- and I’m confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: It’s okay, it’s okay, don’t worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: 1950 something -- no, no, ti -- 1964 -- ti -- 1964, when we built Town Craft, the company that was -- that was the partners.</span> <span id="s1253">Yeah, we establish a company that used to sell furniture and all kinds of equipment on -- on monthly installments.</span> <span id="s1254">So, with a little bit of a capital that I had at the time, I became again, the finance manager of the new company, being also a partner.</span> <span id="s1255">I stayed with this company from 1965 to 1976.</span> <span id="s1256">In 1976 through a friend of mine who used to work on gr -- eyeglasses frames, representing a Fr-French factory in the United States, I was given the opportunity to go with him, and to represent this French company from 1976 til 1991, where at the age of 70, I decided to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Well, thank you, that’s very detailed.</span> <span id="s1258">Y-You have a good memory.</span> <span id="s1259">I know some of the dates are a little rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: I hope it di -- I hope it didn’t confuse you because I’m so emotional now, maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: That’s okay, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: -- s-something as far as the dates only is concerned, might be confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: No, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s1264">I just have a few more questions and -- and -- and if you could not -- I have to keep it quiet, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: No, I’m -- [tape break].</span> <span id="s1267">So, can you just tell me about your parents, how long did they live and they were always in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Oh, my parents came in 1946 to the States.</span> <span id="s1269">My father died in November of 1959 and my mother died in October 1968.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: And tell me -- I believe you have children, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: I have two children.</span> <span id="s1272">One is a dentist, he is 53 years old, and one is an architect, he just turned 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Can you tell me their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: The first name is from the Hebrew Menachem, his name is Meny.</span> <span id="s1275">And the second name -- the second one is the Hebrew name for her father, who was Moshe, and his name is Murray.</span> <span id="s1276">Meny is the dentist, married to a wonderful girl, has two children, lives in Jersey.</span> <span id="s1277">One of a gr -- my grandchildren is in third year in Union College, and the other one is just finishing high school.</span> <span id="s1278">They live in West Caldwell.</span> <span id="s1279">They are very, very active in orga -- Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1280">They’re very, very active in their synagogue.</span> <span id="s1281">That’s why their -- my daughter-in-law asked my wife if she wanted to be the guest speaker for the Shoah this year.</span> <span id="s1282">Now, my second son is not married.</span> <span id="s1283">He lives very happily in Manhattan, but we are not happy that he is all alone in his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: And tell me about your own involvement, I believe, with -- with the organization, I believe in the 80’s you were president, can you tell me a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yeah, we went -- we came here 1953.</span> <span id="s1286">At that time survivors from the Holocaust were also coming from Greece on the base of this law that I told you, 50,000 the pre -- the displaced people.</span> <span id="s1287">Most of them did not speak English, did not know any professions.</span> <span id="s1288">They quin -- they came here with the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1289">Some of them were sent to Flint, Michigan, others were sent here.</span> <span id="s1290">So there was an organization that in a way was trying to help them, with the language, with the daily life, with the profession, with health, that was called [indecipherable] brotherhood of America.</span> <span id="s1291">My father was a member of this organization and we became members immediately.</span> <span id="s1292">We became active.</span> <span id="s1293">While the old people that build the organization in 1917, after the first war passed away, slowly but steadily, we took care of it.</span> <span id="s1294">And in the elections in the 80’s, I was elected president.</span> <span id="s1295">I served two terms, because elections were two years, I served fer -- four years as president, and is still today very active in this organization.</span> <span id="s1296">I’m a member of the central board of [indecipherable] and I participate in everything that I can help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Are there other ways that you have been involved with either groups of Greek survivors, and -- and those sorts of organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: First we -- I helped quite a few of them that decided to relocate from Greece to -- to United States.</span> <span id="s1299">Most of them did not stay here, they went to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1300">I helped them as much as I could because at that time I needed help myself.</span> <span id="s1301">And I participate in every fundraising from Israel.</span> <span id="s1302">I have certificates of Israeli bonds for what I did for the bonds.</span> <span id="s1303">I sh -- was member of B’nai Zion.</span> <span id="s1304">I was -- I was helping, and I still help UJA, and as much as I can I try to keep our Sephardic tradition because unfortunately we are not as many as Ashkenazi.</span> <span id="s1305">Our language, our Ladino is disappearing, it’s not like the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1306">And I have a feeling that after our generation there’ll be nothing left of the Jewish tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Were you able to teach Ladino to your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: My children do not speak Ladino, I’m sorry to say that.</span> <span id="s1309">They do not speak Spain -- French.</span> <span id="s1310">They speak -- they speak Spanish, they learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1311">They’re involved with their crowd, and everything that’s Jewish, thank God for it.</span> <span id="s1312">They are more or less observant.</span> <span id="s1313">They participate in their synagogue, and that’s the best I can hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Do you think that your -- your faith helped you through all of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Ah, I’ll be honest with you, no.</span> <span id="s1316">I’ve kept my fa -- my faith because it was part of my life from the day I was born, but did not help me in any way, on the contrary, in quite a few instances, I suffered because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1317">And I don’t mean just the Holocaust, I mean here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: You did experience anti-Semitism here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: I w -- I was also thinking maybe -- sort of larger faith in God, did that help you to get through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: No, the faith I had in God, I still have.</span> <span id="s1322">I don’t think it was too much, I hope it was more, but as far as I am concerned, He helps me, He exists, and [indecipherable] all the commandments I tried to follow, the si -- the rich words of our religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And you -- you have a Sephardic temple you go to in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yes, we have a Sephardic temple in Forest Hills, where I belong, and where I a member of the board.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Did you speak ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: And by the way, on this Sephardic temple, I was in the executive for at least seven years.</span> <span id="s1327">I’ve been on the Board of Directors of the temple from 1972 til today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: What’s the name of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Forest Hills.</span> <span id="s1330">No, I’m sorry, Sephardic Jewish Center of Forest -- I’m confusing with the brotherhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Did you -- did you ever talk to your sons about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Always.</span> <span id="s1333">Always.</span> <span id="s1334">As much as I tried to spare them the tales, they know the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: So you were willing to share with them your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1337">I’m always willing to share my experiences.</span> <span id="s1338">I was willing to make sure that the Holocaust doesn’t disappear after I disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: I -- I know a lot of survivors for many decades did not talk about their experiences.</span> <span id="s1340">Was that similar for you, for awhile you didn’t talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: No, I always tried not to talk about it with strangers, not with my family.</span> <span id="s1342">Many people complain, why didn’t you say what’s happened to you?</span> <span id="s1343">I don’t want any part of it.</span> <span id="s1344">I try not -- I cannot forget, but I’m trying not to remember.</span> <span id="s1345">I [indecipherable] all right to give other people the suffering, to a certain extent, of what I went.</span> <span id="s1346">It doesn’t help.</span> <span id="s1347">The only thing I try to do is m -- to make sure that they know -- they know the Holocaust existed, and to perpetuate the memory of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: I hope you realize that by doing this interview that’s exactly what you’ve done.</span> <span id="s1349">I know it hasn’t been diff -- it hasn’t been easy for you to do this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Darling, that’s why I decided to give you the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: I’m -- I’m very grateful and -- and so is the museum.</span> <span id="s1352">I -- I realize that it’s been difficult for you to re -- remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: It’s done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Is there -- a couple other small questions, one is did you -- or do you still receive restitution, reparations from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1356">From conference number two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: And tell me how -- you told me this before we started the interview, tell me how you came to change your name from your birth name to Nick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: During Greek wa -- during the German occupation, I couldn’t use the name Haim, so I became Nick.</span> <span id="s1359">When the whole thing finished, and all my family disappeared, the few friends that were left, they were Orthodox, and they called me Nick.</span> <span id="s1360">So when the time came to become a U.S. citizen, I deti -- decided that it was foolish for my friends to call me Nick and my name to be Haim.</span> <span id="s1361">So I changed officially my name, the day -- the day I became a citizen, to Nick.</span> <span id="s1362">And all my documents in the United States, from the Social Security, from my work, from my taxes, from everything are under the name of Nick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Okay, well, is there -- is there anything else that you would like to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: By the way, something more that is trivia, but maybe this will help explain why I use the name Nick.</span> <span id="s1365">In the old country they used to give the name Nick -- used to give the name Haim to babies so they survive.</span> <span id="s1366">I had a brother who died at the age of four.</span> <span id="s1367">So, his name was David.</span> <span id="s1368">My parents decided to put me the name Haim.</span> <span id="s1369">When the emancipation came, the Jews of Salonika, who were very much involved in French culture, decided that Haim is not such a good Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1370">Instead of giving the name Haim, let’s give the guy a name of survivor.</span> <span id="s1371">And the name they choose for all the Haims was Victor.</span> <span id="s1372">Most of the Victors are Haim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: So Victor become Nicky -- became Nick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1376">Well, thi -- but this name you ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: This you can keep off the record, I mean, I don’t want --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: It’s interesting, but this name -- but you chose Nick even much earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Be chose -- no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1380">I chose Nick [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1381">I chose Victor, and from Victor, Nick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: I-I thought Nick was from Nicholas, a Greek sort of name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Ni -- Nick -- Nicholas.</span> <span id="s1384">Nicholas in Greek means the winner of the pa -- of the people.</span> <span id="s1385">Nicos Laus.</span> <span id="s1386">Laus means people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: And -- and the brother you had, was he older?</span> <span id="s1388">It’s before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: No, he was younger than me, and he died before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: So he was older -- he -- he was older -- he was born --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: He died four years old, before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: And do you know how he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: No.</span> <span id="s1394">I know it was a sickness, I don’t know if it -- it was an epidemic or what.</span> <span id="s1395">My parents never spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Well, I want to thank you for taking the time today.</span> <span id="s1397">Is there -- is there anything at else -- at all you would like to say to conclude?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: No, not -- I haven’t got, unless you need something else.</span> <span id="s1399">I’m always available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Well, you’ve -- you’ve been wonderful, I really appreciate.</span> <span id="s1401">Thank you very much, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1403">You’re always welcome, do you feel like coming again, and we’re here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: We’re here, we feel that what we did today is to our own benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1407">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick
