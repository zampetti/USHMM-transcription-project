Regina (Goldstein) were all hidden with me during the war.</span> <span id="s13">We were all hidden by a Gentile.</span> <span id="s14">I was also in the Janowska Road Camp.</span> <span id="s15">I came from Zloczow.</span> <span id="s16">In my hometown we established a Sholom Ansky Cultural Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">I was born in 1907.</span> <span id="s18">I was nine whey my father died.</span> <span id="s19">I was a photographer in the camps.</span> <span id="s20">The Nazis ordered me to go around the camp and snap anything what I</span></p> <p><span id="s21">see.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: So what pictures did you snap, mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">HL: Mostly aktzions.</span> <span id="s24">One time Hitler visited the camp.</span> <span id="s25">People were hanging on trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">from poles.</span> <span id="s27">But this I didn’t snap for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s28">They would kill you if they found out.</span> <span id="s29">I hid it.</span> <span id="s30">You had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s31">You see, I was the last photographer in this camp.</span> <span id="s32">I snapped pictures so there should be a memory of</span></p> <p><span id="s33">what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: If you were afraid they would kill you if they caught you taking the pictures, why did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">HL: Because I saw the people with their hands and legs tied to the poles and killed them and every day the truck took them away like a piece of garbage.</span> <span id="s36">I felt if I would survive it would be a good testimony.</span> <span id="s37">We had pictures of Polish prostitutes who lived with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s38">Altogether I had maybe 530 pictures.</span> <span id="s39">They were sent to Nuremberg for the trials.</span> <span id="s40">Later the Germans sent a team to talk to me and I gave them pictures of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s41">Although they called me to be a witness, I never went.</span> <span id="s42">So we met in New York at the consulate.</span> <span id="s43">My friend told me not to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s44">He said, “They making fun of you; they don’t believe you what you say, even with the pictures.</span> <span id="s45">They confusing you, you getting meshuga (crazy).</span> <span id="s46">This was in the late fifties.</span> <span id="s47">I also sent to Wiesenthal a batch of pictures.</span> <span id="s48">When I escaped from the camp I took the pictures with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: Do you have the pictures here?</span> <span id="s50">Can I see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">HL: Yes, but not all.</span> <span id="s52">Here are some of the mass graves which we opened.</span> <span id="s53">The doctors checked them to see how old they was.</span> <span id="s54">(He spreads out the pictures and shows them to me.)</span> <span id="s55">Here’s a picture of partisans hanging.</span> <span id="s56">Here’s the last Jewish band playing at a selection.</span> <span id="s57">Here’s the machine they used to crush the bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Here are some of the officers on horses.</span> <span id="s59">Here are the barracks.</span> <span id="s60">Here’s the dog grabbing people by the throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: On what boat did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">HL: The General Muir into New York.</span> <span id="s63">My sister and brother and niece met me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">We went to Georgia Avenue in East New York.</span> <span id="s65">But rooms and work were hard to get.</span> <span id="s66">So I bought a farm in the Catskills in Woodbourne.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: Did you even meet any kapos in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">RG: I did.</span> <span id="s69">We had to go to New York on business.</span> <span id="s70">We were looking for a place to eat.</span> <span id="s71">And you know (she motions of HL) Landau.</span> <span id="s72">All of a sudden someone walks out from a store and says “Regina!”</span> <span id="s73">And he was a policeman, a militiaman.</span> <span id="s74">He had a haberdashery or clothing store on the Lower East Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">WH: He was in Janowska?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">RG: No, he was from Zloczow.</span> <span id="s77">Some people complained about him very badly but he was nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">HL: I saw him from a better position.</span> <span id="s79">He used to pull people out.</span> <span id="s80">He was walking around with an axe.</span> <span id="s81">He was opening doors where people was locked up and</span></p> <p><span id="s82">hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">RG: I didn’t have the heart to tell on him.</span> <span id="s84">You know, it’s very easy to die.</span> <span id="s85">To live with something like this on your conscience.</span> <span id="s86">I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s87">It was near Essex Street.</span> <span id="s88">His name was Yossele Landau.</span> <span id="s89">He got married and has children.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">HL: He’s still alive.</span> <span id="s91">People tell me they see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">RG: Don’t you think it’s worse to live with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: In a way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">RG: You could also talk to a Minna Lanes.</span> <span id="s95">In Europe she was married to someone not Jewish.</span> <span id="s96">Here she’s married to a Jew.</span> <span id="s97">She was hiding.</span> <span id="s98">She doesn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Usually someone doesn’t talk about something, they have something to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: What was Landau like as a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">HL: Nothing special.</span> <span id="s102">They had a candy store, they sold fruit.</span> <span id="s103">But he wouldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s104">He probably wants to forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Did you start the bungalow colony (Lewinter’s) after the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s107">I worked as a photographer for someone at the Concord for 15 years.</span> <span id="s108">I took pictures when the people came in for dinner.</span> <span id="s109">Keychains.</span> <span id="s110">I did it from 1953 to 1966.</span> <span id="s111">Then when the Quickway came, they hit my property, the bungalow colony, because I as on both sides of the road.</span> <span id="s112">So then I had a nice dollar.</span> <span id="s113">I paid $12,000 and I collected $35,000 seven years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">WH: How did the survivors in the bungalow colony who were survivors get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HL: Most were not survivors.</span> <span id="s116">The survivors hung around with each other.</span> <span id="s117">Their behavior was very bad though, very bad.</span> <span id="s118">They were rough.</span> <span id="s119">They didn’t had that social way of living.</span> <span id="s120">Some of them I refused to rent even.</span> <span id="s121">They were wise guys.</span> <span id="s122">The children didn’t behave.</span> <span id="s123">They fight with the people, arguments with the American, between them, too.</span> <span id="s124">It was a very, very bad combination.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">RG: Some of the survivors think the world owes them a living.</span> <span id="s126">It’s not the fault of the American Jew that he was suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: Do you think the average American Jew, not Roosevelt, knew what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HL: Of course he did!</span> <span id="s129">Was there any Jew in the United States which didn’t have relatives still living in Europe?</span> <span id="s130">There’s no excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: Some people didn’t want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HL: Culture, radio didn’t start with 1945.</span> <span id="s133">They knew.</span> <span id="s134">You wanna tell me at that time they was dead, they was blind, or there was no radio; there was no underground radios?</span> <span id="s135">(all this said in great anger) The world was interested in killing millions of Jews!</span> <span id="s136">We was too many: we was a cancer in the throat!</span> <span id="s137">Everybody kept quiet.</span> <span id="s138">So Truman recognized Israel in ’48.</span> <span id="s139">A big deal.</span> <span id="s140">So now you travel in Israel, you see in many places a memorial for Truman.</span> <span id="s141">He was the big hero.</span> <span id="s142">So why he didn’t convince Roosevelt we shall let in at least the ship with the children?</span> <span id="s143">He didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s144">And I heard many American Jews say in an argument with the survivors: “Why Hitler didn’t kill you all?”</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: You actually heard Jews say this or just plain Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HL: American Jews!</span> <span id="s147">What you think, I mean the Irish?</span> <span id="s148">Who cares about them?</span> <span id="s149">He’s anyway born an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s150">Yes, American Jews.</span> <span id="s151">Many times.</span> <span id="s152">And some people said we came here rich.</span> <span id="s153">Well, some of the survivors was four or five years in Europe after the war and they made some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WH: What achievement in life are you most proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">HL: I’m proud that I raised a nice family, that I can live comfortable here, and I’m proud I’m giving charity.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">WH: Aren’t you proud also of the pictures you smuggled out of the camps and that resulted in bringing attention to the Nazis’ crimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">HL: Oh yes, I’m proud of that also but you wouldn’t find me talking about that.</span> <span id="s158">I’m a man who’s not looking for coved (honors).</span> <span id="s159">I saved people.</span> <span id="s160">I got those 18 people out, I gave food to people, but this is between me and God, as well as what I sent to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s162">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0066 PAGE 4</span></p> <p><span id="s163">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
