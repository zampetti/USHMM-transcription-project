one, and this is Helen Grossman interviewing Dora Freilich about the Holocaust and her experiences.</span> <span id="s19">And this is October 24, 1984 and we are going to start with her story.</span> <span id="s20">Tell me, Dora, where you were born, the date and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A:I was born in Poland, on December 25, 1926 in a small town not far from Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q:Do you remember the name of this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q:Can you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A:Yes, P-R-U-Z-A-N-Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q:O.</span> <span id="s27">K., good.</span> <span id="s28">Tell me about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A:We were a family of four, or rather five.</span> <span id="s30">My father had a bakery and we were very well-to-do.</span> <span id="s31">Our children were brought up a very nice way.</span> <span id="s32">We played the piano, we went to good schools, we went on nice vacations, we had private teachers for Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q:These were public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A:Public schools, but we had private teachers that came after school for Hebrew and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s35">This is how we got our languages.</span> <span id="s36">It was a nice town with a lot of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q:The neighborhood was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A:The neighborhood was strictly Jewish.</span> <span id="s39">I, as a rule, did not encounter any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s40">Maybe I was too young to realize, or too young...we played together, we ate together, we visited each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q:In their homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A:In their homes.</span> <span id="s43">We came to their homes, they came to our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q:How did their parents treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A:I have not bad memories of this at all.</span> <span id="s46">Maybe it was just that age that you don’t grasp yet any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s47">We always had a maid that worked in our house because my mother worked with my father.</span> <span id="s48">And she was like with us forever and she was Gentile.</span> <span id="s49">She spoke Yiddish just like us.</span> <span id="s50">So I don’t know...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q:Was it a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A:We were not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s53">We were what you call now Conservative.</span> <span id="s54">We were closed for the holidays at our store and we belonged to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s55">Of course, the synagogue was more Orthodox than my father was.</span> <span id="s56">There were a few synagogues in the town but they were all the same, they were all Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q:Did your family go on Shabbas to the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q:You were open, the store was open, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A:Yes, we had Gentile people that worked in the store.</span> <span id="s61">A bakery is a very hard business.</span> <span id="s62">It was all done by hand, not done with machines as now, and we had Gentile people that worked for us for years and years.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q:Did your parents work at the shop on Fridays and Saturdays?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A:Usually my father did not work nights because that is when he used to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s65">He worked during the day, but on Shabbas my mother did not usually go in.</span> <span id="s66">We had Gentile people that worked in the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q:And your father went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A:My father would go in but he was never in the front.</span> <span id="s69">He used to be in the back.</span> <span id="s70">We had a very beautiful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q:Where were you in the family?</span> <span id="s72">The oldest, the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A:No, I was the second to the oldest.</span> <span id="s74">I had a sister that was a year-and-a-half older than me, and then I had a brother that was three years younger and then we had a baby that was born in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q:Oh lord, the baby lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A:The baby lived and the baby survived; it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q:Now, your life was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s78">Were there any other Jewish organizations that you belonged to besides the synagogue, before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A:Before the war, as I’m always telling my husband...I was 13 years old, and the girls belonged to the Shomer Hatzair, we belonged to the Halutz, but all of the organizations that had to do more with fun...than, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q:It was social.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A:It was social.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q:Did your family belong to any Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A:I don’t know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s84">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s85">I really did not pay attention to those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q:The school that you were in, how did the teachers treat you, the Polish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A:Absolutely good.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q:They were civilians; they weren’t people that worked for the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A:No, they were just regular teachers.</span> <span id="s90">Of course our schools were run different than the schools here.</span> <span id="s91">Homework had to be done and in the classroom you conducted yourself like a pupil.</span> <span id="s92">You conducted yourself accordingly.</span> <span id="s93">A teacher was someone you respected.</span> <span id="s94">You came prepared for school, and we had a marvelous life.</span> <span id="s95">In school we learned, and by the time we finished seven grades and here it would be like 12th grade of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q:Then how old would you be after you finished the seventh grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A:Well, we start at six.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q:And you finish at 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A:The materials that we took and the education that we got...and if you took a language you had to learn that language.</span> <span id="s100">It wasn’t just left on your roster that you take French, English, or whatever.</span> <span id="s101">You did your homework and it was taken for granted that you learned it.</span> <span id="s102">Or you were left in the grade for two or three years.</span> <span id="s103">You didn’t just go.</span> <span id="s104">You did whatever had to be done.</span> <span id="s105">I as a rule did not account for any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q:Did you meet after school?</span> <span id="s107">Was there such a thing as clubs and organizations in the school that you were allowed to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:We had a choir and we sang but everybody belonged to that.</span> <span id="s109">We had religion, and that is an interesting issue because religion was separated between the Jewish religion and the Gentile religion.</span> <span id="s110">Otherwise, when we had Jewish religion, there came a teacher from the Hebrew University and he taught us Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q:That was given each day or two or three times a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A:I would say two or three times, not every day, but two or three times during the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q:They also had their religion and you were not forced in anyway to take theirs?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A:Absolutely not, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q:How many people do you think lived in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A:I would say, before the war, about 10,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q:And of that, how many do you think were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A:I would say four or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q:Four or five thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q:Almost half.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A:We had two Jewish newspapers in the city.</span> <span id="s123">We had a lot of organizations.</span> <span id="s124">This I know even though I was not joining because I saw older, like my cousins.</span> <span id="s125">We had a Hebrew school and a Hebrew high school that was called Gymnasium, and a [unclear].</span> <span id="s126">We had a Yiddish school.</span> <span id="s127">It’s like my husband said, we had two papers but we had only one boss.</span> <span id="s128">But this was our town, very Jewish, and we lived a very normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q:Were there social events that were Jewish that you would go to, anywhere besides...the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A:That was not in style.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A:You went to the synagogue with your parents for services only.</span> <span id="s133">The synagogue did not cater to anything else except for the services.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q:The Rabbi was not somebody who was around all the time, or he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A:He was around but you came to him with problems that concerned...you know, but the children were not affiliated, there was nothing in the synagogue for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q:That was a different day...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A:As far as I can remember was 1939...I mean...that was, first of all, at 13 you are more a child there than here.</span> <span id="s138">Here you are exposed to so much more.</span> <span id="s139">You are exposed to television, you are exposed to good books, you are exposed to music, and there you are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q:Then children didn’t read newspapers, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q:Parents did.</span> <span id="s143">Did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A:My mother did and my father did but, you know, but until the news used to come, it was probably a half of year old.</span> <span id="s145">You were concerned for the things that were going on in town.</span> <span id="s146">There was a Yiddish kehilla, and eventually you had to give some money to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q:Was there a name for that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A:It would be the Pruzany kehilla.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know exactly the name as I was at the stage where those things did not interest me.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q:Did you say Prussian?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A:Pruzany.</span> <span id="s152">That was the name of the little town.</span> <span id="s153">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q:Then you weren’t aware that your parents weren’t really involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A:They would be involved to the extent that they would donate some money, but that was it.</span> <span id="s156">This is what I can remember.</span> <span id="s157">There were a lot of organizations that I know of where the youth belonged; there was Shomer Hatzair, Halutz, there was also a big organization which was not far from our house, but I can’t think of the name now.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q:You said Shomer...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q:How would you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A:Well, the way I would spell that would be...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q:S-H-O-M-E-R H-A-T-Z-A-I-R.</span> <span id="s163">Right.</span> <span id="s164">And that was an organization for youths.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q:But you didn’t belong to that, or you weren’t old enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A:I don’t think I was old enough to belong to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q:In other words, it would be for young adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A:Yes, age 17, 18 and something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q:Literally you had a good young life.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A:A wonderful young life.</span> <span id="s172">A wonderful young life.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q:With parents who were close to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A:With parents who were close to us.</span> <span id="s175">Family around us.</span> <span id="s176">Our children were very well-educated, and I had traced over 100 relatives...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q:From that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A:From that town, and many were lost, killed in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s179">The reason that we all stayed together is because family just stays together, that is all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:There was no reason to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A:There was no reason to leave.</span> <span id="s182">I had two uncles, brothers of my mother: my oldest uncle who lives here in New York, and the youngest he left four years ago, he left for Cuba but he was taken to the Israeli Army, to the Polish Army, and his brother could not take him to the United States because there was a quota going on, so he came to Cuba and when the war started in 1939 and ‘40 he brought him over to the United States and he was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q:So, he was in for how long, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A:Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q:In the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A:I think he was in for about three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q:Did he ever talk about his treatment in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A:No, he never discussed those things with him.</span> <span id="s189">He remembered us.</span> <span id="s190">I have some pictures of him as a child.</span> <span id="s191">He lived in our house as a child and my mother was his sister and I was the only survivor of that whole family.</span> <span id="s192">In Germany he started looking for me in 1945 but he couldn’t find me and he had to return to the United States with his unit, so he left a letter with a cousin of mine that he is looking for me.</span> <span id="s193">My cousin did not know at that time that I am alive but he heard from people, you know.</span> <span id="s194">We went from town to town and wherever we were we put our names down, one after another.</span> <span id="s195">You came and you stopped and you looked, and you looked and you searched for names.</span> <span id="s196">Sometimes you found nothing, but this was the procedure on how to go through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q:That was after...?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A:That was after the war.</span> <span id="s199">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q:Let’s go back to when you were young.</span> <span id="s201">When did you start to feel the effects of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A:All right.</span> <span id="s203">The war started in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q:Where were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A:I was in my hometown and I didn’t even know what war is.</span> <span id="s206">What I learned in history was that wars happened somewhere else.</span> <span id="s207">I mean what kind of war would come to us and why?</span> <span id="s208">And children were not allowed to listen in at certain things, you know; and then the war started.</span> <span id="s209">This was 1939, September, or October.</span> <span id="s210">I don’t remember the exact date, and it was a very brief encounter when the war started, nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s211">It was at that time that Germany and Russia made a pact and divided Poland in half, and our part of Poland fell unto the Russians.</span> <span id="s212">We are close to the Russian border so we fell under the Russians.</span> <span id="s213">O.K.</span> <span id="s214">They didn’t kill us.</span> <span id="s215">They had other methods.</span> <span id="s216">They took away our businesses, but they didn’t take away your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q:And they took away your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A:They took all the businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q:And you were 13 at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A:I was 13 at the time and they gave you passports.</span> <span id="s221">In other words everybody had to carry a passport.</span> <span id="s222">It’s your name, your birth, a certificate, and if your father had a business then you had a number.</span> <span id="s223">That number was very bad, otherwise: it meant that you exploited people.</span> <span id="s224">If people worked for you, then you exploited them, because in Russia, you know, everything belonged to the government.</span> <span id="s225">You worked for the government.</span> <span id="s226">Everything is taken care of.</span> <span id="s227">If people were happy working for you, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s228">You got this, was 11 they called it, number 11.</span> <span id="s229">They started reorganizing the cities, they made schools and we all went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q:You stayed in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A:We stayed in our house, except every house had to take...like they brought in a lot of soldiers and in our town...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q:Were these Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A:No, Russians.</span> <span id="s234">I hadn’t seen a German at that time yet, but they brought in a lot of Russian soldiers and I don’t know for what reason.</span> <span id="s235">I guess we had a lot of empty lots in our part of town, it wasn’t over-populated, and they stationed some airfields there, which is interesting for a small town like this.</span> <span id="s236">We went to schools, and again it started.</span> <span id="s237">Russia is very hard on teaching.</span> <span id="s238">You got to know what you are doing there, and a lot of kids that could not attend school, they had to go out and work before the war, they got to go to school now because it was free.</span> <span id="s239">In fact, they paid you.</span> <span id="s240">If you made good marks you got what they called a stipendium.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q:The government?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A:The government, absolutely.</span> <span id="s243">There are a lot of things that are not known.</span> <span id="s244">If you made good marks, they paid.</span> <span id="s245">They didn’t pay much.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q:The Jewish people were paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A:Jewish or Gentile, it didn’t matter, we all went to school again.</span> <span id="s248">The businesses were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q:How did your father earn a living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A:My father was very upset when they took.</span> <span id="s251">They let him stay for a while in the bakery because they needed bread anyway, so he was working in the bakery, which he never did before, because he inherited from his father and he was the boss.</span> <span id="s252">Now he had to go in the back and work with everybody together.</span> <span id="s253">It still did not affect our children.</span> <span id="s254">We were happy.</span> <span id="s255">I mean we had enough to eat...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q:Because he owned the store did they pay him?</span> <span id="s257">Did he have any type of an income?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A:No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q:Then how were you expected to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A:Well, we were expected to live on what we had, with no payment.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q:Were there other people put in the store with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A:Yes, there were people that were there before and some others that they chose, of their own choosing, in the store to work.</span> <span id="s263">Of course, my father was devastated, but it was done to everybody else too.</span> <span id="s264">All the stores were taken over.</span> <span id="s265">We remained in our house.</span> <span id="s266">The first time that I realized that there was something wrong...the Russians have three organizations.</span> <span id="s267">In other words, they start preparing you to be a Communist in the very early stages.</span> <span id="s268">This is their main thing.</span> <span id="s269">Otherwise as little as we were involved in political parties, this is their main aim.</span> <span id="s270">We start them very young.</span> <span id="s271">As I was 13, the name of the party was called Komsomol.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q:How would you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A:K-O-M-S-O-M-O-L.</span> <span id="s274">Now, of course, there were a lot of Jews and, for that matter, Gentiles, too, that were not rich in the town.</span> <span id="s275">Not everybody can be rich and well off and well-to-do, but I don’t think anybody went hungry to bed.</span> <span id="s276">There were a lot that came back to school that were out working at an early age, you know like quitting school at 13 or 14 and going out working as tailors and such, and making a living and helping the parents to raise the family.</span> <span id="s277">Families were big—five, six and seven children—and there was a guy, a Jewish guy, and he started organizing the girls and the boys for this party.</span> <span id="s278">The party would meet at night and they would have dances and they would talk about politics and, as children, everybody is very anxious...and he came over to me and said, “You are not going to belong,” and I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s279">I never did anything wrong.”</span> <span id="s280">And he said, “You are not going to belong because of your father’s [not clear],” and I came home crying and I said, “Because of you I cannot belong to that party, and I will be the only one that does not belong to it.”</span> <span id="s281">My father tried to explain to me but I didn’t take “No” for an answer.</span> <span id="s282">I just wanted to go where everybody else went, having a good time, singing and dancing and listening to the teachers, and to me it was interesting whatever they talked about.</span> <span id="s283">I didn’t know yet what, and I knew then that there was going to be a great big thing.</span> <span id="s284">I didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q:You said it was because of your father’s stature?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A:Right, because of my father being an owner of a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q:A number “11”.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A:A number “11”.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:That was on your passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A:It was on his passport.</span> <span id="s291">It was like you exploited people.</span> <span id="s292">People that worked for you were exploited rather than worked.</span> <span id="s293">They didn’t ask nobody how they were treated or whatever.</span> <span id="s294">This was like...So, of course, I was very upset; I was young and I wanted to know what was going on but I couldn’t belong.</span> <span id="s295">Times were starting to get rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q:You were still 13 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A:That was in 1939, ‘40.</span> <span id="s298">But we still met together, the girls and the boys, you know, and talking...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q:The parties were mixed, Jewish and Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A:The parties were mixed.</span> <span id="s301">A lot of Poles: Polish families tried to take their families and go away.</span> <span id="s302">Otherwise, people that were in the military and visited their families, government people, and they knew, you know, what the consequences might be because this is how they were going.</span> <span id="s303">First the owners of the stores, then after them...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q:Did Jewish people try to leave at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q:There was no reason yet or they didn’t understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A:No, they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s308">There was one big organization called Bund which was not acceptable at the Polish side because they were very communistically inclined.</span> <span id="s309">But it was very big.</span> <span id="s310">A lot of Jewish people belonged to it, a lot of Jewish youth, and by youth, I mean the older ones.</span> <span id="s311">When we were youths, we were 18 or 19, we were not youths at 13 or 14.</span> <span id="s312">We were children.</span> <span id="s313">This is the big difference here.</span> <span id="s314">We were children, we played with schmatte dolls and we did not take any great interest in political things.</span> <span id="s315">That was not the thing to do.</span> <span id="s316">We started looking at boys, of course, but political things did not interest us at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q:The Bund was a regular organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A:A regular organization.</span> <span id="s319">It was not allowed by the Polish, but in our town it just so happens that it was very big.</span> <span id="s320">Now the Russians did not like them either.</span> <span id="s321">They had to gather them together and they sent them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s322">It just so happens that in Siberia they didn’t get killed.</span> <span id="s323">They survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q:Did you know any of these people?</span> <span id="s325">Were they friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A:No, they were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q:But, you knew their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A:I knew their families and I knew a few families.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q:And they were young adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A:They were young adults...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Tape 1 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:This is tape one, side two.</span> <span id="s333">We are recording Dora Freilich and this is Helen Grossman doing the interviewing.</span> <span id="s334">You were talking about the Bund.</span> <span id="s335">Would you continue with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A:I knew that it was a big organization, and why I knew it is not because I belonged to it or I knew much about it, it’s just that their meeting place was two houses away from our house, and when they had the meetings, there were always disturbances there.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q:Was it in a home?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A:Yes, a private home.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q:What do you mean by disturbances?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A:You know, there was always somebody watching outside, to see if the police is not coming, I mean people that belonged to that organization because it was communistically inclined...</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q:And not really accepted by the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A:Absolutely.</span> <span id="s343">The reason that a lot of them survived is that they were taken and they were shipped to Siberia, and the miracle of being there, you know, whoever died, died there, from natural causes because conditions were bad there, too, but actually they survived because they had lived through the war not going through to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q:And there were Jews and Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A:No, Jews only.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q:Sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A:There were a lot of Christians sent, but for different reasons.</span> <span id="s348">I mean anybody that had #11 was sitting with their suitcase packed ready to be shipped.</span> <span id="s349">We were, otherwise, not a desirable element to be kept so close to a border, not knowing what was going to come.</span> <span id="s350">We were ready because we knew that we were going to be shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q:You knew that you were going to be shipped somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A:Yes, by the Russians, to Siberia, and my father said that as long as we are together we will do whatever we can to help each other and this is how life was going on.</span> <span id="s353">Times were not good anymore.</span> <span id="s354">There was not enough food and...</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q:You were getting some kind of a stipend from the government just to get decent grades, but your father wasn’t getting anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q:And you were living on what you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A:What we had, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q:Were you selling possessions at all at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A:At that time, in our family, there was enough left yet without...but people were starting doing it.</span> <span id="s361">They were trading with the peasants, material for some food, like butter or chicken or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q:Like flour?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A:Flour.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q:You had flour in the bakery.</span> <span id="s365">Couldn’t you use that?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A:Probably, he could take some out and have.</span> <span id="s367">Otherwise, in our family, as far as I can remember, there was no necessity to do that.</span> <span id="s368">Other families I knew were doing it already, otherwise there was no abundance of food anymore.</span> <span id="s369">There were no stores anymore to buy anything.</span> <span id="s370">Whatever the Russians brought in, it was...on a certain day that they told you they was going to give.</span> <span id="s371">You didn’t care what they gave, as long as they gave.</span> <span id="s372">You stood in line, and that went on through the night.</span> <span id="s373">You stood in line the whole night.</span> <span id="s374">If they were giving bread, you stood in line.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q:Did they ever give clothing, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A:No, they took everything away that they could find in Poland, because Poland was a pretty rich country.</span> <span id="s377">It was nothing compared to the United States, but it was doing its best.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q:Did the Russians come into the houses to take things?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A:No, I wouldn’t say that they came into the houses to take things.</span> <span id="s380">What they did, rather, was bring in a lot of army people and they stationed them in the private homes.</span> <span id="s381">Sometimes you benefited from it because, for instance, with us was staying a Russian pilot, a young guy, who they stationed in our house and he used to bring a lot of packages that the soldiers get and he used to bring it home.</span> <span id="s382">There was always fish and beans and things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q:Canned food?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A:Right.</span> <span id="s385">Or he used to bring like, sometimes, wood for the stove to burn.</span> <span id="s386">They got everything, and the families, as time was going on, got less and less.</span> <span id="s387">I mean you ate up what you had and you traded a little away and...there was a lot of commotion [?]</span> <span id="s388">of the government in the schools.</span> <span id="s389">The difference was that in the Polish school, politics were not discussed, not in my grade anyway.</span> <span id="s390">You learned history, and that is why I say that wars always went on somewhere else.</span> <span id="s391">There was always wars in Sweden and wars in Spain, but there...[unclear] in Russia but not in Poland.</span> <span id="s392">Why would Poland be in a war for?</span> <span id="s393">We had nothing to offer that could be taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q:Was Palestine discussed in your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A:Palestine was discussed.</span> <span id="s396">We knew a few people, like a few young people that left for Palestine.</span> <span id="s397">It was not a habit of the townspeople to do.</span> <span id="s398">In fact some families would be very upset not for the fact that they went to Palestine but for the reason that they went all together.</span> <span id="s399">Families stuck together.</span> <span id="s400">This was our survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q:When you had the Bund you had uncles and aunts around.</span> <span id="s402">Were they involved too, or were they busy trying to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A:I don’t think that none of our family, as I can picture it or remember it belonged to any of those organizations.</span> <span id="s404">Our boys, our cousins, which we had many, belonged to the Betar.</span> <span id="s405">That was Jabotinsky’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q:What is Betar?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A:An organization...</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q:How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A:B-E-I-T-A-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q:And that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A:Jabotinsky.</span> <span id="s412">He was not in our time but this was his organization.</span> <span id="s413">We had to have Palestine by fighting for it.</span> <span id="s414">They are not going to give it to us on a silver platter.</span> <span id="s415">The boys belong to this organization, all my cousins.</span> <span id="s416">I don’t know about other boys but all my cousins belong to this.</span> <span id="s417">When I think about it, my husband belonged to that organization, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q:Did you know him then?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q:Oh, you probably found out about it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A:In fact Menachem Begin married a girl that lived above my husband’s store.</span> <span id="s422">Jabotinsky was there to the wedding and before he became Prime Minister, he was always involved in politics.</span> <span id="s423">They came here.</span> <span id="s424">Many years ago they were honoring somebody, and we were invited to that dinner.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t remember where it was, but he was the main speaker there and my husband wanted to see him very much and, of course, his wife came and they lived above my husband’s shoe store.</span> <span id="s426">So, all those connections.</span> <span id="s427">That was before he became Prime Minister.</span> <span id="s428">His wife, she remembered the street, she remembered everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q:Tell me, at the time of the Bund, were poorer people, people that didn’t have enough, were any of them trying to come to the United States or to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A:Well, there were a lot of families that were getting help from the United States because they had families here.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q:Financial help?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A:Financial help got to them at that time.</span> <span id="s433">Not at the Russian time.</span> <span id="s434">Before Russia, and there were a lot of people that got a lot of financial help.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q:But they couldn’t after Russia came in and took over and Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s436">That was the end.</span> <span id="s437">Life changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A:Life changed and some people became more popular that in the Polish.</span> <span id="s439">For instance, some got very good jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q:The Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A:No, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s442">We are not talking about the Polish people.</span> <span id="s443">The Polish people were afraid; they were afraid of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q:So, the Russians really accepted the Jews at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A:Oh yes, the Russians accepted the Jews at that time.</span> <span id="s446">There were a lot of people that got high positions.</span> <span id="s447">We had a lot of very educated people.</span> <span id="s448">There were a lot of lawyers and doctors, they took over these positions.</span> <span id="s449">There was a judge, and we went to schools that were established.</span> <span id="s450">It was not war, it was just under a different government, and the difference was that in the Russian schools, politics was a big thing.</span> <span id="s451">They had a way of praising their government, theirs is the best, and you know, you brain-washed children, especially young adults.</span> <span id="s452">And the day came when they said we were going to have a fake exercise in case of something.</span> <span id="s453">They prepared the whole town, all the schools and all the shops.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q:What year do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A:That was 1941.</span> <span id="s456">I think it was the beginning of ‘41 and the end of ‘40 and the beginning of ‘41, and they taught the girls how to be nurses.</span> <span id="s457">It was a survival thing.</span> <span id="s458">You had what to do in case of an emergency.</span> <span id="s459">It wasn’t just preparations for war, you know, suppose...we were supposed to meet, like in a cemetery.</span> <span id="s460">The schools were divided, some schools were coming from one side and some from another, and we are all supposed to meet there and all of a sudden we saw planes.</span> <span id="s461">The Russians, when they see planes... Bombs started falling and they said, “Look how we are performing!”</span> <span id="s462">, but there started to be explosions and there is fire and people are falling, and that is when Germany broke the treaty with them and took over Russia.</span> <span id="s463">They started advancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q:And took over your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A:Our town was not the only thing.</span> <span id="s466">Divided in half... And people started running.</span> <span id="s467">The chaos was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s468">We didn’t know what was happening, but we saw that there was casualties already laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s469">Our parents were running [not clear]... And the Germans came in, moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q:They marched in, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A:They marched in.</span> <span id="s472">Like I said before, why they made an airfield in our town, because we had a lot of ground.</span> <span id="s473">They had prepared it to such an extent that all the airplanes, every part like when you teach a pilot, the mechanics...the planes were all taken apart...That was all German thinking.</span> <span id="s474">Otherwise, they could not lift themselves up and fly away, whichever we could save.</span> <span id="s475">Everything was standing there on the ground.</span> <span id="s476">The chaos was unbelievable because right in our town was a lot of Russian families.</span> <span id="s477">There was a government going on, so they brought them in.</span> <span id="s478">They were working and whoever could, tried to cross the border and go into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q:Were the Jewish people trying to escape to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A:First the Russians, but the Jews started, too, because they knew.</span> <span id="s481">At the time when they divided Russia, and I will tell you just an incident of my own, not the thinking of anybody else.</span> <span id="s482">My mother had a sister living in a town in Lodz, which was called Litmannstadt by the Germans.</span> <span id="s483">Her town fell into Germany right away in 1939.</span> <span id="s484">Little things used to trickle down here and there.</span> <span id="s485">People used to tell stories about what the Germans were doing.</span> <span id="s486">Nobody believed this.</span> <span id="s487">I mean “Why?”</span> <span id="s488">One night, we were still sitting in our home town, by the Russians, and somebody knocked on the door and a guy came in.</span> <span id="s489">He was in his late 30’s and he had our address, our name, and he said that he came to give us regards from my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s490">He came into the house and he told us that he was going out with my cousin, and he told us stories about what is going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s491">We were sitting around the table in the kitchen and my parents made us go out, because children don’t listen to stories like this.</span> <span id="s492">Everybody looked at him and said that he is crazy.</span> <span id="s493">I mean he told the real stuff about what is going on.</span> <span id="s494">He said that they just took people out and hung them in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s495">They shot them in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s496">They went into the families and just shot everybody at random.</span> <span id="s497">They threw children out of the windows; and everybody looked at him and said he is crazy.</span> <span id="s498">He is absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s499">Why would people do things like this?</span> <span id="s500">So, we were not allowed to hear this.</span> <span id="s501">He stayed for a couple of days and then he moved on.</span> <span id="s502">He was all by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q:Where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A:He wanted to go across the border and go deep into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q:He thought he would be safer there?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A:Yes, because he already went through what was waiting for us now, but we did not believe him.</span> <span id="s507">Now the Germans came in and times started getting very rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q:What happened to the two soldiers living with you in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A:They ran away as soon as the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s510">Whether they survived or not I don’t even know, but whatever was moving...They tried to get on trucks; they tried to get 1,000 people on one truck hanging from all sides just to get out.</span> <span id="s511">They wanted to go back into Russia, and this is when the real thing was starting.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q:This was 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A:1941, the beginning of 1941.</span> <span id="s514">As we know now, the Germans was occupying, going, and their destruction was against the Jews.</span> <span id="s515">Their main obstacle, their main thing was to destroy the Jews, so they started right away.</span> <span id="s516">For a while they let us live in our own home, then they started making the ghettos.</span> <span id="s517">We lived for about six months, I would say, in our own house and then we were forced to go into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q:How far away was the ghetto from your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A:Within walking distance, but you were not allowed to go back to your house.</span> <span id="s520">Your house was then occupied by Gentile people who took over your house.</span> <span id="s521">They would take over everything, not only were you not allowed to take a certain amount.</span> <span id="s522">You couldn’t, there was nowhere to put anything.</span> <span id="s523">We lived in one room, a family of...At that time we already had the baby.</span> <span id="s524">The baby was already born, so we were already six people and we lived in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q:With whatever you could carry?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A:Yes, with whatever we could carry and, first of all, the elders of the town got together and made a Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q:How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A:J-U-D-E-N-R-A-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q:And that was an organization...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A:It took care of the needs of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q:Of the Jews.</span> <span id="s532">Needs of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A:It’s of the Germans not of the Jews.</span> <span id="s534">If they needed 204 coats, it had to be delivered to them, but instead of going to the houses, they had to be delivered to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s535">Otherwise...everything to appease them.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q:In other words, this was a German or Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A:Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q:To appease?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A:To appease and to keep order, you know.</span> <span id="s540">It just so happened that our little town, somehow, I don’t know by what miracle, kept on going.</span> <span id="s541">They brought in a lot of people from adjoining little towns of Jews to our ghetto.</span> <span id="s542">It was already the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q:It was just one ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A:One ghetto, and we had to accommodate them all.</span> <span id="s545">Sometimes we lived four and five families in one room.</span> <span id="s546">Sicknesses and lack of food was great but we still were together and that made up, you know, for other things.</span> <span id="s547">At that time I was already, like 15, and we organized clubs, but with no names, just get together.</span> <span id="s548">We used to sing, we used to read poetry, we met a lot of people from other towns, like...you know, in my time, you didn’t travel that much, you knew the people from your town and this is how it went.</span> <span id="s549">When other young people come and they bring other ideas and different songs and different things.</span> <span id="s550">We made a cultural club and we used to like to tell little plays.</span> <span id="s551">We were already getting to that stage where we were not children anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q:Young adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A:Adults.</span> <span id="s554">We already knew the situation was not good, and everyday the Judenrat had to prepare an amount of people that went to work.</span> <span id="s555">That was taken care through them.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q:They would go to the factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A:They would go to the homes.</span> <span id="s558">For instance, my father was a very tall man.</span> <span id="s559">A tall man at any job took a certain kind of a beating or licking or whatever it is, so me and my sister used to go instead of him, if we could, and at that time we still could.</span> <span id="s560">Our job was to knit, and we knitted gloves and socks and knit hats for the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q:Knit helmets?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A:Right, so if we could spare my father not to go out to work, which was always outside work, like building or whatever it was, and this is how our ghetto existed.</span> <span id="s563">It wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s564">It was bad, but there was a lot of hope, an awful lot of hope.</span> <span id="s565">It was this and the closeness of the families, I think, to stay with the family together, why so many of our people were killed.</span> <span id="s566">Because, if, for instance, the parents and the children...if the children would not care so much for the parents and save their own lives, they would run away, which some people did, but very little.</span> <span id="s567">The family came first.</span> <span id="s568">If you had an older son and four little children and the son came to the father and said, “Dad, they are running away to the forest.</span> <span id="s569">You see what is going on, you hear the stories,” and he said, “Now, you are going to leave me, with a family?”</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q:But how could he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A:He stayed, he didn’t go, he stayed with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q:What chances did the people who ran for the forest have?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A:Some survived, some did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q:As far as when the Germans would find you, did you see anything that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A:When they found them from the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q:Either in the forest or in the towns or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A:First of all, they took out the first of what they called the Aktions.</span> <span id="s578">They took out 16 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q:What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A:It means first group of Jews.</span> <span id="s581">For no reason at all, but they were like...maybe in jobs they thought could damage them or anything like it.</span> <span id="s582">They took them out and they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q:How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A:A-K-C-J-A.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t really know...It is hard to spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q:O.</span> <span id="s587">K., go ahead.</span> <span id="s588">You said they would take the...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A:They took out 15 Jews from our town and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q:Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A:I for one did not see it, but one of my oldest cousins was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q:And they shot him?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A:They shot him in the middle of the market place.</span> <span id="s594">Started circulating why.</span> <span id="s595">Some said because they belonged to the Bund.</span> <span id="s596">Some said they belonged to another organization.</span> <span id="s597">Otherwise they were not the proper people.</span> <span id="s598">They could stir some problems or trouble.</span> <span id="s599">Then we knew before, but we knew right then that the situation is getting worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q:What did they do with the bodies?</span> <span id="s601">Did they bury them?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A:They buried them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q:Did the Germans bury them?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A:No, the Jews buried them.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q:Right there in the middle of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A:Not in the middle of town.</span> <span id="s607">They buried them in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s608">Then the population in our town started swelling tremendously because they brought in from all around, and we thought that really we would survive then.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q:More Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A:Yes, they had liquidated almost all of the ghettos surrounding our town.</span> <span id="s611">All the little towns, and whoever could make it.</span> <span id="s612">Some were walking for two days and nights.</span> <span id="s613">Whoever died on the way, that’s...The Judenrat waited for them and tried to accommodate them, find them a place where to sleep, eat and some clothing, and I always heard people talking that we are going to be the only town that survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q:So they would all be taken into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A:All to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q:But, the ghetto’s walls were still the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A:Still the same, and the sicknesses were great because there were no medicines, and because there is less food, the more sicknesses.</span> <span id="s618">But still the families were going on.</span> <span id="s619">A family is a tremendous strength.</span> <span id="s620">My father was the youngest, I think, of eight or nine children and everybody used to say, “You are so young, why didn’t you...” Tape 2 of 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q:This is tape two, side one and we are taping Dora Freilich and this is Helen Grossman interviewing.</span> <span id="s622">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A:And so we knew that there are some young people running away to the forest, and my father says, “Just suppose I go and I survive, what good is it going to do me?</span> <span id="s624">I have a family, I have four children.</span> <span id="s625">What is my life without them and without my wife?</span> <span id="s626">I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s627">If we go, we go all together.</span> <span id="s628">Second, we are going to survive because we have a lot of help.”</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q:Did you have relatives around, too, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A:We all lived in one house.</span> <span id="s631">My uncle...I had one cousin who is now in New York, they had a very big rooming house.</span> <span id="s632">I think it was the biggest rooming-house in the city for that matter, because the Hebrew University and the Hebrew School was in the adjoining building which belonged also to my uncle.</span> <span id="s633">They used to say that he was the richest man in town.</span> <span id="s634">And they had a special name that they called him but I forget.</span> <span id="s635">Because, as it is here, you wanted to be like everybody else.</span> <span id="s636">You didn’t want to be the richest but you wanted to have better things, maybe, but there was a certain thing that my mother always used to tell me.</span> <span id="s637">“Always say that you are older,” because we were big children.</span> <span id="s638">I guess it comes from better eating, better living conditions.</span> <span id="s639">I was a big girl, because I am a big woman for a European woman, you know.</span> <span id="s640">Now they are bigger, but years ago they were smaller.</span> <span id="s641">My mother used to say, “When they ask you, say that you are seven,” and I would say, “Mommy, I am only five,” and she would say, “Say that you are seven.”</span> <span id="s642">We had bicycles, which not everybody had.</span> <span id="s643">I don’t know, maybe 10 or 15 families.</span> <span id="s644">There was a bicycle for a girl and a bicycle for a boy.</span> <span id="s645">We had two bicycles.</span> <span id="s646">My father used to say, “Ah, don’t go...[Yiddish].”</span> <span id="s647">That was “the evil eye.”</span> <span id="s648">We were big children.</span> <span id="s649">We were well taken care of, we were very well dressed.</span> <span id="s650">So, we go together or we stay together.</span> <span id="s651">It’s one or the other.</span> <span id="s652">This was, I guess, a Jewish concept, a family concept, and I guess that is why I have seen and read it in many books that the families being so close-knit together, which helped in one way and hurt in another way.</span> <span id="s653">Our great hope and our great bond with the family made us...gave us so much more hope.</span> <span id="s654">That is why we were killed because we went together.</span> <span id="s655">Always hoping that it couldn’t be bad there.</span> <span id="s656">The war between the Russians and the Germans was going strong.</span> <span id="s657">Poland was nothing to occupy.</span> <span id="s658">They went right through and left the people...and they were going deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s659">Now the worst, the war was going for them, the worst we got it in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s660">One reflected on the other.</span> <span id="s661">In 1942, at the end of 1942, there was a group of boys that had run away to the forest.</span> <span id="s662">I didn’t know them and they came into the Judenrat to help them raise money for ammunition, because otherwise you are not accepted.</span> <span id="s663">You must present a piece, a revolver, anything, because even in the forest there is always...you know, you are not accepted unless you have some ammunition with you.</span> <span id="s664">The rumor goes, although it is not a rumor anymore, because we had just had a book published and I read some stories that I did not know about my town, which is very interesting to me to read about it.</span> <span id="s665">The rumor has it that those boys were caught by two German officials that came in at the same time to the Judenrat to ask for silver or some extra boots or some extra linen, etc. etc. etc., and they saw them there and they thought that the Judenrat and the boys are connected, which may be in some way they were but not to an extent to do something wrong to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s666">Otherwise, the Judenrat took care of the ghetto as much as they could, providing them with jobs, with food, providing them with lodging, trying to accommodate for all those people that were brought into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s667">And this was the moment that they...they were wearing uniforms, Russian uniforms, German, or whatever they could find in the pile and this is, they say, when it started.</span> <span id="s668">They accused the Judenrat of being an accomplice and supporting the Jews in the forest, and so they surrounded the ghetto with German soldiers.</span> <span id="s669">Now we had a guy that worked in our bakery for as long as I can remember.</span> <span id="s670">At that time—I am already going on 16—we still had a little baby, and the ghetto was fenced in but not on all sides.</span> <span id="s671">There was some creeks running through...and this guy that worked for my father for so many years came and through somebody said, “Let me have the baby, let me take the baby to my village.”</span> <span id="s672">She was blond; we were all dark hair but that baby was blond.</span> <span id="s673">“I don’t know what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s674">The rumors are bad what we are hearing.”</span> <span id="s675">So they were afraid, too.</span> <span id="s676">They were not killing them.</span> <span id="s677">“Let me have the baby.”</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q:This was a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A:We debated about it and we decided to give him the baby.</span> <span id="s680">After two days the guards from the fences were taken away and we thought the Judenrat would take care of everything again.</span> <span id="s681">We will work, we’ll struggle, we’ll die, we won’t have any food, we won’t have any heat, but we will still have each other.</span> <span id="s682">So we started looking at each other and my father said, “We want to bring the baby back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q:This was the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A:No, this was more than the second day.</span> <span id="s685">She was already there a week, and he said, “Why should we tear apart a family?</span> <span id="s686">Let’s get together again,” and we gave him notice that we want to get the baby back.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q:How did you get the message to him?</span> <span id="s688">Could you leave the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A:No, through trading on the side with the peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q:You sent a message?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A:Right, and he begged us not to take the baby back, to leave the baby with him, with his family.</span> <span id="s692">He had a family I think of seven children and he said, “One more, let it be there.”</span> <span id="s693">I told this to my children when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s694">I don’t know if I should mix these two things together but it is interesting.</span> <span id="s695">Always when we used to go for a ride in the car we used to sing a song about a mother that gives her child away.</span> <span id="s696">It’s a Yiddish song and every time we used to go in a car, my son would say, “Mommy let’s sing that song,” because the mother gives the baby away to a Christian family and they look out the window.</span> <span id="s697">They are two blond girls and that little baby boy, a little boy with black hair and black eyes, and the baby is crying.</span> <span id="s698">In the words in the song, “I want to go with you, I don’t want to stay here,” but she is begging them to take care of the baby because I cannot take care of him anymore and that is why I want him to live.</span> <span id="s699">So every time we got in the car my son used to say to me, “Mommy let’s sing that song.”</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q:And what happened with your...?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A:So he brought the baby back.</span> <span id="s702">The baby at that time was a year-and-a-half, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q:It must have been very hard for your mother to give up the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A:Well, we were there in the ghetto already for a long time, and we saw what was going on and the situation was deteriorating and the situation of catching the boys in the Judenrat...We knew, we started to, like everybody woke up or something.</span> <span id="s705">“What can we do?”</span> <span id="s706">There was nothing that could be done.</span> <span id="s707">You could not fight the Germans; you also did not have the Polish Gentile population with you.</span> <span id="s708">They were just like the Germans and worse.</span> <span id="s709">So, the story that we didn’t fight back.</span> <span id="s710">How can you?</span> <span id="s711">If you are surrounded on all four sides by enemies shooting from all four sides at you, what can you do?</span> <span id="s712">So one morning, the Judenrat announced...and...it’s about two weeks since the found boys in the Judenrat and the evacuation of our town.</span> <span id="s713">We lived in a small town, so we don’t have a big train.</span> <span id="s714">We had a small train.</span> <span id="s715">They called it...it took you to the train that went from big city to big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q:Was the whole ghetto empty?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A:The whole ghetto was empty.</span> <span id="s718">They took off on sleds.</span> <span id="s719">It was in January, bitter cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q:In 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A:The end of 1942, the beginning of 1943.</span> <span id="s722">The peasants were ordered to come with the sleds.</span> <span id="s723">They told us to pack whatever we can take with us, the necessities, and on the sleds we were taken to the train.</span> <span id="s724">Now in a little town and when you are in business you know a lot of people that you deal with and they said, “The rumors.”</span> <span id="s725">The Gentile people that knew my father said that the rumors that are coming through are unbearable.</span> <span id="s726">“They say that they are killing the Jews all over.</span> <span id="s727">Where they are taking them?”</span> <span id="s728">We don’t know; we don’t have papers and they took our radios.</span> <span id="s729">We didn’t have nothing, and my father said that he doesn’t want to listen to this.</span> <span id="s730">He is going with the family together and this is it and we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q:How long of a ride on the sled?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A:On the sled the ride was not too long.</span> <span id="s733">It was like, I was, say, mostly standing and when there was everybody...and lame people and sick people...</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q:The whole ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A:The whole ghetto, and then they took us on the trains.</span> <span id="s736">It was like a seven-mile ride by sled.</span> <span id="s737">It’s two hours, three hours, and then they put us on the train in cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q:Your family was still together in the cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A:Together and on every cattle car there was two Germans on both sides.</span> <span id="s740">At that time everybody started looking for ways of surviving and everybody started hollering at my father.</span> <span id="s741">“Do something, do something.”</span> <span id="s742">So, he looked at us, four small children.</span> <span id="s743">He jumped out of the train and he got killed.</span> <span id="s744">He jumped and he said before he jumped to us, “If we ever stay alive, we will meet back in our town.”</span> <span id="s745">And he jumped.</span> <span id="s746">I was, I think, 15, my sister was 17, my brother was 13 and the baby was two.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q:When he did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q:And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A:My mother was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q:Was he trying to get away?</span> <span id="s752">Was that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A:There was a lot of pressure.</span> <span id="s754">We were going through little towns.</span> <span id="s755">It was [not clear] even like this.</span> <span id="s756">It was in the ghetto, and the town was evacuated in three days.</span> <span id="s757">There was not enough left to take everybody, so they took, for the time being...A lot of people in the ghetto built bunkers and they were hiding.</span> <span id="s758">Now, I think that we had built the biggest bunker in town.</span> <span id="s759">Of course nobody survived in that bunker because the dogs would come and sniff you, that was it.</span> <span id="s760">So by the time they started to take us away, my uncle said to my father, “You are so young, you are not even 40.</span> <span id="s761">Do something.”</span> <span id="s762">This was the tragic thing in our family.</span> <span id="s763">My mother and my brother and the little baby went on the third transport, and my father took me and my sister and three of my cousins and my uncle and we hid in the bunker for two nights thinking that we are going to survive.</span> <span id="s764">When we saw that we cannot do it, that we have not enough food, we don’t have lights, and we returned back to our houses and we packed up everything that we had to take along for the baby.</span> <span id="s765">Cookies, sugar, things that were very precious to us and...</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q:Any kind of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A:Any kind of food.</span> <span id="s768">Food was very important.</span> <span id="s769">That was the main thing of survival and we went with the fourth transport.</span> <span id="s770">It was the fourth day, we went.</span> <span id="s771">Actually my father had only me and my sister.</span> <span id="s772">He gave us some money and he said, “Do your best.</span> <span id="s773">You will meet your mother and the children there, because we are all going to a working camp, so we are going to meet the mother and the two children.”</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q:Did you know which camp you were going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A:No.</span> <span id="s776">As we were passing by—I think it was not far from Warsaw, which was very far from our town—they could see through the little windows people working outside, laying the track and they knew how many people went through here and nobody comes back and they were showing that we are all going to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q:You just drew your hand across your neck and that was the motion that they used?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s779">Those people, the repair people showed you where you were going.</span> <span id="s780">Because the train was full, so my father decided...I don’t know like something goes through your mind, like suicide.</span> <span id="s781">You plan on it but you never think that you are going to do it if you are suicidal.</span> <span id="s782">And he jumped out.</span> <span id="s783">I returned home in 1945, I went back to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q:Let’s go back.</span> <span id="s785">Let’s finish with that.</span> <span id="s786">After your father jumped, the train was moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A:It was constantly moving.</span> <span id="s788">There were two more people that jumped from the same cattle car.</span> <span id="s789">From ours; there were others that jumped from other cars too.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q:When they jumped, I guess they were shot right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A:They were shot but we didn’t think that he was shot, but in the long run we have never found him and nobody has seen him in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s792">I have looked for him all over.</span> <span id="s793">I have returned back home for that reason.</span> <span id="s794">So, he was shot probably on the spot.</span> <span id="s795">There is one guy that jumped from the same cattle car that is alive.</span> <span id="s796">But as the train goes, they jumped from both sides.</span> <span id="s797">He obviously jumped from the side that was closer to the forest.</span> <span id="s798">That all has a bearing, every little thing, and he could run right away into the forest; he is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q:How long did that train trip last, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A:The train trip lasted, I think, it was two or three days.</span> <span id="s801">Three nights and three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q:Any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s804">People were just dying in the train and it was standing room only.</span> <span id="s805">You made where you stood, there was nothing to drink and nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s806">Crying and suffering was unbelievable, and there was nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s807">You go, so whoever dies, dies, and you stand right next to them.</span> <span id="s808">It was me and my sister and 100 other people, neighbors, friends, you know, people that you spent a lifetime together with, that you spent your youth with, teachers that you have been afraid of at one time now are together with you in the car.</span> <span id="s809">And then we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s810">And that ride on the train, I have put in a special category.</span> <span id="s811">It took me months until I could get myself together and imagine and put it on paper, that ride on the train.</span> <span id="s812">And then we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s813">We didn’t know what Auschwitz is.</span> <span id="s814">Lights.</span> <span id="s815">Opening of the doors of the cattle cars and everything dead or alive, everything is falling out.</span> <span id="s816">From 100 I don’t know if there were 40 survivors in our car, and every car the same thing, and there were maybe 40 cattle cars together.</span> <span id="s817">We see from far away, we see smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q:This was 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A:That was 1943 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q:Oh, ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A:January, 1943.</span> <span id="s822">We are already in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s823">In 1942 and the end of ‘41 we were in the ghetto and the end of ‘42 is when we started to see that something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s824">They surrounded the ghetto and they go away again and this is when a lot of young people run away, young men.</span> <span id="s825">And that’s where we met the famous Dr. Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q:In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A:At Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s828">I don’t know if he was at every oncoming train.</span> <span id="s829">But he was at ours.</span> <span id="s830">At that time we didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s831">It was left or right, left or right.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q:Were they separating you, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A:You had to pass by...like they were standing four military men and subconsciously you somehow realized that they are looking for something.</span> <span id="s834">They are not looking for the lame people and they are not looking for the sick people; they are looking for the stronger ones that are still walking.</span> <span id="s835">So right away, your mind starts working and...I don’t know, I never figured it out, but at the moment when you see death before your eyes, your desire to live is so great, that you try right away to do something about it.</span> <span id="s836">You straighten up and it is like an animal instinct.</span> <span id="s837">I don’t know what it is, but this is what it is.</span> <span id="s838">Me and my sister fall into a lane that goes into the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q:She felt it, too, and she straightened up, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s841">At that time it was probably that they emptied out Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s842">They used to empty it every couple of months, because in ‘43 there were people there from four years before; so, every time besides the dead ones that died on the inside, they used to come and empty because they needed new arrivals.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q:They needed the space.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A:They needed new strength to work, and that was the time when we were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q:You said that Dr. Mengele was right there?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A:Dr. Mengele was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q:You didn’t know who he was, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A:No.</span> <span id="s849">As a rule, from our city there was a big amount of people that survived.</span> <span id="s850">We always come together for the last 40 years and always talk about it.</span> <span id="s851">We have our Yiskor meeting which is conducted in New York, and of course there are few left.</span> <span id="s852">It gets less and less.</span> <span id="s853">People die of old age.</span> <span id="s854">But again, they took care on each other, as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q:Like an extended family.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A:It was like something caring for each other, and this is where I come in again in that book about things which I did not know existed, that some people could get some medication...We used to get a lot of diarrhea.</span> <span id="s857">We were separated; men and women were not together.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q:In the bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A:There was two separate concentration camps.</span> <span id="s860">One for the men and one for the women.</span> <span id="s861">A German soldier would not touch us so there were very few rapes.</span> <span id="s862">This is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q:I thought that it was the other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q:No.</span> <span id="s866">They were not allowed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A:They were not allowed.</span> <span id="s868">Also, Jewish people were worse than dogs.</span> <span id="s869">I mean this was the lowest, so you didn’t have to touch the lowest.</span> <span id="s870">There were a lot of Gentile people in the concentration camps that came for different reasons.</span> <span id="s871">There were political, and some were criminal.</span> <span id="s872">Hard, hard criminals.</span> <span id="s873">They were the ones taking care of us.</span> <span id="s874">So we came into the concentration camp, and Poland has a very severe winter.</span> <span id="s875">I mean we get winter in September and it stays till April.</span> <span id="s876">Auschwitz is a town in Silesia.</span> <span id="s877">It has a very long winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q:How do you spell the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A:Auschwitz is the main concentration camp, in Polish Oswiecim.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q:Spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A:That was in Polish.</span> <span id="s882">But it’s known as Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s883">Auschwitz is the main concentration camp.</span> <span id="s884">We are in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q:What is Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A:No, that’s not the town.</span> <span id="s887">This is what they called the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s888">That belongs to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Tape 2 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q:This is tape two, side two and this is Dora Freilich being interviewed by Helen Grossman.</span> <span id="s891">Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A:Now we are in Birkenau in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s893">We are taken—the girls, separate, the men, separate, rather the women, separate, and the men, separate, and we are marched into the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q:Let me go back to one place.</span> <span id="s895">When you said that the people were divided, those who went to the concentration camp and the rest went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A:Straight to the crematory.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q:Now let’s go back to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A:All the old, all the young, all the children...everything...</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q:Children, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A:Babies, children.</span> <span id="s901">There was such incidents...When I say that the will to live is so strong, that mothers have thrown away their children...given [not clear] young mothers...when they realize in this moment that this is the game that is going to be here...and we are marched into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s902">It is all fenced in with electrical wire fencing and there is an entrance and above the entrance there is a saying, “Arbeit macht frei”—work makes you free.</span> <span id="s903">Although we are...I am already 16 years old, still you cannot believe that there would be a people, a nation that would want to kill another, for what?</span> <span id="s904">There has got to be a reason, but there was no reason.</span> <span id="s905">It was only because we were born Jewish.</span> <span id="s906">We are taken into a barracks which is called a [not clear]...to give us the protection and...[long pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q:Were the Jews and the Christians mixed up at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A:This is strictly Jews only at this point.</span> <span id="s909">From the ghetto on the train, this was strictly Jews.</span> <span id="s910">Whatever we found, whoever we met as Gentiles, were brought to the concentration camp at different times for different reasons.</span> <span id="s911">For stealing, for robbing, for political, for all kinds.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q:And your barracks were all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A:The barracks were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s914">The ones who were taking care of us, the overseers, were the hardened criminals that were Germans.</span> <span id="s915">Now they had the power over us.</span> <span id="s916">The ones that had already been here for years and years in the concentration camp, sent there for different reasons, they were now over us.</span> <span id="s917">Now we come into that place and we go through...First they shave our heads, then they shave our armpits and our private places with dull razors, and then comes the tattooing of the numbers, and we look at each other like, “What is going on?”</span> <span id="s918">It’s like masses coming, one after the other, and we hear a voice which I also put in writing, “It’s better than taking the heavenly express.”</span> <span id="s919">You still have a little time on your hands.</span> <span id="s920">One thing, try to keep yourself as healthy as you can under those conditions and maybe you will survive.</span> <span id="s921">And Auschwitz is not [unclear].</span> <span id="s922">Now this is the worst.</span> <span id="s923">I don’t even have words.</span> <span id="s924">I don’t even know a people that have ever done anything so brutal as was done in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s925">The burning, the killing...</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q:Of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A:Of the people.</span> <span id="s928">Here we are all young females.</span> <span id="s929">It is strictly females.</span> <span id="s930">I am talking about my concentration camp where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q:You are talking about burning there in front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A:In front of us.</span> <span id="s933">The crematoriums are in this sense that we can see.</span> <span id="s934">This never stops for one minute.</span> <span id="s935">The clouds of smoke go up constantly, and if that cannot do it well enough, they take out the corpses and they stack them up and they put them on fire.</span> <span id="s936">And this is all done...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q:In front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A:In front of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q:You were forced to watch this?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A:No, we were not forced to watch this specific thing, but we cannot avoid it.</span> <span id="s941">You see it.</span> <span id="s942">It is going on day and night until Eichmann shows up in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q:Did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A:I have seen him.</span> <span id="s945">I did not see him personally.</span> <span id="s946">We knew...there are always rumors coming around to the camp when some very big official came.</span> <span id="s947">He came with a big proposition that Jewish people are not getting killed...fast enough.</span> <span id="s948">The process is too slow and he looked in.</span> <span id="s949">We were told then...about it after the war by people that worked in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s950">You know people had to work at it, too.</span> <span id="s951">They kept them for only a certain time, mostly men worked at it.</span> <span id="s952">No women.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q:Jewish men?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A:Jewish men.</span> <span id="s955">Jewish and Gentile, I guess.</span> <span id="s956">Mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s957">They had to shove them into the showers, supposedly.</span> <span id="s958">And they kept them for a certain time, those people, the Jewish people that worked on them and then they killed them.</span> <span id="s959">Otherwise...if anything happened, they should never...They thought they could catch it in time that nothing will come out how this was functioning.</span> <span id="s960">Well, at that time there were rumors that Eichmann came into the camp and that he was a very high official and he has a certain method that is going to speed up the killing of the Jews.</span> <span id="s961">And he brought in the X..</span> <span id="s962">.</span> <span id="s963">whatever it was called, that zyklon, that killed the people in less than four minutes.</span> <span id="s964">The majority was killed, the majority was gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q:The zyklon was the gas?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A:This was a better method.</span> <span id="s967">It was a stronger gas and it was doing a better job.</span> <span id="s968">Well, a lot of people were still alive because they gave you just a certain amount of time, five minutes, and then if you dropped dead, you are dead, and if you are not, you are going to burn anyway.</span> <span id="s969">If people was still there, you had to burn them.</span> <span id="s970">Where do you dispose of so many bodies?</span> <span id="s971">There were millions and millions of bodies.</span> <span id="s972">[long pause] Well, life in Birkenau...I don’t have words to describe it.</span> <span id="s973">I don’t know why I survived it; I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q:What was it like, in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A:We got up about four in the morning.</span> <span id="s976">They woke us up, and we stood in front of our barracks, five in a row.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q:How many people would you say, 20, 30, 40?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A:In the barracks, there were a couple of hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q:Five in a row.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A:Five in a row.</span> <span id="s981">We stood until there was a little bit of light coming through.</span> <span id="s982">They counted us constantly.</span> <span id="s983">One thing that the Germans said [had?]</span> <span id="s984">dead or alive, the number must be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q:If somebody died during the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A:Not some, but many.</span> <span id="s987">You brought them all out and you piled them up in front of the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q:Everybody would carry out the dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A:Everybody would carry out the dead and put them in front of the barracks and that is how they were counted.</span> <span id="s990">Dead or alive.</span> <span id="s991">If from work, we used to carry them with us, and if one of those...This was after being already about seven months in Birkenau, and the girls were dying left and right.</span> <span id="s992">Sickness.</span> <span id="s993">No food.</span> <span id="s994">Lice.</span> <span id="s995">The lice ate us up alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q:There was no chance for any kind of washing, or bathroom facilities, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A:This was a hole and they only give you only this much time in the “bathroom.”</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q:That was the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A:This was the hole and they only give you this much time in the “bathroom” for everybody together; finished or unfinished, you go.</span> <span id="s1000">The ground in Birkenau is lime and you sink into it.</span> <span id="s1001">You just sink into it, and in the wintertime with the wooden shoes, if you get stuck into it and you can’t get out you die right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q:Like cement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A:Like diluted cement.</span> <span id="s1004">I don’t know what you call it here.</span> <span id="s1005">This is the kind of ground it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q:It was probably lime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A:It was lime.</span> <span id="s1008">But the snow and the rain and everything together diluted and you get mud, and if you go with your wooden shoes and you get stuck, then you can’t pull it out.</span> <span id="s1009">Everyone went down to the weight of, I don’t know, 40 or 45 pounds and every day there was less and less girls.</span> <span id="s1010">Every day we walked to work and our work consisted of doing a lot of nothing but heavy work.</span> <span id="s1011">We took...we built highways.</span> <span id="s1012">We carried heavy stones, gravel, everything that had to do with building construction.</span> <span id="s1013">No matter how many we walked out with in the morning, we had to bring everyone back with us into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q:Was there any food in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A:In the morning there was just black coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q:And then, I am sure, at mid-day there wasn’t any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A:Mid-day they used to bring soup, and this is where the accident with my...it wasn’t an accident.</span> <span id="s1018">My sister was with me and we walked out this morning to a commander to work.</span> <span id="s1019">Approximately...the rumors get around...sometimes there is someone who is a little better...a little bit more hard5 even in a German, who would leave the girls alone.</span> <span id="s1020">You know, let them work but at least she wouldn’t beat us while we were working, because the working and the beating was unbearable, and somehow we could not get into that unit.</span> <span id="s1021">The running...the commotion in the morning was so great because everybody wanted to run to the unit that they thought was better.</span> <span id="s1022">So right there in the...you got killed, you got shot.</span> <span id="s1023">The Lagerstrasse, the street where you walked out, you had to parade.</span> <span id="s1024">Every morning.</span> <span id="s1025">When you walked, the orchestra played.</span> <span id="s1026">They were the best players there in white suits playing songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q:Men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q:How big of an orchestra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A:I would say about 30 or 40 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q:Were they Jewish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q:They were chosen probably because they were from symphonies themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1035">Like “Playing for Time.”</span> <span id="s1036">She [Fanya Fenelon] was playing in that orchestra.</span> <span id="s1037">And then when we marched to work, we had to sing.</span> <span id="s1038">We had to sing German songs.</span> <span id="s1039">For not singing, and for not keeping up, you could be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1040">So here we marched on the highway and people are going back and forth and seeing a crowd of very happy girls going to work, singing loud and clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q:Civilians would see you marching, passing by, and they would know you are from a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A:They would know that we come from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1043">They knew...They saw the smoke that was going for miles and miles and yet after the war everybody said that they didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q:I heard it constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A:Now, this one time we could not get into a unit that was halfway decent, what we called the [not clear].</span> <span id="s1046">You worked but you didn’t get beat up.</span> <span id="s1047">And we fell into that unit when we walked out with four Germans and six German shepherds.</span> <span id="s1048">This is how the unit worked out, 200 girls; and we came to a place where we had to carry mud.</span> <span id="s1049">We put our coats, whatever we had, with the buttons in the back and we carried...</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q:Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A:That is what they told us to do.</span> <span id="s1052">On top...We were like in a valley and on top there was standing Gentile girls, also from the concentration camp, and they were...We used to pass by them and they would put in the dirt, the heavy, wet dirt into our coats, or, if there was not enough coats, they used to give us, like [not clear], and that day, I think, was the worst day.</span> <span id="s1053">We brought from that day about 20 dead girls...from this work day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q:What was the purpose of wearing your coats that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A:That we could have the [not clear] to use the coat to carry with.</span> <span id="s1056">Also, this was our Sunday.</span> <span id="s1057">Also done for the same purpose.</span> <span id="s1058">Sunday we did not go out to work but we did the same thing in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1059">Their enjoyment was our agony.</span> <span id="s1060">The more agony, the more they enjoyed it, so they used to think of things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q:To harass...</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A:They stood there, and they were young soldiers, and for instance, they would say to each other, “Let’s see.</span> <span id="s1063">Can you shoot her?</span> <span id="s1064">Shoot her from here?”</span> <span id="s1065">And he said, “I will try,” so he did.</span> <span id="s1066">He said, “If you don’t do it, I will do it.”</span> <span id="s1067">So he got her.</span> <span id="s1068">Another one put on the ground dead.</span> <span id="s1069">And this is when my sister got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q:Because somebody was playing games?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A:Just playing games.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q:She was shot for no reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A:No reason.</span> <span id="s1074">They were bringing down...The truck went by and they left this soup which was given to us at noon time.</span> <span id="s1075">The soup was brought in...It was like barrels, but they were made out of steel, and...I guess they used them for soldiers here to, like...I have seen it, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q:With the top clamped on the side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A:Right, with the tops clamped on the sides.</span> <span id="s1078">Right, and since we were in a valley, they left this on top and the girls had to go up and bring it down and they were heavy, so this was a picnic for the soldiers, because this is when they could see real agony at play.</span> <span id="s1079">They sent up like six girls, and one of the things with the soup opened up while they were sliding down with it and they all got burned.</span> <span id="s1080">Not all burned right away...hands ...and then they shot them.</span> <span id="s1081">We had brought back that day 20 or 24 dead girls to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q:And you had to bring your sister back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A:Yes, I had to bring my sister back.</span> <span id="s1084">We carried them...We always walked out...They were made out of wood; you always took them with you...I don’t know what you call them here...You put it on your shoulders.</span> <span id="s1085">You always walked out with this because you knew that you were always going to bring back some girls dead.</span> <span id="s1086">There was no other way.</span> <span id="s1087">This was the way of life.</span> <span id="s1088">But to bring back 22 or 24 dead and to carry them, it was almost every row...We marched in five, and almost every row carried a dead girl.</span> <span id="s1089">The applause that they got entering was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1090">A job good done...</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q:The soldiers...</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A:This was for them something...</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q:These girls were not buried when they were brought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A:These girls had to be brought in and brought to our barracks where we belonged, put down on the floor and counted together with us.</span> <span id="s1095">Then they were burned.</span> <span id="s1096">They were put on trucks and taken to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1097">They were dead already, anyway, but you had to bring them back, because everything had to be accounted for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q:They were very systematic, the Germans?</span> <span id="s1099">Very systematic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A:This was how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q:Tell me what the situation was.</span> <span id="s1102">Did you become friends with the other people?</span> <span id="s1103">Some of them you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A:Well, most of the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q:I am talking about the other girls in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1107">In the beginning when we walked in, it was all, like from our town.</span> <span id="s1108">All girls that we knew, all girls that we went to school with.</span> <span id="s1109">There were girls that came into our ghetto from the neighboring towns that we got acquainted with and again, it was like a helping hand.</span> <span id="s1110">Everybody tried to encourage everybody else.</span> <span id="s1111">The older ones tried to do it to the younger ones.</span> <span id="s1112">By older, I mean by 25 or 27 year-olds looked to us like we were children.</span> <span id="s1113">They are the older so they tried to encourage us, to try to keep clean, to try to be good to each other, to try and not steal the food from each other, and we always paired off like two together.</span> <span id="s1114">If we got a portion of bread, we ate one in the morning and we kept one.</span> <span id="s1115">Otherwise, we put together both of our portions.</span> <span id="s1116">We ate one and we kept one, to save.</span> <span id="s1117">I was with a girl that was not from my town and she was from Grodno, Poland, and she was in our ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q:How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A:G-R-O-D-N-O.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q:Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A:And her name was Dora, too, and we, for a little time, shared our life.</span> <span id="s1122">We slept on the same bunk together and we shared our food together and she used to tell me, “You’ll see.</span> <span id="s1123">We live.</span> <span id="s1124">I have an uncle in America, and he is a big actor, and we will come to him.</span> <span id="s1125">He is my uncle and you will see, we will have it so good.”</span> <span id="s1126">Her uncle was an actor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q:Her uncle was really an actor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1129">What was his name?</span> <span id="s1130">He played in Papirosin.</span> <span id="s1131">Jewish stage, yes.</span> <span id="s1132">I don’t think he’s alive now.</span> <span id="s1133">He played in Papirosin.</span> <span id="s1134">I can’t remember his name now, with his wife, and that was her uncle, that was her father’s brother, and they stayed in contact closely, because she knew that he plays the Jewish Theater.</span> <span id="s1135">She even knew Brooklyn...She called it “Broklyn”...Can I offer you something?</span> <span id="s1136">Would you like a drink or a coffee, or a soda or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q:No, I just want you to go ahead with your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A:And she said, “You’ll see.</span> <span id="s1139">He will be so good to us because he always sends us money.</span> <span id="s1140">The families did help.</span> <span id="s1141">He sends us for every yomtov and he sends us money and we have something to live on.</span> <span id="s1142">We’ll be with him.</span> <span id="s1143">He lives in Brooklyn.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q:It sounded like heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A:It sounded like heaven.</span> <span id="s1146">It gave me a little bit of hope, and there was very little left.</span> <span id="s1147">Very little.</span> <span id="s1148">At that time on the bunk, there was like three tiers and we slept in the middle.</span> <span id="s1149">There was me and my sister and four cousins and four friends.</span> <span id="s1150">We slept like this because everybody wants to be together.</span> <span id="s1151">It was me, the only one left.</span> <span id="s1152">They all died at work, or of sickness, or shot for play, or taken for experiments, which was another very bad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q:Tell me what you knew about the experiments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A:O.</span> <span id="s1155">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q:You mentioned Mengele before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A:Mengele was the doctor, who they say is still alive.</span> <span id="s1158">Mengele had his own way of doing things.</span> <span id="s1159">First of all he rode on his motorcycle on the Lagerstrasse.</span> <span id="s1160">Now the Lagerstrasse was the main street of the camp.</span> <span id="s1161">On both sides were the barracks, and if my unit was ready to go, we marched out on the Lagerstrasse and we had to walk straight out to the entrance, be counted again...Everything and everybody had to be accounted for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q:Spell Lagerstrasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A:L-A-G-E-R-S-T-R-A-S-S-E.</span> <span id="s1164">So in the middle, as the unit of 200 or 150 girls used to walk, he used to suddenly run through with his motorcycle and whoever got killed got killed.</span> <span id="s1165">No business of his.</span> <span id="s1166">That was his pleasure.</span> <span id="s1167">On both sides of the Lagerstrasse were two canals and that is where the girls fell in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q:Into water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A:Into the mud, and when he was through with his enjoyment and we put together back the unit of people, of the girls, if 20 were dead, then there were 20 available right away.</span> <span id="s1170">I mean put them back and go back to work.</span> <span id="s1171">That was Mengele’s enjoyment.</span> <span id="s1172">His enjoyment was also his friends taking beautiful young girls and cutting them up in pieces and making all kinds of experiments with them.</span> <span id="s1173">This was by the end of 1944.</span> <span id="s1174">At that time I am already two years in Birkenau—that’s Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1175">There was very few of us left.</span> <span id="s1176">By few, I mean the ones that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q:Excuse me, did you know any of the people that were taken?</span> <span id="s1178">Did you know the people personally that were taken for Mengele’s experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A:I knew one girl and she was alive after the war, I had met her after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q:And she survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A:She survived.</span> <span id="s1182">The experiments were many, of different kinds.</span> <span id="s1183">They could do whatever they want; so if they performed an operation, they didn’t have to sew you up.</span> <span id="s1184">They wanted to see how it did inside without closing.</span> <span id="s1185">If they made like they call here now a..</span> <span id="s1186">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q:Hysterectomy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A:No, not that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q:Where the baby is taken from the womb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A:Yes, the baby is taken from the womb or artificial insemination, they did that but they had to watch how it grows, what it does, and for them to cut up a Jewish girl and see how this is doing inside...</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q:Probably without pain killers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A:Without pain killers.</span> <span id="s1193">The girls...</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Tape 3 of 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q:This is Helen Grossman and I am interviewing Dora Freilich.</span> <span id="s1196">This is tape three, side one, and we are going on with the experiments at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A:Now, the girls that were chosen to go to the experiments were chosen from the healthiest between us.</span> <span id="s1198">They were separated from us and taken to a completely different barracks, and they say, I am not sure if that what I heard...that they were kept on a better diet than us, to give them a more normal way of life so that they could get a little bit stronger.</span> <span id="s1199">They also did not go out to any physical work but we saw them going out to pick flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q:Excuse me, but did your menstrual period keep going through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A:No, they put stuff in the food that took the menstruation away right away.</span> <span id="s1202">We did not have it all through the time that we were in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q:What do you think the girls did that were taken for the experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A:I guess that this is what they tried to do.</span> <span id="s1205">That’s why they fed them a different diet.</span> <span id="s1206">They did also not work physically as hard.</span> <span id="s1207">Their conditions were a little bit better than us in order to give them a more civilized way of living so that they can experiment on them and see what is happening.</span> <span id="s1208">Because if they took any from the concentration camp, they would not survive because we had only the skin to keep together the bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q:Did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A:As I said, I met one girl that survived.</span> <span id="s1211">There might be others, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1212">She had a complete hysterectomy, which we knew about hysterectomies then, and we knew what they are doing but obviously she never married.</span> <span id="s1213">She could never have children.</span> <span id="s1214">They did the same thing on the men’s side too.</span> <span id="s1215">They took men too for the same purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q:The healthier men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A:The healthier men.</span> <span id="s1218">They kept them and they did the same thing to see how they can operate, what they can do to them, for their own professions, for their medicine.</span> <span id="s1219">For guinea pigs.</span> <span id="s1220">This girl I know, I met her after the war and I don’t know if she’s alive any more, but she was as young as me.</span> <span id="s1221">She was 19 and she told me then that she will never be able to have children and I said, “Well why?”</span> <span id="s1222">And she said, “Because I think they took out something that a child has to be born in.”</span> <span id="s1223">We didn’t know what it was, and back home you did not sit a child down and sit him down and say, “Listen, you are going to get a menstruation.”</span> <span id="s1224">You just didn’t do things like that.</span> <span id="s1225">You went to the library and you looked up some stuff if you wanted.</span> <span id="s1226">Sex and things like this, that was not a habit.</span> <span id="s1227">Sex waited until after marriage.</span> <span id="s1228">There was no fresh thing.</span> <span id="s1229">If you knew about somebody, and somebody told you, and somebody else brought it...and that this girl was bad and maybe she had sex, my God, the whole family was like...Ach!</span> <span id="s1230">Nobody wanted to be associated with her.</span> <span id="s1231">This was what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q:In the camp there couldn’t have been anything like sex.</span> <span id="s1233">It was impossible...</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A:No, the Germans would not touch us with a ten-foot pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q:What about the people that were guarding you that were not Germans?</span> <span id="s1236">They were the other prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A:They were already like Germans and worse.</span> <span id="s1238">Mostly they were Germans.</span> <span id="s1239">Volksdeutsche, they were called.</span> <span id="s1240">Germans living in other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q:Explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A:Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1243">Germans living in other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q:Misplaced Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A:Misplaced Germans, and they were brought into camp for different reasons.</span> <span id="s1246">Like for reasons that were political.</span> <span id="s1247">Even prostitution.</span> <span id="s1248">They were a black...like, for instance, we got the numbers, and on the bottom you can see it’s a half Magen David, half a triangle.</span> <span id="s1249">Now, the politicals had a red triangle.</span> <span id="s1250">They didn’t have no numbers on their arms, but they had it on their uniforms.</span> <span id="s1251">The prostitutes had a black triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q:Were they Jewish prostitutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A:No, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1254">German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q:Any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A:Any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q:But they were marked as prostitutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1259">Even gay people were marked.</span> <span id="s1260">Homosexuals was not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q:Were the prostitutes treated any differently than anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A:Well, it depends on the time of the year that they came in and how long they were there.</span> <span id="s1263">Otherwise any one who had been there before, took over the command over us.</span> <span id="s1264">Everybody was boss over us.</span> <span id="s1265">Might be Volksdeutsche, Polish.</span> <span id="s1266">Whatever he was, as long as he was there a year, a half a year, three months more than us, then he had the command, he was our boss.</span> <span id="s1267">This was Mengele’s main thing, to find out, to see how he can function on human beings to do all these experiments, to do all these things, to do all these operations and not close it up, to see it growing, to see it functioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q:And observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A:And observe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q:And keep records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A:And keep records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q:You probably heard about the skin lamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A:The skin lampshades.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q:Were you aware of that when you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A:No.</span> <span id="s1276">Neither were we aware of the soap that they were making from the fat when they burned the people.</span> <span id="s1277">Our hunger kept us so occupied that everybody thought, “I am going to be the one that survives.”</span> <span id="s1278">And this I see now in many books: people that survived, that everyone...you never said it aloud, and you didn’t say that I am going to survive, I am going to write a book about it, etc., etc., because that was in every, not corner, but in every minute around you, but somehow deep inside you felt that you must survive.</span> <span id="s1279">You must do the utmost to survive and see what you can do about it, to show the world what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q:You have heard of the artwork that came out of the camps.</span> <span id="s1281">Were you ever aware of any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A:No.</span> <span id="s1283">You mean like in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q:There particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A:I don’t think that there was any artwork in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1286">Theresienstadt, I think, was the camp visited by Red Cross, and I think that it was kept a little bit under better conditions.</span> <span id="s1287">As an example.</span> <span id="s1288">Right.</span> <span id="s1289">The rest was, “Just kill as many as you want.</span> <span id="s1290">Enjoy yourself as much as you want.</span> <span id="s1291">There are no restrictions.</span> <span id="s1292">You are not going to be punished; do whatever pleases you the most,” and what pleased them the most was killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q:To get back to the experiments: they would keep the women alive, but not with pain killers.</span> <span id="s1294">They would just live as long as they could and then expire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A:As long as they could, and then expire.</span> <span id="s1296">I know of a woman here.</span> <span id="s1297">She is much older than me, much older, 15 years older, and she had been in the experiment group, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q:What did she say about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A:Well, as a rule, this is still...they do not talk about it much.</span> <span id="s1300">If you know of somebody that was in that particular group, you don’t touch that subject.</span> <span id="s1301">I mean, you would tell all of the horrors that you went through and everybody on their own went through; besides as a group, we all went through our own beatings, our own sufferings.</span> <span id="s1302">This is not a subject to touch because it is too private.</span> <span id="s1303">She doesn’t have no children, so I know that this was done to her.</span> <span id="s1304">As we grew older we learned what it is all about.</span> <span id="s1305">So I know that she was there, and she never had a family.</span> <span id="s1306">In 19-..., by the end of 1945, no, 1944, rumors started going around in the concentration camp, there was always rumors... The men used to come into work, like the electricians, or mechanics, or sewer workers, all kinds.</span> <span id="s1307">They could get hold of a radio or something more easily, and they were more interested, and mostly they heard from England on the BBC it was.</span> <span id="s1308">And they knew that the Allies are in the war...whatever.</span> <span id="s1309">They knew that the Germans are getting a licking on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1310">The winter was very bad, and this was their only hope, the Russians, that they couldn’t survive the winter there.</span> <span id="s1311">So that the men used to come in...They used to leave word, here and there a word to a girl, saying, “We heard this and this.</span> <span id="s1312">Try and help yourself and we will help you too.”</span> <span id="s1313">Bring in an extra portion bread, beans or something, to give to the girls, sharing.</span> <span id="s1314">“Try and stay healthy.</span> <span id="s1315">Try to get a little water and wash yourself, try and get rid of the lice.”</span> <span id="s1316">The lice was eating us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q:There was no way of getting rid of the lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A:They were embedded into the skin, sucking the blood.</span> <span id="s1319">You could not pull them out; so by the end of 1944, they made an Entlausung, which mean to get rid of the lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q:Spell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A:E-N-T-L-A-U-S-U-N-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q:To get rid of the lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A:To get rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s1324">O.K., this is the way it went.</span> <span id="s1325">Each and every one of us took off what we were wearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q:This was an order from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A:Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q:They wanted to get rid of it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A:They wanted to get rid of it too because they were in the boards of the barracks and everything.</span> <span id="s1330">So, whatever we were wearing, pants—torn, not torn—shorts, long sleeve shirts, a belt and of course the wooden clogs—which the girls wear it now and enjoy it so much.</span> <span id="s1331">We never took it in to sell because every time I looked at it I thought, “My God, my God.”</span> <span id="s1332">So we had to take it and tie it together; we were completely naked.</span> <span id="s1333">That was the end of 1944, in December, and the snow was three or four or five feet high.</span> <span id="s1334">They closed the barracks and exploded bombs in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q:Where were the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A:The people were out.</span> <span id="s1337">They put on top of the barracks, and in the middle of the Lagerstrasse big boiling things of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q:Cauldrons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A:Yes, and we threw our clothing in there.</span> <span id="s1340">Then when it boiled—meanwhile, we stood naked for a whole night and a whole day—then they took it out from the water and they threw it on the roof so it froze.</span> <span id="s1341">Then they pulled it down from the roof, and we had the numbers, besides on us, on our jackets; in other words, you were a number, you had no name, you were called a number.</span> <span id="s1342">Then you take the frozen clothes and you take them apart, and it breaks, it tears; you put it on because it is yours, it has your number and everything, and we are left with one leg and one without; you have half a shirt or you have no shirt at all, it fell apart completely.</span> <span id="s1343">So they have one big thing with extras, like, and these are from soldiers, worn and worn over and over again, and if they see that it is very bad, that you have nothing, you get something, maybe a pillow, anything, just to cover yourself.</span> <span id="s1344">This was the Entlausung of the camp.</span> <span id="s1345">It didn’t help any, maybe a little, but rumors started that they are going to take us to another camp.</span> <span id="s1346">There were rumors that another camp was forming.</span> <span id="s1347">Girls were always afraid of something new; something new always spelled disaster, worse than this.</span> <span id="s1348">You already knew how to protect yourself a little bit unless you got shot in the back of your head, but you have already conditioned yourself a little bit.</span> <span id="s1349">Then a group of us said, “Well, what can be worse than this.</span> <span id="s1350">We are left just a couple of us.”</span> <span id="s1351">A lot of them went berserk; that was another catastrophe.</span> <span id="s1352">They went crazy right away the first couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q:Right away in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q:And after that the survivors were able to cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A:After the first initial couple of months, had a greater chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s1357">Eastern European Jews, that was proven statistically, were more survival prone than any other brought in from any other country.</span> <span id="s1358">Why, it was not proven; they say that people that were brought in from countries where the level of living was higher had a less resistance.</span> <span id="s1359">They brought in girls from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1360">Now Yugoslavia was a very advanced country, and they brought in girls from Belgium which were the same, and they brought in girls from France, and they just fell like flies.</span> <span id="s1361">In three days, there was nobody left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q:From all of these.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A:Yes, they used to bring in transports.</span> <span id="s1364">When we came in the railroad stopped at a certain point and we had to walk to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1365">At that time they had built already the railroad and it brought you straight to the crematorium, or otherwise the concentration camp was overfilled.</span> <span id="s1366">We worked under contracts, not our contracts—they had different contracts.</span> <span id="s1367">Did you read the book, Schindler’s List?</span> <span id="s1368">Very interesting book.</span> <span id="s1369">If not enough died in a specific time or not enough were shot in a specific time and it was getting overcrowded they just brought a truck, piled them up on the truck, and took them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1370">This was a daily routine and you get so used to it.</span> <span id="s1371">It’s like a doctor performing an operation, it’s nothing; you sleep with the dead and you eat with the dead, and you lay near them, and you are like an animal, stripped of everything.</span> <span id="s1372">Your only object is for food and for survival, and after the war that was the thing that most of us thought.</span> <span id="s1373">I must do it, I must survive and tell the story.</span> <span id="s1374">And they decided that they are going to liquidate Auschwitz after an incident that happened.</span> <span id="s1375">Birkenau, rather.</span> <span id="s1376">They had a factory that made ammunition.</span> <span id="s1377">It was on the way to Auschwitz, between Birkenau and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1378">Auschwitz was the town and Birkenau was like on the outskirts of the town, and there were a lot of girls that worked there too, and a lot of girls stole a lot of ammunition, and as in the ghetto there were a lot of little groups coming together and trying to fight back, and they blew up part of the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q:Is this in Schindler’s List?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A:I don’t know; maybe he writes about it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q:And they blew up part of the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q:What year do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A:1944.</span> <span id="s1385">Of course they attributed it right away to the girls that worked in that factory because this is the only place that the ammunition could come from.</span> <span id="s1386">They brought it in with them.</span> <span id="s1387">Because they were searched when they came out, so they probably brought it in like powder and gave it to the men and the men used to make the bombs.</span> <span id="s1388">They hung four girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q:Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A:Everybody had to see this.</span> <span id="s1391">Two girls were hung in the morning for the ones that were going out to work, and the ones that came in had to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q:That was for the explosion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1394">And they hung four.</span> <span id="s1395">Also, there were a few, and one girl was from Belgium and she already advanced to a point where she worked in an office, very pretty, very blonde, a very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1396">She could walk out with the papers from the concentration camp and walk to the crematorium; that is how much faith they had in her.</span> <span id="s1397">That is how good of a worker she was.</span> <span id="s1398">She helped a lot of Belgium girls, put them in better position, you know, like maybe into the kitchen to work or on laundry which was under a roof, not outside to work—outside work killed you completely—and she got together, I guess there was a lot of planning into it and she ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q:And she escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q:Oh, she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A:No, they caught her and she was already out of Auschwitz and out of the city, and she was in some kind of restaurant sitting; her name was Mala.</span> <span id="s1403">And the search was on for her because they say that one of the German Gestapo was in love with her.</span> <span id="s1404">There must be some truth to it because she had possession of papers; she used to go out from the concentration camp and bring the papers.</span> <span id="s1405">And he made it his own, like he gave it his all to bring that girl back, to find that girl, to show the camp that no one, but no one escapes from Auschwitz, and they found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q:This was a Jewish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q:And?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A:And while the whole concentration camp—we came in from work, and you never know, there is always some instinct, like an animal, there is something in the wind, you can feel something is going on and you start feeling that something is in the wind—what is it, and it came out that they caught Mala.</span> <span id="s1410">He sent out I think half of an army—it was to increase his prestige—and they brought her in and we all had to stand in front of our barracks, and she was put into a wheel-barrow with her head hanging down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q:In the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A:Yes, and as they wheeled her through, her head kept going clank, clank, and banging into the asphalt, but she kept her fingers like this for the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q:She was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A:Yes, she was still alive; they caught her alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q:Was she tied?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A:She was tied but she cut herself with a razor blade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q:How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A:She had it on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q:She cheated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1421">And maybe she died or was close to death before they burned her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q:They took her to the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A:Yes, but first they took her through the whole Lagerstrasse, the whole camp, for everybody to see.</span> <span id="s1424">We had written a song, and somewhere I have it, and it was written in Polish or Yiddish, something about Mala, but she said while she was banging her head, to the girls, “I have told people on the outside what is going on.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q:And she had her fingers up in a V?</span> <span id="s1426">For Victory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A:Yes, doing the sign, and then she cut her wrists, and the truth...Nobody knows if she was dead on arrival to the crematorium or they brought her in barely alive, but they found her.</span> <span id="s1428">This had put a lot of fear in us.</span> <span id="s1429">Not that girls were not trying to escape; they were trying to escape over the electric wire fence, and you fell right there, that was it.</span> <span id="s1430">So they said that they are going to close up Birkenau—that was the concentration camp where we were—and they were going to bring us into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1431">The rumor started coming in that the armies were getting together and that they were trying to take us away from Auschwitz and take us into Germany, because Auschwitz is in Poland.</span> <span id="s1432">They took us to Auschwitz, and we were in Auschwitz for about two or three months in the concentration camp, and then it started that they have to evacuate us because the Russians are coming and they are going to kill us all.</span> <span id="s1433">Like they did not kill us yet enough.</span> <span id="s1434">So the Russians are going to kill us now, and Auschwitz was being evacuated.</span> <span id="s1435">The men went before us.</span> <span id="s1436">The girls...</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q:Evacuated to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A:Just walking, go; we were going to Germany and we walk on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q:With guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A:Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1441">Guards and dogs and everything, everybody goes.</span> <span id="s1442">This they called the “death march.”</span> <span id="s1443">It killed half of the people that were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q:And they were headed where in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A:Any place, just across the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Tape 3 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q:This is Dora Freilich being interviewed by Helen Grossman and this is tape three, side two, and we are starting with the death march from Auschwitz to Germany.</span> <span id="s1448">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A:It was 1945, January.</span> <span id="s1450">The winter was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1451">The men that had walked before us were probably dead because the highways were strewn with dead men, with bodies laying on all sides.</span> <span id="s1452">We walked and walked and a lot of our girls that had survived so many years in Birkenau found their death there on the highway.</span> <span id="s1453">We came to a place, I don’t recall exactly the name, that was after three days of marching day and night, day and night without a stop, with no food, with nothing.</span> <span id="s1454">They brought us to a little station and they packed us into open wagons.</span> <span id="s1455">It was probably in Germany, because Auschwitz is like not far from the German border before the War too, like Silesia, because there were so many Germans living in Poland taking out their animosity on us.</span> <span id="s1456">That march put away over half of our girls that survived two-and-a-half to three years in Birkenau and they got killed on that death march.</span> <span id="s1457">I was brought into Ravensbruck on that train.</span> <span id="s1458">It would be R-A-V-E-N-S-B-R-U-C-K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q:That was a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A:That was one of the most famous concentration camps made before the war, for the German people if they did not behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q:As a penal colony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1463">The walls around that camp you could not see the sky.</span> <span id="s1464">They were maybe 100 meters [she probably means a distance equal to approximately 100 feet.</span> <span id="s1465">-ed.]</span> <span id="s1466">high and made out of cement.</span> <span id="s1467">Now, we came in there, whatever was left of us, and there was already there in that camp about 3000 women that came in from different camps.</span> <span id="s1468">There was not a drop of food, there was no water, there were no toilet facilities but open holes.</span> <span id="s1469">There were no places where to sleep, and we stood there in the barracks where once there were some bunks, but the girls that were there before, the women that were there before, took it out and burned it outside to keep a little warm, so there were no boards left anymore.</span> <span id="s1470">So if you wanted to lay down, you kept the boards inside the back of your pants, and I was with another girl, so she kept one and I kept one, so we put two boards together if she wanted to lay down for an hour and then I would lay down for an hour, and they could be stolen every minute of the day from you.</span> <span id="s1471">Somebody could run up in the back and take it away from you because that was the only way of survival.</span> <span id="s1472">We were there in that camp I guess for two months, just starving to death and dying, doing nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q:Were there anybody left in your family at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A:Nobody; from my family everybody was gone in the first year in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1475">I had nobody left, and that was when my sister died, and that is when I brought her into the camp carrying her in my arms dead, and then all my cousins, all my girlfriends, there was nobody, nobody left, but a few friends who one is now my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1476">We were both from the same town although I did not know her because she went to a different school.</span> <span id="s1477">She went to a Hebrew school and I went to a Polish school and it was like a different environment, and in Birkenau we got acquainted and we stayed together all the time, and then we married two brothers; so she was with me and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1478">We didn’t work, we didn’t work and there was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1479">We were just standing and dying.</span> <span id="s1480">The sicknesses were unbearable.</span> <span id="s1481">Diarrhea, you just stood in it and you lay in it, slept in it, that’s all you did.</span> <span id="s1482">Then they started getting together transports to take us to other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q:In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A:Right, we were already in Germany.</span> <span id="s1485">Ravensbruck is already deep in Ger–many, it’s like near Munich; it’s in the middle.</span> <span id="s1486">They say it’s about an hour from Munich.</span> <span id="s1487">I don’t know, maybe one day I am going to get up enough courage to go back, which a few of my people did now, go back to Auschwitz, to Birkenau, and see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q:Now it’s a garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A:Right, but my husband says I am crazy for even thinking about it; but I feel it’s a bonus to me for surviving it—not because I tried that hard—and I really don’t know how I survived.</span> <span id="s1490">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1491">I want to go someday and see it again.</span> <span id="s1492">There is so much... [unclear] in vain.</span> <span id="s1493">There are so many dead bodies, and so many dead babies were thrown into the open flames, and we used to look out the windows and those flames never stopped for one minute.</span> <span id="s1494">Not for one minute, but there were constantly fewer.</span> <span id="s1495">When they made the railway to the concentration camp, then they didn’t bring them in if the concentration camp was full.</span> <span id="s1496">They took them right away to there.</span> <span id="s1497">We had seen brides in their veils through the windows walking to the crematorium not knowing what is happening.</span> <span id="s1498">Because as Hitler had said he is going to do something that the world is not going to believe and he did.</span> <span id="s1499">Families with children dressed, coming from picnics, from anything, thrown into trains and brought straight to Auschwitz to the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q:Let’s go on to the Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A:We stayed there for about two-and-a-half to three months I would say, and they saw that everybody is dying, and the thing was that if you had somebody to take care and you are in Germany and not on the Russian front; this is how whole construction works.</span> <span id="s1502">You know Schindler, as good as he was—and he was a fantastic guy to save so many Jews—but it was also to his advantage because he had worked for the Germans, doing for them things that they needed.</span> <span id="s1503">He was very young and it was very ironic that a young guy like him had the guts to go against the Germans because he saw how they are killing people, and he took it upon himself to save them and he called them “meine Juden”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q:My Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A:He had factories.</span> <span id="s1506">He made the grenades, but what he did, he made false grenades, they were fake.</span> <span id="s1507">Only when he knew when there was going to be an inspection, then he prepared live grenades for the inspectors to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q:He was German, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A:He was German.</span> <span id="s1510">It was a very interesting book, because you seldom come across what you call nowadays, Righteous Gentiles, which there were, of course, and he in that age, where Germany was so popular, and Hitler was so good, that he took it upon himself to save his Jews.</span> <span id="s1511">And you know that there are differences, and you know that he was spit at in Germany for it after the liberation?</span> <span id="s1512">I think he later died in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q:Is he in the Righteous Gentiles in the Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A:Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1515">I am sure that he is there.</span> <span id="s1516">I am positive that he is there, because not only did he save one or two, but he saved thousands, because he had the factory and he worked for them but in spite of this he saved his Jews and in spite of that he went against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q:And he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A:And he survived.</span> <span id="s1519">Everyone that saved a Jew put his own life on the line and he did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q:Were there any other Christians that you are aware of as you were of Schindler?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A:Not that I know of, but I come across by reading that people are finding a lot of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q:No, I meant when you were in Germany.</span> <span id="s1523">What happened when you were at Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A:We stayed there for three months and then they took us away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q:To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A:They took us to a place called M-A-L-T-H-O-W [Malchow?]</span> <span id="s1527">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q:And you were moved by truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A:We were moved by train, a regular, normal people’s train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q:With seats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A:With seats and with windows that look out.</span> <span id="s1532">We didn’t know where they were taking us but this is where we were put.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q:That was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A:That was a camp, yes.</span> <span id="s1535">That was a camp that was stationed next to a camp of war prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q:Do you know the name of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A:No, Russian.</span> <span id="s1538">All I know is Malthow [Malchow?]</span> <span id="s1539">; the other one I do not know.</span> <span id="s1540">They were war prisoners, and they were Russian and they were French and they were all kinds, and I guess as I know now under the Geneva thing that there are certain things that you can not do to a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1541">A prisoner is a prisoner of war, not sent by himself; he is sent by a country, and so they are in a little better condition, supplied with food or bedding or clothing or etc., etc.</span> <span id="s1542">When we used to walk by like to go out to work, the work was again the same story.</span> <span id="s1543">It wasn’t under such strenuous condition because they themselves knew that the end is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q:This was 1945 by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A:1945, so the war prisoners used to throw over their fences some food to us, like you know sometimes a piece of salami, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1546">The women I always used to call girls because we were girls, young, and there were older ones and they used to teach us how to be close, how to behave, how to care for each other, and it helped a lot because hunger can do a lot of things to you.</span> <span id="s1547">It can actually turn you into a beast; you don’t care where it comes from.</span> <span id="s1548">It’s like LSD, you don’t care where it comes from as long as you have it; so you steal, and you rob, as long as you have that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1549">So they used to do that.</span> <span id="s1550">They always talked about food, and somehow it relieved a little bit the pain, and as we came from different parts of Poland, the same thing like in the United States, there is different menus and different ways of cooking and everybody used to tell, my mother used to make varenikes this way, and my mother used to make it that way and we used to do it for a whole night and this kept us going.</span> <span id="s1551">This constant reminder of the past, this constant talking about it and the keeping in touch kept us going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q:It made you feel that there was going to be a future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A:Right, not knowing.</span> <span id="s1554">We always pretended.</span> <span id="s1555">We knew that people were killed, that people were burned, we knew that there was a crematorium going day and night, we knew that there was nobody left, but you somehow hoped that maybe somebody run away, maybe on the outside, Yablokow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q:What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A:That is the name of the famous actor that I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q:Spell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A:Y-A-B-L-O-K-O-W.</span> <span id="s1560">J or Y, I don’t know how he spelled it but that was his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q:And it’s the actor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A:And he played on the Yiddish stage, in Grodno.</span> <span id="s1563">In fact when we came to the United States he was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q:Now, when this is edited they will put it in the right order.</span> <span id="s1565">I knew that you were going to remember it.</span> <span id="s1566">Now go ahead about the camp.</span> <span id="s1567">The...</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A:Malthow [Malchow?]</span> <span id="s1569">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A:Then one day all of a sudden, they said that there are some trucks being exchanged for prisoners, and that we are going to get food and they are going to take us to Sweden or Switzerland; and the truth of the matter is there was something like this, not carried out all the way.</span> <span id="s1572">There was a promise, there was a thing they were putting together, worked out with FDR for the exchange of 100 trucks for 1000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1573">And he said what is he going to do with 1000 kikes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q:Who said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A:Roosevelt said this; this is recorded history, that in 1944 or ‘45, when that guy who burned himself in front of the English Embassy, the American Embassy, the English Embassy in London, trying to tell what he knows was going on in the concentration camps, and knowing that people know here and are trying to bring it to the attention and nobody wants to listen.</span> <span id="s1576">Greenspan...was his name.</span> <span id="s1577">He burned himself in front of the Embassy, of the American or the English Embassy, I am not sure, and there was a Rabbi Weiss that knew very well what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q:He was in New York at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A:Right, and it was some kind of a deal made.</span> <span id="s1580">My husband knows much more about it because it was brought to their attention, in the camp yet, that they needed 100 trucks and they would release 1000 Jews and Roosevelt said, “What am I going to do with 1000 kikes?</span> <span id="s1581">Don’t rock the boat.”</span> <span id="s1582">So this is recorded history and people knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q:Did they know about it here, do you think, at the time?</span> <span id="s1584">I don’t think it was brought out then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A:I don’t think that the average public knew the atrocities.</span> <span id="s1586">I think that the higher echelons did know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1587">I think that there were a lot of pictures sent from soldiers which is now proven.</span> <span id="s1588">Like we had, he was a principal.</span> <span id="s1589">As a 19-year-old boy he was in the army and he liberated Dachau and he now speaks before our symposiums.</span> <span id="s1590">He is the first speaker there always, and there were a lot of pictures then taken.</span> <span id="s1591">All of the pictures that we see now were taken by the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q:When they released Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A:All of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1594">They weren’t taken by us because we had nothing with us.</span> <span id="s1595">We had no cameras or anything; we were just beaten people, starved to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q:Weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A:That’s all.</span> <span id="s1598">And all the pictures and everything were sent by German soldiers to their families, or by American soldiers, French, English, Italian, or whatever; and he tells the story when he liberated Dachau.</span> <span id="s1599">He said that in all those years, until we came to talk about the Holocaust, that every time he thought about it he pushed it away and said, “That’s not true, because I haven’t been there,” and then when it came out...You know we had the organization here, the Holocaust Survivors; we changed it now, it was the Jewish New-Americans, we changed it last year.</span> <span id="s1600">We would rather be called the Jewish Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s1601">And we do a lot of work; we are preparing now, you know, we are going to be hosting in 1985 the gathering of the Holocaust survivors, like it was in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q:Yes, and that is going to be where...</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A:It is going to be here in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1604">We know about this for a couple of months, but the mail is now being sent out in preparing for everything that is going to be going on.</span> <span id="s1605">When he heard people like in the neighborhood where he lived and he saw people that survived, he said he might as well talk about it too.</span> <span id="s1606">He had to get it off his mind and he comes to us, to the symposiums which go on already I think for the eighth year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q:For the symposiums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A:It’s been already many years that the symposiums go on.</span> <span id="s1609">I myself have already been to seven of them in Gratz College that we have and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q:That is the youth symposium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A:Yes, this is the youth symposium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q:Tell me what happened at that camp then, at Malthow.</span> <span id="s1613">You didn’t get any trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A:No, and we didn’t get no food and we didn’t get no trucks, but we saw that there was something happening; we didn’t know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q:This was what month, do you think?</span> <span id="s1616">Oh, this is January?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A:No, in January we are in Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A:By March and April we are there and there is something going on because we see already that the Germans are changing.</span> <span id="s1620">They are taking off their uniforms and they are putting on regular suits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q:Right in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A:Right in Malthow, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1623">There was not so much beating; there was nothing to beat already.</span> <span id="s1624">They were falling like flies anyway.</span> <span id="s1625">They were laying down and dying.</span> <span id="s1626">No food, nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s1627">We used to get up at 3:00 in the morning just to get the grass that grew overnight.</span> <span id="s1628">Shrunken like this.</span> <span id="s1629">If I weighed 40 pounds it was a lot and I am a big girl.</span> <span id="s1630">I’m five foot six.</span> <span id="s1631">So, we all think this is the end.</span> <span id="s1632">So, all of a sudden they are throwing their uniforms, and one morning...They upheld the morning things that go on.</span> <span id="s1633">Dead or alive you had to get up and be counted.</span> <span id="s1634">This must go on.</span> <span id="s1635">There were lists and lists that have to be preserved and everything had to be accounted for.</span> <span id="s1636">They say that they are going to take us out of the camp and that we are going to march into the nearest town.</span> <span id="s1637">They don’t know the reason themselves but they are already changing their clothes.</span> <span id="s1638">With us, there is nothing that we can do anymore.</span> <span id="s1639">We go out on the highway.</span> <span id="s1640">Now, the highway is just Calamity Jane.</span> <span id="s1641">Trucks, horse and buggies, motorcycles, cars, open trucks, closed trucks, German people with children.</span> <span id="s1642">It is the end of the war, but they don’t know where they are going.</span> <span id="s1643">They don’t know which way, who is going to occupy whom, so they all are trying to run to the American side, but we don’t know, we have to march.</span> <span id="s1644">They are marching near us, and they are marching where they are going but we can’t do a thing, so we march.</span> <span id="s1645">I have a friend of mine that is in Israel.</span> <span id="s1646">She was the oldest of us and she kept us all together.</span> <span id="s1647">Also four years ago I lost a friend who died suddenly.</span> <span id="s1648">We were like her two daughters, and she said we are going to just walk off the road after it gets darker and we are going to walk into the forest, because you see what is going on.</span> <span id="s1649">I don’t know if you can visualize, but you can only see in a film: people running in different directions.</span> <span id="s1650">Nobody knows where to go but we had to stay because first of all we are in uniform, we had no hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q:Your head is still shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A:Still shaved, and we are in these striped uniforms and we can barely walk.</span> <span id="s1653">Each and every one has boils all over because we are so thin and the lice are so thick that they sucked out the blood, and our infections are unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1654">Everybody has a blood infection.</span> <span id="s1655">Everybody has diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1656">So she says to us, “Let’s just do it, because one way or the other we are dead; we are dead this way and we’ll probably be dead that way, so let’s do something.”</span> <span id="s1657">So we get together, I think it was 11 girls, and as we walk we are nearing to the end of the column and walking down into the forest.</span> <span id="s1658">The forest has Germany and Poland on both sides, full of them.</span> <span id="s1659">And in the forest when it gets dark we see a lot of Germans, officers coming in and taking off their uniforms and changing into civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s1660">Now a lot of boys—and this my husband told me many times—got shot because they have taken the German uniforms because they were naked and they wanted to warm themselves, so they put on the German uniforms and the Allies mistook them for Ger–mans by the end of the war and they shot them.</span> <span id="s1661">I was liberated May 8th.</span> <span id="s1662">Now at that time there were already some camps that were liberated.</span> <span id="s1663">When we left Birkenau they say that I think seven or eight days the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q:In seven or eight days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A:In seven or eight days, and this is how the procedure was going.</span> <span id="s1666">They knew that this is coming to an end; they were doing very bad in Stalingrad and they were just dying there of hunger, of cold, of everything.</span> <span id="s1667">Freezing to death, that was their only rescue for the Russians because they knew that they cannot survive a Russian winter.</span> <span id="s1668">So we walked up and they didn’t bother us anymore, the Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s1669">They saw that we are looking at them.</span> <span id="s1670">Some left the clothing laying there and some took their guns with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q:The guns were the only protection that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A:Yes, but they wanted to mingle with the civilians; they didn’t want to be any more Germans.</span> <span id="s1673">They had clothes with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q:Civilian clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1676">I am not talking about the population.</span> <span id="s1677">I am talking about the ones that take care of the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A:And, they changed, they see us, but they don’t touch us.</span> <span id="s1680">Otherwise, they are concerned now for their own lives, so they don’t care.</span> <span id="s1681">We can walk this way and we can walk that way.</span> <span id="s1682">It doesn’t matter to them anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q:You can just walk away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A:Yes, we stayed until it got real dark in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Tape 4 of 4, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q:This is tape four, side one and we are taping Dora Freilich and it is a continuation.</span> <span id="s1687">This is October 31, 1984.</span> <span id="s1688">Dora, can you tell me when you were liberated and take it from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A:As we were, in 1945, it was in May, and they took us out of our last concentration camp, which was Malthow.</span> <span id="s1690">Where they were taking us, I don’t think they knew themselves.</span> <span id="s1691">They started taking off their German clothing (which I think I am repeating now because I think I already said this) and they really did not care what we were doing anymore; they wanted rather to save themselves.</span> <span id="s1692">We were a group of 11 girls that stuck together and we hid in the forest, and then when it got dark we crossed the little bridge that was leading to a town, a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q:Do you remember the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A:Yes, B-A-R-K-O-W.</span> <span id="s1695">It was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1696">We came to that little town and we came to a big building.</span> <span id="s1697">I think it was a high school or whatever.</span> <span id="s1698">It was a school.</span> <span id="s1699">There were thousands of people there.</span> <span id="s1700">There were Germans.</span> <span id="s1701">There was us.</span> <span id="s1702">We didn’t know what was going on but we knew something was happening but nobody knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s1703">We were very tired, we were on the go already for about two days, day and night.</span> <span id="s1704">In the morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q:You were walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A:We were walking.</span> <span id="s1707">In the morning we woke up and we walked out to see what was going on and we saw a Russian soldier and he said that the war is over and the Allies are coming from all sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q:There is no way that you could remember that date, could you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A:The date was May 8th, 1945; that is the day that I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1710">We spoke Russian with him because we come from Poland and we were always under Russian occupation so we spoke Russian to him and he told us unbelievable stories what was going on, how they conquered the Germans and he said, “Just try and keep well.”</span> <span id="s1711">We went and we occupied a house, a German house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q:How many people were with you?</span> <span id="s1713">They were all women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A:We were all women and then some men came around also, some prisoners of war and some other kind of men, and some men that were prisoners that were not Jewish, that were Gentiles; it was a chaos.</span> <span id="s1715">A lot of Germans that were hiding, they were running.</span> <span id="s1716">They didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s1717">And we occupied a big house that was beautiful; there were still pots standing on the oven and cooking.</span> <span id="s1718">People left the house; they were running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q:I wonder where they ran to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1721">We stayed in that house.</span> <span id="s1722">We were 11 girls, 11 friends that survived together.</span> <span id="s1723">And we were very hungry and we started eating everything that was in sight and we got very, very sick, very, very sick.</span> <span id="s1724">And between us, we were like the youngest ones; we had a few that were like 10 years older.</span> <span id="s1725">They were like more clever than we were and they started taking like command over us.</span> <span id="s1726">And they said, “We are not frying anything.</span> <span id="s1727">We are not eating anything that is fat.”</span> <span id="s1728">We have been without food for the last three months, barely having anything, one bread for a week for 10 people, just a slice of bread, under-nourished, full of lice crawling all over, beaten up, blistered.</span> <span id="s1729">I don’t know what you call it here, but it was like boils.</span> <span id="s1730">It was from dirt and it was from undernourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q:Infections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A:We took baths.</span> <span id="s1733">I don’t think they had showers.</span> <span id="s1734">I don’t remember really.</span> <span id="s1735">We threw away the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q:Was there clothing left in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A:There was everything left in the house.</span> <span id="s1738">There was a house full of everything.</span> <span id="s1739">The pots were still boiling.</span> <span id="s1740">The Russians occupied that town; in other words, we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1741">The only ones that took really revenge were the Russians.</span> <span id="s1742">That’s one thing you got to give them credit.</span> <span id="s1743">There were Russians in Malthow in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q:And they were still around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A:They were just coming in and they were going yet further.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q:North.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1748">They occupied the town and they said, “Anything you want, just tell us what you want and we are going to get it for you.”</span> <span id="s1749">Otherwise they gave them a free hand.</span> <span id="s1750">Whatever you want to do.</span> <span id="s1751">Kill.</span> <span id="s1752">They had raped this town from nine years old to 90 years old; every woman there in that town was raped.</span> <span id="s1753">We stayed in that house for about four weeks.</span> <span id="s1754">They slaughtered a sheep for us, they got food for us, and we dressed ourselves in some decent clothes, but then they started to attack us too.</span> <span id="s1755">You know it’s a funny thing, but we are girls and they are boys and they are young.</span> <span id="s1756">They have been away from home for a long time and the war was dragged out for many years.</span> <span id="s1757">They have been hungry, they haven’t seen any women, and we saw that it is not going to be good.</span> <span id="s1758">We were brave, I can say that word, because we went through so much that we were not afraid of anything any more.</span> <span id="s1759">So we went to the highest General in the Russian Army that was stationed in that town and we told him the story, that they are coming in at night, the boys, the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q:Do you remember his name by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A:I did remember for a time but not any more.</span> <span id="s1762">He said, “Look, I can not stop them, because you don’t know the hell that they went through.</span> <span id="s1763">You know that the Germans were close to Moscow and they have destroyed city after city; they have raped every woman in sight in Russia, they have been hungry.</span> <span id="s1764">We will help you live this time.</span> <span id="s1765">Just go away.</span> <span id="s1766">I know how you feel.</span> <span id="s1767">I know what the war was.</span> <span id="s1768">Just go.”</span> <span id="s1769">And so we decided that we must go.</span> <span id="s1770">They got for us a covered wagon like Gypsies used to travel in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q:With a horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A:Two horses.</span> <span id="s1773">They helped us pack.</span> <span id="s1774">We packed a lot of food, everything that we had with us, you know, and we started traveling towards Poland.</span> <span id="s1775">Why did we do it?</span> <span id="s1776">There were a lot of reasons.</span> <span id="s1777">First of all my reason was that my father had jumped down from the train as they were taking us to Auschwitz, although at that time we didn’t know where, and my father said if any of us survive we will go home, and I said to the girls that I must go home and of course everybody looked at me like I was crazy, but we all traveled together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q:Were they all from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q:So they were all going in the same direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1782">We traveled in that covered wagon for about a week until we came to a town.</span> <span id="s1783">I don’t remember the name of the town now, but you had to wait there until you had to cross a very big lake—this I remember—and we for sure could not do it, the girls on our own.</span> <span id="s1784">We had to put some braces in the wheels of the wagon, and we decided that maybe we should leave the wagon right there and go find other transportation, and this is what we did.</span> <span id="s1785">Our journey home, which I always put it in my speeches, took three months of walking and riding, day and night in constant fear.</span> <span id="s1786">And through that chaos we search–ed; every town that we came to, people were there before us.</span> <span id="s1787">The bigger towns had like little communities forming and people left their names and the names of relatives, con–centration camps where they were, maybe there was somebody before you.</span> <span id="s1788">Some people found somebody.</span> <span id="s1789">They used to leave their name, the concentration camps where they were, family names, brothers’ names, married names, whatever; and there were big lists of people and this is how it started.</span> <span id="s1790">First you went to that place to look for the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q:This was like a community building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A:Yes, like a library.</span> <span id="s1793">And that was all through Germany and of course I didn’t find nobody but we still proceeded to go towards Poland, and we didn’t know how we were going to make it but we tried.</span> <span id="s1794">We were in the station where the trains were leaving and there was a train going to Moscow and we spoke there—it was a military train—and we spoke a good Russian so we went over and we spoke to a general, whatever, and he said if we will get on the train without being noticed, he will stop in a little town where he will let us off.</span> <span id="s1795">He will not stop but slow down, and we should jump.</span> <span id="s1796">That was exactly the same little town where we got on the train going to our death.</span> <span id="s1797">We decided that we are going to do it, and so we jumped on that train and it was like an express line.</span> <span id="s1798">The Russians have taken Germany apart.</span> <span id="s1799">They took everything.</span> <span id="s1800">They took apart factories, they took apart houses, they took out everything that was moveable and took it back to Russia, because they had nothing left there.</span> <span id="s1801">So as the train slowed down we jumped off the train in that little town.</span> <span id="s1802">We were standing there, 11 girls, and this story I always tell because it is a very sad story.</span> <span id="s1803">As the train proceeded going, we stayed at the station and it was Russian again.</span> <span id="s1804">We were in Poland already now but it was under the Russian occupation again.</span> <span id="s1805">Otherwise Poland is divided into Poland and Russia and my part where I come from is occupied by Russia again.</span> <span id="s1806">It’s confusing.</span> <span id="s1807">And he comes over to us and he has one arm.</span> <span id="s1808">In other words, he lost his arm in the war, a young guy, very bitter.</span> <span id="s1809">And he looks at us and he says, “Where are you coming from?”</span> <span id="s1810">And we tell him and he says, “No, you must have worked for the Germans; there was nobody that survived.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q:Was this man Russian or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A:Russian.</span> <span id="s1813">So, far away, I see a guy coming over to us and he comes over and he looks at me and he says to me, “Are you the girl from Pruzany?</span> <span id="s1814">Did your parents have a bakery?”</span> <span id="s1815">And I said, “Yes,” and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s1816">He said, “Are you alive?”</span> <span id="s1817">I said, “Well, I am.”</span> <span id="s1818">He said, “I used to work for your father.</span> <span id="s1819">You don’t know me but I used to deliver bread for your father.</span> <span id="s1820">What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1821">And I tell him the story.</span> <span id="s1822">I say to him that my father had jumped out and I came looking for him and maybe he knows if my father is alive.</span> <span id="s1823">He didn’t hear about it.</span> <span id="s1824">I said, “Is there any Jews in my home town?”</span> <span id="s1825">He said, “Yes, there are a few, but they are all from the forests that came back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q:They had been living in the forest all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A:Yes, this was the group that had been living in the forest.</span> <span id="s1828">Many of them died, many of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1829">And he said, “I will take you there.</span> <span id="s1830">I have a horse and a buggy, but I cannot put you in there because my horse cannot carry you all.</span> <span id="s1831">Just put your belongings, whatever you have.”</span> <span id="s1832">Each of us had something and we put it on the wagon and we walked after the wagon and we told him what the guy said to us, and he said, “Get away from him because he is a murderer.</span> <span id="s1833">He is so miserable because he lost his arm in the war.”</span> <span id="s1834">And we came to our town.</span> <span id="s1835">We walked I think seven kilometers, I don’t know how many miles, and it is very sad time for us.</span> <span id="s1836">As we approach our town you can see almost from the outskirts into the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s1837">The war as it was going on, the Russians coming in, the Germans marching out and vice versa, everybody was bombing everybody and destroying everything and there was very little left of the town.</span> <span id="s1838">And he said, “I will take you to some Jewish families that are there, and in the morning we will find a place where to stay.”</span> <span id="s1839">And this is what he did.</span> <span id="s1840">We stayed there in a house, all 11 of us, and whoever was there from the survivors from the forest came.</span> <span id="s1841">They brought us some food, bread and soup and tried to make it as comfortable for us as possible.</span> <span id="s1842">They also looked at us, because we were the first ones to come into the town that survived the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q:They didn’t believe what they saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A:No, and at that time we realized that we are just different, that we will have to go on explaining and telling the story of what was going on And they too went through a lot; they had their own stories to tell.</span> <span id="s1845">At that time the Russians decided that we are not a desirable element.</span> <span id="s1846">They could not decide if we worked for the Germans or are we really survivors of the war.</span> <span id="s1847">There was not the name Holocaust yet, and they started taking us to the, it’s like the CIA here, NKVD, and they took each and every one of us to tell the story separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q:To make sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A:Of what happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q:And this was in your hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A:In my hometown in 1945, I would say about July or August.</span> <span id="s1852">I had met a boy there that went to school with me together, that survived in the forest and he now worked as a part-time policeman and he came and we told him what they are doing to us, that they are asking us and writing down things and that they really don’t believe us and they think that we are a dangerous element.</span> <span id="s1853">So after we were all separately asked about our experiences, as to almost to explain a day in Auschwitz, when it began, how it was, what it was, and finally came to the conclusion that since this is a border town and since it’s an occupied town, we will not be allowed to stay there.</span> <span id="s1854">Russia is a very funny country.</span> <span id="s1855">You are with them or you are against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q:Everything is black or white.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A:You got to be with them, you cannot be against them.</span> <span id="s1858">Everybody was spying.</span> <span id="s1859">The wife is afraid of the husband, the husband is afraid of the wife.</span> <span id="s1860">This is the truth; this is how it is going on now too.</span> <span id="s1861">This is their regime.</span> <span id="s1862">A normal human being who lived under normal conditions cannot realize the freedom, the opportunity, the beauty that we have in this country.</span> <span id="s1863">We take it so much for granted that this is how it is.</span> <span id="s1864">It is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q:So the Russians didn’t want you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A:No, so this guy that I went to school with said to us, “I want you to go away from here because otherwise you will be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1867">This was the final decision of the cabinet.”</span> <span id="s1868">We were 11 very dangerous people.</span> <span id="s1869">I mean we could probably make war against Russia.</span> <span id="s1870">At that time a law came through that if you were born in Poland, and lived in Poland up to 1935 [November 1939], you could leave for Poland.</span> <span id="s1871">Otherwise...</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q:You could leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A:Yes, you leave the Russian-occupied zone and go back into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A:And a lot of people started doing this, and we decided that this is what we must do, and we started preparing ourselves.</span> <span id="s1876">At that time I started looking for a few of my friends that I went to school together.</span> <span id="s1877">I did not find many.</span> <span id="s1878">They had left and went to Poland; they did not want to live under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s1879">I found a few older people that worked for my father, and I went to one of them that was the main baker in our bakery.</span> <span id="s1880">He had worked for my father many, many years, and to whom our little girl was given away during the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1881">And I came there and I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1882">I came with another friend of mine that was between the 11 girls and he opened the door and he looked at me and he called me by my Jewish name which is Dvorah, and he says, “My God, is it you?”</span> <span id="s1883">And I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1884">He said, “Is anybody else alive?”</span> <span id="s1885">And I said, “No, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1886">I came to look for my father.”</span> <span id="s1887">And he said, “Your father was not here, we have not seen him.”</span> <span id="s1888">It is now 1945, they had been liberated before because we were deep in Germany.</span> <span id="s1889">He said, “No, I don’t think that your father is alive, but there is one thing that I want you to know.</span> <span id="s1890">I have a few things that belonged to your family and I want you to have them.</span> <span id="s1891">I also will tell you who else has some stuff of yours, and I want you to go and take it.”</span> <span id="s1892">And he gave me quite a few things: for instance, he gave me my father’s hat that was made out of Persian lamb.</span> <span id="s1893">You know, this is what they wore then, the high Cossack hats.</span> <span id="s1894">He gave me my father’s, it was not a coat, but something you wear under a coat to keep warm; it was very expensive fur.</span> <span id="s1895">It was removable and you can wear the coat with or without.</span> <span id="s1896">In the winter you wear it and in the summer you wear the coat without it.</span> <span id="s1897">And he gave me like covers for a bed; they are like spreads but they are made out of, I don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s1898">At home you called it plush, it is not used here but back there it was a big thing.</span> <span id="s1899">You hung it on the walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q:Was it a coverlet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A:It covered the whole bed; you also used it as a table cloth.</span> <span id="s1902">It was quite expensive.</span> <span id="s1903">As a child, I did not appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1904">I think it was only put on the bed during the holidays; it was not used during the whole year.</span> <span id="s1905">He also gave me a lot of white material: you know, bales of white material and red material, that they used to make like pillow cases and bed sheets.</span> <span id="s1906">Now, we were girls without bras, without pants, without anything, so we cut it up and made some clothing for us.</span> <span id="s1907">He said, “What are you going to do here?”</span> <span id="s1908">And I said that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1909">I came to look if my father is alive.</span> <span id="s1910">He said, “Your father is not alive and nobody is alive from your family.”</span> <span id="s1911">And he said that he doesn’t think that I should stay there, and I said, “I am not.”</span> <span id="s1912">At that time we knew already that we are going away.</span> <span id="s1913">He didn’t feel that it was safe for us and I told him the stories about how they interrogated us.</span> <span id="s1914">And he said, “I don’t want you to stay here.</span> <span id="s1915">Just tell me how did you survive; you didn’t know how to butter a piece of bread in your life?”</span> <span id="s1916">I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1917">And he said, “You see, if you would have left the baby here you would have had a sister here.”</span> <span id="s1918">Tape 4 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q:This is tape four, B, continuing with Dora Freilich.</span> <span id="s1920">Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A:He said, “What can I do to help you while you are staying here?”</span> <span id="s1922">I said, “The only thing that we don’t have is we don’t have any food.”</span> <span id="s1923">We were just plain hungry.</span> <span id="s1924">He said, “All right.</span> <span id="s1925">I will give you some potatoes; I’ll make ready some meat for you, that I will chop up and we’ll put in a barrel.”</span> <span id="s1926">I don’t know how it stayed fresh.</span> <span id="s1927">We did not have any refrigeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q:This was August by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q:It was probably salted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A:Yes, we did have cellars.</span> <span id="s1932">They were cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q:It was probably a cold cellar in the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A:“Yes,” he said, “I just can’t believe that you are still alive.”</span> <span id="s1935">He said, “The more I look at you, the more scared I get.”</span> <span id="s1936">I said, “My gosh, you have been with us for so many years, you know it’s me.”</span> <span id="s1937">He said, “I know it’s you, but how did you do it?”</span> <span id="s1938">I said, “It’s a long story and I don’t know where to start.”</span> <span id="s1939">He said, “Is anybody else alive, I mean, from the town?”</span> <span id="s1940">He said, “I know that there is people that survived in the forest, and some came back and some did not.</span> <span id="s1941">Who is with you?”</span> <span id="s1942">So I told him of the girls that were with me and he came to visit us once and he cried, just cried.</span> <span id="s1943">He was then a man I would say in his 50’s.</span> <span id="s1944">He said that he just can’t bear looking at me without my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q:It was too painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A:He lived with us, that is, he did not commute to work.</span> <span id="s1947">And he used to go away for the weekends.</span> <span id="s1948">He was also a big drinker, and this is why it stands out in my memory.</span> <span id="s1949">My father used to always go and pick him up.</span> <span id="s1950">He loved to drink and he used to get drunk and my father used to go and pick him up from the bar, because the bakery was mostly worked at night, put him to sleep and give him something to eat.</span> <span id="s1951">And we children knew about it.</span> <span id="s1952">To us it was like a game.</span> <span id="s1953">We said, “Did Daddy pick up already?”</span> <span id="s1954">—his name was Wally—and at night he used to work and he said to me, “What are you going to do now?”</span> <span id="s1955">And I said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1956">I really don’t know; one thing I know is that we must leave this town.”</span> <span id="s1957">I went to our house and there was no house.</span> <span id="s1958">I went to our bakery and there was nothing left; it was all grown over with weeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q:What other things did you find from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A:We found a few copper things.</span> <span id="s1961">Copper was an expensive thing then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q:Like pots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1964">He also had a silver candelabra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q:It had belonged to your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1967">He also told me of a guy who was my father’s barber and was also a Gentile man and he said, “Go to him; I think your father gave away some stuff to him too.</span> <span id="s1968">I want you to have it.</span> <span id="s1969">It belongs to you.</span> <span id="s1970">I know your father probably had buried some stuff but I don’t know where; I wish I knew.</span> <span id="s1971">You know that everything would be yours now but I don’t know where it is.”</span> <span id="s1972">I said that it’s really not important to me because I really don’t know what’s going to be with my life.</span> <span id="s1973">The only thing that keeps me going is my hope that maybe, maybe I will find somebody of my family.</span> <span id="s1974">If not, I am not too thrilled about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1975">And so I went to this guy, this barber who also had a few things, like he had a few pieces of material that you make coats and suits out of and he gave it to me, and they all looked at me like I was a ghost.</span> <span id="s1976">They could not actually believe that anybody survived.</span> <span id="s1977">They did not know what happened.</span> <span id="s1978">There were rumors coming through but it was too early to reach there.</span> <span id="s1979">And finally we decided to leave the town; this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q:With the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A:With the girls, all of us.</span> <span id="s1982">There were trains going and we went and I think we had to pay for it, a certain amount of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q:Were you starting to gain some of the weight back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A:Yes, we ate and in fact we gained more than necessary because we ate more than necessary.</span> <span id="s1985">We were very hungry, and at that time we looked already halfway decent.</span> <span id="s1986">That was already, June, July, August; it was three months after the war.</span> <span id="s1987">The train, whoever wanted to leave, they had things like cows and horses, and you could take it with you.</span> <span id="s1988">It was like, what they called, I don’t know how to say in English, it was like transferring from one.</span> <span id="s1989">It was allowed if you were born in Poland and you lived in Poland until 1935 you were allowed to go back.</span> <span id="s1990">You were a citizen, a Polish citizen and you were allowed to go back to Poland and not live under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s1991">And so we boarded that train and we came to Lodz.</span> <span id="s1992">Lodz was one of the biggest cities in Poland and had a big Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1993">It was a big textile city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q:What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A:Before the war they had a lot of textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q:Oh, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A:And we came to that city and it was just before the holidays I think; it was in September.</span> <span id="s1998">I don’t remember whether it was the beginning or the end of September, or the middle of September, rather, but it was in September.</span> <span id="s1999">And here we are again, no money, and no home and no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q:Were there a lot of people on the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A:A lot of people; the chaos that the war had made was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2002">People were traveling from one city to the other looking for people, returning to their own cities, trying to find somebody that was alive, trying to see if their house was still standing, looking for some familiar things, to start over again, with something, to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s2003">I don’t mean monetary, to tie the loose ends together rather.</span> <span id="s2004">Some people found somebody, you know.</span> <span id="s2005">I did not.</span> <span id="s2006">The closest I had was three cousins that survived: two brothers and another cousin from another family.</span> <span id="s2007">One is dead already who lived in Israel, and two are here in the United States; they live in New York.</span> <span id="s2008">In Lodz we didn’t have where to live; we didn’t have a home, we didn’t have an apartment, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2009">There was a Jewish-like committee that took care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q:Do you know the name of the committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A:It was probably what they called the Yiddish kehilla.</span> <span id="s2012">I don’t know the name.</span> <span id="s2013">And we went to them and they gave us like rations, a half of bread, a can of sardines and a can of tuna fish, and we moved into one room where we lived maybe 20 people together, in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q:And this was all the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A:All the girls, and there was some other people that lived there before, that came before us, and he was a cap maker and he opened up like a little shop, and he was already like a little better off than us, and when he saw all of us and we were like, three girls from the same town and the rest was all from adjoining.</span> <span id="s2016">They were in the ghetto with us and we knew each other and we stuck together during the war.</span> <span id="s2017">So he gave us this room and we lived there in that room, like my husband said, we covered ourselves with one jacket, all 11 of us, and this is where I met my husband.</span> <span id="s2018">We started going out.</span> <span id="s2019">We had to make a living somehow, so we used to buy like things from other people that were already in the business, and there was a market in Lodz, like a piece of material for a suit, a watch, and we used to go out and buy it from them and then go out in the market and sell it.</span> <span id="s2020">It is very hard to explain how this started it, how this thing worked.</span> <span id="s2021">The ones that were more in it used to travel out of the city and bring it.</span> <span id="s2022">We used to buy it from them; we used to go out and sell it and make a few zlotys (that’s the Polish money), and finally one day I had enough money to buy a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s2023">I did not have a pair of shoes yet that fitted me properly.</span> <span id="s2024">I was at that time with my girlfriend who is now my sister-in-law too, and finally bought the shoes and we had a very good day in the market.</span> <span id="s2025">We sold I think a watch and we made a very good profit.</span> <span id="s2026">It is funny, but this is the only way we could make a living.</span> <span id="s2027">We didn’t know anything else how to do.</span> <span id="s2028">And she had met a guy, you know, we were young, and he started taking her out and he said to her, “You know, I have a brother too; maybe your girlfriend would like to meet my brother.”</span> <span id="s2029">And she said, “Well, why don’t you come up with him sometime and we will get acquainted?”</span> <span id="s2030">So they came up one evening, and they were doing the same thing, the two brothers: they were also selling and buying but in bigger extent than we did, and we got acquainted and he said, “How about we go out one night to the movies?”</span> <span id="s2031">You had to start living again.</span> <span id="s2032">You had to connect things, you had to somehow start mingling with the world, with the free world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q:To live again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A:Yes, you had to learn to live again.</span> <span id="s2035">And one day he made a date with me and he came to pick me up and I was looking for my shoes.</span> <span id="s2036">I told him that I bought this week a pair of shoes, we had a very good sale, and I couldn’t find the shoes in the room and we started joking around and he said, “You probably don’t want to go and you hid the shoes.”</span> <span id="s2037">And I said, “No, I didn’t.”</span> <span id="s2038">Any way, somebody stole the shoes and sold them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q:You were barefooted!</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A:I was sitting there barefooted again.</span> <span id="s2041">We made it into a big joke, and after this thing my husband tells the story...</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q:He wasn’t in the shoe business at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A:They were going in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q:That is probably why he picked a barefooted girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A:Probably.</span> <span id="s2046">His family was always in the shoe business and they were now deciding to open up a little shop.</span> <span id="s2047">He was the shoemaker and his brother who was older than him, he was the upper-maker, like he used to make the upper of the shoes.</span> <span id="s2048">He said, “I don’t believe it, that somebody in this room stole the shoes from you.”</span> <span id="s2049">I said, “Well, I don’t know where else to look; we looked all over and they are not there, they were brand new.”</span> <span id="s2050">And I was sitting on the bed, without shoes again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q:Tell me, did you have any medication at that time; were you able to get any, did you need it, was there any medical care at all around?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A:You know, the young people recuperated very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q:Once your stomach settled down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A:Yes, and once we started eating we didn’t have no problem, not in my age group, we didn’t have no problem.</span> <span id="s2055">I mean an occasional headache but that was nothing.</span> <span id="s2056">Our menstruation came back, we started menstruating and then, I don’t think that we went to doctors or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2057">We went to a dentist.</span> <span id="s2058">And we kept together, the survivors.</span> <span id="s2059">It was something, there was a silent bond between us that remains up until this day.</span> <span id="s2060">We tried to live near each other and to come together, go together.</span> <span id="s2061">We talked, we went to the movies, we went to the theater, we started to live again.</span> <span id="s2062">We were also trying to decide what we are going to do with our lives.</span> <span id="s2063">Otherwise staying in Poland was not our priority, because even after the war, there were times when people were killed, there were pogroms again starting and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q:Did you see any of this or did you just hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A:I heard about it.</span> <span id="s2066">We lived in Lodz.</span> <span id="s2067">The concentration of the Jewish survivors was concentrated in the bigger cities.</span> <span id="s2068">After they went to the little cities to see if there was anybody still alive and came back with nothing and they concentrated in the bigger cities, and this is where we stayed, in the bigger cities.</span> <span id="s2069">And everybody had friends, you know, we started writing letters and people started remembering that they had relatives somewhere in Canada or Cuba or America, and writing letters to relatives and things like this and deciding where to go.</span> <span id="s2070">The Polish people as a rule in Lodz were not thrilled with us.</span> <span id="s2071">We knew it; we avoided contact with them and we were also issued like passports; you had to carry it with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q:Was that the same as identification papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A:Something like it.</span> <span id="s2074">It was an affidavit that you needed from America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q:Proving that somebody was ready to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A:Somebody was ready to bring you here, otherwise you could not come unless you were provided with a job or a place to live.</span> <span id="s2077">This had to come from somebody.</span> <span id="s2078">The HIAS and the Joint did not help much.</span> <span id="s2079">There was help from the Jewish people; I don’t know how much of it reached us.</span> <span id="s2080">But everybody started, you know, there were people that were older than us and had trades and started opening up all different things, not to stay there but to survive and make a living, to be able to bring food on the table.</span> <span id="s2081">But one thing was in mind, that we must leave Poland, nobody wanted to live there.</span> <span id="s2082">Poland was just not a place for Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s2083">So we started to get ready to leave Poland and to go back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q:Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A:Again, the cycle was all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q:You didn’t have it in your mind to come to the United States?</span> <span id="s2087">At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A:We had in our minds, but you could not travel from Poland.</span> <span id="s2089">The Polish quota was so limited that probably they let in maybe ten people during a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q:What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A:It was 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q:Still the same year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A:At that time we decided.</span> <span id="s2094">We were going out, my girlfriend and me were going out with the two brothers and they wanted to go to Israel and we registered in a group as Greek Jews to be smuggled into Israel with the Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s2095">We were all given names and places where we are going, how to behave, how not to speak, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s2096">And the time came—I think it was in December, 1945—when our group was ready to go.</span> <span id="s2097">At that time, the Polish government knew and learned that there is something going on.</span> <span id="s2098">There were a lot of people from Palestine (it was not Israel yet) sent to look for young people, to save them and bring them to Israel, and they caught us on the way.</span> <span id="s2099">Our group was caught, and in order to avoid any brutality from the Polish police we said that we were going looking for relatives, and maybe we will find.</span> <span id="s2100">We went to a town that was called Kato–wice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q:How do you spell that, C or K?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A:K. K-A-T-O-W-I-C-E.</span> <span id="s2103">This is how it’s spelled in Polish.</span> <span id="s2104">We stayed there in that town and they took us into the police station and they searched us just like the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q:The Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A:The Polish police.</span> <span id="s2107">Their excuse was that they were looking for guns, did we carry guns.</span> <span id="s2108">Now, they knew very well that none of us was carrying a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q:Did they have women to help search you or did men do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A:The women searched the women and the men were searched by men.</span> <span id="s2111">And the whole thing was coming back to life that this was going to be a repetition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q:What month do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A:That was 1945, in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q:All right, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A:After, of course, they did not find any ammunition on us and there was nothing else that they could blame on us.</span> <span id="s2116">My husband hates it when he tells that story.</span> <span id="s2117">He feels so much hatred for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q:He is still angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A:He’s still angry, and we decided to return back to Lodz, and we decided that we are going to get married.</span> <span id="s2120">I mean you have to have a beginning.</span> <span id="s2121">And we got married together, three couples in one evening.</span> <span id="s2122">Me, my girlfriend who is now my sister-in-law, and another couple that was with us together, they were going to the market together, and we got married together.</span> <span id="s2123">And we were getting ready to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2124">We wanted to go to Israel very much but we must leave Poland, that was our aim, the anti-Semitism was just starting very bad and we knew that if the Poles had their way, they can do a better job than the Germans.</span> <span id="s2125">The Germans just taught them how to do it and they will do a better job yet.</span> <span id="s2126">So we came to Germany.</span> <span id="s2127">We lived in a displaced person camp in Feldafing, that was on the outskirts of Munich.</span> <span id="s2128">It was one of the biggest DP camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s2129">There were a lot of youths there, a lot of people that survived.</span> <span id="s2130">F-E-L-D-F-I-N-G [Feldafing].</span> <span id="s2131">There, of course, it was all survivors.</span> <span id="s2132">They made schools, they started opening up trade schools, teaching youths a trade, something, and of course preparing us that we will go to Israel, and most of us wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q:This was a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A:Oh, you could walk out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q:It was where everybody could meet but it had been a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A:It was not a concentration camp; they say it was a camp where they used to send soldiers for rest and recreation.</span> <span id="s2137">It was a very picturesque place; it was very beautiful there.</span> <span id="s2138">The barracks were nothing to rave about, but the place itself was surrounded by a sea.</span> <span id="s2139">It was wooded area, and it was made like into a city for us, otherwise.</span> <span id="s2140">There was like a management thing, where you came and you registered, you got a card, there was work to be done.</span> <span id="s2141">I think Eisenhower was at Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q:It was run by...</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A:The Americans.</span> <span id="s2144">I think I saw Eisenhower the first time there.</span> <span id="s2145">I didn’t know who he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Tape 5 of 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q:This is tape five, side one, of Dora Freilich’s story and this is Helen Gross–man doing the interviewing and she is at Feldafing.</span> <span id="s2148">Go ahead, Dora.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A:Feldafing is a displaced persons camp, DP.</span> <span id="s2150">It was run like a little city, with a little government and schools which we need.</span> <span id="s2151">We have to be attached to something with somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q:To get your life back to normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A:To get our life back together, although we did not know about psychologists and psychiatry.</span> <span id="s2154">But we did have meetings and we talk about it, and the Americans are sponsoring it.</span> <span id="s2155">Feldafing is in the American Zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q:Is this still 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A:This is 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q:All right, go ahead.</span> <span id="s2159">How long were you at Feldafing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A:We were in Feldafing from 1946 until 1949, until we left to immigrate to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q:But in the meantime the organization at Feldafing helped.</span> <span id="s2162">Tell the story about the policeman before you go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A:As I said, we had our own little town, our own little government.</span> <span id="s2164">We opened up shops and everybody tried to do something.</span> <span id="s2165">One sold potatoes and one sold onions and one sold a chicken in the market, and cucumbers; and my husband and brother-in-law opened up a little shop and made shoes.</span> <span id="s2166">Some were tailors and you started to get your life back on the road again.</span> <span id="s2167">And we had meetings, we had dances, to which we went.</span> <span id="s2168">It’s not funny, it’s not cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q:You had to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A:Yes, unless you commit suicide, you must go on living and you wanted to live.</span> <span id="s2171">Somehow, the will power to go on living was so strong you felt like you are the only survivor of the family and you must carry on in honor of your family.</span> <span id="s2172">You go on living, and it was not easy.</span> <span id="s2173">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s2174">But everybody being in the same boat, it was easier.</span> <span id="s2175">Each and every one of us went through their own little hell, so somehow we all tried together to help each other and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s2176">And one day this policeman got killed at the station in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s2177">The train arrived or the train was departing, I don’t remember exactly what it was, but a Jewish policeman to be killed in Germany after the war!</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q:Killed by...</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A:A German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q:By a civilian, or another policeman, or a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A:I don’t think that they ever found out who killed him.</span> <span id="s2182">The demonstrations that we had; we had marched into the city, as civilized people, with banners.</span> <span id="s2183">We had a funeral for him and the whole camp attended.</span> <span id="s2184">I call it camp again but it was a displaced persons camp, and we all marched.</span> <span id="s2185">We wore white gloves and black ties, and black skirts.</span> <span id="s2186">This is my girlfriend who lives in Miami now; she is alive and I see her on occasion when we go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q:Oh, you had a banner, a flag, oh my.</span> <span id="s2188">Would you call this a magazine or a program?</span> <span id="s2189">(Dora is showing me a, what is it called?)</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A:It is a program from Feldafing, with her own picture, marching, holding a banner, when the policeman was killed.</span> <span id="s2191">When a Jewish policeman was killed.</span> <span id="s2192">We were demonstrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q:It is marked 1946 here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q:That is great that you have that.</span> <span id="s2196">Then you decided to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A:Everybody was registering different places.</span> <span id="s2198">People started to get letters from families, from Canada, from Cuba, from the United States, from Argentina.</span> <span id="s2199">A lot of Jews had emigrated before the war to Argentina.</span> <span id="s2200">And I knew that I have two uncles here.</span> <span id="s2201">I didn’t know exactly the addresses or anything but my younger uncle was in the army and he had looked for me, not for me but for somebody from the family and somebody had told him that they think that I am alive.</span> <span id="s2202">They had not seen me but rumors used to go because people were constantly going.</span> <span id="s2203">This was the thing after the war, you went from city to city and you constantly looked, and to this day, I constantly look; it is something in me, I always look and this one looks like someone and this one got older.</span> <span id="s2204">I always look; maybe, maybe... My daughter is now interested in tracing the roots.</span> <span id="s2205">The roots now is a very big thing and they had a meeting and you asked me before about if they are united, the children of the Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s2206">They had a meeting a couple of weeks ago and they had a guy, I don’t know his name, but what do you call a guy, they have a special name for one that goes in and looks for the roots?</span> <span id="s2207">They had invited him to speak before them, and he had spoken.</span> <span id="s2208">And he told them that he himself is not a survivor; he is an American-born person, but they had invited him to speak, and he told them how to go about it.</span> <span id="s2209">How you can find things, and this is what my daughter is now completely interested in.</span> <span id="s2210">She wants to go as far as she can go.</span> <span id="s2211">I said, “Go ahead, we will see how far we can go.”</span> <span id="s2212">She has it all written down, but he said, in the remotest places, where people wouldn’t even think of looking, people have different documents, cities, magistrates, are laying around that nobody is interested in.</span> <span id="s2213">He said that once he had to look for a document in a cellar, and he had to spend almost the whole night there and he looked like he was in a chimney, but he found things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q:Tell me how you felt about yourself after it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A:Well, after it was all over, I don’t think it hit us yet; the impact of it did not hit us at that moment that we were liberated or for that matter even when I traveled to my home town.</span> <span id="s2216">You still had in the back of your mind that maybe.</span> <span id="s2217">The impact really hit me when I was already free, in a free country, between free people and being the mother of a child, and this was the most critical time in my life.</span> <span id="s2218">I used to sit and look at a child and think of what a precious past I robbed her, because if she had been born to somebody else she would have had everything that I took away from her, grandparents, aunts, uncles, places to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q:You didn’t take them away.</span> <span id="s2220">They were taken from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A:But I felt that if she had been born to somebody else, because she was mine she would have to struggle through life together with me, and I was not thrilled about life.</span> <span id="s2222">I still did not know how to go on living.</span> <span id="s2223">I was existing.</span> <span id="s2224">I was just pulling through day to day.</span> <span id="s2225">I was now on my own; I was not surrounded with all my friends no more.</span> <span id="s2226">I mean it can not be for a lifetime.</span> <span id="s2227">You move.</span> <span id="s2228">And we established a life on our own, and you have to mingle with people, with free people, and you have to learn how to do it and it is very hard.</span> <span id="s2229">And I think that this was my most critical time in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q:You used the word guilt before, felt guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A:Very, very guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q:Because you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A:Because I survived.</span> <span id="s2234">In fact, I used to get angry when people said to me how lucky I was.</span> <span id="s2235">I was not lucky at all, I didn’t think I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2236">I thought that I was being punished for being alive.</span> <span id="s2237">I thought that this is a continuation of the same thing.</span> <span id="s2238">So I was not in a concentration camp, but I was alone, I was still alone.</span> <span id="s2239">I had nobody to talk to, I had no family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q:You were married then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A:I was married and I had a child.</span> <span id="s2242">My husband went to work.</span> <span id="s2243">I had a little furnished room, but besides this I didn’t have nothing else, and this is what people could not understand.</span> <span id="s2244">They thought that just by being alive that I am lucky, but that is not the way that I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q:In other words, it was your family that you missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A:I missed the family.</span> <span id="s2247">I missed somebody to tell good news, to tell bad news.</span> <span id="s2248">I didn’t have nobody to tell it to.</span> <span id="s2249">One thing that sticks out in my mind, and this is after I came to the United States, and I probably started going into labor, but I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2250">Nobody ever told me about it.</span> <span id="s2251">My aunt was away and she had a hotel and she used to go away in, like in April, to set it up for the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q:She was in the mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A:No, she was in Sharon Springs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q:All right, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A:She left me in the house, and there was her son who was at that time 13 years old, who, I can put in, is now a Supreme Court Justice.</span> <span id="s2256">And my husband was not back from work yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q:What was his name, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A:Melvin Tannenbaum.</span> <span id="s2259">That was my mother’s maiden name, Tannenbaum.</span> <span id="s2260">And somebody had told my husband about an apartment and he said that on the way back from work he is going to stop and look at the apartment because he knew the time is near that I am going to have a baby and that we will have to move out.</span> <span id="s2261">I felt uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2262">They had a little girl of five and a boy of 13 and it was kind of crowded.</span> <span id="s2263">I went into the bathroom and I started...I wasn’t feeling good and I came out and I said to him, “I don’t feel good.”</span> <span id="s2264">And he said, “What is wrong with you?”</span> <span id="s2265">He was 13 years old or 13-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s2266">And I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2267">I didn’t know how to tell him that my water had busted.</span> <span id="s2268">I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2269">Nobody had ever told me.</span> <span id="s2270">He said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2271">We are going to call my aunt and tell her what happened.</span> <span id="s2272">You tell her in Yiddish, if you don’t know how to say it in English.”</span> <span id="s2273">And he called her up.</span> <span id="s2274">Her name was Frieda and he said, “Dora wants to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s2275">And I said, “Frieda, something happened.</span> <span id="s2276">I don’t know what happened but something is wrong.”</span> <span id="s2277">She said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s2278">And I told her, and she said, “Do you know what?</span> <span id="s2279">Tell Melvin to call a taxi and go to the hospital and I will follow as soon as my husband comes from work.”</span> <span id="s2280">She had two small children.</span> <span id="s2281">I came to the hospital and my husband didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2282">He was looking at an apartment, and obviously, I wasn’t ready yet.</span> <span id="s2283">I saw the girls walking around, everybody getting ready for her time and now I could understand it, but at that time I could not understand it, why she put around my bed the curtains and also the sides up on the bed.</span> <span id="s2284">I was only two months in this country.</span> <span id="s2285">I came in March, and the baby was born May 19th.</span> <span id="s2286">And I could not understand why she was doing this to me when I have to go to the ladies’ room constantly, and she said that you don’t have to go anymore, and I said that I have to go, and I thought that if I only could speak English and explain to her, she wouldn’t do this to me.</span> <span id="s2287">I thought that people are doing things to me because they don’t understand me.</span> <span id="s2288">She was doing it because I was probably ready and she did not want me to get out of bed anymore.</span> <span id="s2289">But not me.</span> <span id="s2290">I climbed over the thing and I went anyway, and when I came back they said, “Where were you?”</span> <span id="s2291">And I said, “I went to the ladies’ room; that was where I had to go.”</span> <span id="s2292">And she said, “Well, you are not going anymore.”</span> <span id="s2293">This I understood, and then my baby was born.</span> <span id="s2294">I had a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q:I can’t tell you how much we appreciate your giving us your story.</span> <span id="s2296">It is going to mean an awful lot to the Archives.</span> <span id="s2297">It will be used seriously, and for this I thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">The Bund was actually a
