and we moved to Oradea,which is a big city also in North Transylvania--some seventy, seventy-five kilometers from Beliu.</span> <span id="s73">There we had...my father bought a house, a small house; and also in that house he opened a grocery story again.</span> <span id="s74">And I continue my high school in Oradea.</span> <span id="s75">[Altiadona (ph)] was the name of the high school; a very good, state high school--a girl's high school.</span> <span id="s76">Because in Romania the girls were separated from boys--different uh building, different street even.</span> <span id="s77">And I graduated there; and I was a very good student.</span> <span id="s78">Every...end of every year in Oradea, I was uh...I get medals; because I was a very good student.</span> <span id="s79">You call it premiums?</span> <span id="s80">Books and some medals; and I was considered a very good student.</span> <span id="s81">And I..</span> <span id="s82">.</span> <span id="s83">really I was.</span> <span id="s84">That means when I graduated, when I..</span> <span id="s85">.</span> <span id="s86">when ...when I had the baccalaureate exam at the end; because in Romania, that you finish with the high school you have to pass a other very, very difficult exam.</span> <span id="s87">They call it baccalaureate exam.</span> <span id="s88">And to that exam, they came from the other cities student to the Institute to pass that...that exam.</span> <span id="s89">The commission was formed from university professors, not local.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">And we were to that...inscribed to that uh exam, around seventy students; and I was the third one in the grade which I pass it.</span> <span id="s91">Very good grade.</span> <span id="s92">That was in May...in June 1940; and that was the last graduation at Romanian schools in North Transylvania.</span> <span id="s93">Because on August 30 was the Vienna Dictatum, and in September 6th the Hungarian army entered in North Transylvania.</span> <span id="s94">That mean, uh Oradea became uh Hungary; but South Transylvania, where is part of my family was living there, there...that's Romania, and...still Romania.</span> <span id="s95">Because the Hungarian had a law--uh, Numerus Nullus--for the students to enter the universities in the first year and the second year, I was not accepted to study further.</span> <span id="s96">I mean, to go to university.</span> <span id="s97">Because I would like to, in that time and after that, very much to study further.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">But I wasn't accepted, because of this law.</span> <span id="s99">And uh...then at the end of September, I went to the Jewish hospital in Oradea.</span> <span id="s100">Was a medium-sized Jewish hospital, some one hundred beds.</span> <span id="s101">And I was train to work in the laboratory of that hospital.</span> <span id="s102">And then, after very short time, I get a job.</span> <span id="s103">That means I was paid.</span> <span id="s104">Very low salary, but I had something to do.</span> <span id="s105">And I was...I worked there until, uh, came the... the Nazis enter in Oradea in 19...I mean, in Hungary in 19 March, 1940--'44. '</span> <span id="s106">44.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Can we stop at this point?</span> <span id="s108">Can you tell me a little bit about what Oradea was like between 1940 when the Hungarians came in and 1944 when the Nazis came in?</span> <span id="s109">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Was...was a..</span> <span id="s111">.</span> <span id="s112">a atmosphere of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s113">The Arrow Cross uh Party in Hungary--the 1 Also: Oradea Mare.</span> <span id="s114">Hungarian name: Nagyvárad.</span> <span id="s115">German name: Grosswardein.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Nyilaskeresztes Party they call it--start to make propaganda and wrote all kinds of graffiti on the walls against the Jew.</span> <span id="s117">And, uh, the commun...the people, if they thought that they are communist, they were taken away.</span> <span id="s118">And, uh, was a very strange atmosphere.</span> <span id="s119">People were...it...we...we heard about what happened in Poland and, uh, in Germany, about the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s120">And, uh, we got a little bit, uh, scared, but everything happen far away from us.</span> <span id="s121">Even we saw, because we were living very close to the main railroad station in Oradea.</span> <span id="s122">I saw long wagons with people taken from...they said they are from Ukraine.</span> <span id="s123">I don't know, I don't think they were Jew.</span> <span id="s124">They were prisoners, and they take them to Germany to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">And people start...uh, tried to give them bread and water through the window.</span> <span id="s126">They were in...in cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s127">But the Hungarian, uh, gendarmes didn't let ge...uh, get close to those wagons.</span> <span id="s128">That I saw, and I ...I hear about what's going on.</span> <span id="s129">We had radios, and we hear what is happening; but we said, "This can't happen to us.”</span> <span id="s130">We very... we were very optimistic, a little bit.</span> <span id="s131">Very fool optimistic.</span> <span id="s132">And then when the Nazis, the Germans, occupy Hungary--really occupy, in 19...March 1944, that was March 19th--starting from April 1st, 1st of April, we were uh wearing the David uh star on our clotheses.</span> <span id="s133">And I was afraid to go in downtown or in the streetcars without star on...on my coat--because was still uh spring, and I was wearing still a coat.</span> <span id="s134">But I went to work.</span> <span id="s135">That time, I left the hospital because the hospital was occupied by SS.</span> <span id="s136">And uh Jewish girl, other friend of mine, was working in the x-ray lab.</span> <span id="s137">She also didn't went to work for them.</span> <span id="s138">And also I left the hospital, because we were afraid to go to work for uh ...in the presence of the SS.</span> <span id="s139">Maybe they wouldn't take it out either.</span> <span id="s140">But I left the hospital, and I start to work only a few weeks at [Angelo (ph)]--was the name of that photo company.</span> <span id="s141">And I was working their laboratory developing films and doing copies on...and so on.</span> <span id="s142">And I went home always when was already dark; and I put a uh overcoat over uh...about my coat, that the uh... the Star of David can't be seen.</span> <span id="s143">But my parents didn't let me continue to work; that they were very afraid that they're going to catch me.</span> <span id="s144">That means, I stopped working at [Angelo (ph)] before the ghetto, be two weeks.</span> <span id="s145">Then on--that was from 1st of April, we had the Star of David.</span> <span id="s146">At first May, the same year--I mean, '44, 1944--they start to take people into the ghetto in Oradea.</span> <span id="s147">Ghetto was around the orthodox synagogue in Oradea.</span> <span id="s148">That was the Jewish quarter...quartier.</span> <span id="s149">And in the hospital... they...the...in the synagogue, they set up the hospital.</span> <span id="s150">And uh in the ghetto, we moved to a family who was the rabbi in the town of Beliu.</span> <span id="s151">But unfortunately, he too, after the Hungarian came to Oradea...come North Transylvania, he want to be moved from Beliu to Oradea.</span> <span id="s152">And they...we move in their apartment; because we stay in the one room, and they stay--only the old man and his wife--in the other room.</span> <span id="s153">And I start to work in the hospital in the ghetto; doing very simple, very routine test.</span> <span id="s154">Because they didn't have the equipment.</span> <span id="s155">They don't let to take the equipment from the Jewish hospital to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s156">Just simple test: drawing blood and doing some urine test.</span> <span id="s157">Very simple test.</span> <span id="s158">And also they trained me to give shots, because they didn't have enough nurses.</span> <span id="s159">And that was from 4th May.</span> <span id="s160">That was my birthday when they took me to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s161">And we were there until May 26th, when start the deportation from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s162">I didn't want to let my parents alone; and I preferred to stay with them and go with them, not with the hospital group.</span> <span id="s163">And that was my luck, because the people with the hospital group--nurses, uh sick people, everybody, doctors--they were taken direct in Auschwitz to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s164">That at 1st of June, going to the rail station--not the main train station in Oradea, to a littlest rail station in the [Rajdio (ph)] Park--they put us in the wagons.</span> <span id="s165">Cattle wagons, very very crowded wagons.</span> <span id="s166">We...everyone had just a little room to sit down.</span> <span id="s167">They put a [kibla (ph)] for uh toilet.</span> <span id="s168">No water, no nothing...a little water daily, but in a half-hour it was gone.</span> <span id="s169">And they locked the door from outside, and the train left the railroad.</span> <span id="s170">They told us--these were the Hungarian gendarmes who take us to the...to the...to the wagons--in the way before we start to leave the ghetto, they came with a bag to each of us and say, "You have to put in this bag all your jewelry.”</span> <span id="s171">They took my earrings, my watch, my ring.</span> <span id="s172">Everybody put his jewelry in that bag.</span> <span id="s173">That means the Hungarian gendarmes took those jewelries, not to... Because people, uh...they hide at home, or give to somebody to keep them; but even they keep earrings or uh watches.</span> <span id="s174">Then the wagons start and they said that they will take us to north Hungary in the puszta [the Hungarian prairie] to work in ...on the farms.</span> <span id="s175">And we...we trust them; but later on they mis...we find out that they misled us.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Because then we arrived in Kassa.That was the last Hungarian north city in Hungary.</span> <span id="s177">After Kassa start already...well, the...the border to Czechoslovakia, which was occupied by German in that time.</span> <span id="s178">And because we then...they didn't get out at Kassa, didn't let out us to get out from the wagon in Kassa.</span> <span id="s179">They...the wagon and the train went to Poland.</span> <span id="s180">And...in Czechoslovakia, and then to Poland.</span> <span id="s181">In that moment, everybody was very very very scared; because we find out that they misled us, that we be in no Hungary, no puszta work, no nothing.</span> <span id="s182">They took us to Poland, but we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s183">And we traveled...I don't know, from Monday morning 'til uh Thursday dawn--I mean, Thursday early morning--when we arrive in...in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s184">When we arrived there, we smelled the smoke.</span> <span id="s185">Was dark.</span> <span id="s186">And when we get out from the wagons, we saw people out the doors stripped dresses...uh, coats.</span> <span id="s187">They were Polish people, mostly.</span> <span id="s188">They speak Yiddish; and they said, "You have to do separate lanes...uh, lines.</span> <span id="s189">The men for on one side, the women on the other side.”</span> <span id="s190">And they told to the womens--they have young children on their arms, or uh beside them--they said, "Give the children to the old people, old womans.”</span> <span id="s191">We didn't...these poor womans, they didn't know what means.</span> <span id="s192">Which mother would left their child out from their hands?</span> <span id="s193">And then we have...there we have time to say adieu to my father, to kiss him.</span> <span id="s194">And then (pause - crying) ...then we start to go ahead in line.</span> <span id="s195">I was in the same line (pause - crying) ...with my mother and with the lady what...who...whom house we were living in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s196">I mean, the rabbi wife.</span> <span id="s197">And we just passed a few, I don't know maybe ha...quarter of mile.</span> <span id="s198">Very short way.</span> <span id="s199">And we saw a big side lights on the...directed towards us, that...and on there was staying a very nice looking SS man.</span> <span id="s200">And we find out later that man was Mengele.</span> <span id="s201">And beside him there were some helper--people with those stripped coats; and with the...his hand he pointed to people.</span> <span id="s202">And because I was not on his side on the line--I was the inside line--he pointed to me, and came two men.</span> <span id="s203">They grabbed me and put me out from the line, on the right side.</span> <span id="s204">I didn't have time to kiss my mother, or to see...to say something to her.</span> <span id="s205">I was terrible shock.</span> <span id="s206">And after that we find out that the people, they... I mean, the women, they... All the people--I mean, my mother and all the others-- they then direct to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">2 Hungarian name for city currently located in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s208">Czech name: Košice (German name: Kaschau).</span> <span id="s209">Located in an area which originally belonged to Hungary, but was made part of Czechoslovakia in 1918; occupied by Hungary from 1938 to 1945, but returned to Czechoslovakia after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">And they...when we were around one uh hundred or maybe more on the right side, they take us to the bath.</span> <span id="s211">We left all our clotheses on the floor.</span> <span id="s212">They cut our hair from all our body; and we get a shower.</span> <span id="s213">We...you know?</span> <span id="s214">We...and then, with[out] any towel or anything, just that's how we were, they give us a very very strange looking dress: long, short, terrible-looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">And some also very bad shoes; and they put us immediately, still wet, outside in the... in the yard.</span> <span id="s216">Outside the wash building.</span> <span id="s217">And there, from far away, were the mens also; because we saw people with those stripped coats.</span> <span id="s218">And up today, I think--and maybe was just imagining-- that I saw my father between them.</span> <span id="s219">But I have...I was not sure.</span> <span id="s220">Then from there after a while, after waiting outside maybe one hour, two hours--I don't remember exactly how long time -- we marched to the C Lager.</span> <span id="s221">And they put us in the Block 15.</span> <span id="s222">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s223">Just some uh straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s224">And, uh, the Blockälteste who was a Slovak--I mean, the Jewish girl from Slovakia--that was the Blockälteste.</span> <span id="s225">I mean, the boss over us.</span> <span id="s226">And she has some Stubdienst--I mean, some helper--also Slovakian, because they spoke German.</span> <span id="s227">These people, they were...they have some, uh, position.</span> <span id="s228">I mean, Blockälteste or Stubdienst were, uh, choosed by the SS because they spoke...spake, uh, German, or a little bit Yiddish.</span> <span id="s229">They understood German.</span> <span id="s230">And those Blockältestes, they're very very bad people.</span> <span id="s231">They start to scream to us, "Why you came...let them to take you here?</span> <span id="s232">You know they are...they want to put you in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s233">Your parents are on the smoke.”</span> <span id="s234">Uh, terrible things they talk...talk.</span> <span id="s235">Everybody was in shock--crying, screaming.</span> <span id="s236">We didn't know...up to that moment, we didn't know anything what's going on.</span> <span id="s237">And many people, they lost their consciousness and they get their prayers....</span> <span id="s238">Terrible situation happen in the block.</span> <span id="s239">Crying, screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Many, uh, some of them went to the...to the fence, touched the wire.</span> <span id="s241">Get, uh...and they die, because they were with electricity.</span> <span id="s242">Very, very terrible situation happens.</span> <span id="s243">Then...we were sleeping on the floor, on that straw.</span> <span id="s244">And...and the night was pretty cold, because in--I don't know what kind of climate-- maybe because we had only one cloth on...one dress on us.</span> <span id="s245">In early morning in dark, they took us outside from the block to say the "Appell"--counting us.</span> <span id="s246">Sitting five in a row or, uh, sometimes more, and they count and they count us hundred times, 'cause they knew how many should be.</span> <span id="s247">And the many times they made mistakes, and again count.</span> <span id="s248">And we stood out on that terrible....</span> <span id="s249">I mean, was cold in the early morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Very, very, uh, tight to each other;

and the SS uh woman saw this, and they punish both of us.</span> <span id="s290">We put down the container aside, and they take us to the C Lager gate, and said to us to kneel.</span> <span id="s291">And we took bricks, bricks in our hands.</span> <span id="s292">We held up our hands with the bricks, and stayed there from the...from dawn until the sun was...I think was already noon.</span> <span id="s293">And we were very afraid with the other girl, because we...in that time, we know already about crematorium.</span> <span id="s294">And we were afraid that maybe as a punishment they going to take us to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s295">But uh at noon, they let us go back to the block.</span> <span id="s296">And during that time when we were staying kneeling with the bricks on our hands, we were uh heard from far...from far away their music bands playing "The Merry Widow.”</span> <span id="s297">And we were crying and crying (crying), listening to that music; because I knew that uh music from my home, from before.</span> <span id="s298">And then finally at noon they let us go back to the to the block, and we were happy that we escaped and they didn't take us to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s299">And since then, I never went to carry those uh container.</span> <span id="s300">Even when I was very hungry, I was very afraid of something happen and that's the end.</span> <span id="s301">In August, came...they announce in the block that those people they were working in before--I mean, in their homes, in laboratory, in photography, as uh seam...as uh tailors--that means they have fine hands, fine fingers.</span> <span id="s302">They go aside, and they choose us.</span> <span id="s303">I don't know how many we were in our block.</span> <span id="s304">Maybe twenty-five, thirty.</span> <span id="s305">They take us to the Lager, the Block number 10.</span> <span id="s306">And there were also girls from other uh blocks from the C Lager, also in the same category.</span> <span id="s307">After a while--maybe one week, ten days later--came a commission... I mean, two civil wearing....</span> <span id="s308">I mean, not SS.</span> <span id="s309">Two men, and uh two SS men; and we had to pass in front.</span> <span id="s310">They took in a..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">in a room where on the wall there were a sign like in a ophthalmology office.</span> <span id="s313">And we, they put us to read the numbers, to what...and they were looking how our eyes are good or not.</span> <span id="s314">I mean, what line, lower line you can read.</span> <span id="s315">And also they touch our fingers.</span> <span id="s316">And uh I was choosen to go with that group, but I don't know where.</span> <span id="s317">We didn't know where, whats means that.</span> <span id="s318">And they choose three hundred of us.</span> <span id="s319">Only three hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">They take us to B Lager in a block.</span> <span id="s321">Empty block.</span> <span id="s322">That means, only we were there.</span> <span id="s323">They say that they going to keep us in quarantine for...I don't, I think three weeks.</span> <span id="s324">To see if somebody gets sick or some contagious illness.</span> <span id="s325">Unfortunately, one of the girls get sick; and they said that she has typhus.</span> <span id="s326">I don't know if it's true or not, but they keep us, I think, two...uh ten days more, to see if other girls get sick or not.</span> <span id="s327">But nobody gets sick; and I don't think she had typhus.</span> <span id="s328">Just a diarrhea, or something [like] that.</span> <span id="s329">We don't...didn't have doctors there, just uh uh nurses; or there wasn't a good diagnostic to say that is typhus or not.</span> <span id="s330">Anyway, after...in the...after the quarantine was over, in the end of September, they put us in a wagon, in a truck.</span> <span id="s331">They take us to the wash...I mean, to the shower room in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s332">We were afraid to go...always we were afraid to go to shower, because in the shower happened that they let the gas come out in...instead of water, they said.</span> <span id="s333">I don't know, but they said that that was the way how they did it.</span> <span id="s334">We...we get a shower there, and we get pretty good dre...clotheses.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Underwear, better dress, coat, better shoes, some uh stockings.</span> <span id="s336">That was something uh batik [NB: a scarf] on the...in the head.</span> <span id="s337">We...we feel pretty ba...good, because we we didn't have lice in that time.</span> <span id="s338">But uh we very much afraid of lice.</span> <span id="s339">During the Auschwitz stage, I passed two times through a selection.</span> <span id="s340">There came doctors from uh...I don't know from where, SS doctor; and we...we...naked, we shoot past in front of them.</span> <span id="s341">And if somebody have some little uh sign on his...on his uh body, this for put on the left.</span> <span id="s342">And they took them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s343">Was terrible selection, because they were afraid that the whole Lager B is going to have typhus or some kind of contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s344">And they do this...I was passing two times this kind of selection; but thanks God, I didn't have any thing on my body and I..</span> <span id="s345">.</span> <span id="s346">I go through.</span> <span id="s347">Now after we had that better clothes, we...they take us in a wagon.</span> <span id="s348">Not... not cattle wagon; a better wagon.</span> <span id="s349">Was not dirty, was pretty good.</span> <span id="s350">And they take us to Weißwasser.Was a place that the telephone ca...company had a big factory of air plane lamps.</span> <span id="s351">My factory was very close to Breslau [NB: Wroc_aw].</span> <span id="s352">And there we have three barracks.</span> <span id="s353">Each one of us, we had individual beds; uh, some, uh...some, uh, beds...not bed sheets, but uh blankets.</span> <span id="s354">Was uh was a a brick oven there.</span> <span id="s355">That means, in the winter we had some brick, and we...we...we stay in warm room.</span> <span id="s356">And from there we were walking every morning to the factory, under the supervision of the SS woman.</span> <span id="s357">And, uh, we worked eight hours, and at night we came home.</span> <span id="s358">I was working first in the chemistry lab, because I was registered as a laboratory technician.</span> <span id="s359">But then they put me to...after a short while they transfer me to the Cathode Abteilung [NB: Cathode Workshop].</span> <span id="s360">That means I did the cathode part of the...of those lamps.</span> <span id="s361">Very fine, very little pieces, with, uh, four chips working, uh...very, very fine.</span> <span id="s362">Very small, and very fine job.</span> <span id="s363">All day with the lights on those cathodes; and with some machine, I pinch each one and put something on the end.</span> <span id="s364">Anyway, was very...a good situation there; because we was warm in the la...in the factory.</span> <span id="s365">That means, we were not feeling the winter.</span> <span id="s366">Was already winter.</span> <span id="s367">The food was not too much; but, uh, we had a nurse in the...in that, uh, barracks, was a part of barracks was the infirmary.</span> <span id="s368">There somebody if he has something, uh, sick or, uh, cold or diarrhea was taken there; and the nurse was a Jewish girl was taking care.</span> <span id="s369">But they didn't keep...keep us too long in the infirmary, because they were also afraid that they going to take us to crema[torium].</span> <span id="s370">Because they say that Groß Rosen--or I don't know which camp--was not far from there.</span> <span id="s371">And I 3 Subcamp of Groß Rosen.</span> <span id="s372">There were actually two subcamps with this name, one located at Kreis Rothenberg in Lower Silesia and the other at Kreis Hohenstadt in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s373">The camp in Sudetenland is where Firma Telefunken had its facility.</span> <span id="s374">The camp in Lower Silesia had a glassworks.</span> <span id="s375">It was evacuated in February 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">remember I was one time I was very very hungry and very very very weak.</span> <span id="s377">I went to the factory.</span> <span id="s378">I work, but I feel very weak.</span> <span id="s379">And the nurse was a very good person.</span> <span id="s380">I still...a long time I keep in touch with her.</span> <span id="s381">She remain in Sweden.</span> <span id="s382">She married a Swedish man.</span> <span id="s383">And we ...when we...when I was in the infirmary, she gave me extra food; and I get it, little bit, I feel much better after uh three, four days.</span> <span id="s384">And also she told me to came...after they divided the food to everybody, to came to the infirmary.</span> <span id="s385">And she gave me a little extra food.</span> <span id="s386">She was a very good person.</span> <span id="s387">She gave extra food to those girls they were a little bit...know a little bit they were weaker.</span> <span id="s388">And I was between those.</span> <span id="s389">Then, at end of February--we were there from October [1944] 'til end of February [1945]--during the night we start to hear all kind of noises; airplane and shooting.</span> <span id="s390">And they said that the Russia are starting to clo...to get closer and closer.</span> <span id="s391">And they evacuate the...that... those barracks, and they put us on feet to walk.</span> <span id="s392">I don't remember exact the place where they took us--other Lager.</span> <span id="s393">And there also were a good number of people.</span> <span id="s394">They took those people, too; attached to our group, go further.</span> <span id="s395">Like a snowball; at the end, we were a lot of people.</span> <span id="s396">I don't know how many--thousand, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">And from that date--from Feb..</span> <span id="s398">.</span> <span id="s399">end of February until end of April, that means March--two months, more than two months, we were all the time going from here to there by foot, by train...uh getting out from the train, on the camp.</span> <span id="s400">And eating green leaves, and no water.</span> <span id="s401">And then we start to get a lot, a lot of lice; because we didn't have water to drink nor to wash ourselfs.</span> <span id="s402">And already was uh...at one night we were in wagon and the wagon was lock up.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">One night we heard the SS men outside talking, of the wagon, "Our Führer is dead."</span> <span id="s404">-- "Alter ist töt," he said.</span> <span id="s405">And we...we just were listening, and we di.</span> <span id="s406">.</span> <span id="s407">we didn't know which Führer; because was a Führer of the camp, and was the Führer Hitler.</span> <span id="s408">And then after that--that was around end of April...23, 24th April.</span> <span id="s409">Something like that; we didn't know exactly.</span> <span id="s410">I just glad said these, uh...find out this date.</span> <span id="s411">After a while, they...we were very close to Denmark, we find out; to the Denmark border.</span> <span id="s412">They put us...they take us from the wagon, and they set us in lane on that camp.</span> <span id="s413">And around us they set up some cannons, you know?</span> <span id="s414">And we were very, very afraid that they going to kill us.</span> <span id="s415">You know, I don't know how you call those, which uh...Katushkaor something, they kill in line people.</span> <span id="s416">We say, "Now, this is the end!"</span> <span id="s417">But after short time, maybe half hour, we saw an airplane flying very low.</span> <span id="s418">And then gear down, landed not far from that point.</span> <span id="s419">Pass maybe one hour, two hours.</span> <span id="s420">They said, "Get up, go back to the wagon.”</span> <span id="s421">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s422">Then we were sitting in the wagon; and in that moment, the SS was change to the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s423">People came...I mean, Wehrmacht soldiers came to take over the wagons.</span> <span id="s424">And they were sit...they opened the door, and we were sitting on the floor with the legs outside, clinging outside from the wagon.</span> <span id="s425">And he said--I remember I was very close to the door--and he said, "Yah, you're going to go to the good places.</span> <span id="s426">What...I don't know what going to happen to us.”</span> <span id="s427">And we passed through very nice places, very nice uh towns and very nice places we go ...we went with the wagons through.</span> <span id="s428">And we didn't know what were going on.</span> <span id="s429">After a short while the train stop, they open large the doors; and we saw... I was not in the first wagon.</span> <span id="s430">I was mostly in the middlest part of the wagon, but was a very long train.</span> <span id="s431">I find out later that we...that mean, we were four thousand.</span> <span id="s432">And during this uh going and coming, many times we... we observe that in the 4 NB: Katusha rockets, or perhaps reference is to machine guns (such as Kalashnikov rifle).</span></p> <p><span id="s433">morning we are in the same place, circling around.</span> <span id="s434">And during the night, we heard many shootings; because they said that men started to try to escape.</span> <span id="s435">Anyway, when uh they opened the doors, we look out and we saw nurses with white dresses and caps with red cross on their front head.</span> <span id="s436">And...on the caps.</span> <span id="s437">And uh when they arrived to our wagon, there were two or three civilian...two or three nurses and the Wehrmacht people.</span> <span id="s438">Maybe one Wehrmacht person.</span> <span id="s439">And a man said to us, "You are free now, and you going to stay overnight here.”</span> <span id="s440">Yah, they said that we are in the border with Denmark, at Padborg.</span> <span id="s441">That was a town or city.</span> <span id="s442">We were not in the city; we...they take us to a farm during the ni...over the night.</span> <span id="s443">They said, "You are now in the border of Denmark and uh...and uh Germany; and tomorrow you will go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s444">You stay here overnight, and you are now free people.”</span> <span id="s445">Everybody start to cry, to scream: "Where is my mother?</span> <span id="s446">Where is my sister?</span> <span id="s447">Where is my father?"</span> <span id="s448">We were in terrible shock.</span> <span id="s449">We didn't know what to...what to...what to think.</span> <span id="s450">Then came the Red Cross cars at every wagon, and they put us in those wagons, take us to the...to a very close farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">And so full with lice; they didn't uh disinfect us.</span> <span id="s452">They put us to a table, and they give us to eat uh oatmeal with a little milk.</span> <span id="s453">Not too much milk.</span> <span id="s454">And naturally, we eat like wolves.</span> <span id="s455">We very hungry; and they said that they don't give us too much food, because they don't want after that big starving to eat too much.</span> <span id="s456">Because will not be good for us.</span> <span id="s457">And uh they give us some, uh, sleep bags.</span> <span id="s458">And, uh, in a barn, a covered barn, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s459">We sleep in those sleeping bags over night.</span> <span id="s460">What was interesting in that barn, that in our...that group there were also Kapos, Jewish Kapos, and the Blockältestes and Stubdienstes.</span> <span id="s461">They were strong.</span> <span id="s462">You can see from that picture, the last picture of mine, not everybody was skinny.</span> <span id="s463">Those, uh, good looking girls, they were Stubdienst or...or Blockältestes.</span> <span id="s464">They were eating well, from our food.</span> <span id="s465">Some strong--stronger, not too very strong--people are start to beat them well with some sticks, start to...to beat them.</span> <span id="s466">But, uh, even they arrested one of them, one of the Kapos.</span> <span id="s467">Because the girls start to scream that he was a Kapo, he was a devil;

Because I know for sure that my uncle is alive in Arad.</span> <span id="s619">I was thinking maybe they changed apartments or new address, but I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s620">And somebody told me, "Write a let...a telegram, send a telegram to the Jewish community in Arad.</span> <span id="s621">Give their name, his wife name, his son name, approximately their age.</span> <span id="s622">And maybe they knew them, and they will answer you.”</span> <span id="s623">And I did that.</span> <span id="s624">And after very short time, maybe ten days, I get answer from them.</span> <span id="s625">From my uncle, saying in the telegram, "Came home!</span> <span id="s626">We...we wait you with open arms.”</span> <span id="s627">And I was very very happy that finally I get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s628">We start to write to each other; but that was Christmas '45.</span> <span id="s629">But I can't...couldn't go home until '46 in September.</span> <span id="s630">All that time, I was working at [Tulene's (ph)].</span> <span id="s631">I getting friendly with other girls; because in that factory, there other girls from other groups also taken from uh Germany camps.</span> <span id="s632">And we get friendly with the.</span> <span id="s633">.</span> <span id="s634">I get friendly with them; and uh we went to each other.</span> <span id="s635">We get in to movies.</span> <span id="s636">We have a pretty good life there.</span> <span id="s637">The Swedish people were very, very nice to us.</span> <span id="s638">They invited to their houses.</span> <span id="s639">But we didn't speak so well; very very little we speak Swedish.</span> <span id="s640">And when we start to speak a little bit better, they still invited us; but we didn't felt good to go up to go to their home.</span> <span id="s641">Because they all the time they were...they were asking us about how it was in the camps, in the lager; and we were so...feel so bad that we didn't want to talk anymore about [it].</span> <span id="s642">And finally in September, ...because I write...wrote a letter to the Romanian embassy that I want to go to university and if I don't go uh sooner I will miss the scholar...the starting of the...the school year.</span> <span id="s643">Finally they send me...send me home in September.</span> <span id="s644">The coming home was a torture; because we --together with other girls from other group--seventy of us, we came by plane 'til Prague.</span> <span id="s645">Was exactly between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s646">That means, we spent the holidays there in Prague, in a hotel uh supported by Joint.</span> <span id="s647">Forty people, they were going to America, to other countries.</span> <span id="s648">And when we said that we came from Sweden and we go home to Romania.</span> <span id="s649">They said, "You are crazy.</span> <span id="s650">You go back.</span> <span id="s651">We just go uh...leave Romania, and go to...” And we were a little disappointed, but was no way to turn back.</span> <span id="s652">Finally, the Romanian embassy in Prague took--I don't know how many--fifteen or twenty former war prisoner--Romanian, non-Jewish war prisoner.</span> <span id="s653">They were prisoner in the west.</span> <span id="s654">I don't know by the Germans or by who.</span> <span id="s655">And they came together with us.</span> <span id="s656">We had a common...together the same visa, the enter visa to Romania--those prisoners and seventeen of us.</span> <span id="s657">They were very good people.</span> <span id="s658">I mean, uh they help us very much; because we be... we had heavy luggages, you know?</span> <span id="s659">And they help us to carry those luggages.</span> <span id="s660">They...we give them cigarettes and uh chocolate we have.</span> <span id="s661">And uh we pass from uh Prague to Budapest in a wagon full with uh wood.</span> <span id="s662">In the front of wood trains, where are the longer bars is a little place.</span> <span id="s663">We were staying there until we passed the...the border.</span> <span id="s664">When we arrived in Hungary-- I don't remember the name of that town--was a Sunday afternoon, and the peasants were staying in.</span> <span id="s665">You know, in the...in the country, the peasants go to the railroad station to see who is coming, who is going.</span> <span id="s666">And they were then, when they sawed us and they asked, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s667">We said that we are uh coming back from the lagers, and so on.</span> <span id="s668">And they said--you know what they said.</span> <span id="s669">That was the first first disappointment of ours.</span> <span id="s670">They said, "Oh, they come more people back than uh they left.”</span> <span id="s671">And then from there, we went to Budapest; and from Budapest, again by very strange way, we went to Arad.</span> <span id="s672">Because Arad is on the border between Romania and Hungary.</span> <span id="s673">And at the border of Romanian...Romanian uh...last Hungarian station and between the Romanian station, was a big trouble.</span> <span id="s674">The former prisoner, they have some blankets; and they said that those blankets are stealed, I don't from where stolen from.</span> <span id="s675">And they had a big discussion, and almost they fight.</span> <span id="s676">We were very scared, because that station was full with Russia soldiers.</span> <span id="s677">And the Russia soldiers that time, they're taking everything what they can from the people and rape the women, and so on.</span> <span id="s678">And we were very very scared in that little station, because they didn't let the train to pass to Romania.</span> <span id="s679">They stopped it; because they said that those uh prisoners, they have stealen some blankets.</span> <span id="s680">I don't know from where they said from them.</span> <span id="s681">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s682">But we were staying there overnight.</span> <span id="s683">Very scary.</span> <span id="s684">Then finally, we went though.</span> <span id="s685">We arrive in Curtici [Hung: Kürtös].</span> <span id="s686">That's the border, uh first stop in Romania.</span> <span id="s687">And uh from there...there I find... Naturally, they... all of us went out from the train, and they start to look in our luggages.</span> <span id="s688">To control the...
