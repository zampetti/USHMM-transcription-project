Herne.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was one of six children and first I went to a Jewish school for two years, then I went to a Protestant school for another two years and then I went to the Overreale schule.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: That was in Herne.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In Herne.</span> <span id="s14">My school started at the beginning of the first World War in 1914.</span> <span id="s15">So my father was a soldier and he had six children so most of the time I spent with relatives of mine also in West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Your father was in the army and it was difficult…</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In the army and my father had a men’s clothing store and my mother had to attend the store in order to take care of the children and it was very hard and tough.</span> <span id="s18">One sister was with an aunt of mine and I spent two years with my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: That was a place by the name of Raaden.</span> <span id="s21">This is in the northern part of West Germany between Hanover and Bremen.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Is that when you went to the Protestant school?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And when you returned to Herne, was that after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: No, not after the war.</span> <span id="s26">It was in 1917.</span> <span id="s27">A sister of my mother was married and her husband was killed at the beginning, right at the beginning of the first World War and she was longing for company and she asked my mother that I should spend some time with her.</span> <span id="s28">And so the last years of the war, I spent with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: At the end of the war, you returned to school in Herne?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did your father return to his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My father returned to the business and all the children assembled home again and were united again.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Under the Treaty of Versailles, the Ruhr was…</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: The Ruhr was, especially the city of Herne, was occupied by French troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: How did you feel growing up in an occupied area?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We took it with…not with enthusiasm, but as children as something new and interesting.</span> <span id="s37">It was not much, not big changes I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Was there a strong anti-French feeling among the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Some of the Germans hated the occupation altogether.</span> <span id="s40">We had a lot of colored troops -- French colored troops from Algiers.</span> <span id="s41">This was something especially for the Germans, new.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: As you were growing up and continuing in the Overreale schule, what were conditions like for you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The conditions were very, very bad.</span> <span id="s44">We had very little food and had terrific inflation.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: 1922?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: 1922.</span> <span id="s47">If we would have the support of our grandparents, they lived in the northern part of Germany, we would have been very, very bad off.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you think that your father’s business was harmed by the French occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s50">We had…the Germans objected to the occupation.</span> <span id="s51">My father, he was liberal and he even did business with the French people and this was sometimes very, very bad for him.</span> <span id="s52">The Germans objected to it and we had, sometimes we had terrible, terrible incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What kind of incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I recall once, there were thousands of Germans in front of my father’s store, one morning and they wanted to storm the whole place.</span> <span id="s55">And I was a boy of 13-14 years of age.</span> <span id="s56">I notified the French gendarmerie and they came to the help of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Just curious, why did you notify the gendarmerie instead of the local German police?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">The local police would not have done anything.</span> <span id="s60">So, they helped my father and they came right in front of the mass and told them to disburse or there would be bloodshed.</span> <span id="s61">And this was his luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you notice any anti-Semitism involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, no, not at that time.</span> <span id="s64">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Do you remember the election of 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s67">The election I remember very well.</span> <span id="s68">This was the time I already spent in Cologne.</span> <span id="s69">I was, as an older son in Germany, supposed to take charge, take over the business of my father and I had to learn that trade.</span> <span id="s70">And I recall in 1928, it was the opening of a big clothing store, Bamberger and Hertz.</span> <span id="s71">They had branches all over, in Frankfurt, Munich, Leipzig, Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s72">They opened up a store.</span> <span id="s73">So I applied for the job and I got this job.</span> <span id="s74">I went to Cologne and I spent a couple of very happy years in Cologne until 1933, until the change of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did most people feel or know that a vote for Hindenburg would be a vote for Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: You think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s79">Certainly.</span> <span id="s80">He was a very, very weak man, Hindenburg, and he was only a puppet and everybody knew he didn’t have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What happened to you in Cologne after Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I remember the speeches from Goering, Goebbels, every night and I remember April 1st…but first of all, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s83">On Dec. 31, 1932, at a little group New Year’s Party and I had a gentile girlfriend at the time.</span> <span id="s84">I took her home and her father was a terrible anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s85">He was waiting for her.</span> <span id="s86">First, he gave her a slap in the face and told her “I told you not to go out with that Jew.”</span> <span id="s87">After I left, I went home and I heard some shots and this was the terrible incident I had.</span> <span id="s88">Three communists killed a couple of Nazis -- very prominent Nazis and I didn’t pay any attention.</span> <span id="s89">I went straight home.</span> <span id="s90">The next morning, over the radio, in the newspapers, they were asking for anybody who knew anything about it -- saw anything.</span> <span id="s91">I didn’t want any part of it and I never told anyone for a long time.</span> <span id="s92">And those three people, those three socialists or communists, they were caught and of course they were hanged in Cologne and even Mr. Goering was present at the time of the hanging.</span> <span id="s93">They were hanged at the Cologne prison they called it klingelhutz.</span> <span id="s94">So then, I’ll go a little bit further -- April, the first -- it was the day of boycott.</span> <span id="s95">I walked into the store and I was told by the owner --you better go home today -- everything is closed.</span> <span id="s96">All Jewish stores all over Germany have to be closed on April 1st to show the public which are the Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s97">In order to go home, I had to pass a German square -- they called it Neuwangt?</span> <span id="s98">-- and there was an attachment of SS troops.</span> <span id="s99">As I passed the place, they were hollering at me -- there is a Jew, there is a Jew.</span> <span id="s100">I was pretty well known through my work and I was active in sports and so they arrested me and they forced me to carry a big flag written on it was “Wir Juden sind Eure Ungluck” -- We Jews are your Misfortune.</span> <span id="s101">I took the flag and threw the flag on the ground.</span> <span id="s102">And following, it was not hard for the SS to reach me and gave me a terrible beating.</span> <span id="s103">They knocked my teeth out and a few months before I had an appendix operation and they kicked me in the stomach.</span> <span id="s104">And then they forced me again to carry the flag.</span> <span id="s105">It was 10 o’clock in the morning until 9 o’clock at night through the streets and hundreds of people were following me spitting at me, and kicking and beating me up.</span> <span id="s106">I forced myself not to give up.</span> <span id="s107">So at night at 9 o’clock, I had to stand to attention and then there came a special order, I should be freed and they told me about face and I made the wrong turn and again, they gave me a beating and then they let me go.</span> <span id="s108">Two days later, I landed up in the hospital.</span> <span id="s109">I had another operation, a stomach operation.</span> <span id="s110">This was one of the worst incidents I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: As a boy who grew up without experiencing much anti-Semitism, how did you react to something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I was very eager to try to overcome it.</span> <span id="s113">I forced myself to take it because at that time -- we or I had the feeling Hitler wouldn’t be there for a much longer time.</span> <span id="s114">Even my big-shot boss, he told me -- you stay on.</span> <span id="s115">It will only be for a short time.</span> <span id="s116">Otherwise, I would have taken the initiative and tried to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s117">I had a sister here who had come in 1928.</span> <span id="s118">She always hated Germany and she never came back to Germany.</span> <span id="s119">So I had a chance to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s120">We were six children, and my mother and father -- unfortunately, they were gassed and one sister tried to go to England but she couldn’t make it anymore and she was sent to a camp in Riga.</span> <span id="s121">She lived in Riga all through the war and in the last couple of days, they also killed her in Riga.</span> <span id="s122">She was in charge of the gold which was knocked out from the dead people and she knew where this gold was hidden and before the Russian advance, she was killed.</span> <span id="s123">One of my brothers went 1936 to Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s124">Another brother of mine, he was in Buchenwald, the concentration camp but he waited and he came out on the last boat -- he went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s125">He couldn’t come to the United States -- they wouldn’t let him in here and then he stayed in Cuba for a year and then he came to the United States</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: After this beating in 1933, did things quiet down for you as far as harassment by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Well.</span> <span id="s128">There was always something.</span> <span id="s129">It happened to me, to my family -- former good friends turned out to be just the opposite later -- turned out to be real terrible Nazis.</span> <span id="s130">I had once, instead to take my lesson at the time with that gentile girl -- to give up the friendship -- I was still friendly with this girl and one day I went to a restaurant in Cologne -- it was on a Saturday night and we had dinner and there was a dance.</span> <span id="s131">There was one of these SS obersturmbandfuehrer -- big-shot man.</span> <span id="s132">He was the head of the Cologne stadium.</span> <span id="s133">I even recall his name -- Lorman.</span> <span id="s134">He came over to our table and he asked this girl to dance with him.</span> <span id="s135">She said I don’t dance.</span> <span id="s136">He grabbed me -- he was a big six foot four guy and he threw me out bodily out of this restaurant and then she walked out after me.</span> <span id="s137">She was a very liberal minded girl -- went to art school and was absolutely not an anti-Semite -- not a Nazi altogether.</span> <span id="s138">But later on, I was forced to give it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: How were you forced?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I received a letter from her father and he wrote to me (I still have it) and said I’m still friendly with his daughter.</span> <span id="s141">Take yourself a Juden Sara.</span> <span id="s142">You brought a Christian family into constant trouble.</span> <span id="s143">From now on, I will watch you and have you watched by the NSDAP and then he signed off with Heil Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Did you remain with Bamberger &amp; Hertz?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s146">I stayed there until the place went over into Aryan hands and then</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s149">And then my boss he asked me to come to Munich and help him to Arisier, his place in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: You mean to sell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: To help him turn over the place into completely Aryan hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: I assume Bamberger &amp; Hertz were both Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: There was no Hertz -- Hertz was only a silent partner.</span> <span id="s154">This was Mr. Bamberger and that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s155">Then I went to Munich -- this was the end of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You had thought during all this time that Hitler wouldn’t last long.</span> <span id="s157">How did you feel at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Then I had already given up the idea.</span> <span id="s159">I was 100% sure that he would stay on for a long time and that it was time for me to get out of Germany if I was ever to get out.</span> <span id="s160">Then I went to Munich and I worked there for a couple of weeks and the place was taken over by a general manager who was a gentile -- very fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s161">After we finished this, I took off a week and took a trip with a friend of mine into Austria -- Innsbruck, Salzburg, and we wound up in Berchtesgaden This was November 8, 1938.</span> <span id="s162">We were sitting there one night having dinner and we hear over the radio an announcement -- this terrible thing happened in Paris.</span> <span id="s163">This Jewish man by the name of Grynspan killed von Rath and I noticed the uproar of all the people at the restaurant.</span> <span id="s164">It was a little hotel.</span> <span id="s165">I told my friend -- it’s getting hot -- let’s get out of here and don’t stay here tonight.</span> <span id="s166">Also, we were dressed like tourists.</span> <span id="s167">I was wearing short leather pants.</span> <span id="s168">I looked more or less like a Bavarian so they didn’t have the idea that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s169">But we took our consequences and we paid and went to the railroad station and we went to Munich.</span> <span id="s170">When we arrived in Munich I still see the picture, the whole city was turned upside down.</span> <span id="s171">All the big department stores -- all destroyed.</span> <span id="s172">I even noticed one very, very terrible incident.</span> <span id="s173">There was a little man’s clothing store and the owner was a Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s174">They took him by his hands and his feet and threw him through his own window.</span> <span id="s175">As we came, I said to my friend, don’t let us go home.</span> <span id="s176">We will be arrested and we will be sent to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What made you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Because all the Jews were being rounded up.</span> <span id="s179">This we found out already.</span> <span id="s180">So we didn’t go home.</span> <span id="s181">We went to a friendly couple.</span> <span id="s182">He was Jewish and she was a gentile girl -- they were married and she was hiding us on top of her roof -- this was about, we stayed there until about one or two o’clock.</span> <span id="s183">In between, Nazis came into her apartment and wanted to take her husband and she insisted her husband is out of town.</span> <span id="s184">At two o’clock in the morning, we walked out of the building and we walked into a big park in Munich -- Englischer Garten and we stayed there until the next morning at six o’clock.</span> <span id="s185">Then I went to the new owner of Bamberger &amp; Hertz -- his name was (missing).</span> <span id="s186">And he took us in and told us to stay on top of the building, on top of the floor, as long as we have to.</span> <span id="s187">And we stayed there for three or four days.</span> <span id="s188">He gave us food, lodging, use of the telephone and he was very, very generous and we have to thank him a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: When you came to Munich after living in Cologne all these years, did you have to register or…</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No.</span> <span id="s191">I -- normally should have registered but I didn’t have any intention because I knew I only had to stay there for two weeks or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: I thought they might not have known about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: That was a possibility too but they didn’t pay any attention.</span> <span id="s194">Registered or not registered, you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s195">I always said the gentile people have a sixth sense, they knew how to recognize a Jew -- always.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Were the employees of Bamberger mostly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s198">I would say they were about 75% gentiles and 25% Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What happened to you after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I stayed there -- upstairs -- three days --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">(Tape turned).</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Picked up on calls from upstairs I made several calls and I spoke to my mother and she told me that my father was picked up and sent to a camp and my brother was sent to Buchenwald and all my uncles were sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s203">In other words, more or less all the Jews were rounded up and sent to camps.</span> <span id="s204">I was very fortunate so I took all kinds of precautions not to fall into the trap.</span> <span id="s205">I took a train in Munich with the intention to go back to Koln.</span> <span id="s206">I bought myself a Nazi paper -- the Volkischer Beobachter and put it in my pocket with the intention to show the conductor that he is not dealing with a Jew.</span> <span id="s207">I had a sleeping car ticket and I spoke to him a few words and I even gave him a few marks tip.</span> <span id="s208">The train stopped near Dachau and I hear the order “All Jews out of the train”.</span> <span id="s209">The conductor said “no, no, this man, he isn’t Jewish -- he is reading the Volkischer Beobachter”.</span> <span id="s210">So this was another fortunate thing I did.</span> <span id="s211">I arrived next day in Koln.</span> <span id="s212">I made it my business not to get off on the main railroad station.</span> <span id="s213">I got off before Cologne and I took the streetcar into the city.</span> <span id="s214">I didn’t go back to my apartment – I lived with a Jewish family and I knew if I went to a Jewish family I would be also arrested.</span> <span id="s215">I went to gentile people – I knew they were friends of ours, absolutely no Nazis and I stayed there for a few days.</span> <span id="s216">In the meantime, I noticed, I lived not far from the synagogue in Koln on the Rohnstrasse -- it was completely burned out, completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s217">All the Jewish people had been arrested and put into camps.</span> <span id="s218">Then, of course, I tried everything under the sun to get my affidavit in order to get out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: How did you go about doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I had an application in Stuttgart which was the location of the American consulate.</span> <span id="s221">I went to Stuttgart and I arrived in Stuttgart and in order to go to the consulate, I had to wait two days so I had to stay somewhere.</span> <span id="s222">I couldn’t get a room in any hotel, in any pension or even restaurant.</span> <span id="s223">There was a rabbi standing there at the railroad station and he asked me “Are you going to the American consulate?”</span> <span id="s224">and I said “Yes, sure, but I can’t get a place to sleep.”</span> <span id="s225">You come with me, he said, I have six children and it makes no difference.</span> <span id="s226">He took me to his house and he said sleep there.</span> <span id="s227">I went to bed and another boy was sleeping in the same bed.</span> <span id="s228">I forgot his name but it was a terrific gesture and I was very thankful.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Why do you think you couldn’t get a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Because they wouldn’t take any Jews under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s231">And I went to the American consulate and I was able to get my affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: You had papers from your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I had papers from my sister and a friend of my sister who was a judge here -- a very famous judge Bronsky.</span> <span id="s234">He also gave me an affidavit so I was able to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s235">But in order to get out of Germany, this didn’t mean I could go to the States right away.</span> <span id="s236">I had to go to Holland -- and I stayed there for four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Why did you have to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Because I had to wait.</span> <span id="s239">I booked on the George Washington at the time and I couldn’t get any -- there was no vacancy until a certain date but in order not to waste any more time in Germany, I went to Holland and I stayed with good friends of mine.</span> <span id="s240">And people I once met in Belgium, on the coast of Belgium -- a very wealthy Dutch family from Rotterdam and I tried to talk the people into getting out of Holland as fast as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: How did they react?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: They had a daughter and this daughter studied medicine and I told these parents -- get your daughter out of Holland, if you don’t want to go, because she doesn’t have a chance in Holland.</span> <span id="s243">One of these days Hitler will attack Holland and you will not have a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s244">So they told me, We will open up our dykes.</span> <span id="s245">I said I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s246">Hitler will take over Holland before breakfast.</span> <span id="s247">And that’s just what happened.</span> <span id="s248">I found out the whole family was sent to concentration camp and completely killed -- each and every one.</span> <span id="s249">As a soldier, I was stationed for a time in Brussels and I had a chance to go to The Hague in Holland and I found out what happened to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: When you went to Stuttgart, what did you find there -- it must have been deluged with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: All the Jews stayed within the premises of the American consulate because everybody was afraid to walk out -- to get arrested or put into camps.</span> <span id="s252">We made it our business to stay within the boundary of the consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Was there a feeling of desperation among the people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: A lot of people weren’t able to get their affidavits -- they needed some more papers and some more additional guarantees from their relatives here in the United States and it was very, very hard for a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Let me just go back to the rest of your family.</span> <span id="s256">Your father and brother were still…</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">My father in the meantime, was released out of Buchenwald because he was a frontkampfer from the first World War and my brother, he stayed for a long time in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s259">My father and mother -- the children, we tried very hard to get them out of Germany and the American government was very, very tough and very hard on them -- always they needed some more additional papers and more papers until it was too late.</span> <span id="s260">We paid already for the tickets -- this was the one very bad feature of the United States government at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did your brother come back from Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: My brother came out from Buchenwald and he went to Hamburg and boarded a ship in Hamburg with all of his belongings -- his suitcases were ready to put on board ship.</span> <span id="s263">While he went on board the ship -- they were holding back all his belongings and he came over with a suit and the shirt he was wearing -- he arrived in Cuba without money and without a clean shirt.</span> <span id="s264">Then he stayed in Cuba for a year and he arrived in the United States and arrived at the time in Miami.</span> <span id="s265">He was told in Miami he shouldn’t go to New York.</span> <span id="s266">At first he insisted he had his brother and sisters in New York but they said don’t go to New York because there are too many refugees.</span> <span id="s267">We’ll send you to New Orleans, Louisiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Was this HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: The HIAS sent him to New Orleans.</span> <span id="s270">They gave him shelter and a new set of clothing and he got a job and within the year he succeeded.</span> <span id="s271">He wasn’t able to go into the army -- he always had a little heart trouble.</span> <span id="s272">Today he is on top of the world -- one of the biggest children’s wear manufacturer in the U.S.</span> <span id="s273">He has a factory and has 450 people working.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s275">You came in 1939, right?</span> <span id="s276">How did you feel on the day that you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: This was one of the happiest days of my life.</span> <span id="s278">After the trouble I went through I was glad to get back into freedom and liberty and not to be constricted to Nazism and I was also -- I had a little mixed feeling to leave my parents and sister behind but I had the feeling that we would be able to get my parents and our sister out of Germany.</span> <span id="s279">Till the last minute -- I even have -- till everything was absolutely impossible anymore.</span> <span id="s280">I still have a postal card from my mother on her way to the concentration camp -- she said we are leaving now and hope we will survive and see each other again.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: When you came to the United States, how were you first able to earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: This is a story by itself.</span> <span id="s283">I arrived here with 10 dollars like everybody else.</span> <span id="s284">I came over on the George Washington and I remember boarding the ship in Southampton, England with another gentleman and I walked next to him and we were pressed for time because they took pictures.</span> <span id="s285">So I asked why they were taking pictures and they told me that the gentleman next to me was Mr. Benes, the Pres. of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s286">I arrived here and my two sisters called for me at the ship -- it was on a Thursday and they said to me --they sent a telegram on board the ship -- you have to work tomorrow.</span> <span id="s287">I said work tomorrow -- they are waiting for me in the United States -- I should work tomorrow!</span> <span id="s288">It was a fact.</span> <span id="s289">A friend of mine came here a year earlier and he lived in Brooklyn and he worked in a pocket book factory and they were looking for a cutter.</span> <span id="s290">So my sister told me tomorrow morning you start a job in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s291">I didn’t even know where Brooklyn is -- I arrived in Brooklyn…</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: They took me by taxi to Brooklyn and then my friend told me how to get there to this place -- this was in Greenpoint and I lived in 1824 Caton Avenue in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s294">I had a little room which I shared with this friend.</span> <span id="s295">In the meantime, he gave up this job, and I was supposed to take over his job.</span> <span id="s296">He worked during the night and I worked during the day.</span> <span id="s297">When he was off I slept and when I was off, he slept in the same bed.</span> <span id="s298">So I arrived there and they asked me you’re a cutter.</span> <span id="s299">So I said yes, I’m a cutter.</span> <span id="s300">They told me, always say yes.</span> <span id="s301">So, I’m a cutter.</span> <span id="s302">For two days, the owner told me what to do.</span> <span id="s303">I did my best and I did everything wrong.</span> <span id="s304">After two days, he said you’re not a cutter, you don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s305">Instead he gave me a broom -- from now on, you clean up the factory.</span> <span id="s306">So I cleaned up the factory for two weeks and then he said to me we are a little off-season now – we will call you back.</span> <span id="s307">I told my sister he will call me back and my sister said, forget about it.</span> <span id="s308">They always tell you they will call back -- look for a new job.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you know English at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Very, very little.</span> <span id="s311">So I got a new job.</span> <span id="s312">I was in Brooklyn with a big outfit -- they dyed straw from China.</span> <span id="s313">It was a very hot stove but I had to work during the night.</span> <span id="s314">They told me for eight hours but in reality I stayed there for twelve hours and I was not used to working during the night -- standing at a hot stove -- a hot oven.</span> <span id="s315">They dyed ladies straw material which was later made into straw hats.</span> <span id="s316">And one night -- and the father of the boss -- he was in charge during the night of the factory.</span> <span id="s317">One night I was so dead tired that I fell asleep and he took a piece of iron and hit the stove and he woke me up and I was so mad.</span> <span id="s318">I had already learned a few slang words and I used those three initial words -- SOB.</span> <span id="s319">He fired me right on the spot.</span> <span id="s320">So then I went into my own business -- peddling.</span> <span id="s321">I went downtown to Allen Street and tried to get some neckties and tried to peddle neckties.</span> <span id="s322">There was a man there, he said to me -- You want to peddle neckties?</span> <span id="s323">I said yes.</span> <span id="s324">He gave me 15-20 dozen neckties free and I peddled the neckties -- any price from ten cents to a dollar.</span> <span id="s325">Whatever I was able to get.</span> <span id="s326">They were mostly black ties and I went on the trolley cars and sold to the conductors at the time black neckties.</span> <span id="s327">I took trolley cars from Brooklyn to the city of Yonkers and I made a poor living -- just got along.</span> <span id="s328">One day I took my neckties in a bag and I went to Harlem into a bar.</span> <span id="s329">There was a man there and he said you give me your satchel, your little bag.</span> <span id="s330">I see to it that you sell all your neckties.</span> <span id="s331">I gave him the bag and said where’s the money.</span> <span id="s332">He said get the hell out.</span> <span id="s333">So I went to a policeman -- he was on horseback and I told him the story.</span> <span id="s334">He said who told you to go into a bar in Harlem.</span> <span id="s335">You better get out of here.</span> <span id="s336">So I lost my money.</span> <span id="s337">I lost my neckties and I had a hard time to repay the man on Allen Street.</span> <span id="s338">I could go on and on until one day, I tried to improve my English a little and I tried to get back into my old line.</span> <span id="s339">I walked on Broadway and I saw a big clothing store -- Simon Ackerman -- it was opposite the Metropolitan opera at the time and I saw a big sign Going Out of business.</span> <span id="s340">I looked in the store and they were busy, busy, busy and I walked in there and I took my coat off, it was in the fall -- October -- I took my overcoat off and started to hang up the suits on racks.</span> <span id="s341">A man came over to me and said you work here?</span> <span id="s342">I said you see I’m working here.</span> <span id="s343">I was desperate -- I needed the money.</span> <span id="s344">He said do you want to work here?</span> <span id="s345">I said I told you I’m working here.</span> <span id="s346">He said I’m the general manager.</span> <span id="s347">His name was Mr. Penger.</span> <span id="s348">He said all right, you can work here.</span> <span id="s349">I give you 12 dollars.</span> <span id="s350">This was 11 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s351">After he hired me officially, I didn’t hang up the suits anymore -- I sold suits.</span> <span id="s352">And I did so well during the day that he gave me the same night eighteen dollars already and he said you wait.</span> <span id="s353">The store was open until 10 o’clock at night, every night.</span> <span id="s354">Then, he said we have dinner together.</span> <span id="s355">I felt the whole world was coming to an end all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s356">Within the weeks, I got very friendly with him and he liked me very much and this was before Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s357">He invited me to his house -- his brother was a chief district attorney here and his whole family was there -- it was a wonderful evening and I was friendly with him until the day he died.</span> <span id="s358">He was a very great help to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Did you stay with Simon Ackerman?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I stayed until they went out of business and then this particular gentleman opened up his own store in the same vicinity and I stayed with him and two other men and I stayed very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s361">After he went out of business, he also went out of business, then, it was hard for me to get a job in this line and I intended to go -- at the time Bond’s opened up a big store on Broadway -- but they told me to wait two months.</span> <span id="s362">I walked downtown on Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s363">There was another firm there -- Brooks.</span> <span id="s364">They asked me if I would work for them, and I started the next day to work there and I stayed until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s365">They had five sons and I was very close with one of the sons and we intended to open up a store in New Haven.</span> <span id="s366">I went to New Haven and looked over the location and everything was set.</span> <span id="s367">We rented the place -- I came home and found an invitation from President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s368">Greetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Were you already a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, I wasn’t a citizen.</span> <span id="s371">Then, we had to give up our plans.</span> <span id="s372">I was inducted into the service and my good friend from Brooks -- he was so disgusted.</span> <span id="s373">He tried to volunteer but he was oversized.</span> <span id="s374">He was a fellow six feet six inches tall and 280 lbs.</span> <span id="s375">But he tried everything under the sun and he also was inducted.</span> <span id="s376">But I wasn’t -- I didn’t volunteer.</span> <span id="s377">I had a good job and I was trying this enterprise and I wasn’t so eager at the time to go into the service.</span> <span id="s378">But I couldn’t get out of it -- I had a very low induction number so I went into the service.</span> <span id="s379">I went to Fort Dix and from there, I went to Fort Lee in Virginia and from there I went to the infantry in Camp Gordon in Georgia.</span> <span id="s380">I stayed there a whole year and then all of a sudden, my colonel called me over and he said you have to leave our outfit and be transferred to Army Intelligence in camp Ritchie, Maryland</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Did they recommend you for Army Intelligence or did you volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, I didn’t volunteer -- I never knew there was an outfit like that.</span> <span id="s383">So then I went to Camp Ritchie and after a few days in Camp Ritchie, we were sent to Frederick, MD.</span> <span id="s384">And we were all sworn in as citizens before we went overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">(Turn in tape).</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: We landed in Glasgow, Scotland.</span> <span id="s387">We went over with the Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s388">We had 60,000 troops on it besides the foreign secretary Stetinius and Joe Lewis who was on the boat.</span> <span id="s389">And</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: This was 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes, 1943.</span> <span id="s392">And then in Glasgow it took us a whole day to be barged out in small boats and then by railroad all through England to a place -- Wooden?</span> <span id="s393">on the Edge in England.</span> <span id="s394">We stayed there for a while and then from there, we went to Clevedon -- near Bristol and we got some additional training.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: In intelligence work?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What was your assignment when you went on to the continent?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I was trained in psychological warfare in broadcasting.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How did you use this?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: In July, 1944, we went into France and we arrived in Quarantaine?</span> <span id="s401">in Normandy and there was still fighting going on.</span> <span id="s402">In the beginning we didn’t have any special assignment.</span> <span id="s403">I was very fortunate -- I wasn’t called for any duty on board ship because some of our boys were called off before the invasion and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s404">They went with the invasion and were wiped out.</span> <span id="s405">But we arrived in Normandy and went through France and were then stationed for quite some time in a place -- Perrier in France and then we went to Verdun.</span> <span id="s406">In Verdun one day I was notified to report at once to Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s407">In Luxemburg, I had to report to a British Navy Commander McLaughlin.</span> <span id="s408">He was stationed in mobile radio unit and there were some other boys there -- British, American, some of German background and they gave me a sheet of paper to read this particular piece of paper -- a script.</span> <span id="s409">After I finished the Navy commander told me to go back to my hotel.</span> <span id="s410">I was stationed in a hotel in Luxemburg and a few days later he informed me that my voice was chosen to be a commentator and broadcaster.</span> <span id="s411">Then I went back to Verdun to pick up my belongings and check out of my unit -- I was transferred to a different unit.</span> <span id="s412">And in Luxemburg we occupied a beautiful home of the former Gestapo director -- his name was Osann and it was like a castle.</span> <span id="s413">We stayed there and everything connected with our secret radio station.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Who were you broadcasting to?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: This was a radio station -- we broadcasted every night between 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock A.M., to Germans because the German radio stations were all destroyed.</span> <span id="s416">So they had no other communications then to listen to this radio station.</span> <span id="s417">There was one secret radio station in London and one in Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s418">We called it Operation Annie.</span> <span id="s419">We had some very fine editors with us -- among them the daughter of Thomas Mann and the son of Thomas Mann.</span> <span id="s420">We had a Professor of German background.</span> <span id="s421">Professor Zeitlin of Ohio State College and a Professor Gerard from Harvard.</span> <span id="s422">We had Lehr Edell and Padover who was the dean of political science at the New School and from time to time we had very fine writer here from the States.</span> <span id="s423">All in all it was a very well organized unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Were most of these people from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: German and Americans too, but mostly German writers.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Within your unit, what was the feeling about broadcasting into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Everything was done with enthusiasm.</span> <span id="s428">We had German actors with us.</span> <span id="s429">One time we took a German prisoner -- his name was Thyssen.</span> <span id="s430">His brother was a communist leader in Germany.</span> <span id="s431">We broadcasted every night -- an hour or two hours alive and it was put on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: What type of broadcast was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: We gave facts and lies in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What was the purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: To bring some turmoil among the German people.</span> <span id="s436">We told them certain German generals gave up.</span> <span id="s437">They were disgusted with Goebbels or we told them Mr. Goering is leaving the country -- he is going to Sweden.</span> <span id="s438">Or we told them the wife of Goebbels was killed by Germans.</span> <span id="s439">We gave them stories but in between we gave them facts too.</span> <span id="s440">We told them thousands and thousands of Germans have run over to the American lines.</span> <span id="s441">We had with us the famous Hans Habe who was a terrific writer and we had good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: The purpose was to upset morale?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Upset morale and take prisoners in order to take information.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did you take many prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: We took many.</span> <span id="s446">Again we had a lot of American non-commissioned officers of German background.</span> <span id="s447">They were also schooled for interrogation in Army intelligence in Ritchie?</span> <span id="s448">.</span> <span id="s449">Their purpose was to interview these prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you know at the time about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Of course, I made a lot of reports about the camps.</span> <span id="s452">I found this before -- I had to read it over the radio -- a report of how, it is written in German of course, this is a story of how Hitler enjoyed the killing of his generals.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: This was written by your writers?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, but it was facts.</span> <span id="s455">And in two voices we had to bring this to the German public.</span> <span id="s456">These were the facts about the time they wanted to assassinate Hitler -- what he did with the German generals.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: After Stauffenberg’s attempt to assassinate Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Did you at any time go into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: After our assignment, when we were finished.</span> <span id="s461">First, there was the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.</span> <span id="s462">Then we had to get out of Luxemburg -- we had to burn everything.</span> <span id="s463">It looked for a few days like the German advance would take -- recapture this territory.</span> <span id="s464">So our man in charge, Col. Powell, he told all our men of Jewish background -- of German background to get out of Luxemburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We went to Verdun where we stayed for a few days until everything cleared up and then we went back to Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s467">After the war was almost over, we were assigned to Bad Nauheim in Germany.</span> <span id="s468">This was our headquarters.</span> <span id="s469">Then we opened up the so-called psychological department -- newspapers, radio and again I helped open up Radio Frankfurt and then I had a program on Radio Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What was the purpose of Radio Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: To tell the people about the new type of government they have to expect under American, British supervision.</span> <span id="s472">I stayed for quite some time in Bad Nauheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: How did it feel to be back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: First of all, I couldn’t look at the Germans at the beginning.</span> <span id="s475">But I had a job to do.</span> <span id="s476">We had to interview Germans.</span> <span id="s477">Every time a German city was taken, the first thing we did always, we went to the local post office and took over the mail.</span> <span id="s478">The mail had been there for a long time because there was no transportation and then we made it our business to read the mail and study it.</span> <span id="s479">And out of the mail we got most of our information.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: What type of information could you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: For instance, certain Nazis, they wrote to their son in the army on the Russian front -- I dig up a hole and put all the important things in and covered it up with sand.</span> <span id="s482">And sometimes, I went to the woman and I asked her what did you do with all your secret stuff -- she said I have nothing.</span> <span id="s483">I said how about taking a shovel.</span> <span id="s484">She got all flushed and we went out to her garden and I told her to dig a hole there and we found the things.</span> <span id="s485">It was sometimes very important to us -- to find out about the memberships of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s486">Bur whenever I had to interview somebody, they always told me they were forced to join the Party.</span> <span id="s487">So I always tried to get ahead of them and asked when you were forced to join the Party – they were always forced.</span> <span id="s488">Anyway, we got a lot of information and we made a lot of arrests.</span> <span id="s489">All in all, it was a great satisfaction to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: As you had to do with these Germans, it must have been difficult to think of your own past -- to think that you had lived there for a good part of your life and what happened to your parents.</span> <span id="s491">How did you cope with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Sometimes, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s493">Of course, most of the Germans I came in contact with were very nice and helpful.</span> <span id="s494">But sometimes, I had to go so far and couldn’t go further.</span> <span id="s495">Once, I had some little incident in Bad Nauheim -- I had a roll of film and I went into a drug store and it was on a rainy day.</span> <span id="s496">I came out of the drug store and I slipped.</span> <span id="s497">And I hear a German woman saying to her husband -- I hope he breaks his neck.</span> <span id="s498">I confronted her and asked what did you say and she said nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s499">Of course, I was mad like hell.</span> <span id="s500">I gave her a slap in the face and had her arrested and I told the man in our counter intelligence what happened.</span> <span id="s501">And he said all right, we’ll take care of her.</span> <span id="s502">So they kept her there for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Did you go back to Koln?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I went back to Koln and I went to the Koln Judische Krankenhaus, they called in Judische Azile at the time and in this particular Krankenhaus, all the survivors from the concentration camps came back and I tried to be helpful as much as I could.</span> <span id="s505">I supplied them with army blankets and food -- whatever I could get hold of.</span> <span id="s506">And I tried to contact relatives all over the world and the city was completely bombed out -- it was hardly recognizable.</span> <span id="s507">I thought it would take a hundred years to rebuild the city.</span> <span id="s508">Then of course I went back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s509">My colonel was a former Lt. Governor from New Jersey -- his name was Col. Powell and he was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s510">He said to me, Curt, whenever your city is taken, make it your business to go to your city and find out what happened.</span> <span id="s511">So I went with an American captain to my hometown.</span> <span id="s512">The first thing I went to the place where my father and mother lived and I was told there was a certain Nazi -- an anti-Semite in the worst way, he told them every time there was an air attack not to go into the air raid shelter but to go on top of the building.</span> <span id="s513">I told my captain all about it and I was wearing my helmet and had my pistol and so I walked into the apartment and the woman opened the door.</span> <span id="s514">She didn’t recognize me but I knew her.</span> <span id="s515">I said where is your husband and she said I don’t know.</span> <span id="s516">So I said, maybe he is hidden here somewhere and I walked into the apartment.</span> <span id="s517">I turned everything upside down -- all the furniture and then I asked her if she had had Jews living here in your house -- Jellin.</span> <span id="s518">She said oh yes, they were always so nice and we got along so well.</span> <span id="s519">I said you lousy B. I told her and I was steaming mad.</span> <span id="s520">Then, finally he came in the apartment and I said what happened to the Jews who lived here.</span> <span id="s521">He said the Jellins, they all went to the United States.</span> <span id="s522">I said you liar -- and I took him along -- I put him in the staff car and I took him out of town and we did something to him -- I was in the mood to knock him off and I would have gotten help from my captain too.</span> <span id="s523">But I didn’t have the nerve because first of all this was British territory and they even approached me -- a British officer who said you are not here in Russia.</span> <span id="s524">You are not allowed to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: This British officer found you outside of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: This British officer.</span> <span id="s527">So I had him arrested and they kept him for a certain time and the British let him go.</span> <span id="s528">He was a living beast -- this guy.</span> <span id="s529">And I found out what happened to my father and mother.</span> <span id="s530">They were supposed to be sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s531">They weren’t sent to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s532">It was the last shipment because my father was a front soldier and with another man who was a doctor in town and was a medical doctor during the first World War -- they were put on a cattle train and the train was taken out of Herne and it was sealed and the whole car was gassed.</span> <span id="s533">That was their end.</span> <span id="s534">So then I did some more survey in the city and found out what happened to their things and such…</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: That must have been an awful time for you in Herne.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s537">I stayed there a few days and then I came back again.</span> <span id="s538">(Mr. Jellin didn’t seem to want to continue on this vein).</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you ever capture or interview Nazi officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes, we even had once a German general and we took him prisoner near Trier and we took him to Luxemburg for interrogation.</span> <span id="s541">The only thing we could get out of him was that he was interested in the pension he would get from the German government.</span> <span id="s542">I remember Hans Habe saying he is no use to us, we’ll send him back over to the German side otherwise, we have to feed him and treat him like a German general.</span> <span id="s543">But whenever, there was a German prisoner from Koln I was called to listen in to see if they were telling the truth.</span> <span id="s544">All in all, this was a very interesting period for me.</span> <span id="s545">I got a certain satisfaction out of it.</span> <span id="s546">Give them back in certain ways -- in the way I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How do you feel about the fact that we helped Germany rebuild so quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: In the beginning, I was very much against it but the youth, the new -- the elderly people are entirely different.</span> <span id="s549">I guess from the new generation.</span> <span id="s550">And this was more or less the policy of the U.S. government to build up Germany against the East.</span> <span id="s551">And this has to be shown and proven if it was right or wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: To take the other side of the coin, how do you feel about the German policy of Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: This was done by Mr. Adenauer who was a terrific man and no anti-Semite and no Nazi.</span> <span id="s554">I recall him as our Oberburgermeister in Germany (in Koln) and he was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s555">I recall once a year we had in Germany this carnival and he visited with his family and we had the honor to have him in our store and he and his family occupied the corner windows in our store to watch the parade.</span> <span id="s556">I think he did most of the work to reciprocate the German Jews for the restitution.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Are most of your friends today of German Jewish background or are they American born Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: They are mostly of European or German background.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Do you feel yourself more a part of the American mainstream or more a part of the German Jewish community in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I think we feel more a part of the German Jewish community -- not of the American mainstream.</span> <span id="s561">Maybe, the point is that we live here in New York City.</span> <span id="s562">If we would live in a different part of the United States, it would be different.</span> <span id="s563">I see this for instance with my brother in New Orleans.</span> <span id="s564">He is married to a woman from New Orleans and 99% of his friends are American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What made you come to Washington Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Not for any special reason -- not because of the German Jews.</span> <span id="s567">My wife didn’t live here -- she spent most of her life near Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s568">She was born in Hamburg but her father left before Hitler and lived in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: When you were dating here, did you date many American girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: No, mostly girls of German Jewish background.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Do you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: In looking back, what do you think was the most difficult adjustment you had to make?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: To come here and not to be a burden to anybody and find a living.</span> <span id="s575">To be independent otherwise I would say I didn’t find it that hard.</span> <span id="s576">I got along very well with the American people.</span> <span id="s577">I’m pretty easy going.</span> <span id="s578">I never had any difficulty in the army with the American soldiers and I spent quite a few years with American boys and the same goes for living here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: When you say you spent a lot of time with the American boys, did you notice any difference between working -- the working habits -- you were used to in Germany and the American system.</span> <span id="s580">?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I must say that.</span> <span id="s582">The American way of working is much, much easier than the way of working on the other side at least in my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: How do you mean easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Here, they are more broadminded, more generous, not so.</span> <span id="s585">Maybe the standard of ethic isn’t as high here as it was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: What do you mean by standard of ethic?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Here, you can take many things for granted while in Germany you had to work much harder, much more -- you had to show more, produce more.</span> <span id="s588">You had to show more respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: To the boss you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Not only to the boss, but to the type of work you have been doing.</span> <span id="s591">It is very hard to compare.</span> <span id="s592">In Germany, you are trained for a certain kind of work.</span> <span id="s593">Here, you can -- you have to be very flexible.</span> <span id="s594">One day you can do one thing, next week you can do something else and make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Do you think the opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: They are much greater here, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s598">PAGE
