Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s14">My mother was naturalized in, I imagine, 1897.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Your father’s name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Louie Judah Cohen.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And how far back did his family go, do you know, in Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s19">I know that either his father or his grandfather was a dayan, who I believe was a holy man, holier than the rabbi, but I don’t know much about his father at all.</span> <span id="s20">He had five siblings, two sisters and three brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And what kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: He was in business, he and his -- the brother in law and their brothers had what was called -- they were the -- one of the first people to use the trading stamps and they used to import tea, and in the teabags were black and white stamps.</span> <span id="s23">And after the people bought the tea, they saved the stamps, they came back to my father’s place and they traded them for all kinds of things, household items, toys.</span> <span id="s24">It was very successful.</span> <span id="s25">And when -- when my father realized what was going on in Germany, he stopped all kinds of business with Germany, and he used to import beautiful German baby dolls, and he stopped this immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Yeah, we’ll get to that time soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: It’s too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Tell me, did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I have one sister and I had one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My brother was John Bernard Cohen, we called him Bernie.</span> <span id="s34">My sister’s name is Fay Stein.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And where are you in the -- in the order of children?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I was the middle one.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And tell me about your mother’s family, and her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My mother’s name -- she was born Ettie Pass.</span> <span id="s39">She was one of eight children, she was the third eldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And she came to the -- to Scotland when?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: She came to Scotland, well, I believe prior to 1897, because they were naturalized in -- you know, so I don’t know how long they were in the country before they were naturalized, cause my si -- my husband and I had to be here five years before we became citizens.</span> <span id="s42">So I don’t know when she came.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Do you know why they came to Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s45">No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And th -- her family came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I believe they came from Riga.</span> <span id="s48">Riga, Latvia, and I believe that my grandfather was born in Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And did you have a large extended family in Edinburgh when you were growing up as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s51">As I said, my mother was one of eight, and so many of them lived in Edinburgh and we had a very large family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Tell me about the Jewish community in Edinburgh when you were small.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: The -- the Jewish community was very small, it was -- it comprised of 300 families.</span> <span id="s54">There was only one synagogue, which was Orthodox, and it’s a very, very close knit congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And were your parents active in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: My parents were always very active in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s57">My father was the treasurer of the congregation, my uncle actually was president.</span> <span id="s58">They were a-also very involved with all of the -- the Jewish -- the societies.</span> <span id="s59">My mother was president of the Ladies Benevolent Society and of the Zionist Society.</span> <span id="s60">My father was active in other ones, I’m not sure which ones actually.</span> <span id="s61">But I think they were both members of the -- the Scottish National Council of Refugees and -- and -- and of course it went on from there, because from there we brought in the 35 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Yeah, we’ll -- we’ll get to that in a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yeah, I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: We were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s66">We -- they’re strictly kosher, you know, they didn’t drive at the weekends.</span> <span id="s67">It changed all our dishes at Passover and we used to -- of course we went to all of the Jewish holidays and we went to services every Saturday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What was the n -- what is the name, or what was the name of your synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: It you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s70">I think it was just the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And where was it located?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: On Salisbury Road in Edinburgh, about 10 minutes walk from where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What street did you live on?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: We lived on [indecipherable] Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And the synagogue was located where?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: On the eastern side of Edinburgh, near the King’s park.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Do you remember the rabbi’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: While I was growing up, the famous rabbi was Rabbi Salis Daiches.</span> <span id="s79">He was a wonderful man and my father was very, very close to him.</span> <span id="s80">He died, and when I married, I was married by a Rabbi Cohen.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in?</span> <span id="s82">Was it a Jewish and non-Jewish neighborhood, or strictly Jewish?</span> <span id="s83">A: None of the neighborhoods were really Jewish.</span> <span id="s84">It was a small -- it was a small congregation, it was very scattered, and I would say it was a non-Jewish congre -- non-Jewish community -- area, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And the friends that you had, were they Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Both, Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s87">Mainly Jewish, I’d say, as I was growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Where did you go to school as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I went to a private school, it was a -- it was a girl’s school called Saint Margaret’s Ladies College.</span> <span id="s90">Had about a hundred pupils in all.</span> <span id="s91">And -- and my sister and I and my two cousins and my -- and my sister-in-law were the only Jewish children there.</span> <span id="s92">We were five children in the -- in a school of a hundred pupils.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Was that difficult?</span> <span id="s94">How were you treated by the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: We were treated very well.</span> <span id="s96">The only thing that I remember is that they had the prayers in the morning and we had to stand outside the hall waiting for the prayers to finish before we could go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did that make you feel?</span> <span id="s98">A: It didn’t really bother us.</span> <span id="s99">You know, we knew that we didn’t sing the hymns and that sort of thing, so we waited outside and we usually sort of chatted among each other.</span> <span id="s100">Then after the prayers were finished, then we walked in and we had -- we were told the general news that was going on.</span> <span id="s101">There was no anti-Semitism in our school as I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And what about the teachers, or were they all non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: They were all non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s104">My brother went to the Edinburgh Academy, was a very prestigious boy’s school, and he either -- met with no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s105">My husband also went to that school, and as far as far as I knew there was no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Your parents were active Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s108">Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s109">They -- they felt very strongly about Palestine and anything they could do to help, they were always in the forefront.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s111">Did you go to Hebrew school after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s113">We had -- we had a Palestinian student that used to come to our house and teach us Hebrew, and he used to teach us modern Hebrew, which I have - forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s115">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s116">My brother, of course, went to the rabbi for his Bar Mitzvah preparation and then the two boys that we had, the two Austrian boys, also went to the rabbi for their Bar Mitzvah preparation.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Were -- did your parents raise you to be independent?</span> <span id="s118">How did they raise their children?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: They raised us to be independent, but I think they would have been very unhappy had we not dated Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s121">Let’s start talking now about when you noticed a change.</span> <span id="s122">You said you were born in 1923?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So you were very young, of course, when Hitler came into power in 1933.</span> <span id="s125">Do you -- wha-what is your first memory of this man named Hitler?</span> <span id="s126">Do you -- can you recall when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: You know, I don’t really, but we went abroad on vacation and we were in Holland, now called the Netherlands and we always went to Jewish -- Jewish hotels if possible.</span> <span id="s128">And we were in this -- in this Jewish hotel in -- I think it was [indecipherable] just outside Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s129">And we were all eating at dinner and three men walked in and they looked round all the tables and they talked among themselves and then they walked out again and we were told that they were Nazis, looking for people.</span> <span id="s130">That was the first that I remember.</span> <span id="s131">And that was about -- perhaps about 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So y-you as a child weren’t aware before 1936 that -- that conditions were changing at all -- were -- I mean, were -- or were you?</span> <span id="s133">Did your parents talk about it, did you -- you were able to read, of course, or listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s134">Did you have any inkling as a youngster?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, we did, and I think that we did more than other people, cause of course my parent talked about it to us and -- and we heard them sort of talking among themselves and I remember very, very clearly that my father had a book, and in it there were -- there were diagrams, or there were photographs of Jewish men in Germany that had been beaten, and I remember that very, very clearly and it has stuck with me fa -- all through the years.</span> <span id="s136">So my father was desperately concerned about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you have relatives on the continent?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Not -- no, I think that my mother had we didn’t seem to have contact with them, but I remember -- and my sister jogged my memory on this, that we used to see my mother tying up packages with cord and with thick paper to send to -- to send to Riga.</span> <span id="s139">But I -- but I don’t know who they were, and I don’t know -- and they didn’t -- I mean, we didn’t hear anything about it afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: When you saw those upsetting photographs, did you talk that over with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My father talked about what was happening in Germany and he was desperately concerned.</span> <span id="s142">He was desperately concerned about the probability of war and of what might happen to us.</span> <span id="s143">And he was very, very concerned to the point that when the war seemed inevitable, he and my mother drove around the country, looking for a house that we could live in and -- outside the city, because we didn’t know the city will be bombed.</span> <span id="s144">And they eventually found this beautiful farmhouse 30 miles away in -- in the [indecipherable] in a village called Walkerburn, and we lived there for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Wh-When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: It was from 1939 til 1941.</span> <span id="s147">But they had been looking.</span> <span id="s148">And of course when -- when France fell, and they knew that the Germans were just across the channel -- we thought it was a kind of an adventure, but he was desperately -- he was desperately concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Let’s move backwards a little bit before that.</span> <span id="s150">What about when Chamberlain went to Munich, were -- did your parents talk about that?</span> <span id="s151">Does that strike any memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Ta -- please tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes, it did, and my father was very skeptical.</span> <span id="s155">He could see what was happening.</span> <span id="s156">He -- he must have had some kind of knowledge that other people didn’t have about what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s157">He could see what Hitler was doing, he could see that -- what was happening in Czechoslovakia, and then when he went into Austria, and he just felt that Hitler was going to just run rampant unless he was stopped.</span> <span id="s158">And of course, he worried desperately about -- about the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did your father speak German?</span> <span id="s160">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s161">My -- my parents spoke some Yiddish, especially when they didn’t want us to know what they were talking about, but not German.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And so he -- though he -- though he did not speak German, he obviously was reading and listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Oh yes, yes he did.</span> <span id="s164">I mean, he -- he was a very, very quiet man, but the things that he did, we found out afterwards, he -- he was looking out for everybody.</span> <span id="s165">I mean, he was the sort of person that after he died, we found out that he’d been supporting the two -- two of my mother’s brothers that weren’t doing well in South Africa, because they wrote to say, well why is it -- why has this stopped?</span> <span id="s166">And then we found out that he’d been doing this, hadn’t told anybody.</span> <span id="s167">He was just great.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And how would you describe your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: She was a lovely person.</span> <span id="s170">Unfortunately, from when my brother was born, and he was five years younger than I, she was an invalid.</span> <span id="s171">She had problems and she had periods of intense pain -- this is not being recorded, is it, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yeah, this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s174">She had -- she had gallstones.</span> <span id="s175">And just after my brother was born and when she asked the doctors about surgery -- now this was in 1920 -- I mean, ’28 or something, they -- the doctors, they casually said, oh, if anything happens to you, your children will always have one parent left, so she never had the surgery.</span> <span id="s176">And they got worse and worse and she suffered wi -- we never knew when she was having an attack, and she was in intense pain.</span> <span id="s177">But she was wonderful, I mean, she -- as I say, she was one of the mainstays of the Jewish congregation, and she was in the heart of everything, and as I say, she was president of the Ladies Benevolent -- the society.</span> <span id="s178">They were active in the Zionist Society, and then when war came along, she was a member of the -- of the Scottish National Council of Refugees.</span> <span id="s179">And she was the one who arranged for the 35 children to come in from Dovercourt camp in England.</span> <span id="s180">And this was not easy because there were only the 300 families and many of them didn't want to have the responsibility of taking refugees, but she found homes for all of these 35 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: All right, let’s talk about that.</span> <span id="s182">When eng -- when Germany invaded Poland in September ’39 -- September 1st, 1939 --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: September -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Oh -- September 1st, 1939 --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: -- your parents -- did that cause a change in your parents’ perspective or activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, we -- my father was almost certain that this was what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s188">He knew that war was inevitable and by the time -- so Germany invaded Poland, we were already in this house in the country.</span> <span id="s189">In fact, we went there for the summer vacation.</span> <span id="s190">So that we were there, and I remember very, very clearly that Sunday morning on September third, when we sat round the -- at -- around the radio and -- and listened to Chamberlain telling us that we were at war.</span> <span id="s191">And so we decided to stay there.</span> <span id="s192">My school -- my sister had already graduated, and she was actually going to become a lawyer; that never happened.</span> <span id="s193">She went to work and eventually she had to do the war service.</span> <span id="s194">And she was -- and she was sent to -- she was sent to a factory in Glasgow, and -- just 45 miles from Edinburgh and she used to work there -- she stayed with my aunt in Glasgow through the week and then come back at the weekends.</span> <span id="s195">I had one year to go in school.</span> <span id="s196">I was -- war was declared 10 days after my 16th birthday.</span> <span id="s197">And I should have had one more year of school, and my school closed down.</span> <span id="s198">They closed down and evacuated to the north of Scotland.</span> <span id="s199">My parents didn’t want me to do this, so my schooling was finished.</span> <span id="s200">And of course my -- the brother also.</span> <span id="s201">And we went to live in the country for two years.</span> <span id="s202">They went to the village schools there, the three boys, my brother and the two refugee boys went to the village school there, and as I say, my schooling was finished.</span> <span id="s203">After two years we went back to Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s204">Edinburgh itself was not badly bombed, but Edinburgh is 45 miles from Glasgow and in Glasgow there was Clydeside -- Clydebank, which was the biggest shipping factory in the world.</span> <span id="s205">So the Germans used to come over practically every night to bomb the Clydeside, and in doing so they came over Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s206">So we never knew, and I think we had about 150 air raids and we never knew what was happening and we always knew the Germans planes because they had a missed beat.</span> <span id="s207">The British planes had a very steady beat, the Germans had a missed beat.</span> <span id="s208">You could hear them above and know what -- what they were.</span> <span id="s209">And my sister and I were both air raid wardens and we used to go out in the dark and patrol the streets and see what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Let’s move back a little bit in time about the young people that your parents, those 35 children, and especially the two boys, how did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I don’t know how my mother too -- got this all together, but we heard about the children in -- in the Dovercourt camp, and we heard about they were looking for families to take these children.</span> <span id="s212">So my mother did her thing and went around and found these 35 families and they all said that they would take a child, and we said that we would take one boy.</span> <span id="s213">We said -- my brother was nine or 10 at the time.</span> <span id="s214">We thought a ni -- a boy will be nice for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Wha-What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: This was 19 -- the winter of 1938.</span> <span id="s217">And they came in on a very, very cold wintry night, I think it was in December 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Wh-Where did these children come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I believe they came from Dovercourt camp in England.</span> <span id="s220">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s221">I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Now, were these English children, or were these children from the con -- Jewish children from the continent?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Oh, oh, these were Jewish children from the continent.</span> <span id="s224">They came from Germany and Austria, maybe other countries, but they were all -- they were all refugee children.</span> <span id="s225">And they came on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Right, and so they were at this Dovercourt.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And -- and then your -- your mother -- how did -- how -- what did she do, go knock on people’s doors?</span> <span id="s229">How did she get people to accept these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: She just about -- knocked -- knocked on people’s doors.</span> <span id="s231">I mean, they knew all of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s232">In fact, if I da -- a funny story was, when my sister was ma -- my sister was married a year before I was, and everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s233">Food was rationed, everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s234">So they decided that in order to have a wedding with a sit down dinner, they couldn’t -- they couldn’t have very many people.</span> <span id="s235">Well, my parents knew everybody in Edinburgh, and the people that hadn’t been asked were very, very upset.</span> <span id="s236">So I was married a year later, and we had a wedding in the assembly rooms in Edinburgh, we asked 700 people.</span> <span id="s237">I mean, it was more of a buffet thing, but I’m saying this to tell you that they knew everybody.</span> <span id="s238">They were -- because my parents were so involved in the congregation and because of this, they were invited to every wedding, every -- every bris, a-and my father was, you know how you -- what -- if you’re a Cohen you buy back the child or something, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Th-The Pidyon HaBen.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Right.</span> <span id="s241">And my father used to go to all of these, he -- you know, and he went to every wedding, and every Bar Mitzvah, everything, so naturally when we had a wedding and didn’t invite them, they were very hurt.</span> <span id="s242">So we took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So you’re -- n-now we’re talking about what, January ’39?</span> <span id="s244">Wh-Wh-When are we talking about, the year your mother and father are taking -- taking responsibility for these 35 children?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, I’m not sure when they -- when they started, but you go -- I’m not sure when it all began, but I know that the children came in in December ’38 - 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Oh -- okay, so -- so -- so this was after Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: -- and they were on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did they speak any English, these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: The ones that we had were especially hard because the two boy -- when the children came in, we’d arranged to take one and -- and they came in this very cold night and there were these two boys that were standing hand in hand and nobody could understand them.</span> <span id="s252">They didn’t speak German, they didn’t speak Yiddish, but they spoke this sort of dialect.</span> <span id="s253">So it was established afterwards that the -- that they spoke this kind of sub-patois, and where they came from was, they came from a little tiny village called Lackenbach in Burgenland, which was, I think, in northern Austria.</span> <span id="s254">So they managed to find out from somewhere that these boys had promised their parents that they would never be separated, so we took both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: How old were they and what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Max was either eight or nine and his name was Max Kodigstein, and his brother was Agon, and he -- he was -- must have been about 11 or 12.</span> <span id="s257">(Hey Jenny, come on.</span> <span id="s258">We go.</span> <span id="s259">Go on.</span> <span id="s260">Yeah, scoot.</span> <span id="s261">Stay.)</span> <span id="s262">Max’s brother was Agon and he was about 11 years old, and Max was a rather rotund little boy with brown hair, and -- and Agon was taller with -- with red hair.</span> <span id="s263">And they were completely bewildered.</span> <span id="s264">I think that they’d never been in a city before.</span> <span id="s265">And we had arranged a bedroom for this boy that we thought that we were getting and luckily we had a double bed.</span> <span id="s266">So we brought them in on this very, very cold night.</span> <span id="s267">The next day all of the -- all of the children were assembled at the shul and the particulars were taken, and then my parents, they took them down to the big department store and outfitted them, cause they were wearing lederhosen, thick, white socks and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s268">And they stayed with us for quite some time before they learned some English and then -- and then they went to the nearby school.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So how long did these boys live with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: They lived with us for six years.</span> <span id="s271">They lived with us from 1938 til after the war finished, and then after the war finished we found out -- I don’t know how we found out, my parents found out that there was distant relatives in London.</span> <span id="s272">Their parents, of course, had died in -- in the camps, but they had distant relatives in London, so they went down to be with them.</span> <span id="s273">And after my father died -- and I’m not sure what year it was, but both boys married girls down in London, Jewish girls, and my mother and I so traveled by train down to both of their weddings.</span> <span id="s274">I lost touch with them when I came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So these two boys moved into your house and the other 33 went into other homes --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: -- in -- in Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s278">And did you have contact with these other children, or did your parents have contact?</span> <span id="s279">Did the children get together as a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, in fact, as I say, it -- it was a very a close community.</span> <span id="s281">Our boys actually had the two cousins, they went to other families, and -- and they used to get together -- we used to have -- we tried to arrange things where all the children would get together so that they would feel that they were part of something, you know, that they weren’t th -- completely isolated.</span> <span id="s282">And -- and of course we all went to services, and -- and we used to have an Oneg Shabbat afterwards, and the children were there.</span> <span id="s283">So they were very well treated.</span> <span id="s284">I mean, I know that there were some families, unfortunately that thought that they were getting a cheap domestic.</span> <span id="s285">This happened -- I think this happened everywhere, but in the main -- I know that we felt that we had suddenly got two new brothers, and they were part of our family.</span> <span id="s286">As I say, my -- my mother’s -- one of my -- my mother’s proudest things was that she had one child -- one boy but she made three Bar Mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s287">And it -- on this side of th -- you know, we lost touch with them.</span> <span id="s288">I have tried through the -- through the -- is it the survivor’s registry, to see if I could find out where they were, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And what was their state of mind in the beginning, psychologically?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: They didn’t say much to us.</span> <span id="s291">They were quite bewildered and they were very, very happy to be part of a family, but I knew that -- I could hear the oldest one crying at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And what kind of connection or correspondence did they have with their family?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: None at all.</span> <span id="s294">None at all.</span> <span id="s295">When -- and they came to us, there was no connection at all.</span> <span id="s296">I -- since working at the museum, I’ve tried to find out about where they came from, from Lackenbach in Burgenland and the interesting thing was it looked as if this was a little Gypsy village.</span> <span id="s297">I really have wanted to look more on the internet, but so far -- come here, shoot -- so far, I haven’t done so.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I mean they -- they had to be quite old now too, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hilda Seftor.</span> <span id="s302">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about the two boys that came into your family, that came over from the Kindertransport and stayed for six years.</span> <span id="s303">Tell me about their Bar Mitzvahs.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I don’t remember much about them, I think they were very quiet affairs but -- but we had the family there and we made a little -- and we tried to make a little party for them and I think they were very, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: When were the Bar Mitzvahs?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s307">Max was, I imagine, nine or 10 when he came, so I imagine it was three years after that [indecipherable] and of course, Agon must have been earlier, because he was 11 when he came, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Di-Did the children talk about their family at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: They didn’t talk about their family at all.</span> <span id="s310">We didn’t know if their relatives there, or what kind of a -- what kind of a life that they lived before then.</span> <span id="s311">I think that it was completely alien to what they came to.</span> <span id="s312">I think they lived in a very, very remote village and that everything was so strange to them that they couldn’t have a comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: How did they manage at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: They seemed to manage very well.</span> <span id="s315">And the other children, I think may have thought they were a novelty and they treated them very well.</span> <span id="s316">They treated them very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And the teachers and so forth?</span> <span id="s318">They went to the same school that your brother went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: They went to the same school in the village.</span> <span id="s320">When we went back to Edinburgh, then my brother went back to the Edinburgh Academy and they went to the local school, and did very well.</span> <span id="s321">I mean, this is 60 years ago, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: So when you -- when they moved into your family, you were in your country home, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: No, when they first came to us it was in the winter of 1938, and we were -- we were at home.</span> <span id="s324">That following summer we all went out to our country home for the summer vacation and stayed there, and that’s when we went out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s326">Now let’s talk about the other part of your family’s life and your life, the -- the -- the Whittingehame part of your f-family s-story.</span> <span id="s327">When -- tell me a little bit about how this all began and what th -- how it came about and the location.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well, Whittingehame is located on the outskirts of Edinburgh and it -- it all came about because Viscount Traprain, who was the -- who was the nephew of L-Lord Balfour, who initiated the Balfour Declaration -- Viscount Traprain was the owner of this house and couldn’t afford to keep it going, he -- he couldn’t afford the taxes.</span> <span id="s329">And in Scotland if you can’t -- if you can’t pay the taxes, they will take the roof off your house.</span> <span id="s330">So he came to the Jewish community and offered it as a home for children.</span> <span id="s331">And we were overwhelmed, and we were a small community, but we said yes, let’s do it, and my father went round the country raising funds for it, and then when it was all decided that we could do it, he was made treasurer of this.</span> <span id="s332">A-And both of my parents were governors of -- of Whittingehame Farm School, and what they did was -- excuse me.</span> <span id="s333">Can we stop for a minute.</span> <span id="s334">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You said something about if people don’t pay taxes they take the roof off of their hou -- the house tha -- th-the roof is removed from their house?</span> <span id="s336">Is that true or is that just an expression?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, this is actual -- this is the actual truth.</span> <span id="s338">Lord -- Viscount Traprain had this huge house and it was a very, very definite problem that they would take the roof off.</span> <span id="s339">And if you take the roof off, then they didn’t have to pay taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s341">It’s an unusual story.</span> <span id="s342">So what -- now what year are talking -- what month and what year are we talking about that he came to your family and to the synagogue and offered this?</span> <span id="s343">A: I am not sure.</span> <span id="s344">It was, I would imagine, round about 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So this was before Germany invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: And then, when funds were collected, my father was the one who was completely responsible for furnishing this as a school for the children and for getting all the equipment that they needed.</span> <span id="s349">And then when this was done, they hired a teaching staff.</span> <span id="s350">And because they -- the idea was that Whittingehame Farm School was going to be a school that -- that taught a complete school curriculum and also taught the children how to work the land so that if they went to Palestine and were in kibbutz after the war, that they will be able to work there.</span> <span id="s351">And -- and the teaching staff was absolutely great and the first headmaster was not Jewish, he was called Mr. Maxwell and at times he wore a kilt, which the children loved.</span> <span id="s352">And once this was all done and this -- and the school was repaired and we bought 160 teenage children up from Dovercourt -- Dovercourt Camp in England, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Who were these children?</span> <span id="s354">Were these other Kindertransport children like the fir -- the 35 that your parents were helping out?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, it -- these were all Kindertransport children, I think between the ages of 14 and 18, though I’m not really sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s357">And they came from a camp on isba -- on the coast, is that what you said, of Dover?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: At -- at Dovercourt camp -- I’m not sure where it was in England, but it was a big, very temporary camp for children who were first brought over to the country and kept there while homes were trying to -- were found for them.</span> <span id="s359">And they went all over.</span> <span id="s360">I mean, Great Britain was absolutely wonderful in the -- in the fact that it arranged to take 10,000 children.</span> <span id="s361">It was a small country and once we got them there, we had to find out who would take them.</span> <span id="s362">And they went to large homes, they went to small homes, they went to schools and so we heard about - Dovercourt Camp, we arranged for the 160 to be brought up.</span> <span id="s363">And they were there throughout the war.</span> <span id="s364">Actually, at a certain point, Britain declared that all -- all people not born - all people from Europe were enemy aliens, so the boys were taken over to an -- to interment camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I’m not really sure when.</span> <span id="s367">I think it must have been about, perhaps 1941 or 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s369">All boys over what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Sik -- over 16 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Let’s talk aga -- also about the financial commitment your parents had to make.</span> <span id="s372">They obviously had to make it for Agon and Max.</span> <span id="s373">What about for the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, the school had to be subsidized by the whole Jewish -- whole Jewish community.</span> <span id="s375">This was an enormous undertaking, so as I said, he was the treasurer of this, and he -- he went throughout the country raising funds for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But when you say throughout the country, throughout Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No, I think it was England also.</span> <span id="s378">Scotland does not have a large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s379">As I say, there were 300 families in Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s380">The -- Glasgow there were several thousand, but even then, I mean, this was not enough to th -- take care of this, so I think -- my father had business in some of the big English towns in -- in Leeds and Liverpool and other -- I mean, he had branches of -- of his business in some of the big towns, in Cardiff and Wales, in Liverpool and Leeds.</span> <span id="s381">So I think that he went to the Jewish congregations there.</span> <span id="s382">I’m not sure where he -- he raised funds, but I know that h-he went throughout the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And your mother stayed home with you all?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s385">As I said, apart from anything else, she was a semi-invalid, and -- and it was not easy for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: When you say your father had businesses in -- around the countries, wh-what -- the same kind of business that he had back in Edinburgh?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, exactly the same, and as I say, he was in -- in partnership with his brother-in-law, who was also called Cohen, although he was no relation.</span> <span id="s388">And his brother -- I think there were about three or four of them, and it was the same business, and unfortunately during the war, many of them were bombed.</span> <span id="s389">The one in Liverpool was bombed, I think the one in Leeds was bombed, and -- and it goes on from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And this is the business where people came in with stamps and redeemed them and -- in your father’s o -- stores?</span> <span id="s391">Isn’t that what you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, his business was called the Ideal Trading Stamp Company, and as I said, he imported tea and then had the stamps in there, and then -- and then people would redeem the stamps for merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: And where did he import the tea from?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I don’t know, maybe India.</span> <span id="s395">I honestly don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: S -- let’s t -- also talk now about this school.</span> <span id="s397">So the -- the -- these children came to the school at -- en masse, did they come as a group when the school finally opened, when your parents got it going and other people got it going?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I believe it -- they came en masse, I think that some of them may have come later, but I think that -- they came en masse, you know, sort of -- mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s400">And describe what these -- the set up was, how the children slept and so forth.</span> <span id="s401">And d-do you know, the physical layout of the -- of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: They had dormitories -- it had dormitories for the boys and dormitories for the girls.</span> <span id="s403">And there was -- there was an excellent matron, Miss Lacker, who was, I believe -- I think she was Austrian.</span> <span id="s404">Perhaps she was German, but she was a lovely lady and my mother was, as I said, one of the governors and she was head of the house committee and my mother used to have many, many meetings with Miss Lacker.</span> <span id="s405">And, you know, sort of trying to bring in a kind of family thing for the children so it wasn’t just a school.</span> <span id="s406">They wanted to bring in a -- a sort of homely attitude so that they would not feel so homesick.</span> <span id="s407">And as my sister wrote in her memoir, what -- wa -- one of the things that we used to do is, we used to go out regularly -- my father didn’t drive, but we had a chauffeur, David, he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s408">But anyway, we used to go out several nights a week and my father used to take great cartons of ice cream and the thing was this, that some of the children were very, very Orthodox and there were two dining rooms there, one for the strictly kosher, and one that was not so kosher.</span> <span id="s409">And we used to take the ice cream out in a great big -- whatever you call them?</span> <span id="s410">And it was ice packed [indecipherable] because the children used to have you wait for two or three hours before they could have the ice cream.</span> <span id="s411">And one of the other things is that where my father’s business was, right opposite was an ice cream factory, and my father was very, very fond of this man that owned the ice cream factory.</span> <span id="s412">He was it -- he was Italian and he was called Mr. Valenti.</span> <span id="s413">And my father -- and ma -- and Mr. Valenti used to get together and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s414">The sad thing was this, that in 1940 all of the Italians were rounded up in Scotland and they -- and they -- and they were put on this -- on this ship, the Arandora Star and sent to [indecipherable] and the aras -- and the Arandora Star was sunk by a German patil -- torpedo off the Irish coast and Mr. Valenti died.</span> <span id="s415">My father was very upset about that, because he was such a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Speaking about good men, which your father an -- ce-certainly sounds like, was he -- was he unusual in the -- in the Edinburgh community or were there a lot of other men like him, who did so much and put so much effort and time and caring into these children?</span> <span id="s417">Or was your father unique in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well, I know I’m prejudiced, but he we defin -- he was definitely unique and he was -- he was one of a kind.</span> <span id="s419">My uncle was a governor, but he didn't do half as much as what my -- my father’s whole heart and soul was tied up with this school, and he was constantly sort of trying to find things for the school.</span> <span id="s420">Food was very strictly rationed, and he’d go around the farms looking for eggs for them.</span> <span id="s421">He would -- he would try and supplement the rations in every way he could.</span> <span id="s422">I mean, he was always there for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Now you were 16 - 17 - 18 - 19 at the time.</span> <span id="s424">You were obviously following what was happening and your parents, of course were following what was happening during the war.</span> <span id="s425">What about the children?</span> <span id="s426">Were they also as aware, the children in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Oh, I’m quite sure they were.</span> <span id="s428">If you see i -- if you see the pictures that the museum has, that my sister provided, there is a whole -- a whole group of -- of mail they were getting.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t know where they were getting it from, possibly from Switzerland, but I mean, they knew what was going on and of course, you know, we had air raids, which they were involved with.</span> <span id="s430">And -- and they had first -- and they had first aid classes, you know, they were taught to do what they had to do in case a bomb fell, this or this thing.</span> <span id="s431">They were -- they were very much aware, and -- this was a regular school, you know, I mean, it -- we knew they must -- it must be so much heartbreak there, but you try and be there for them if they need it, -- but try and encourage them to go on with their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So was it a memb -- a matter of lay people counseling these children, or were there any professionals there counseling these children psychologically?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: You know, I don’t remember that, you know.</span> <span id="s434">I was just a teenager myself and it was 60 years ago, so I honestly don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So what was your role with this school?</span> <span id="s436">As you say, you were 16 when it all started, what did you do in th -- in -- beginning then?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I didn’t do very much.</span> <span id="s438">As you say, I wasn't old enough to drive then, and I used to go out with my parents and make friends with the children and do -- you know, try and make them feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s439">My sister did have her license and she w-would often go out by herself at night and yeah -- and be wi -- I think it was about 15 or 20 miles from the city, and she would be there at night and she would be [indecipherable] with the children, you know?</span> <span id="s440">And she was the one that wrote the memoir and she possibly has better memories than I do, though when I talked to her the other night she said, I don’t remember, it was so long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s442">Ca-Can you describe what kind of farming techniques the children learned, you s -- had mentioned that they were learning that, agricultural techniques, in preparation for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I don’t know what kind of -- the techniques.</span> <span id="s444">I know that when Whittingehame Farm, the estate was given to them, they were given the land with it, and with the farmers that worked the land and they took these children under their wing and they taught them the farming as they knew it.</span> <span id="s445">Now, I know that the idea was that if their parents were not still alive when they left, that they would go to Palestine, and many, many did go to Palestine on kibbutzim -- on kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s446">But I don’t know what kind of farming.</span> <span id="s447">I know that I saw them on tractors, I saw them making hay, I saw them, you know, doing all this sort of thing and in these photographs that the museum has, it also shows that it was especially -- were taught how to sow fields and this sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you have a sense that these children were coping well, or was there signs of depression among the children, when you would go out there?</span> <span id="s449">A: I really was too young, but thinking about it now, I think that they were coping well.</span> <span id="s450">I think that the matron was a very nurturing person.</span> <span id="s451">I think that my mother was wonderful there, she was there to talk to them, and to be there for them if needed them.</span> <span id="s452">The other thing was just that Chaim Weitzman, his wife was very, very much involved with it, and she -- Vera Weitzman, and she was out there a lot and -- and she worked with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did she live nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I don’t know where she lived nearby, but she was always there.</span> <span id="s455">And actually, Viscountess Traprain’s wife, they lived in the [indecipherable] house, and his wife was always there too, helping.</span> <span id="s456">So there was [indecipherable] and there’s a corps of women that were sort of there for the -- them if they needed, apart from working in the kitchen and doing these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you sense any negative feeling among the non-Jewish residents in surrounding areas about these Jewish children being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Absolutely not, it was -- it was a building apart from itself, it was set in the country, amid fields.</span> <span id="s459">But no, I didn't -- I didn’t see anything at all, or my parents didn’t either, I know, because I would have heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">And so how often would you go out there?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: We go out -- we would go out there a-at the weekends and perhaps one or two nights a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Did you stay overnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s465">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And the children picked up English quite easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s468">In fact, they did very well.</span> <span id="s469">As I say, [indecipherable] had a very, very qualified teaching staff.</span> <span id="s470">And after Mr. Maxwell left, they had a Jewish headmaster called Berner Cherig, who now, I believe, is in Israel.</span> <span id="s471">And they seemed to do very well.</span> <span id="s472">In fact, one of the -- in one of the photographs that we have, it shows the -- the girls all in the sewing room, and there’s a sign above it that says, speak Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: In Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: In Hebrew, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Were all the staff Scottish?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s477">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t think they were Jewish, I think they were -- that they were regular teaching staff, but I could be wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s480">Now, what were you doing from the age of 16 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, the two years that I was in the country, I was -- we had a very, very large country house.</span> <span id="s482">It had seven bedrooms and goodness knows how many bathrooms, and they had the apple room and the gun room, and I mean, you name it.</span> <span id="s483">It was a very, very sprawling farmhouse, and -- and the domestics that we had all went to do war work, so they -- there we were in the country, my mother was an invalid, so I was looking after the house.</span> <span id="s484">And then, that time there was no central heating, so you know, you would light the fires in the morning for heat.</span> <span id="s485">So the first thing I do was light the living room fire, light the kitchen fire, do these sort of things.</span> <span id="s486">I was looking after the house and I was -- I was very domesticated and I loved to -- I loved to cook, so that kept me busy.</span> <span id="s487">And then when we went back -- back to Edinburgh, I was accepted into the -- the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, and I was there for two years and I got degrees in household and institutional management.</span> <span id="s488">And institutional management meant that you learned to cook for many, many people.</span> <span id="s489">In fact, after I got married, and with four boys, and my family used to tease me that I was still cooking for institutional management.</span> <span id="s490">And so I graduated from there and then I was told that I had to do work of national importance.</span> <span id="s491">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Th-This would be 1943 now?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes, possibly 1943.</span> <span id="s494">My sister was already away doing work of national importance, and I was told that I had to do this.</span> <span id="s495">Well, my mother needed somebody.</span> <span id="s496">We had a big house in Edinburgh, no staff.</span> <span id="s497">So they said that I could stay at home.</span> <span id="s498">Th-They wanted to make me what they called a messing officer.</span> <span id="s499">This is a British phrase.</span> <span id="s500">A messing officer is a commissioned officer in the British forces that -- that deals with -- with -- with the catering, the cooking.</span> <span id="s501">Looking after the troops.</span> <span id="s502">They wanted me to be a messing officer and they said that I could -- I could stay at home if I got a job of national importance.</span> <span id="s503">So I went to work for the Edinburgh’s school system, sort of cooking meals for the schools -- for the Scottish schoolchildren.</span> <span id="s504">And what I did was this, I had to be there at six o’clock in the morning and it was dark, it was blackout, there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s505">It was luckily about 15 minutes walk from where I lived.</span> <span id="s506">And I get -- I leave the house about five -- I’d get up early, I would light the fires in our own house.</span> <span id="s507">I would wash the kitchen floor, do everything that had to be done so my mother wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s508">Then I’d leave the house at 5:30, walk to my work.</span> <span id="s509">And what we had to do is we had to work with the food, so that the food had to be ready by 8:30.</span> <span id="s510">Then it was put in insulated containers and the trucks used to take it off at 8:30 to the various schools.</span> <span id="s511">And we were finished by three o’clock.</span> <span id="s512">Well, after we sent the food out at 8:30, we began preparing the food for -- for the next day.</span> <span id="s513">And during that time I got a vaccination.</span> <span id="s514">They had smallpox in Glasgow, which came into Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s515">And -- and without telling my parents I went to have a vaccination, because for some reason I was not vaccinated as a child.</span> <span id="s516">So I went to -- I went to get a vaccination that was not good and I had a very -- a very swollen arm, and the doctor said, you’re working too hard.</span> <span id="s517">So they put me in -- in the -- in the largest wartime nursery, it had a hun 150 children.</span> <span id="s518">And I used to go -- I used to get the -- the tram car by that time, to this nursery and I used to go there and I used to cook for the 150 children and for the staff.</span> <span id="s519">And it was -- it was an old -- it was an old church run by an -- and ran by an -- and ran by a canal.</span> <span id="s520">And there were -- there were rats and this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s521">And I remember one year -- I lliked to knit.</span> <span id="s522">One year I made about 20 or 30 pairs of mitts for the children, to th -- when -- for Christmas and one year they -- the Duchess -- the Duchess of Kent was going to come to visit.</span> <span id="s523">Great excitement.</span> <span id="s524">And I had managed to hold some white flour, which was always, always unwrit -- unobtainable, and I made this wonderful cake.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, I made this absolutely wonderful cake and took it in there and the next morning when the Duchess was supposed to come, they found out that the rats had eaten part of it.</span> <span id="s526">So this was a -- this was an experience.</span> <span id="s527">So I worked there and actually where I should backtrack and say that when I went to work for the -- for the schools, after I was there for six months they say that would I be in charge of sending the food out to all the wartime nurseries in Edinburgh, which I did.</span> <span id="s528">I think there were about 1500 children, and I used to send out the food to all these children.</span> <span id="s529">Then when I got this, the smallpox thing, I h -- I went to work for the largest nursery.</span> <span id="s530">And finally my mother’s health deteriorated and they said that I could stay home.</span> <span id="s531">And that’s when I started my volunteer work and I went to work -- I looked after her and I went to work at the Canadian Legion Services club on Princess Street, which is the main street in Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s532">And my parent’s house was always open house for everybody.</span> <span id="s533">I mean, when -- I mean, for Pesach, for Thanksgiving, any time.</span> <span id="s534">We always had lots of people and f-for our two Seders, -- we always had four or five or six servicemen.</span> <span id="s535">So we had open house and we always had many, many servicemen coming back, and it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s536">I had a great -- I had a great childhood, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Let -- let’s get back to Whittingehame a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did any rabbis come to the -- to the house to teach the children or work with the children or talk to the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s541">I’m -- I’m pretty sure that they must have visited and they must have come and talked to them.</span> <span id="s542">I’m not sure if they actually taught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s544">So there was no religious trainings?</span> <span id="s545">It was more secular, Hebrew, conversational Hebrew to get them ready to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I think you’re right, but I honestly don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s548">Now, so much was going on, obviously, with Hitler, we -- and -- were you and your family aware of what was happening to the Jews in ’41 - ’42 - ’43 over in -- in the -- on the mainland?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: We were very much aware.</span> <span id="s550">Of course we --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: How -- how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, news was getting through by this time.</span> <span id="s553">I mean, news were getting through by this time.</span> <span id="s554">And of course, the children that came on the -- on the Kindertransport and our own boys were very much aware of how -- how their parents had been treated, what was happening over there.</span> <span id="s555">So we knew, probably far more than the non-Jewish population.</span> <span id="s556">So we did know what was happening and it is a very tense time, you know, because -- because when, one by one, the countries over -- over in Europe fell, and we were left by ourselves -- we were only 18 or 20 miles from the -- from the German troops, and -- and my father especially was desperately concerned about it, because you know, he - what were -- what was going to happen to us?</span> <span id="s557">Were -- were we going to be sent over to the camps ourselves?</span> <span id="s558">It was -- it -- it was a -- I realize now, far more than I ever did when I growing up, what it must have been like for them, for our parents, cause I often think, what would I have done if this had happened when I had -- had my four boys?</span> <span id="s559">And luckily -- I mean luckily, but luckily, none of my family actually went and were killed, but we saw it all around us, obviously.</span> <span id="s560">My brother was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And when did the correspondence between the children in the house and Whittingehame and their families stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s563">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s564">I mean, I don’t know where the correspondence came from.</span> <span id="s565">I can only think that it must have come through -- through Switzerland because when I was -- when I was transcribing it for the museum I -- I did a very touching series in which this little girl had been sent on the Kindertransport to England and she was writing to her parents in Berlin and they were each trying to buoy each others up, and the little girl was saying, you know, what is happening over there?</span> <span id="s566">How are things with you?</span> <span id="s567">And the parents were saying -- they had a guest house in Berlin -- oh, everything’s wonderful, this is happening, this is happening.</span> <span id="s568">And you could see.</span> <span id="s569">And then -- and then finally, when war broke out, the little girl said [indecipherable] said, what am I going to do, I can’t write to you any more.</span> <span id="s570">And I have this on the computer here.</span> <span id="s571">It’s a heartbreaking thing, but I realize that from the time that war broke out, that all correspondence, it did stop and that any that came through must have come by through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s572">So I mean, I don’t know where the letters came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I know that our b -- our boys didn’t see anything at all, they were completely cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: And they started speaking with Scottish accents.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hilda Seftor.</span> <span id="s579">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s580">Did Agon and Max, the two young boys who moved in with your family, whom your family quote, adopted, ever come with your family after Whittingehame?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes, they usually came with us unless they had something else that they -- that they wanted to do or had to do.</span> <span id="s582">They came with us as part of the family.</span> <span id="s583">And I think that they liked to be with the other children, I think that they gave a feeling of almost family, you know, that there were other children who -- who were not so Scottish.</span> <span id="s584">And it -- it worked out very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When they would go, how would they talk to the children, in English, or in German, or how would they talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I think they would ha -- have to talk in English, because I think that the language that they spoke would not be very easily understood by -- by other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And t-tell me a little bit about the high holidays and whether the children at Whittingehame celebrated any of them, or other holidays, like Passover and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: The children definitely celebrated all of the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s589">I am not -- I can’t remember so clearly exactly how it was, but I know that my parents made sure that there was a Seder, that there were Seders, that -- that the other holidays that there were some -- there were some religious observance, so that the children would remember their heritage.</span> <span id="s590">And sad to say I can’t remember who exactly went out to conduct the services, but -- but they were always made very, very much aware that they were Jewish, and where they came from, and what their heritage was.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Do you know if any of the children kept journals?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s593">We’re trying to find -- pretty late in the game but we’re trying to find children who might remember a-and who can tell us if they kept journals or not.</span> <span id="s594">I have some inquiries going out now as I’m trying to find children who were there.</span> <span id="s595">And so far I found one lady who now lives in New Jersey, who was out at Whittingehame and she remembers -- she remembers my parents picking them up in the car as a group and taking them to classical concerts in Edinburgh in the Usher Hall.</span> <span id="s596">Now, I don’t remember that, but when I talked to her she said that she always remembered my parents had taken them to concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Were there any negative comments made by non -Jews in Edinburgh about harboring these children, taking care of them during the war?</span> <span id="s598">Did you ever sense any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, no, I -- I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s600">I didn’t sense anything at all.</span> <span id="s601">I was -- I was young myself, but I think that had there been any negative, any negative or -- views at all, or any -- any sort of sign of anti-Semitism, that -- that my parents would have been aware of those and -- and they would have spoken among themselves.</span> <span id="s602">And w-we listened to what they said, but no, I didn’t hear anything at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And then you said when the law came about enemy aliens that the young men 16 and over had to leave, what was that like for these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I think they were very unhappy, obviously, that they were in they were th -- classified as enemy aliens, but this was the law of the land.</span> <span id="s605">In fact, one of my -- one of my uncles -- my mother’s sister married -- married an Austrian before World War I, and he lived in -- he lived in th -- Scotland all his life, in fact he was -- he ran one of my father’s businesses in Glasgow.</span> <span id="s606">Never thought of taking out citizenship.</span> <span id="s607">He’d been there what -- 30 - 40 years or more, and he was classified an enemy alien and he was interned.</span> <span id="s608">So I mean, all of the -- all of the men who were not of British birth and -- and who came from these countries, were automatically interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Did your parents have any communication or relationship with these children from 16 on, once they left to these internment camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: I think they must have done.</span> <span id="s611">I don’t honestly know, but I think that they must have kept in close contact with them.</span> <span id="s612">I can’t see that they wouldn’t have done because they were so -- they were so [indecipherable] of making -- they were so involved in making sure that these children knew that they -- they were loved and wanted, and I -- I just can’t see that they would have just let them go like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Now once these 16 year olds and over left, did new children take their place, or was there just less children at Whittingehame?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: It was less children.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Do y -- can you tell me a little bit abo -- more about the other staff at Whittingehame?</span> <span id="s616">You had mentioned some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes, the -- the agricultural side of their education was under the supervision of a Mr. Markham, who was Lord Traprain’s factor.</span> <span id="s618">Now, a factor, the -- the translation of that is the bailiff.</span> <span id="s619">He was -- he was Lord Traprain’s chief man who did the farming and -- and he took the children, he took the boys especially under his wing and taught them how to -- how to sow crops and do all the things that are necessary in farming.</span> <span id="s620">He was a great man and he -- he was -- he was very brusque but very, very kind, and -- and the boys liked him very much.</span> <span id="s621">And the other members of the staff was of course, Mr. Maxwell, who was the headmaster.</span> <span id="s622">There was Miss Lacker, the matron, who was German and who was a lovely lady, very, very -- very warm and compassionate and very competent at what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: This is a -- she was a German Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, I’m sorry, yes, she was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s625">There was Mr. Drew, who was not Jewish, who -- who was the English teacher and who was also the photographer and any of the photographs that we have were taken by him.</span> <span id="s626">We’re not sure of what happened to him after the war.</span> <span id="s627">There was a Mr. Likelbower from Palestine, who taught Hebrew, who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s628">A Miss Trauss, who was German and she was a cook and she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s629">And a Miss Mundy, who was English, who was the school secretary and I doubt that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s630">And I don’t know any of the other members of the staff, but I think that it was a fairly mixed group, partly -- partly Jewish and partly not.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: And did they all get along with each other?</span> <span id="s632">Di -- was there any friction among the staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Not as far as I know.</span> <span id="s634">I think that the ones were hard and came to work with the children were very, very much aware of what had happened, of where the children came from, of how they must be missing their families and I think that they -- that they worked very, very well together, and I think the children appreciated that.</span> <span id="s635">There were so many cases of home sickness and -- and sadness, and a -- and I think that they tried to help in every way they could.</span> <span id="s636">Plus, my mother was there, Miss Lacker was there and the Chaim Weitzman’s wife was there, and they knew they could go to them and talk to them if there really was -- if there really was a problem and they needed to talk to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: What happened if there was a health problem, if a child needed emergency medical attention?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I don’t remember that, but I’m quite sure that my parents would have made sure that there was medical facilities there, also close-by that were available for them, because obviously there had to have been some kind of emergencies during -- or health problems during that time, but everything seemed to go smoothly and I think that if there were health -- health problems they had, th-there was medical there -- medical people there to take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Was there a bomb shelter on the property?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: I think there was, I’m not very sure.</span> <span id="s641">I know that the children were all taught in -- in first aid and what to do if a bomb fell.</span> <span id="s642">I-I don’t remember seeing a bomb shelter myself, but if not then I think that they must have been told where to go in case of -- in case of an air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: W-Were there air raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s645">Oh yes, there were air raids.</span> <span id="s646">We were just -- the school was only a-a-about 20 miles at the most from the city and we had air raids in the city, so -- a-and then of course there were RAF stations -- Royal Air Force stations of -- the bases, I think you call them, all around there, so -- and the Germans tried to bomb them, so yes, we had frequent air raids.</span> <span id="s647">And -- I’m sorry -- and -- and of course, a -- the school had to practice strict blackout.</span> <span id="s648">All th -- all of the windows had to be completely covered at night and a-a-a-at -- the same sort of things that we had to do in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So the staff that you mentioned stayed there at the school and were there during the evening and -- and nighttime?</span> <span id="s650">Who -- or -- or was there another nighttime staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Oh no, the staff lived there.</span> <span id="s652">They lived on the premises.</span> <span id="s653">As far [indecipherable] as far as I was concerned -- as far as I can remember, there was no other staff there, I mean, these are the people that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s655">So they were there with the children during the -- the air raids and the blackouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Absolutely yes, yes.</span> <span id="s657">And at one time I think that a bomb did fall -- I think my sister was -- was staying there that night and I think that a bomb did fell -- fall on the nearby air force base and there was quite some consternation, but everything was taken care of.</span> <span id="s658">And the children knew, I mean, they knew what was happening, they knew the -- the danger of air raids and [indecipherable] during war time, and after what they’d gone through I think that they were just prepared to do anything that had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And where did new clothes come from?</span> <span id="s660">Obviously, if they’d lived there for six years, the children got bigger, heavier, so forth.</span> <span id="s661">Whe-Where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: It must have ga -- the clothing must have come from a fund that -- that the -- that -- that the Jewish community provided for the running of the school.</span> <span id="s663">I think that -- that the -- the clothing must have been part of it and of course, all of us were under very, very strict clothing rationing.</span> <span id="s664">So, I mean, it was -- it was -- it was not so easy to get the clothes that you wanted.</span> <span id="s665">I think that we all wore very functional clothing, clothing that would -- the clothing that would last and that ge -- that we could wear for more than one occasion.</span> <span id="s666">So I think that the -- that the children were definitely well-clothed, but there was very, very sensible clothing.</span> <span id="s667">And of course, they all had -- as I say -- we all had ration books -- we all had ration books for food and -- and for clothing and for anything, so I mean i-i-it was very hard to buy things spontaneously that -- at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: What kind of activities did the children do for recreation there?</span> <span id="s669">After all, they were still children.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I don’t remember precisely, but I know that they had -- they were divided into various [indecipherable] squads and -- and they had all kinds of games and they had play sessions, they had games.</span> <span id="s671">I’m not sure if-if they played -- if they played British soccer.</span> <span id="s672">I should think that they did, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s673">The girls played hockey, but they all seemed to have some kind of very rounded education.</span> <span id="s674">Yi -- which included sports, and -- and physical education, because these were very, very -- very sensitive years for these children.</span> <span id="s675">They were growing fast and they had to have a proper education.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s677">Di -- was there any discussion, let’s say your mother or your older sister to the girls who were maturing physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes, I believe that -- and I think that my sister was involved with this.</span> <span id="s679">I think that -- that the girls would come to my mother, and I -- and to ask for advice, and I think that they could talk to my sister.</span> <span id="s680">She was only two years older than I was, but she seemed to be more mature at that time.</span> <span id="s681">These are years of which I -- a couple of years can make a great deal of difference.</span> <span id="s682">So they were there for them, and I think that there were times where some of the children felt that they had a crush on some of the other children and I -- I remember that my mother especially was there to kind of adjudicate what was going on.</span> <span id="s683">And it -- it was a community, but it was a happy community and the children all lived and thrived and after the war they all went their separate ways, and some went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s684">Some, very few, found family and made new lives for themselves.</span> <span id="s685">A-And they all survived, a-and that was the most important thing of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Were your parents in touch with the other -- the other 33, I guess, children that your father helped to place in different homes?</span> <span id="s687">Not the Whittingehame children, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, no, I know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: -- did your father and mother keep up with those children at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Well, yes, I mean sa -- mainly because they were part of the community.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, it was a very, very small congregation and i-i -- we knew everybody.</span> <span id="s692">I mean, the people who -- who had agreed to take these children in were all -- I wou -- I would almost say some friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s693">So we kept in close touch.</span> <span id="s694">As I say, I think that our boys had two cousins, th -- and they were in one of my mother’s friend’s houses and this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s695">I think my aunt -- I believe my aunt in Glasgow took one of them.</span> <span id="s696">And my -- my mother-in-law, as it turned out to be, she took one of them, so they’re all people that we knew and they’re all part of the congregation.</span> <span id="s697">Another thing which is nothing to do with these children is that when the refugees came into -- into Edinburgh, I think my parents were largely responsible for establishing a refugee club for them.</span> <span id="s698">And they would -- they would find -- they would rent somewhere, a little hole or a big room somewhere, and once a week, or so -- twice a week, they could come together and gather and just talk to each other.</span> <span id="s699">And we used to go to refugee club and talk to them and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s700">So, I mean, apart from the children, they were also trying to help the grownups and just to see that they had some kind -- some kind -- some kind of connection with each other, that they weren't so completely alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: These were adult refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: These wer -- yes, these were adult refugees.</span> <span id="s703">These were people that had managed to come in -- in fact, my -- one of the people that my father signed an affidavit for was called Dr. Adler and he and his wife came in.</span> <span id="s704">One -- another refugee was the Dr. Schneider, who became a very, very good dentist.</span> <span id="s705">But Dr. Adler became my mother’s physician and you know, my par -- my parents kept -- kept in close touch with them, which is rather interesting thinking about it, cause I’m wondering if they had to sit exams before they could -- if they could practice in -- but they definitely did.</span> <span id="s706">And we had refugees come into the house all the time.</span> <span id="s707">And -- and my father was constantly trying to see what he could do.</span> <span id="s708">He knew what was happening, he knew what was going on and as time goes by we could see more and more newsreels and stuff of what was happening in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Di-Did you know about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes, we -- yes, we knew about the -- about the camps.</span> <span id="s711">I think that we knew more than other people and just agonized about them.</span> <span id="s712">I mean, we were just so lucky that we had no close family members that were -- that were caught in there.</span> <span id="s713">And I think that my parents felt this.</span> <span id="s714">I think they felt that they were so privileged that we escaped this that they wanted to help the people that wer -- that were so unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: That’s why -- one of the reasons why, a-as an aside, when I came to Washington -- came to Virginia, I was so happy that I could work for the museum and try and keep on the work that my parents were doing.</span> <span id="s717">It was the one thing I wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: We’ll talk about that a little later.</span> <span id="s719">I know with the Kindertransport children, many of them were placed in homes of non-Jewish families.</span> <span id="s720">Were any of the 35 children that your father helped place, placed in non-Jewish families, or all were placed in Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: They were all placed with Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I think that a -- I mean, thinking back, my parents were completely involved in the Jewish community and I think that all of their friends really -- their close friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s724">And -- the people that my mother felt that she could contact and ask them, they were Jewish, and then she knew the kind of homes that they would be going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So it was never necessary to then move out into the -- into the non-Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, I think that -- thinking back on it that if they had they might have been able to bring more -- more children in, but it was a real feat to bring the 35 in, it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And again, could you just go over how your father heard about these 35 children?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I don’t think he heard about them, I think that we knew that -- that -- that there were children being brought in on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s729">We knew that there were thousands being brought in and I think there was a -- there was a plea sent out to all of the Jewish communities, could they take people.</span> <span id="s730">I mean, he had no knowledge of who these children were, but it was just this -- this -- it’s a question, can you help, can you take children.</span> <span id="s731">That’s what they responded to.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s733">Were there any Jewish residents who were negative about this, or was it all a positive response?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh, I’m quite sure that some people said that they would rather not.</span> <span id="s735">I mean, I’m quite sure, I mean I don’t know, but I’m quite sure there was some, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Why do you say that?</span> <span id="s737">A: Well, I don’t know, I mean, but thinking back and knowing the nature that there’s some people that would and some people that won’t.</span> <span id="s738">And I -- I just can’t think that everybody that my mother sa -- contacted would say, oh yeah sure, yes of course we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s739">I’m quite sure there were people that said, hey I’m sorry, we can’t do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Because of the responsibility, yeah.</span> <span id="s741">Is there anything more you can talk about, about Whittingehame during ’39 to ’45 that we haven’t covered yet, because I wanted to then move on to aft -- you know, when the war was over.</span> <span id="s742">Is there anything else that you remember?</span> <span id="s743">Were there any crises that happened at Whittingehame?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s745">No -- I-I think there was a -- a small crisis when -- when some -- some girls said they were heartbroken because they -- they had this crush on one of the boys or something like this, and -- and they’ll be some -- people will go and talk to them and, you know, -- and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s746">Nothing really, nothing really.</span> <span id="s747">I think that it -- it was a regular school and I think that there were ups and downs and I think that obviously -- perhaps some of the children were sick sometimes, but it all worked out, but very, very well.</span> <span id="s748">It was an excellent teaching staff and there were people there like the Chaim Weitzman’s wife, like the Masons or like my parents, who were always there on hand to be there if they were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: So Vera Weitzman, she didn’t teach any classes, she was just there for suppor -- ma -- emotional support?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I don’t believe that she taught, no, but she was always there.</span> <span id="s751">And she was very, very -- very enthusiastic about it, and very, very involved with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: And did the children get report cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I don’t know, I -- because it was a school, I’m pretty sure that they did, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s754">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: And the food came from the -- the farm land that -- the surrounding farmland that it was a part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I don’t know where the food came from, I know that -- that it was strictly rationed.</span> <span id="s757">I know that all of the -- all of the people [indecipherable] it was strictly kosher and therefore had to come from Edinburgh from the -- from the Jewish butchers.</span> <span id="s758">I’m sure that -- that the dairy stuff came from the surrounding farms, but there again, it was rationed, everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s759">And I -- I know that my father, as I said before, was -- was himself [indecipherable] trying to find extra food for them.</span> <span id="s760">I mean, h-he was always going out.</span> <span id="s761">He wa -- because of the person he was, he knew people and -- and he would go out and say look, there’s a school here, you know, so can’t you help?</span> <span id="s762">And they would respond to it because they knew what kind of a person he was.</span> <span id="s763">In fact, I tell -- in fact I tell a story which is co -- completely different to this.</span> <span id="s764">When we lived in Walkerburn during these two years i-in our country house, it was a little tiny village, and -- and there was -- and there was a convent there, and we used to go visit the nuns, and -- and they were sewing -- bless you -- robes for the -- for the Edinburgh bishops.</span> <span id="s765">Anyway, it was terribly cold, it was pitifully cold.</span> <span id="s766">I mean, and -- and we had no heating at all.</span> <span id="s767">And they would sit and sew these beautiful, beautiful embroidered gowns and the -- and th-their fingers would be blue.</span> <span id="s768">And they told us that they were -- they were praying for a miracle to get coal.</span> <span id="s769">Coal was also rationed.</span> <span id="s770">So we told my father and my father went around, around, and he had two tons of coal delivered to them.</span> <span id="s771">And they said, you see?</span> <span id="s772">We asked for a miracle.</span> <span id="s773">That was my father.</span> <span id="s774">Q: How did he get all the, as you say, petrol to keep driving out to Whittingehame?</span> <span id="s775">It took a lot of gasoline.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I don’t know how he got it.</span> <span id="s777">I know that -- that he had to be very careful because they would -- they would put dye in the petrol so that you know if -- if you -- you had a certain ration, and afterwards if you got black market petrol, it is -- very often it -- it had dye in it so they could tell if it was non-kosher.</span> <span id="s778">And -- and I’m not sure how he did it, but -- but he -- I mean, he had ways of doing it.</span> <span id="s779">And he’d ask people.</span> <span id="s780">He’d just go and say, look, you know, we need this.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: What did the children call him?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Do you know, I don’t know?</span> <span id="s783">Possibly Mr. Cohen, yeah.</span> <span id="s784">Called my mother Mrs. Cohen.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So now the war is winding down and it sounds to me the -- the negative part was when the young -- young men had to leave to go to the internment camps.</span> <span id="s786">But when that happened, did the atmosphere change at the school?</span> <span id="s787">I mean, the -- all these children were enemy aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Were there -- was there any restrictions on the children who remained at the school a -- from that point on, when the older children had to leave -- the older boys had to leave, were there any restrictions or did life go on the same once the boys left?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, I think that when they were declared enemy aliens, they were -- they were under much stricter -- they were under a much stricter rule.</span> <span id="s791">I mean, they couldn’t move around the country, they couldn’t leave, they had to say where they were this time, but of course, for these children they were -- they were in the school, there was nowhere for them to go to, but I think that had they wanted to, that they would have had to sign papers or this sort of thing that, you know, they were enemy aliens, and -- and -- and it -- it -- th-they would have to report if they went anywhere.</span> <span id="s792">But apart from that I think that – that -- you know, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s794">And did we talk about the children who were in the city who were in the different houses coming out to the 30 -- the 35 children coming out to Whittingehame?</span> <span id="s795">Did they ever do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: I don’t believe they ever did.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t believe they ever did.</span> <span id="s798">I don’t believe that -- I can’t remember any of the Jewish community really going out of their way to go out there.</span> <span id="s799">I think that they -- I think that they -- that they -- that the board, the governors of the school used to go out and take their families, but I don’t remember any of the other ones going out.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s801">So it was just the staff and the governors and people like that, who had a direct interest going out, but otherwise, the regular Jewish residents did not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: No, as far as I know they didn’t and as far as I can remember, I don’t believe that the -- the 33 childr -- or 35 children went out either.</span> <span id="s803">It may -- it may have been because of an petrol restriction, I don’t know, but as far -- I don’t remember there ever being any sort of get together with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So now the war is ending, and then what -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Well, the children all went their certain ways, as of say -- the children who found out, sadly, that their families were no more.</span> <span id="s806">Other went to other people, o-others went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s807">Most of them sa -- went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s808">Some di-did find family, went to join them, a-and --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Were -- were you out there when the children actually heard that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Do you know if there was any kind of celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Oh, I think there had to be.</span> <span id="s813">I mean, I remember what it was like for us on -- on V-E Day, and V-J Day and I mean, it was sheer jubilation, and I think -- I think that -- my own feeling was that, well of course there was -- there was rejoicing, there was also a lot of fear and uncertainty what will -- what’s going to happen to us now.</span> <span id="s814">I mean -- I mean, there had to have been.</span> <span id="s815">I mean they had -- they’d been there for what, five or six years.</span> <span id="s816">They had some kind of -- the security feeling that here were their ties, here was a basis.</span> <span id="s817">All of a sudden they were going to go out on their own again.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And the youngest were 14 when they entered --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: --- wasn’t that -- so they’re now 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s822">Yes, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, it was six years for us, I mean, the war was six years and of course the -- they were young adults by the time they left.</span> <span id="s824">Which was -- I mean, which was good, I mean, it had had this time to -- to grow up in a community that was very, very safe and solid and wherever they went to, they had a good back -- had had a good background, you know, and -- and I’m quite sure that the people that taught them were very, very -- very, very careful to make sure that they had something to fall back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Were you there when any representatives from Palestine came over to try to encourage these young people to move to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s827">I think though that -- I don’t think they had to encourage them, I think that the children that found out that their families were no longer alive, didn’t have much -- or, I mean, i-it sounds bad to say, didn’t have any alternative, but th-they were lost, I mean, and they thought that th-there was a home for them in Palestine.</span> <span id="s828">It was obviously the best thing for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hilda Seftor.</span> <span id="s831">This is tape two, side B. And we had started talking about what happened when the war was over, and you said some of the children went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s832">How did they hear -- do you know how they heard about what happened to their families?</span> <span id="s833">Did representatives come to the school?</span> <span id="s834">Do you have any information about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s836">I think that some of them had written to their homes and hoped and hoped and waited and waited and I think -- I believe I remember that some of them got the envelopes back saying that -- that their parents were no more.</span> <span id="s837">But I don’t know -- you know, this is the only thi-thing that I do know.</span> <span id="s838">It -- it was a very, very hard time for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: And how involved w-were your parents when the war was over?</span> <span id="s840">How involved were your parents at Whittingehame when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I don’t remember ho-how it wound down, actually.</span> <span id="s842">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s843">I mean, I have -- I have no -- so maybe you told us what happened when it closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Whe-When did it close, do you remember?</span> <span id="s845">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s846">I think -- I think that it must have been -- I don’t know if it -- if it remained after war finished in 1945, if it went on or not.</span> <span id="s847">This is something that I’ve been trying to find out, but I have no memory of it.</span> <span id="s848">I think that it just wound down that the children one by one went to the various places, and I think that they just quietly closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: What happened to Agon and Max?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Agon and Max found out -- my parents found out that they had distant relatives in London, so they -- by that time they were -- they were young adults, and they went down to live with them.</span> <span id="s851">I believe that Agon went into the construction business, and I believe that Max went to work with a furrier.</span> <span id="s852">That’s much as I know, they both a -- they became very involved in the Jewish community where they lived, and they both married girls from London.</span> <span id="s853">And my father was no longer alive at that time, but my mother and I, I remember sa -- that we caught the train twice, to go down to their weddings.</span> <span id="s854">Andthey were very, very happy that we did so.</span> <span id="s855">Unfortunately, when I came to this country I lost complete touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s857">And what about any of the children from Whittingehame?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: I have no idea where any of them went, I -- I’ve been sending out inquiries just now, trying to find out and hopefully that I might find where some -- some of them are.</span> <span id="s859">This lady in New Jersey who I talked to has given me the names of some.</span> <span id="s860">Some of are in Pales -- some are in Israel now, and some [indecipherable] in England so I’m -- I’m trying to find out if I can get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s861">And it will be great.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you ever go back to Whittingehame once the children left?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s864">I’ve looked it up on the internet and I see the house is still there, and I believe it became a correctional li -- school for boys afterwards.</span> <span id="s865">And I’m not sure what it is now.</span> <span id="s866">According to what I read on the internet, it has been divided into private apartments, but it is still owned by the Balfour family.</span> <span id="s867">It is still a beautiful, beautiful area, a beautiful, beautiful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Let’s now talk about what happened to you after the war, summarizing on how you got to this country and so forth.</span> <span id="s869">So the war is over in ’45, and what happened with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Well, the war finished in 1945, and unfortunately my father died very suddenly on the 19th of June in 1945, just before V-E Day.</span> <span id="s871">He was only 59 years old, it was a great, great shock to us.</span> <span id="s872">My mother was very sick at the time and we went through a very, very sad time at that time.</span> <span id="s873">After the war I became engaged to a man -- to a young man from Edinburgh, one who -- because we knew all of the families in Edinburgh, I had grown up with, I had seen him at the Jewish holidays and at the synagogue and I had been very friendly with -- with his sister, who went to the same school I did, and he went he joined the -- the British army during the war, he was a captain in the Royal Engineers and was stationed out in India.</span> <span id="s874">And he came back after the war and I met him at a -- at a Jewish charity dance, and we became engaged and married.</span> <span id="s875">And he was working for his mother, who was a furrier.</span> <span id="s876">Didn’t work out so we decided to emigrate.</span> <span id="s877">And we ha -- by that time we had one little boy who was two years old, Lawrence, and my mother was desperately upset when we said we were going.</span> <span id="s878">She loved her first grandson.</span> <span id="s879">And I remember saying to her, don’t worry, we’ll come back and see you in two year’s time.</span> <span id="s880">We got to -- well, that’s another -- we -- we sailed on the -- on the first Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s881">We sailed in February, and these ships really rolled.</span> <span id="s882">It was a very, very stormy crossing and most of the passengers spent all of their time in their cabins.</span> <span id="s883">We -- she either lost or gained an hour each day, so we were five hours -- I’m not sure if it’s ahead or behind when we got to New York.</span> <span id="s884">We got to New York and I remember sailing up the Hudson and seeing the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s885">We stayed there overnight and -- and a Jewish friend of ours who we befriended when-- he was in the American army, met us at the boat to go to our hotel, and then took us to his home for our first American meal.</span> <span id="s886">And his -- his wife was a daughter of a Jewish butcher, and she had prepared huge steaks for us, and we couldn't eat them.</span> <span id="s887">And she was very upset with us until we sort of explained we can’t do this, you know?</span> <span id="s888">Anyway, the very next morning we got a taxi to LaGuardia airport and it was bitterly cold, that was -- the 28th of February I think it was, bitterly cold and as we got on the -- on the plane it -- they were -- they were brushing the snow off the wings.</span> <span id="s889">And I was terrified.</span> <span id="s890">We had a two year old child, we were going to California and I was absolutely terrified.</span> <span id="s891">My husband was promised a job as a furrier there, so we had to get there right away.</span> <span id="s892">We got on board plane and my son Lawrence started screaming and he screamed all the way to Chicago.</span> <span id="s893">In Chicago, all of the pay -- all of the passengers were told to get off to get boxed lunches, but by that time Lawrence had stopped screaming, he’d fallen asleep, so we stayed onboard.</span> <span id="s894">And five hours later we got to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s895">When we got to Los Angeles it was 90 degrees and I almost died.</span> <span id="s896">I honestly almost died, I had never known such heat in my life.</span> <span id="s897">We had bought clothes in Edinburgh that was not suitable and we -- and we’re met by this friend of ours and he took us to a motel in Studio City in the San Fernando Valley and left us there and the very next day so Jerry found out -- Jerry, my husband found out that the job that we’d come for was no longer there.</span> <span id="s898">So he started looking around and he ended up by working in the film labs.</span> <span id="s899">He worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he worked for Universal, this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s900">And we lived there for three and a half years and in these three and a half years I had two more sons.</span> <span id="s901">One was born - on July 13th in one year, one was born August 13th of the next year, they were 13 months apart.</span> <span id="s902">Well we didn’t stay in Los Angeles because Jerry had very, very bad sinus trouble, so we packed up and drove to Denver, Denver, Colorado and we lived in Denver for 15 years.</span> <span id="s903">Worked out very well, our fourth son was born there and I love Denver, had a wonderful time there.</span> <span id="s904">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Wha-What year did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Came to the United States in 1951.</span> <span id="s907">And been here for over 50 years now.</span> <span id="s908">And -- and Jerry and I became citizens as soon as we could, it was five years after we got here, in 1955 -- I think it was in 1955, and our son Lawrence became a citizen also.</span> <span id="s909">The other children, of course, we born over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: What did it mean to you to become an American citizen?</span> <span id="s911">A: Meant an awful lot.</span> <span id="s912">I’d always, always loved everything I’d read about United States, it was always like a fairy land to me, like another country, and of course the films, the movies that we saw were, you know, were like the Andy Hardy movies and things all looked as if things were so wonderful here, and I’d always wanted to come here.</span> <span id="s913">I had been engaged to an American during the war, a wonderful fellow who lived -- who actually lived in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s914">He was in the -- he was a navigator of a Flying Fortress.</span> <span id="s915">And he was my best friend until he died.</span> <span id="s916">I mean, he was a wonderful fellow.</span> <span id="s917">And it didn’t work out, so Jerry and I got married and -- and we came over here and -- and Bob continued to be a very good friend and when we found out that we had to leave California, we decided to go to Denver, Colorado and he and his -- he and his wife were our very good friends here.</span> <span id="s918">And -- and we stayed there for 15 years.</span> <span id="s919">Then after 15 years we went back to California again.</span> <span id="s920">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: And then you stayed how long in California?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Then we stayed -- then we stayed 15 years in California.</span> <span id="s923">Jerry had had whatever was bothering his sinuses had taken care of and California was all right, but I never really wanted it to be my home, I was deathly scared of earthquakes, and we’d been in two of them.</span> <span id="s924">We’d been in the -- the Tehachapi earthquake, I think, in 1952 and then in the San Fernando earthquake.</span> <span id="s925">And they’re very, very -- they’re very, very frightening, not only the earthquakes but the aftershocks afterwards.</span> <span id="s926">And -- and my family used to go to bed early and I’d be sitting in our living room.</span> <span id="s927">All of a sudden the whole place would heave, just silently heave.</span> <span id="s928">And after -- after my youngest son Colin was 10 years old, I went to work, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: We-Were the earthquakes more frightening than the bombing raids in Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s931">I think so.</span> <span id="s932">Partly because I-I was so young then and it was kind of exciting, you know, you hear the sirens and I think we were too young to realize what really cou-could happen.</span> <span id="s933">An-And -- and -- and my parents must have agonized.</span> <span id="s934">But the earthquake, I mean, with the -- with the bombings, you heard the sirens.</span> <span id="s935">You knew that something was going to happen and terrible things did happen, but with an earthquake, all of a sudden, your whole world is turned -- turned upside down.</span> <span id="s936">On one of them my husband was sitting at the dining room table very early one morning and the -- and the -- the chandelier light above his head -- he was sitting at the dining room table, just -- just shattered.</span> <span id="s937">And all of the doors in our apartment flew open, and -- and it went on from there, and it was the uncertainty, I mean and when -- when we lived there all these years, I had four boys and the last earthquake, the San Fernando one, I had two boys at college, at UCLA Northridge.</span> <span id="s938">I was working in downtown L.A. and Jerry was in the San Fernando Valley and it -- it kept on going through my mind, if it’s a bad earthquake and the freeways are buckled, we’re all in different parts of -- how we going to get together?</span> <span id="s939">The place I worked with at that time was a department store and -- and they had an elevator for the employees, and the walls of the elevator were so buckled that the elevator couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s940">It was a very, very fr -- it’s very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I think it’s not knowing that -- that the ground under you is -- is going to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: When did you come to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Came here in December 1954 -- I’m sorry, came here i-in -- in December 1994.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And I’d like to now talk to you about your work at the museum, why you decided, or when did you decide to start volunteering at the museum?</span> <span id="s946">A: Well, I’m the perennial volunteer.</span> <span id="s947">I’ve -- ever since World War II, I volunteered in some way or another all my life.</span> <span id="s948">I -- I volunteered for the Red Cross in Denver for about 15 years.</span> <span id="s949">I have thousands of hours there.</span> <span id="s950">I was head of Red Cross motor service.</span> <span id="s951">That’s another story, but -- but I volunteered when we went to Tucson, Arizona, I volunteered in Saint Mary’s Hospital for nine years.</span> <span id="s952">So I’ve always volunteered, but when we came t -- when we came here, I thought, my goodness, the United States Memorial -- Holocaust Memorial Museum is here, could I possibly?</span> <span id="s953">And I thought I couldn’t, because there was the transportation.</span> <span id="s954">And we went down, we saw the museum, we were totally overwhelmed, my husband and my son and I. And I called them and said, is there any way I could come?</span> <span id="s955">And I talked to Genya Marken.</span> <span id="s956">And she said well, we have a training class in October but, she said, if you want to come now, I’m in the photo archives.</span> <span id="s957">So I went into -- I went in -- had an interview with her and she said -- she knew that I wasn’t a survivor, she knew that I hadn’t had anything drastic happen to me during the -- the war, yet she said, why do you want to do this?</span> <span id="s958">And I said, because my parents were so involved and through them I was -- I became involved and I said, I’d love to think that I’m continuing to do what my parents were doing.</span> <span id="s959">And she said, well you know, you can’t just come for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s960">Evidently she had some volunteers that came in once a week for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s961">She said, you’d have to come and make a real investment in this.</span> <span id="s962">And I said, sure I will.</span> <span id="s963">And so I started, and because my husband volunteered at a school and needed to be there by eight, he would drive me to the Metro station and I would get to the museum at seven o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s964">And I had -- I had a special permission from the guards to go in there, and it was completely deserted, apart from the guards.</span> <span id="s965">And I would go up to the fifth floor, everything was quiet and everything was partly dark and I’d walk across the glass bridge and go into the photo archives, and the first thing I do is put on everybody’s computers.</span> <span id="s966">I knew all of their passwords so that they [indecipherable] them.</span> <span id="s967">And then I would -- I worked to Sharon Muller and -- and -- and Teresa Pollik -- but at that -- Pollin, but that time was mainly Sharon Muller, and she was -- she was good to work with because she was very, very precise.</span> <span id="s968">Extremely precise, I mean, and -- and she was never too busy to answer my questions.</span> <span id="s969">I mean, there were always people coming through at photo archives, asking for things, all the [indecipherable] come in, and I could go over and say, Sharon, could I possibly ask you this and she would stop everything and tell me what to do.</span> <span id="s970">I mean, I’m -- I felt that -- how I say, that I knew -- that I felt very confident what I did because she taught me how to do it.</span> <span id="s971">And I -- I worked there for six years.</span> <span id="s972">They called me their unpaid staff.</span> <span id="s973">I would go as -- I worked there four days a week, six hours a day.</span> <span id="s974">I’d leave there at one o’clock and Jerry would meet me.</span> <span id="s975">And I did so much.</span> <span id="s976">I think one of the things that I’m very, very proud of is that I did -- I processed the Auschwitz collection.</span> <span id="s977">That’s a collection of 2400 photographs that were found in a suitcase, and this lady -- I can’t remember her -- her second name, but she found them.</span> <span id="s978">Anyway, they had it in -- in Israel and we asked them if we could have this collection and there was a lot of negotiating going on with Sharon Muller and Teresa Pollin and th-this lady Ann, I can’t remember her second name.</span> <span id="s979">Anyway, she came and she said that if we made copies for her that we -- that we could have -- we could make copies for ourselves also.</span> <span id="s980">So we got the negatives and I remember Sharon and Teresa talking themselves one day and saying, do you think Hilda would like to do it?</span> <span id="s981">So they asked me and I said yeah.</span> <span id="s982">I ha -- I think so.</span> <span id="s983">So I did this whole thing.</span> <span id="s984">I had the contact prints, I had negatives, I did -- put this whole thing together.</span> <span id="s985">There were 2400 photographs, I put them by category, by this, and everything else.</span> <span id="s986">And I got so involved with it.</span> <span id="s987">They were ma -- they were mainly from people who had lived in a place called Bedzin in Poland and it was near the -- near a mountain resort.</span> <span id="s988">And it was the saddest thing because here were these pictures of these -- these photographs and there are people who -- who are leading happy lives before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s989">There were pe -- there were weddings, there were -- there were picnics, there were family outings and there were a lot of -- lot of photographs of school -- school groups, a-and they were -- they were the Jewish -- what do they call them?</span> <span id="s990">Gymnasiums?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Gymnasiums, and -- and -- I got to the point that I would -- I would be able to pick out the people from the various families and -- and be able to put names to them and -- and put them on the computer.</span> <span id="s993">And we got this whole thing together and we had them blown up and they’re now -- and they’re now in this album that I have here, and this -- a -- it’s a wonderful album.</span> <span id="s994">But Auschwitz, the collection, is really, really very special to me.</span> <span id="s995">And I also did -- I processed the Anne Frank thing there.</span> <span id="s996">I did the Hannah Szenes.</span> <span id="s997">I did --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Wh-What exactly did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: I got the photographs together, I put captions on them, I put them on the computer, I wrote things about them, and can’t remember this other man, this wonderful man who led the children out and was -- and was killed.</span> <span id="s1000">I mean, th-there was so many things that I did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Janusz Korczak?</span> <span id="s1002">A: Yes, exactly, thank you.</span> <span id="s1003">And that really touched my heart, you know?</span> <span id="s1004">And -- and I did the Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s1005">I did the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1006">But with all of the things that [indecipherable] the concentration camps and seeing the stacks of bodies, they didn’t affect me as much as working with the pictures, the photographs of people that were happy before the Holocaust, thinking they don’t know what’s -- what’s ahead of them.</span> <span id="s1007">They’re -- there are nursery groups with children, in their nurse -- I mean, not knowing what’s ahead of them.</span> <span id="s1008">That just br -- i-it really broke my heart.</span> <span id="s1009">And -- and can’t thi -- I mean, I -- I have a whole collection of what I did there.</span> <span id="s1010">And I did important -- important Jewish people throughout the world and -- and -- and important non-Jewish people throughout the world and I used to go into the library and spend hours reading up biographies and things of these people.</span> <span id="s1011">So I mean, I did a lot of -- a lot of work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: So you were the one to catalog it, to label it, to put them in groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: [indecipherable] yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: And put it -- put the information on the computer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Right, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s1018">And then, after six years, and my husband died very suddenly and I had surgery and I left and then after that, I talked to Teresa Pollin and she said, would you like to work with me?</span> <span id="s1019">And I said, yes I’d love to.</span> <span id="s1020">And -- so I started working at home and that’s when I started doing -- I did this history of this little girl who came on the t -- on the -- on the Kindertransport and who was heartbroken at leaving her parents.</span> <span id="s1021">And then I -- I recently finished recording the names of 14 and a half thousand Polish children that were in the Lódz ghetto for an exhibit that is going to be opened th-this coming fall, I understand, about the Lódz ghetto.</span> <span id="s1022">Teresa Pollin’s working on it and she asked me to do these in a hurry, and I did and what she did -- well, what she does is when she goes to Israel, she tries to get hold of anybody that might have any connection with these people and by having the names with her then she can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: So you entered all these 14,000 names --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: 14 and a half thousand names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: -- on -- o-on the computer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: I’ll show you.</span> <span id="s1027">Ye-Yes, I -- I entered 14 and a half thousand names, they were Polish names.</span> <span id="s1028">And they in themselves were heartbreaking because some of them had the ages on them and some of them were little children.</span> <span id="s1029">Now I’m transcribing survivor’s histories and each one of them is different and each one of them is a story in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: You’re transcribing from interviews?</span> <span id="s1031">A: Transcribing from -- from the material that the museum sends me.</span> <span id="s1032">They send me rough drafts, and I transcribe them onto the computer and then -- and then email them back to the museum.</span> <span id="s1033">I think I’m on my 40th just now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: And what is your feeling when you walk into the museum building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I love being there.</span> <span id="s1036">It is -- it is the hardest thing for me and the saddest thing that I can’t go down as often as I used to.</span> <span id="s1037">I get this feeling of awe going in there.</span> <span id="s1038">I never go in there without this feeling of just absolute awe that this -- this building is there and that is -- and there’s so much that is going on there, and there’s so much that -- that is recorded there.</span> <span id="s1039">I mean, I if I could, I would be down there every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Is there a particular part of the museum, a particular exhibit that you -- that affects you the most deeply?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1042">I think I’ve only been through the -- the permanent exhibition perhaps about three times.</span> <span id="s1043">I can’t do it more than that, but there -- the exhi -- the exhibits that always hurt me the most, really get to my heart, are the ones of families -- families loading the transports, families being taken off to the camps.</span> <span id="s1044">These wonderful people who are sometimes beautifully dressed, sometimes not, but they’ve got no idea of what’s in front of them.</span> <span id="s1045">This -- this is so hard for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Does it bring back memories of the children that you met in -- at Whittingehame and the other boys, the -- Agon and Max?</span> <span id="s1047">I mean, does it stimulate your memories when you go there?</span> <span id="s1048">A: Oh yes, of course it does.</span> <span id="s1049">I mean, I see children in these photographs, they look so much like the children that were at Whittingehame, so -- so much like Max and Agon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1051">Do you have a lot of contact with the other volunteers at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No, I think that what I -- the work that I’ve been doing has always been kind of something that I’ve done by myself and I really have no contact with the other volunteers at all.</span> <span id="s1053">In fact, I don’t think I don’t think I know any of them.</span> <span id="s1054">I have -- I have gone to the appreciation nights in the past, but I don’t go any more and I don’t go to the dinners, and I’m perfectly happy not to.</span> <span id="s1055">I think I’m just happy to do what I’ve done, you know, and I know the other volunteers are a community in themselves and they know each other and that’s fine.</span> <span id="s1056">One of the things I do, and I try to do every year, is I go down on Holocaust Remembrance dray -- day, and I read names.</span> <span id="s1057">And I’ve done this every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1059">N-Names of the victims?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1061">Yeah, the names of the victims and sometimes they’re very, very hard to read, they -- you know, Polish or Czechoslovak.</span> <span id="s1062">This year I went down and they gave me a choice and I chose names that were from Norway, and they were easier to read.</span> <span id="s1063">But I mean, each one of them is a heartbreak, I mean.</span> <span id="s1064">You -- you read these names and you see families, you see whole groups of names and you see ages from the grandfather to the little children just months old, and it has to tear out your heart to know that they all -- they all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Did you ever go back to visit in Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I’ve been back to Scotland three, perhaps four times.</span> <span id="s1067">We wouldn’t leave our children when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s1068">The first time my husband and I went back to visit was in 1973 on our 25th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1069">And my husband and I went back, I think twice after that.</span> <span id="s1070">And then I went back ba -- by myself about nine years ago to visit my cousin, who has a fa -- who had a farm outside Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s1071">And then the last time I went to visit was with my son, two years after that.</span> <span id="s1072">And I don’t think I’ll go back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Do you feel Scottish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Yes, I do feel Scottish, yes I do.</span> <span id="s1075">I mean, I -- I guess -- when I go over there people say that I talk with an American accent.</span> <span id="s1076">Here they say I talk with a Scottish accent.</span> <span id="s1077">But there’s something very, very Scottish about me, and I love to hear the bagpipes.</span> <span id="s1078">I get so homesick.</span> <span id="s1079">And a -- a funny story that I will tell you is that a friend of mine told me that she had a friend who plays the bagpipes in the American Air Force Bagpipe Band, of all things.</span> <span id="s1080">And she said, he would like to meet you.</span> <span id="s1081">So she brought him here one evening, with his bagpipes.</span> <span id="s1082">Now this is a -- this is a townhouse association and -- and -- and there are neighbors on the side.</span> <span id="s1083">He brought out his bagpipes and started to play.</span> <span id="s1084">Now, you know how loud they are.</span> <span id="s1085">My -- my son at the time was the president of the homeowner’s association.</span> <span id="s1086">I could see him literally getting paler by the minute.</span> <span id="s1087">But it was great.</span> <span id="s1088">I mean, I mean I can have tears in my eyes when I hear the bagpipes.</span> <span id="s1089">It brings back so much to me.</span> <span id="s1090">I absolutely love it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Is there anything else you’d want to add before we end?</span> <span id="s1092">Any thoughts that you have, whether the world has learned from the Holocaust or anything that you care to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1094">I honestly don’t know.</span> <span id="s1095">I was left with a feeling of antagonism bu -- towards anything German.</span> <span id="s1096">I didn’t want to know German people or anything like this, but in the last few years I -- I have two very good friends who are German.</span> <span id="s1097">One very, very dear friend who is in Coburg, Germany, and I realized that there are good people everywhere, and that -- and one can’t judge people by their nationality, by their race or anything else.</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, I feel that -- that what is going on now i-in the world is deeply upsetting.</span> <span id="s1099">You know, you see anti-Semitism everywhere, you see racism everywhere, and I don’t think that -- I don’t think it will ever be any -- any better, and that’s what really bothers me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Well, it’s wonderful that you continued to work and to document these people’s history.</span> <span id="s1101">That’s wonder -- wonderful that you do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Well, you know, we’re all getting so much older, the survivors and myself, we’re getting very much older and it’s so good to know that anything that we can say now might live on and that people can perhaps listen to it and hear what it was like during these year, and -- and for me myself, my -- my prime reason for doing this is so that people would get to know what my parents did, how much they cared, how much they agonized over what was happening in Europe and how much they wanted to help and how much they did help in a very, very quiet way, but they -- they gave everything that they could and I think that this should be remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Hilda Seftor.</span> <span id="s1106">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1107">You had mentioned something previously about a menorah.</span> <span id="s1108">Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, at Whittingehame, my parents loved being there and they were very, very surprised when they were invited to go out one special evening and they -- because they didn’t usually get an invitation, we went out and that was fine and they -- the staff said no [indecipherable] come out tonight, could you possibly come, and we said okay.</span> <span id="s1110">So we came out and -- and -- and I’m not sure how many of this -- of the children were there, if they were all there or not, I don’t remember that, but one of them got up and made a speech and said that they had worked on something very special as a gift for my parents and they were going to present it to them.</span> <span id="s1111">And the brought out this absolutely beautiful menorah that they had carved by themselves and written in Hebrew on it.</span> <span id="s1112">It was about three foot across, and -- and made of beautiful wood, and they said that they would like us to have it and -- in appreciation for all that we had done for them.</span> <span id="s1113">Well, we took -- my par -- my father was a very quiet man who wa -- had a very soft heart and when he’s touched and the tears came to his eyes, and he said something appropriate, I’m not sure what he said.</span> <span id="s1114">But we took it home and we used it every year and it was on our -- on our sideboard at home every year that I remember.</span> <span id="s1115">Then I was the first of the family to leave the country and when I left my mother was still alive, and there was the menorah.</span> <span id="s1116">And then after that my sister left and the last person to leave was my brother.</span> <span id="s1117">And we didn’t know, evidently he brought everything he could.</span> <span id="s1118">And he is no longer alive, but his wife lives in San Francisco -- very, very fond of her.</span> <span id="s1119">And about three months ago she called me and said she was cleaning up her garage and she said that she found this wooden thing in the corner, would I know what it was and would I be interested in it?</span> <span id="s1120">And she expl -- she described it and I said, oh my God, Pat, I said that’s the menorah.</span> <span id="s1121">And I said, don’t -- don’t get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1122">I said, would you consider giving it to the museum?</span> <span id="s1123">And she said, well, she said, I don’t see why not.</span> <span id="s1124">She says, I’ll ask my two children.</span> <span id="s1125">One of them is in Edinburgh just now, one of them was with her.</span> <span id="s1126">So she asked her two children, Mandy and David and they said -- they didn’t know much about the museum, but they s -- and I said, you know what, I’m going to send you some information.</span> <span id="s1127">So I sent them all the pamphlets, all the documents I had.</span> <span id="s1128">And she said, yes, of course we’ll give it to the museum.</span> <span id="s1129">And she said, if it’s all right with you, I’ll donate it with David and Mandy’s names.</span> <span id="s1130">So the U.S. -- the museum’s -- a conservatory group came out to her very early one morning, they packed it up, they brought it back here and it is now in the museum.</span> <span id="s1131">And -- and it really does my heart good to know that it’s there and that something that was given to my parents will always be there for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1133">W-When did your mother pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: My mother passed away in April sum -- 1951, six weeks after I arrived in this country.</span> <span id="s1135">She had a stroke and died the same day.</span> <span id="s1136">And I -- broke my heart and -- and -- and we had just come over here and I was arranging to take my son, Lawrence, who was two years old back there.</span> <span id="s1137">And -- and then -- and we went through all of the things about getting permits and things and then I suddenly realized, they can’t hold a funeral, she’s already gone, what’s the point of going back?</span> <span id="s1138">So I didn’t go back for over 20 years.</span> <span id="s1139">But she was a lovely person, and as I say, she -- she was so upset when we left, and you know, perhaps it was best that it happened that way because had she lived she would have been -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: You had mentioned a little bit before about your feelings about Germany.</span> <span id="s1141">I w-wanted to know what your feelings about being Jewish were.</span> <span id="s1142">I mean, here you all helped to take care of these children.</span> <span id="s1143">Do you think -- during the war years -- do you think that m-made an impression on your Jewishness?</span> <span id="s1144">Did it make you feel more Jewish or did it not have any effect on that aspect of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Oh, I think it definitely made me more aware of who I was an-and -- and -- and of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1146">We ourselves didn’t encounter any -- any animosity or any anti-Semitism, but coming over here I realized that there were -- that there was more anti-Semitism over in Great Britain than I’d realized, and that people were not so -- so willing to wear a Mogen David, or wear some -- something to show that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1147">And I found it -- it’s a much more open society here when I came over here.</span> <span id="s1148">So while we had -- we had absolutely no -- no sort of contact with anything that made us feel that w-we were unwelcome or anything, I know that there was that there.</span> <span id="s1149">And we were very, very -- I mean, we were very, very proud of being Jewish, and as I say, we were the only Jewish children, the five of us, in our school, and -- and we felt kind of important because of it.</span> <span id="s1150">You know, I mean, there was -- there was no feeling of bias or anything else.</span> <span id="s1151">But it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: What forms did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Oh, I -- I think it -- it was -- it was covert.</span> <span id="s1154">I think that the kind of people that my parents were also, I think people would hesitate to -- to do anything to them because they were such kind people and they were always helping other people.</span> <span id="s1155">I mean, I talk about refugees -- the refugees, I talk about the Kindertransport, I talk about Whittingehame, but there were so many other people that they helped in every way they could, I mean, they were just kind, kind people that -- that just were always out for other people.</span> <span id="s1156">And I think that being a sort of a fairly small town, in a way, that people were aware of it.</span> <span id="s1157">Edinburgh is a much bigger and more of a cosmopolitan town than it is -- than it was when I lived there.</span> <span id="s1158">There was no trans-Atlantic flights, there were no tourists there.</span> <span id="s1159">It was a very, very quiet city.</span> <span id="s1160">It was all -- it was almost a sleepy city, not like it is now.</span> <span id="s1161">And - and my father knew the mayor, and in fact the house that we had, and actually we leased it during the war, it was bought after we left by the [indecipherable] of Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s1162">So I mean, he sort of knew people and he -- and he felt very comfortable with them, and so I don’t -- so if there was any anti-Semitism, we didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s1163">But I -- I think sometimes that while it’s not always the case, that it’s the kind of person you are also.</span> <span id="s1164">That may be wrong, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Have you shared this story about what your parents did during the war, with other people?</span> <span id="s1166">Do you -- does it something that comes easily to you and that you share with a lot of other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yes, I do, particularly now.</span> <span id="s1168">Particularly now as I’m getting older and -- and that the survivors don’t have that much longer, obviously.</span> <span id="s1169">But I am so, so anxious that people do hear about my parents, do know that they did something good, and -- and -- and helped other people that I do go out of my way, I go out of my way that you -- in ways that I would not have thought years ago.</span> <span id="s1170">I am a member of -- of a club on the internet, a lovely club, I’ve been a member now for about five, six years, and it started off as a book club and I’m the only Jewish person and I bring out all the time about being Jewish, about the Jewish holidays, and in particular about this -- about Whittingehame, about the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s1171">They are now so interested in it.</span> <span id="s1172">And they will -- they will tell their children and they will tell their friends and this is how I feel that people get to know.</span> <span id="s1173">I mean, I -- it’s not myself I want to talk about, it’s the fact that I had so -- such wonderful -- such a wonderful example, you know, and -- my own children.</span> <span id="s1174">It’s funny because my oldest son always used to say to me -- he resented the fact that we came over here and that he’s got no family over here, because he knew that my mother was one of eight children, and that we had a very, very big family group in Edinburgh.</span> <span id="s1175">And I said, but this is what happens.</span> <span id="s1176">And I said, after the war, everybody kind of separated anyway.</span> <span id="s1177">But he said to me, what was it like for you growing up?</span> <span id="s1178">And I sat down and wrote him 10 pages.</span> <span id="s1179">And he said to me, it’s like a fairy tale.</span> <span id="s1180">And I said, this is how it was, it was a different world.</span> <span id="s1181">And I want -- and I wanted to sh -- and -- and my -- and I said to him do me a favor and copy to send it to your other brothers.</span> <span id="s1182">I want them to know and I want them to tell their children.</span> <span id="s1183">And ma -- basically about being Jewish and living in a Jewish household, and -- and -- and being members of an -- of a community, about sort of going to the shul, going to services every Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s1184">[indecipherable] Shabbat afterwards and just -- it’s not what they do, but I want them to know about it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Have you stayed as observant when you came to the United States and now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: No, we haven’t.</span> <span id="s1187">We -- we are now members of Reform, a-and that’s fine, I mean, my husband Jerry was never as observant and we just sa -- sort of gradually sort of grew away from it.</span> <span id="s1188">And that was fine, you know, but it’s there in me, you know?</span> <span id="s1189">I mean, wa -- wonderful memories of the sheer ec -- the excitement about changing the dishes at -- at Pesach, and ho -- and what fun it was to eat out of different dishes, you know, this sort of thing and -- and it’s always -- my mother used to buy great big cases of matzoh and she used to give a packet to each of her Christian friends.</span> <span id="s1190">She always did that.</span> <span id="s1191">And I do it now.</span> <span id="s1192">I’m a volunteer at Inova Fairfax Hospital.</span> <span id="s1193">Made very good friends there and at Pesach [indecipherable] several friends, I’ve taken matzoh into them.</span> <span id="s1194">You know?</span> <span id="s1195">And it’s good.</span> <span id="s1196">I think it’s good.</span> <span id="s1197">I hope it’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Were you able to get matzoh during the war and did you bring it to Whittingehame?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: We obviously got -- [phone ringing] -- Colin’s got a phone down there -- we obviously got matzoh during the war, and actually yes, we got it in Whittingehame.</span> <span id="s1200">In fact, in one of the photographs that I have and the -- and the museum have, there is pile -- the -- there’s a whole pile of boxes of matzoh for them.</span> <span id="s1201">So in some way they got it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1202">[phone answering machine] Sorry, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1203">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1206">We had hoped to go at one time, but raising four young boys, this was never possible, so unfortunately no, we didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1208">When events like the Eichmann trial came, did that stir up more memories of the war time in -- in Scotland for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Oh yes, i -- obviously it did, I mean, we followed very, very closely and couldn’t understand how people could be so evil.</span> <span id="s1210">I -- I saw quite recently -- I’m not sure if you’ve seen this movie, “A Judgment at Nuremberg”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: But it was shown again and I’ve -- I put it on tape because just -- I mean, it’s fiction, but even -- even watching this brings back that whole era so vividly.</span> <span id="s1213">And -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: And again, your thoughts about Germany you said have changed over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yes, they have changed and this is a funny thing is that my husband ha-had never been terribly involved with things that I’ve been interested in, as in going to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1216">I mean, he supported me, but this was my thing.</span> <span id="s1217">But -- and his parents did take a refu -- one of the 35 children and I hate to say this, but I th -- I have a feeling that my mother-in-law treated this little girl more of a domestic.</span> <span id="s1218">But anyway, the thing was this, that we went to -- we went to Europe in the 1980’s, and we went through France, and Belgium and -- and the Netherlands and got to Luxembourg, and then we drove to the German border.</span> <span id="s1219">And it’s a beautiful area, a-and we could see -- and we could see a castle in the distance, and I said, let’s go over.</span> <span id="s1220">He said, I can’t.</span> <span id="s1221">And I said, come on Jerry, it’s just another border, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1222">He said, I’m sorry Hilda, I just can’t.</span> <span id="s1223">A-And he wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1224">So I mean, he had much deeper feelings than he’d ever, ever, you know.</span> <span id="s1225">But yes, my feelings about sort of, Germany, have changed.</span> <span id="s1226">I don’t know -- I have mixed feelings about it because in one of Leon Yuris’s books, he tries to explain this make-up of a German, the physiology and all [indecipherable] and I believed him -- him completely, but as I say, I’ve been in contact with couple of people recently, and one in particular, and they are lovely people.</span> <span id="s1227">And I feel that you can’t label everybody the way I once did.</span> <span id="s1228">And I have a friend whose mother was German and she’s no longer alive.</span> <span id="s1229">Every time I saw her, she’d be apologizing.</span> <span id="s1230">And I -- and she I think lived in somewhere like Essen or something that was terribly badly bombed and they went out sort of looking for pot -- sort of scraping for potatoes, they were so hungry.</span> <span id="s1231">She was telling me all this [indecipherable] she says, you know?</span> <span id="s1232">And I say, look, you can’t go back and -- and -- everybody had problems.</span> <span id="s1233">But I think it made me realize that -- I mean I-- myself, I could never understand -- I could never understand how the German people could not see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1234">How they couldn't see that the -- their neighbors were all disappearing.</span> <span id="s1235">I mean, this could never be explained to me.</span> <span id="s1236">But it’s a new generation and I think that the German schools, that they’re bending over backwards to teach the children.</span> <span id="s1237">And I -- they say at one time the Japanese were taking this whole thing out of their -- out of the history books, it just didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1238">But the Germans are bending over backwards to make sure that they understand what -- what went on.</span> <span id="s1239">And of course they still have their -- their anti-Semites, and th -- and their -- their Nazis with their -- with their armbands on, but listen, we all have them.</span> <span id="s1240">I mean, look what’s happening here.</span> <span id="s1241">So I think that hopefully -- hopefully this will never happen again and I feel that this new German generation is different.</span> <span id="s1242">I can only hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Do you feel it could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: In this country?</span> <span id="s1245">No I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1246">But as I read the paper every morning, and I got to the point of saying, I hon -- honestly hesitate to read the paper in the morning.</span> <span id="s1247">I -- I really despair of what’s going on throughout the world.</span> <span id="s1248">I think that -- that the lesson has not been learned, with the brutality that -- that we see everywhere, in Darfur, the Congo, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1249">I mean, it’s just incredible what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1250">So whether it could happen again, not in this country, but I honestly don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Do you have friends who are survivors?</span> <span id="s1252">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1253">No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Do you -- do you speak to any of the survivors who work at the museum?</span> <span id="s1255">Have you had contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: No.</span> <span id="s1257">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1258">As I say, I don’t speak to anybody at the museum except the people that I work with.</span> <span id="s1259">I never have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1261">Did -- do you -- how often did you talk about th -- what your parents did, how often did you talk about that with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Not very often.</span> <span id="s1263">I think that when you have -- when you have girls, girls want to know how you’ve -- growing up.</span> <span id="s1264">So girls want to know about your past [indecipherable] boys don’t.</span> <span id="s1265">I me -- I found this out, you know, they’re busy doing their own thing, everything else.</span> <span id="s1266">And that’s why, when my son asked me, and I realized, I sat down and wrote.</span> <span id="s1267">I’ve written, I think, two things for them.</span> <span id="s1268">One of them, what it was like so -- during the war, during the six years for me, and they each have it and I’ve -- I have another one about sort of growing up, what it was like with this bigger -- this large family that we had.</span> <span id="s1269">Cause my -- my parents’ house, it was always an open house, and it -- at the weekends nobody was invited, but everybody dropped in.</span> <span id="s1270">This is something I’ve never been able to understand in this country why friendships are almost nonexistent here whereas, you think, oh well I’ll -- I’ll go visit somebody some evening and you’ll -- and you’ll drop in, it’ll be great, I’ll put the coffeepot on, I’ll put out a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s1271">You don’t do that here.</span> <span id="s1272">I’ve been in -- in this country over 50 years and I’ve never seen the friendship that I see -- that I used to see in Scotland.</span> <span id="s1273">I went back there about 10 years ago to my cousin’s farm, and I could see it there.</span> <span id="s1274">I could see that it hasn’t changed.</span> <span id="s1275">But here is different.</span> <span id="s1276">So I mean it -- it’s just different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1278">When you were growing up, would you’ve -- you’d de -- identif -- would you have identified yourself as Scottish or Jewish or both, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Definitely both, definitely both.</span> <span id="s1280">I mean, I wouldn’t say I was Jewish first, I wouldn’t say I was Scottish first, I say I was -- I was a Scottish Jew, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Well, is there anything else --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: -- that we can talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: I’m trying to think of what else that you may --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: I think that’s -- that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1287">I think -- I think that’s about my whole life’s story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Well, it’s important that you got your parent’s stories and what a wonderful -- acts that they did during the war.</span> <span id="s1289">That’s very important that that’s now going to be in the archives so people will know about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: I am -- I am so grateful and so thrilled that this is going to be, and my one regret always has been that they both died so early, they both died when they were 59, and I think so often of what else could they have done, had they lived to be as old as I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1292">Well, you’ve given them a great gift by putting this down for posterity.</span> <span id="s1293">So thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s1294">This concludes the interview of Hilda Seftor.</span></p>
