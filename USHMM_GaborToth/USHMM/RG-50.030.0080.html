You know, people laugh when I say "a city"; but Siauliai was the second largest city in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s48">It was Vilnius that was taken over--Vilna--by the Poles.</span> <span id="s49">But in that time, Kaunas was a larger city, was the capital of Lithuania; the next one was Siauliai--or as we Jewish people called it, Shavli.</span> <span id="s50">And in Hebrew, we referred to it as Shavli.</span> <span id="s51">We had a gymnasium, which was called Gymnasium Bialik.</span> <span id="s52">It was a (unclear word) type of school, what as you started through kindergarten through high school.</span> <span id="s53">There was a Beth Sefer Chevra for people who could not afford as much.</span> <span id="s54">There was a Yavner for very religious people who were ultra-orthodox.</span> <span id="s55">Even in Lithuania, although everybody was orthodox, we did not have a conservative or reform.</span> <span id="s56">We just had orthodox synagogue; but we were Misnagdim, not Hasidim.</span> <span id="s57">What it means is, our people did not believe in the Rebbe, did not wear curlicues and the black clothing and the fur hat.</span> <span id="s58">Our family looked pretty much like an American family.</span> <span id="s59">My father did not cover his head just to go to shul or to make a prayer.</span> <span id="s60">So we had the religious school Yavner, we had a Fortshuler (ph) for people that were Yiddishkeit--you know, Bundistin [NB: socialists] that didn't believe in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s61">Then we had many cheders where people just sent their children.</span> <span id="s62">They went to regular school, to Lithuanian school; and then they went to learn customs and prayers in a cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So you grew up this way.</span> <span id="s64">Tell us in growing up what happened then, what happened, how old were you when the Germans came and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Also, I would like to remark [that] for a small--at this time--city which is not so big, we had quite a few synagogues.</span> <span id="s66">We had all the time Yiddish Theater come; we had a Jewish paper, newspaper; we had Maccabee, which was a sport organization.</span> <span id="s67">We have every type of Zionist organization from the right to the left existing in a small city.</span> <span id="s68">When I grew up, as I said, I went to the gymnasium; I happened to go to the Gymnasia Bialik from kindergarten to the age of 12.</span> <span id="s69">At the age of 12, in 1940... You know, many people skipped that year.</span> <span id="s70">Even when I go out to speak to a school and I'm giving just a half hour, I cannot go into detail about history.</span> <span id="s71">But in 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s72">And that's when we were not allowed to study Hebrew anymore.</span> <span id="s73">All the schools had to study Yiddish.</span> <span id="s74">At that point, the very wealthy of the community--the Burjui, as they called them--were deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s75">But ironically, these people lived through cold and hunger but nobody killed them.</span> <span id="s76">They survived, and many of them came now to Israel.</span> <span id="s77">My family, as I told you before, were Balabatish--which is comfortable, but not very rich.</span> <span id="s78">So we were allowed to stay.</span> <span id="s79">And in our business, the Communists put in like an overseer; but my parents were still running the business.</span> <span id="s80">Now, 1941, we heard before that in Poland already things are being bad for the Jews--Jews are made to leave their homes and go away.</span> <span id="s81">I, as a child at the age of 12, had firsthand information about it; because in my home came what we called Platim--runaways-- people that escaped from Poland.</span> <span id="s82">My mother's first cousin, her name was Regina Vlafsia (ph); I can't recall her husband's first name--they were children of a family by the name of Fabilisski.</span> <span id="s83">They were manufacturers for cloth in the city of _ód_, Poland.</span> <span id="s84">They had a lot of money, and somehow they bought their way out to come to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s85">And they came to our home; and they told us that they were all made to leave their homes and relocate their particular family to warsaw.</span> <span id="s86">This young couple did not know exactly what happened during that time, but we had gotten in Lithuania--my aunt also in the United States--some letters from Warsaw, assuming they were from Warsaw ghetto, from this great uncle of my aunt.</span> <span id="s87">So we knew what was happening in Poland.</span> <span id="s88">But you don't think it will happen to you.</span> <span id="s89">I'm telling you the truth.</span> <span id="s90">You know, I make a smile with it, and I'm saying it because people don't realize that it can happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s91">If we don't learn from this part of history how it happened, it can happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s92">We lived so nice in Lithuania--Jewish people, non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s93">The children played together, our parents did business together.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't think that our own neighbors are not going to stand by us and help us at the time of need.</span> <span id="s95">In 1941, the Germans occupied Lithuania in three days.</span> <span id="s96">You will see documentation shows it.</span> <span id="s97">I was 13 years old--a little girl--but I remember it.</span> <span id="s98">I remember it well.</span> <span id="s99">My city, they marched through in one night.</span> <span id="s100">Siauliai is a city that stands from the main road of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s101">In every war, the armies had to pass through it; because the main road from Germany to Russia had to pass this road.</span> <span id="s102">So that's why we saw the war going through.</span> <span id="s103">But we were not affected by this military occupation.</span> <span id="s104">The military went through that night; no bombs fell, no people were killed.</span> <span id="s105">They went on farther to fight the war.</span> <span id="s106">But they left behind the (unclear word) the Gestapo, the Nazi party, the special unit that were called...I don't even know exactly.</span> <span id="s107">Einsatzgruppen, or whatever they were called at the time--to take care of the Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s108">And their aim right away started like in any other place with different laws for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s109">Jewish people are not allowed to have businesses.</span> <span id="s110">Jewish children cannot go to school.</span> <span id="s111">Jewish people are not allowed to go to buy food in the grocery store but at certain hours.</span> <span id="s112">By the time we got to that store to get the food, there was no food there.</span> <span id="s113">You know, they didn't have freezers or refrigerators like here.</span> <span id="s114">Small store.</span> <span id="s115">Every day the farmer brought the food.</span> <span id="s116">So right away, we suffered hunger already, too.</span> <span id="s117">The law came out [that] Jewish women were not allowed to be pregnant, they had to have abortions.</span> <span id="s118">No future for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s119">Every Jew had to wear a Star of David in front and in back of the garment.</span> <span id="s120">Many people say to me, "Why did you have to wear it?"</span> <span id="s121">Two reasons.</span> <span id="s122">One, a symbol of shame.</span> <span id="s123">But the most important: why did they want us to wear it?</span> <span id="s124">An ID.</span> <span id="s125">They wanted to make sure they know exactly where the Jew is.</span> <span id="s126">The punishment for not wearing this... Specific[ally], we called it the "yellow letter."</span> <span id="s127">We didn't even call it a star.</span> <span id="s128">It was a Star of David; but the "patch of yellow," that's what we called it in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s129">We didn't say Magen David, or yellow Magen David.</span> <span id="s130">The "yellow letter," we called it.</span> <span id="s131">It was a "yellow letter," we called it; it was a patch that was the ID.</span> <span id="s132">If you didn't wear it, the punishment was death.</span> <span id="s133">Now, you think about it.</span> <span id="s134">Children many times say, "Why did you have to put it on?</span> <span id="s135">You could go around the city; they would think you are Christian."</span> <span id="s136">But unfortunately, not too many friends around us.</span> <span id="s137">The same people that were our neighbors deceived us, reported on us, showed where a Jew was.</span> <span id="s138">If you didn't put on, they would say, "This is a Jew."</span> <span id="s139">They killed you for not wearing that patch, that star.</span> <span id="s140">The next process was, they started to grab Jewish men off the homes, out of the homes, out of the streets.</span> <span id="s141">Allegedly, they have to clean the city of war damage.</span> <span id="s142">The Rabbis, the scholars--a thousand men were put into the city jails.</span> <span id="s143">We had two jails; a white jail and a red jail.</span> <span id="s144">That's how it was called.</span> <span id="s145">The red Deturmen and the white Deturmen.</span> <span id="s146">Because one was painted white, the other was red bricks.</span> <span id="s147">They put them into those jails, the most terrible Lithuanian sadists taking care of them.</span> <span id="s148">Who were they?</span> <span id="s149">The same policemen of the home town that walked around.</span> <span id="s150">We didn't have even traffic.</span> <span id="s151">They just walked around to make sure everything is in order.</span> <span id="s152">They joined the evil cause.</span> <span id="s153">They put on arm bands, they helped to get rid of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s154">They had 1,000 men in that jail, with promises they are going to take them to labor.</span> <span id="s155">And we believed it.</span> <span id="s156">You don't think you don't believe it.</span> <span id="s157">You believe it.</span> <span id="s158">Well, some people ran and they tried to get people out of that jail.</span> <span id="s159">But nobody succeeded.</span> <span id="s160">These thousand men were taken out to a forest near our city by the name of Kuzhi, where they were made to dig their own graves, they were made to get undressed naked, they were shot and they were covered with earth.</span> <span id="s161">How did we know exactly what happened there?</span> <span id="s162">The farmers in the area.</span> <span id="s163">They came back to the city and told us exactly.</span> <span id="s164">I, as a child, remember those farmers that used to bring milk to our grocery store, to our dairy store, doing like this (motioning), telling the earth shook over the so-called graves.</span> <span id="s165">Why did it shake?</span> <span id="s166">Many, many people fell into that hole and were not even shot to death.</span> <span id="s167">They covered them with earth, and they suffocated.</span> <span id="s168">There are many incidents.</span> <span id="s169">I know a young man who lives in Cleveland who ran away from a small city by the name of Aniksht.</span> <span id="s170">In this particular place, the Germans and the Lithuanians were so drunk that they didn't cover the hole that night.</span> <span id="s171">The only time when people tell you they run away from those holes was if you were injured and they didn't cover the hole that night -- they were too tired or didn't want to bother -- then they had a chance to escape.</span> <span id="s172">And also, many times, when I talk about escaping you have to understand to escape you need a place to escape to.</span> <span id="s173">Everybody wanted to escape.</span> <span id="s174">But if your neighbor doesn't let you in, or if you try to run to the forest and while you are running somebody points a finger--"Here is a Jew"--and you are killed.</span> <span id="s175">So you wonder does it pay to escape, or maybe I should wait in the community for a week, a month.</span> <span id="s176">The war will end, and I will live.</span> <span id="s177">So after we heard what happened to this thousand men, we knew the Holocaust was happening to us.</span> <span id="s178">This is when in my city our own Jewish Community Council, marvelous leaders, marvelous men.</span> <span id="s179">And as I told you before, my mother was connected.</span> <span id="s180">Because she was on this committee of helping the poor and the widows, and so she knew firsthand from the leaders what was happening.</span> <span id="s181">They decided to go to the Christian clergy to beg them to help to save our community.</span> <span id="s182">Those Priests, Roman Catholic, they were marvelous men; but when our community council came to beg them to save our people they said "We are afraid to get involved.</span> <span id="s183">We will help you.</span> <span id="s184">By helping you, they will kill us."</span> <span id="s185">Can you imagine, human beings were afraid to help other human beings?</span> <span id="s186">You know, many times we hear all these beautiful statements made by Pastor Niemöller, and other statements, how sorry they are.</span> <span id="s187">Yes, you are sorry.</span> <span id="s188">But isn't it easier to be there for other human beings when they need you, than after the fact to say you are sorry?</span> <span id="s189">Now at that point -- I know if I could sit with you, Linda, and talk with you for weeks of what went through in this short period of time.</span> <span id="s190">Because they said they are going to transfer all the Jews of our city to a little city by the name of Jagga (ph), Jagerod (ph).</span> <span id="s191">They said, you know, there we will be able to stay and we will be able to live there.</span> <span id="s192">But our Council felt if they are going to move us from our home town...we are not going to move us from our home town, we are not going to be in such good shape.</span> <span id="s193">We will be better off if we can stay in the community.</span> <span id="s194">At that point, you know, there were different rumors.</span> <span id="s195">Some people said that our Jewish Community Council persuaded some Lithuanians to help us to convince that we could be in the city.</span> <span id="s196">I heard from my mother that she said and I saw that we gave gold and silver and diamonds to give actually to the (unclear word)_ and the Gestapo to bribe them so we could stay in the community, they wouldn't take us away right away.</span> <span id="s197">We will make shoes and boots for the army.</span> <span id="s198">We had many shoe and leather factories, Siauliai was famous for it.</span> <span id="s199">People that know about that area, Lithuanian was famous about beef and cattle, so we had a lot of leather.</span> <span id="s200">So I don't know exactly what was the persuasion, the good people that intervened with the money, maybe everything together, that they decided yes, they are not going to take us to Jagga, Jaggerod (ph), they are going to let us stay in the city but not in our homes.</span> <span id="s201">A ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s202">At the beginning was formed two ghettos.</span> <span id="s203">Many times when I go out to talk I don't go into detail because a half hour, today we have time.</span> <span id="s204">There was two ghettos, one ghetto on one side was across from the factory of Frenklfabrik, a leather factory, was called the Kaukazas ghetto.</span> <span id="s205">Then, on the other side near the red jail, was the Trakai ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">There was two ghettos in our city--four square blocks each, or five; small area--and that's where the Jews were supposed to relocate.</span> <span id="s207">Now, you couldn't take your bundles and move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s208">It was a special commission that came to every home.</span> <span id="s209">The commission consisted of Germans and Lithuanians, because the Lithuanians showed them where is the Jewish home and the little secretaries.</span> <span id="s210">Now, I will share with you what happened in my house--firsthand information.</span> <span id="s211">My two brothers--one older five years than me, one seven years older than me--so one was 18, one was 20.</span> <span id="s212">I was 13.</span> <span id="s213">And my parents, my mother was at that point 43 and my father was maybe 45...yes, 45.</span> <span id="s214">And they came with commission, they looked around our apartment; and they told my parents how many beds, how many pillows, how many clothing we can take to the ghetto, and how many people.</span> <span id="s215">They issued four certificates.</span> <span id="s216">The ghetto was originally for people to work--not for children, not for sick, not for elderly.</span> <span id="s217">I was 13.</span> <span id="s218">They didn't need me.</span> <span id="s219">I remember it very well, how I felt when I saw I was going to be separated from my family at that point.</span> <span id="s220">My mother succeeded to bribe the Lithuanian Secretary.</span> <span id="s221">How did it happen?</span> <span id="s222">As a child, I had a ceramic cat where I used to save my money that I got for Chanukah, for my birthday--silver money.</span> <span id="s223">And my mother said to the secretary, quietly, "This is full of silver money.</span> <span id="s224">If you will ask for it and I will have to give it to you, please leave a blank certificate--the fifth one--on the table."</span> <span id="s225">And as they were walking out, this commission...the Secretary said, "I want this little cat."</span> <span id="s226">My mother said, "That's my little girl's.</span> <span id="s227">She loves it."</span> <span id="s228">The German said "Give it to her."</span> <span id="s229">You understand, how she could bribe -- it's important to know this little fact -- and he walked out with a lot of money.</span> <span id="s230">But I remember my mother counting those certificates.</span> <span id="s231">Four were there with names filled in; a fifth blank certificate.</span> <span id="s232">My parents filled it in.</span> <span id="s233">Now, to go into the ghetto you just had to show the certificate.</span> <span id="s234">If you had the certificate, they let you in through the gate.</span> <span id="s235">So about 5,000 people got into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s236">We had 10,000 Jewish people in the two ghettos.</span> <span id="s237">The people that did not get this yellow certificate, I believe it's about 3,500.</span> <span id="s238">The orphanage, the elderly, the sick, the children from many families, and many, many people that came to their home last and there was no more room in the ghetto--they were put into the city synagogues, in the shulen, as we called it, within the shul.</span> <span id="s239">With hunger, no water; they were begging for food, they were begging for them to be saved.</span> <span id="s240">People were trying -- our Jewish Community Council, who were wonderful people, they tried so hard to save.</span> <span id="s241">They were saying already, "Okay, take them to this little city of Jagga."</span> <span id="s242">They thought at least they will live; because we had already the 1,000 men experience.</span> <span id="s243">These people were killed just like the thousand men in another forest, 3,500 of them.</span> <span id="s244">So by the time the ghetto was formed, I don't know exactly whether it was August or September, I don't remember; but I know [by the] High Holidays, we were already--my family--in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s245">Half of our population was killed.</span> <span id="s246">So, that's how the ghetto was formed in our city.</span> <span id="s247">You know, feel free to interject or whatever.</span> <span id="s248">Now, in the ghetto... I will tell you how it was when I was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s249">All the working people went to work in the morning.</span> <span id="s250">Girls like me--at the age of 13, you see, I had a certificate to go in.</span> <span id="s251">But I wasn't on the master list, you understand?</span> <span id="s252">The same way, I was smuggled in.</span> <span id="s253">People succeeded to smuggle in some sick, some elderly, some children even younger than me.</span> <span id="s254">But you were not on the master list, master list or whatever, you didn't get food.</span> <span id="s255">You didn't get the rations.</span> <span id="s256">So your family shared with you.</span> <span id="s257">Let's say we got X amount of bread, or...I don't remember how much it was at that time.</span> <span id="s258">Five people ate of the ration of four; and some people, four people ate of the ration of two.</span> <span id="s259">So this is... People have to understand that even as little as the ration was, if you were lucky enough to have your child or your elderly with you at that point, they didn't get food.</span> <span id="s260">Your ration of food became smaller.</span> <span id="s261">In the ghetto, girls like me had to take care of little children.</span> <span id="s262">Many families right away tried to make some little hiding place, whether it was a cellar, under the bed or in a wall; because we saw that things look bad.</span> <span id="s263">In the ghetto, selection upon selection, they came for no reason whatever to take people because they heard the rumor there are children in the ghetto, there are sick in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">How did they get in?</span> <span id="s265">We don't want to feed them.</span> <span id="s266">So they came to take them away.</span> <span id="s267">I lived through two years in the ghetto like this.</span> <span id="s268">I don't know how I survived.</span> <span id="s269">How I have hidden.</span> <span id="s270">One time I remember -- the Jewish police in my city were wonderful, they ran through and warned us that the SS is coming to take people so quickly hide, do whatever.</span> <span id="s271">So I was supposed to get out my door and go into the little shed where you keep wood, that's where my hiding place was.</span> <span id="s272">As I was pulling the door to open up I felt pressure on the door from the other side and I remember not breathing but I could hear my heart pound and the German opened the door, the SS man, and he looked in and he said to his friend or whatever, his associate, "This room is empty."</span> <span id="s273">And he closed the door behind him.</span> <span id="s274">I tell you many incidents like this that I was saved at that time, really by the grace of God.</span> <span id="s275">Two years like this.</span> <span id="s276">When I was 15, I was allowed to go to work.</span> <span id="s277">Now, there were many ways of people being put on a list.</span> <span id="s278">Let's say they took a selection of people, they took -- sometime they didn't even know how many they took -- they took 120, and the list was 100.</span> <span id="s279">20 people, kids that got a little older or the sick that got a little healthier could go out to work instead.</span> <span id="s280">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work instead.</span> <span id="s281">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work.</span> <span id="s282">At that time, in 1943, they did not need two ghettos.</span> <span id="s283">We were living already spacey so many people were killed.</span> <span id="s284">They combined both ghettos together, just the one on Trakai.</span> <span id="s285">The Kaukazas ghetto was closed completely.</span> <span id="s286">We were transferred to the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s287">A little bit people, there were too many of them, they took out some men and women.</span> <span id="s288">And we thought they were going to kill them.</span> <span id="s289">But no, they took them to a small place--I really don't remember the name--to work, to make turf.</span> <span id="s290">I don't know what turf is.</span> <span id="s291">It is a material that comes from the earth, and you press it for burn purposes, for heating purposes.</span> <span id="s292">I don't really know what you call that composite of earth and weeds.</span> <span id="s293">We used it a lot for heating purposes.</span> <span id="s294">So they took them there.</span> <span id="s295">We came in 1943 into the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s296">We were nine people in one room: two uncles and aunts and our family [of] five.</span> <span id="s297">We were still together, that many of the family.</span> <span id="s298">And I recall that time, many times to my friends, I would say, "I remember it as a better time."</span> <span id="s299">And they say, "Why was it a better time?"</span> <span id="s300">And I said, "I still was surrounded with my family, which was pretty lot.</span> <span id="s301">Many uncles, many aunts, many cousins, grandparents, were dead at that time--that lived in villages around our area, and in the city of Vilna.</span> <span id="s302">But my immediate family was still there."</span> <span id="s303">I tell you, really, I'm sitting here and trying to think of certain things to share with you.</span> <span id="s304">I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s305">A man was hung because he was caught at the gate with some bread and a few eggs.</span> <span id="s306">Somebody said he had a few cigarettes on him, somebody said he didn't.</span> <span id="s307">But documented incident, because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people, too.</span> <span id="s308">I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the ghetto for your family.</span> <span id="s309">But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food.</span> <span id="s310">Many guards were bribed.</span> <span id="s311">Many, many guards, you know especially Lithuanian guards, you would bribe them with a fur coat or whatever so if nobody was around they looked the other way and let you bring in that food, so we had a little more food to eat.</span> <span id="s312">But if let's say German Commission or another guard came that wasn't bribed, they came quickly and they grabbed the people, they beat them terrible.</span> <span id="s313">But that one incident this man's name was Mussevitsky, Batsalom Mussevitsky, he was a young man, he had a wife and a child in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s314">He was caught with that few eggs or half a loaf of bread but very little, maybe he had a few cigarettes, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s315">He was taken to the Gestapo jail.</span> <span id="s316">The Jewish Community Council was called and they were told they are holding a big criminal, the Jews have to learn a lesson, no food is in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s317">The following Sunday a gallow was to be built in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s318">What was a gallow in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s319">A table, some stick hammered to the table going this way like an L, upside-down L, a cord hanging there.</span> <span id="s320">Two men sitting there, they were supposed to be the henchmen, Jewish men.</span> <span id="s321">How they were picked, I don't know.</span> <span id="s322">They ordered that we have to provide these henchmen.</span> <span id="s323">We all had to gather in this place and I remember very well a dozen SS men with guns outstretched like this went in with this one criminal that wanted to bring a little food for his child, you know.</span> <span id="s324">People say why didn't he run away, many times people say why didn't he run away.</span> <span id="s325">I said three hijackers hijack a plane or a boat with hundreds of people, three guns against hundreds of people and they are in control.</span> <span id="s326">Imagine dozens of guns in control of one prisoner.</span> <span id="s327">Well, this man was marched in like this.</span> <span id="s328">He walked over to the table.</span> <span id="s329">He said to the two men "Thou shalt not kill," you know in Yiddish, "I will do it myself."</span> <span id="s330">He hopped on the table, on the chair, they did not even have a chance like you know in some places they tie their hands back or they put a cover on their face.</span> <span id="s331">Nothing.</span> <span id="s332">He hopped, he put a string of his own, the loop you know over his, the noose, whatever it's called, over his neck, and to the assassin, the Gestapo, he said you are not going to win a war by killing me" and somebody pushed or he pushed a chair from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this.</span> <span id="s333">I remember it so.</span> <span id="s334">Linda, it was terrible times.</span> <span id="s335">You know, I always try to control myself, not to be too emotional because otherwise if I get too emotional, I cannot bring the message.</span> <span id="s336">You know, you know, this what people have to think about.</span> <span id="s337">I say over, I say this man resisted the Germans, I always say there is a spiritual resistance.</span> <span id="s338">If you didn't fight back, if you didn't punch it or whatever, I say we live the extra day we resisted them.</span> <span id="s339">They wanted us dead.</span> <span id="s340">In the ghettos there was sign, "Yiden"--Jews--"Don't despair.</span> <span id="s341">Live an extra day.</span> <span id="s342">We will overcome it."</span> <span id="s343">The hope we gave each other all through, that's all I remember as a child saying (unclear phrase), in spite of the enemy, we will overcome it, we will live, we will be free.</span> <span id="s344">So you can imagine this punishment.</span> <span id="s345">Now go back to 1943 where I was before.</span> <span id="s346">When we got into that ghetto when they condensed the ghettos, we got a little more food.</span> <span id="s347">Things looked kind of better.</span> <span id="s348">Everybody thought, said gee, they start to treat us a little better.</span> <span id="s349">I was working at that time in the war hospital.</span> <span id="s350">My job was to put wood into stoves so the German soldiers would keep warm.</span> <span id="s351">You know we had a job, we had to do our job.</span> <span id="s352">That morning when I came to my commander to go to work -- it was exactly November 5, 1942, when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the ghetto trucks, trucks covered with canvas, we were told we cannot go to work.</span> <span id="s353">I remember running back to my room.</span> <span id="s354">My mother put two dresses on me one dress on top of another.</span> <span id="s355">You see people said maybe they don't let you take along a bundle.</span> <span id="s356">To be safe, a little bread in the pocket, a coin in the pocket, we were prepared to be deported.</span> <span id="s357">A half hour or whatever, I don't remember exactly, maybe 20 minutes, it was a short time, the Jewish police were running through the ghettos saying a mistake was made in the order, all the working people should leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s358">Chaos.</span> <span id="s359">People did not know what's better.</span> <span id="s360">Some people said it's better to hide in that Malina, in the hiding place -- Malina was called the hiding place during those times, a Malina -- some people said it's better to go to work.</span> <span id="s361">The Jewish police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that were Jewish police in my city.</span> <span id="s362">You won't hear not one had word about the leadership and the Jewish police in Šiauliai after a certain point because after a certain point them to cover other people that the Germans appointed, they brought them from the outside, it was different.</span> <span id="s363">But as long as we had our own people from our home town it was good.</span> <span id="s364">So they said it's better to go to work.</span> <span id="s365">I remember leaving that day for work but all day long we wondered.</span> <span id="s366">What were the trucks doing near the ghetto.</span> <span id="s367">At one point in that hospital we worked with a german, he was from a building commander that was called Ortek (ph) and he was a civilian and he was pretty nice man, he gave us sometime a little bread but he had nothing to do with the security or taking care of the Jews.</span> <span id="s368">His job was building whatever.</span> <span id="s369">So we asked this man to go near the ghetto and see what's happening.</span> <span id="s370">When he came back he said nothing happened but we saw he was pale, we saw he was bothered.</span> <span id="s371">But he said nothing, there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s372">That evening when we were coming back from work, blocks and blocks away from the ghetto, Linda, we heard cries, such cries I hope nobody will hear.</span> <span id="s373">What happened in the ghetto of Siauliai, Lithuania on November 5, 1943, SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians, Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people, it was terrible time -- they went into the ghetto, they found every hiding place, they went in, they broke every dish, every pillow, made every single person come to the gate near that place where you gathered for work, all the children, all the elderly, all the sick, all the babies that were born illegally in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s374">You see, they told us we were not allowed to be pregnant but women got pregnant.</span> <span id="s375">They stayed in their little room in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s376">If they were caught in the selection, then they were caught, but if they were not caught they had their baby in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s377">But on that day not one child was spared.</span> <span id="s378">At the gate a selection to the right and to the left, a thousand children.</span> <span id="s379">Five hundred elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong, including two men from our Jewish Community Council because these two men said to them "Where are you taking these children?"</span> <span id="s380">They said "To a better camp, you are welcome to come and check it out" and they put them on the trucks too.</span> <span id="s381">We did not know then where they were taken to.</span> <span id="s382">We honestly believed that they were taken to another camp where they have children.</span> <span id="s383">They said these children need supervision, you all go to work, we will take care of them.</span> <span id="s384">After the war we found out they were taken to Auschwitz where they were gassed and cremated, they did not even keep them there one day.</span> <span id="s385">The Rabbis told me that I have to keep Yarzeit on that day that my father was taken.</span> <span id="s386">My father was taken with that truck.</span> <span id="s387">My father was 47 years old.</span> <span id="s388">He was among the nice Healthy, strong, tall people.</span> <span id="s389">Can you imagine how I feel even sharing with you?</span> <span id="s390">You know, Linda, I am talking about Siauliai, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s391">I am giving you just my own but by now, 1989, we know what happened all over Europe.</span> <span id="s392">The life in the ghetto after the children selection was terrible.</span> <span id="s393">No laughter, no crying.</span> <span id="s394">My mother used to say to me, "Nessele, don't go outside after you come from work.</span> <span id="s395">The neighbor lost a child one year younger than you.</span> <span id="s396">She will hurt."</span> <span id="s397">Can you imagine -- you know European people had a lot of children -- can you imagine in one day from a mother six children, eight children, you came home.</span> <span id="s398">We were a lucky family, just my father was taken.</span> <span id="s399">Can you me saying a lucky family after they killed my father but we were a lucky family because on that day every family lost dear ones.</span> <span id="s400">Not just one, two, four, six, eight people of a family went on that terrible day.</span> <span id="s401">So the life was terrible after that, it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s402">They were trying -- I don't remember exactly details -- they were trying, I mean the Germans, the SS, the Gestapo, make some internment camps where they thought the workers could work separately.</span> <span id="s403">They thought they would get rid of the ghetto completely.</span> <span id="s404">Then they thought they still need some people that should stay.</span> <span id="s405">There was a factory that was making the shoes, a factory that was making some brushes.</span> <span id="s406">So they left some people in those workshops for a little bit longer but us in June of 1944, they took us to a railroad station for deportation to Germany.</span> <span id="s407">We had to walk about 10 kilometers to this specific railroad because in our city bombs fell already.</span> <span id="s408">The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of Siaulai.</span> <span id="s409">We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the ghetto too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening.</span> <span id="s410">So we were taken to this railroad by foot, we had to walk.</span> <span id="s411">I remember that walk very well because my mother at that time had an injury in her leg and she walked on the railroad and she had injured her knees and she couldn't walk to well and they said whoever cannot walk, whoever is sick or weak should stay and some trucks will bring them to the railroad station, and my mother, like a pool, stood in that group saying -- they couldn't see the injury, it was so tight, it was covered -- she said "I cannot walk, I would like to go on this truck" and a German said to her, "What do you think, run, you are still young, go to work," you know he saved her life because we never saw the rest of the people that were on the trucks.</span> <span id="s412">We were told after the war that they were put into the ghetto in one of the buildings and you know like in every city, they dynamited the area, dynamited them.</span> <span id="s413">Us, they put into cattle cars for a journey to concentration camp by the name of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s414">I'm going to tell you exactly about the ride.</span> <span id="s415">We were in there -- they didn't count you know.</span> <span id="s416">As we came to the train, it said capacity, how many cows or horses you can have in that train, but they didn't say capacity, how many people.</span> <span id="s417">They shoved you in like pushed you and pushed you.</span> <span id="s418">They said stoop down, they didn't say stretch out, you know like this and with your knees just up and you try to take a little bit more room and people say "Let me in, if I stay outside they will shoot me."</span> <span id="s419">So people really squeezed in to let other people in.</span> <span id="s420">It was so crowded.</span> <span id="s421">I remember having my feet over my mother, my brother on top to stretch out.</span> <span id="s422">A bucket in the corner for sanitation purposes.</span> <span id="s423">We each have a little package.</span> <span id="s424">They said take along your valuables and a little food that you had still in your ghetto room and some water.</span> <span id="s425">In my ghetto we had plenty water because we were on the outskirts of the city where there were wells so we had no problem with water.</span> <span id="s426">In the ghetto, the only good part that was in our ghetto of Siaulai we could keep clean because there was plenty of water and we had enough water to drink.</span> <span id="s427">So as we went to those railroad station, you know nobody had thermoses like here, you had an open dish or some dish you used to go to the store to buy some milk in a little container that you filled with water and you took.</span> <span id="s428">Let's say you were a family -- we were, thank God, four of a family still alive, my two brothers, my mother and myself, but in that railroad was just one brother, my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s429">As we were getting on the train we saw my brother said to us, "Don't get excited, your brother is not dead, he escaped."</span> <span id="s430">He told my mother that some nice Lithuanian man that we knew said to him, "If you have opportunity somehow to escape, do so, and don't come to my house, come in the forest, there is a smokehouse and go into that smokehouse.</span> <span id="s431">Every night I will put out some food for you and you go let's say 10 feet or 15 feet and get that food but if they catch you, you snuck in, don't tell them I let you in."</span> <span id="s432">How my brother had this opportunity to escape we did not know for many years but afterwards we found our that as we were being taken from the ghetto, instead of going out to the ghetto, he went back into the factory where he worked and since it was a Saturday he crawled in one of the machinery and on Sunday when the factory was closed, that's when he got out.</span> <span id="s433">But we did not know at that point, just he told my mother.</span> <span id="s434">He didn't want even me to know or my brother to know that he has this opportunity.</span> <span id="s435">Look, in that train, in that thing we were three already of the family, we were left three, and it was just the most terrible thing that happened.</span> <span id="s436">You cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s437">Everybody is really looking out for themselves because you want to stretch your foot out, your foot falls asleep.</span> <span id="s438">You try to put it on somebody else.</span> <span id="s439">The person doesn't like it.</span> <span id="s440">You know their foot is asleep too.</span> <span id="s441">Some People were kind and said okay, put your foot and you told them put your feet.</span> <span id="s442">Some were not.</span> <span id="s443">It was a terrible journey.</span> <span id="s444">We traveled three or four days.</span> <span id="s445">The few survivors of my home town, when I see them and I ask them, "Do you remember how many days we traveled?"</span> <span id="s446">They say no, three or four days.</span> <span id="s447">And this is why many times I tell you the I say the truth.</span> <span id="s448">By the time we arrived to Stutthof, we were a mess, we were dirty, we couldn't reach that bucket to make.</span> <span id="s449">Many people had to make under and even if you could hold it until you went to the bucket, the person next to you, if they made, the train moved, it moves.</span> <span id="s450">The stench was impossible.</span> <span id="s451">Some people told me in some of those wagons people suffocated.</span> <span id="s452">I did not see so I don't share it with you.</span> <span id="s453">I remember when they opened those doors we thought it was heaven but we came to hell, we came to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s454">You know, I as a survivor feel so bad when I see books or even memorials that say Auschwitz, Dachau, Treblinka, Sobibor, where is others and others and others.</span> <span id="s455">You know the last memorial in Yom Ha'Shoah I saw Herman Taube read the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s456">Where is others and others and others?</span> <span id="s457">You know the last memorial in Yom Ha'Shoah I saw that they included Herman Taube read Kaddish, the service for the dead -- they include more and more places.</span> <span id="s458">You as a historian know, over 200 killing places.</span> <span id="s459">Stutthof, many people lost their life.</span> <span id="s460">As soon as we arrived, divided, men this way, women that way.</span> <span id="s461">Our packages, the little bundles taken away.</span> <span id="s462">I remember my mother saying to me -- I wore a watch at that time -- she said "My kind, my child, take off the watch and put it in the sand so the Germans wouldn't have it."</span> <span id="s463">The little we knew that the next day they go with a plow and they take out all the gold.</span> <span id="s464">So everybody like whispered, take off your jewelry and stick it in the sand so they wouldn't get it, you know a form of resistance, a form of fighting back.</span> <span id="s465">And then a little bit later they said you go here and you go here to me and my mother, because she was 46 and I was 16.</span> <span id="s466">She was considered old.</span> <span id="s467">I didn't see her for a long time.</span> <span id="s468">You know, she was taken to another side which I wasn't too sure whether she was taken to be killed or to another side of the camp.</span> <span id="s469">My group of women from the age of 16 to 25, we were taken into a very large room, group by group, I don't know 200 or whatever, I really don't know exactly the count.</span> <span id="s470">We were told to get completely undressed naked, the guards standing around and around.</span> <span id="s471">You know when I think of that moment I still remember how I did not know which part to hide.</span> <span id="s472">Should I cover the top, should I cover the bottom.</span> <span id="s473">(unclear word) bending over and they laughing and singing songs and making fun of us.</span> <span id="s474">We were in that room for the longest time.</span> <span id="s475">Big room.</span> <span id="s476">Still I understand we were lucky because many, many people stood outside.</span> <span id="s477">We were in a room.</span> <span id="s478">Them they said to us, "Go in there."</span> <span id="s479">It said shower room.</span> <span id="s480">Shower room.</span> <span id="s481">They gave us a piece of soap, white soap, thin soap.</span> <span id="s482">I seldom like to talk about it but today I feel I must say it.</span> <span id="s483">We went in that room, water came, we soaped ourselves, we rinsed ourselves, we walked out the door.</span> <span id="s484">After the war, documentation shows Reef (ph).</span> <span id="s485">Soap was produced in Stutthof -- I have a book at home where it gives even the formula -- and I keep on thinking was that piece of soap that I bathed with, was a drop of human fat in there.</span> <span id="s486">How do we survivors feel?</span> <span id="s487">I was lucky, I got out the other door.</span> <span id="s488">How many of our people went into those showers rooms and never walked out?</span> <span id="s489">It said bathroom, shower room.</span> <span id="s490">They were gassed.</span> <span id="s491">We went out the other door, we were told for medical examination, oral, internal, rectal examination.</span> <span id="s492">It's time for us top have a discussion but you want to ask me different things at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Nesse, you were telling us about coming out of the showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, we came out from the shower.</span> <span id="s496">Also don't forget we didn't get a towel.</span> <span id="s497">Sometimes people think you got into a shower, you got a towel.</span> <span id="s498">We were standing there and shivering and it was cold and they pushed us with the guns you know.</span> <span id="s499">It wasn't just walking slowly or whatever, you constantly had to run.</span> <span id="s500">You know they didn't say walk, you ran from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s501">Run, run, run.</span> <span id="s502">I remember the water was dripping and you walked into that other room and there were like in a gynecologist tables like this and everybody had to hop on this table.</span> <span id="s503">And can you imagine, I was 16, I never had an examination, internal examination, I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s504">So they checked you.</span> <span id="s505">I don't even think that people were doctors it looked.</span> <span id="s506">What were they looking for?</span> <span id="s507">Nazi.</span> <span id="s508">They were looking for a diamond, a piece of gold, you know.</span> <span id="s509">Some people hid it there.</span> <span id="s510">You know many people thought they will need a piece of gold, they will swallow it and a few days later they had it.</span> <span id="s511">You know many times you may wonder when somebody says I had a gold coin with me and the people don't really would like to tell you exactly how they brought it.</span> <span id="s512">But many people did it that way.</span> <span id="s513">But in Stutthof you came, they gave you this medical examination, opened your mouth, they looked in your rectum, they looked in your front to make sure you don't have -- in the mouth if you had gold caps they didn't even (unclear word).</span> <span id="s514">Some came, they took your number.</span> <span id="s515">There they had a man that pulled it out.</span> <span id="s516">You stood there, if they were in the mood, they pulled it out right there.</span> <span id="s517">A bucket full of gold caps.</span> <span id="s518">They took it from the dead, they took it from the living.</span> <span id="s519">Then you went into another like outside -- this was already almost outside like with a little cover and they threw a bundle of clothing to you.</span> <span id="s520">What was in a bundle?</span> <span id="s521">A dress, a pair of underwear, and they gave you a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s522">Another question.</span> <span id="s523">Did they say you wear size 7 or 8 or 5 or 10?</span> <span id="s524">Do you know that even in our group by some mistake we all got the shoes, our own shoes, and that was very unusual.</span> <span id="s525">Somebody made a mistake somewhere because I didn't get my shoes but you know they threw to us the shoes and all of a sudden people said "Give me, those are my shoes, give me, those are my shoes" and people started to exchange until you found your shoes.</span> <span id="s526">But let's say somebody -- I had a pair of boots and it was summer, nobody wanted those boots but I wanted them and I got them back so I was lucky I had these boots.</span> <span id="s527">So you had a dress, a pair of underpants and a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s528">Now the family is taken away.</span> <span id="s529">Me, 16 years old, standing there surrounded with some women from my home town but alone, all alone, very different than this nine people in the ghetto room surrounded with electric wires, guards going around and around, you are scared, people are whispering from one side and another what's happening there.</span> <span id="s530">The next thing what they do, they take us into a big room to register.</span> <span id="s531">You know you think they took your family, they took your clothing, one more thing, your gorgeous name.</span> <span id="s532">16 years old I was prisoner 54015 in the concentration camp of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s533">Why was I prisoner there?</span> <span id="s534">Why?</span> <span id="s535">and still I'm lucky, I bring out always I'm lucky.</span> <span id="s536">They didn't tattoo it on my arm, they gave it on a piece of shmata [Yidd: "rag"], on a piece of rag on my clothing.</span> <span id="s537">In Auschwitz, all my friends that survived, the few of them have it on their arm.</span> <span id="s538">I had in on a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s539">From there, they assigned you in barracks.</span> <span id="s540">The particular barrack I was assigned to had no bins.</span> <span id="s541">The Stutthof was being rebuilt.</span> <span id="s542">When we came, at some point they had old barracks that had bunks.</span> <span id="s543">They were doing some new barracks, a new section when I got into that side, between each camp was two rows of electric wires--not one, but two rows, like this, between the men's camp...between the new camp and the old camp.</span> <span id="s544">And from there, across these wires, I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s545">So I knew she was alive.</span> <span id="s546">That's when I found out she was still alive.</span> <span id="s547">But she was...like people that in case they don't need you no more, you are next to be killed, on that side.</span> <span id="s548">In the morning, they woke us up 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s549">They called it "appell"--roll call.</span> <span id="s550">When they said, "Roll call!"</span> <span id="s551">, you had to be outside like this (snapping fingers), and lined up in a specific row behind a specific people.</span> <span id="s552">And if you didn't know these people, too bad.</span> <span id="s553">You had to recognize them, and be there at the right place.</span> <span id="s554">Let's say, if you are in the 20th row in the middle, you had to find your row and stand there.</span> <span id="s555">Many a time I sat half of the night on the window of the barrack, when they say roll call, to jump out and be outside because they running with whips and with guns and hit us so hard, we should go out quick.</span> <span id="s556">You stood there for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s557">Why you stood there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s558">They counted and they counted and they counted.</span> <span id="s559">They wanted to make sure nobody escaped.</span> <span id="s560">You couldn't escape from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s561">You know very well very few recorded -- the only way you could escape is maybe you were sent out for a labor or you had some connection somehow, but very few.</span> <span id="s562">The only people that were missing were people that died in the barrack or somebody decided to commit suicide and jumped on the wires.</span> <span id="s563">They counted and finally maybe 6:00 o'clock they said, line up, we will give you black coffee, it was some black drink -- and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s564">The piece of bread was very tiny, I don't know, believe me you could eat it now, it's like half a sandwich, you know, just the bread.</span> <span id="s565">Then you were assigned something to do.</span> <span id="s566">In my particular area in Stutthof they said today you go clean the bathroom, tomorrow let's say you sweep the street.</span> <span id="s567">Every day if they needed 50 woman, 100 women to do certain chores, sweep the barracks.</span> <span id="s568">I will share with you one of these labors.</span> <span id="s569">One day we were taken out, about 50 women, and with about a dozen SS men with the guns outstretched and we had to walk out of the sight of the camp and there is an empty space with a pile of shoes, mountain of shoes, big shoes, little shoes, tall shoes, tall, old shoes, new shoes.</span> <span id="s570">We were told to sort them.</span> <span id="s571">This was a special command to sort shoes.</span> <span id="s572">We had to sort them, tie them in pairs, put them in bundles, ladies' shoes separate, men's shoes separate, children's shoes separate, and we were working, and on the other side was a polish prisoner of war camp and he said to us "Jewish lady, Jiduvkas (ph), you know what the shoes are?</span> <span id="s573">Those are the shoes from the people that perished, your people in this camp."</span> <span id="s574">Can you imagine you touch a shoe and somebody tells you the people were killed and you wonder is that your aunt's shoe, your cousin's shoe, your baby.</span> <span id="s575">They become people, not shoes.</span> <span id="s576">I tell you from my heart the next day when they didn't tell me to go to the shoes, I was so lucky, I was so happy to go to clean the latrines, I was happier not to have to go to that job.</span> <span id="s577">Can you imagine after our people were dead we had to sort shoes, we had to sort clothing.</span> <span id="s578">Many people had to drag bodies from one place to another all through those years, all through those years.</span> <span id="s579">In the evening they gave us some kind of a vegetable peel soup and you had to be in the barrack.</span> <span id="s580">When you were in the barrack you had an opportunity to talk to each other.</span> <span id="s581">The Germans did not go into the barracks just like this.</span> <span id="s582">The person in charge was a polish women.</span> <span id="s583">In Stutthof mostly Polish people were in charge, they were the Kapos, nobody else.</span> <span id="s584">They were prisoners or criminals or whatever, they were in charge of this section and if they came in, if they were in a good mood they didn't say nothing if you were chatting.</span> <span id="s585">But otherwise you couldn't chat, you know, you had to be very careful, and that's when you found out from other people what was going on.</span> <span id="s586">Let's say if I came back from that day from the shoe sorting, I could tell what happened.</span> <span id="s587">Many times people came back that sorted clothing in the clothing and they found little notes that people said we came from this and this country, we were here, we don't know where we are being taken.</span> <span id="s588">Many people from Stutthof were brought from Latvia, from Estonia.</span> <span id="s589">Most of the baltic countries came to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s590">So we knew indirect information.</span> <span id="s591">In the barracks on the walls or in the barracks that you went in, if there was a bunk you saw inscribed everywhere the word Gedenk (ph), remember.</span> <span id="s592">You know, I live now with the ringing in my ears of remember.</span> <span id="s593">Everybody, when we sat down the only discussion was if ever somebody survives, please tell the world what happened here.</span> <span id="s594">If somebody succeeds to go in a camp or be among the free world or go out for labor, please tell what happened, please tell the world what was happening.</span> <span id="s595">We kept on thinking that nobody knows in the whole world what was happening to us because you know first we said "oh, we will wear the yellow star, a star, two three days, a week, a month, the war will end" but here I am talking already 1944, three years already.</span> <span id="s596">By that point I was already skinny, 16 year old girl, looked horrible, I looked maybe like 40.</span> <span id="s597">In Stutthof, when I was there by myself you know with many nice Jewish women but no family, nobody, I didn't have a cousin, no one there with me, a few women from my home town, a woman came over to me and said to me they don't really keep children in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s598">Why did she say that?</span> <span id="s599">Every day when we were given the food, if there was a little food left tin that big bucket that they carried the food to us, the Polish Capo used to say children under 16 can get double food but under 16 were not allowed to be there.</span> <span id="s600">So everybody was afraid to march out.</span> <span id="s601">You were hungry but I didn't say I want more food.</span> <span id="s602">You didn't have a birth certificate, it's your word against theirs.</span> <span id="s603">He used to come schlep me out, drag me out and another maybe dozen kids that were already 16, maybe some were, saying you can get more food, why don't you come out -- maybe some were not -- saying you can get more food, why don't you come out, you are under 16, and if I said I'm 16, he beat me up.</span> <span id="s604">So this woman said to me, "it's bad, it's bad, you know, they won't keep you alive here" and I looked at her with my eyes open, you know I was so scared, and she said to me "Maidela, little girls, try to go out for labor, they do take people out for labor.</span> <span id="s605">If you could get out for labor, maybe you would survive, little girl Meidela (ph), little girl," you know like this.</span> <span id="s606">She didn't know my name, I never knew her name.</span> <span id="s607">One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the camp, they were given a blanket and dish for food and with my smart -- you know, what do you know at 16 in a camp from the age of 13 to 16?</span> <span id="s608">-- I said they are given a blanket and a dish for food, it must be for work.</span> <span id="s609">You know how many Jewish people went to death with a blanket and a dish for food.</span> <span id="s610">So I stood in this line.</span> <span id="s611">The woman said stand on your tip toes to look taller, pinch your cheeks to look osier, and you know I succeeded to leave Stutthof.</span> <span id="s612">That night we left, 5,000 women.</span> <span id="s613">I remember they took us over a little river -- I don't know the name of the river -- by boat.</span> <span id="s614">Somebody said that many people were drowned in that river but I don't know, you know how people talk.</span> <span id="s615">Maybe there is documentation on it.</span> <span id="s616">I think it was the elbe maybe.</span> <span id="s617">And they divided us a thousand in a camp, a thousand pass by, they divide it, thousand, they divide it.</span> <span id="s618">So all the women from my home town were divided like 10 before me so I found myself in the labor camp just with 10 people from my home town.</span> <span id="s619">Other wonderful people, Jewish women, nice, but not even a friend from my home town.</span> <span id="s620">All of a sudden I found myself no family, no neighbors, no people that you know, not even a familiar face.</span> <span id="s621">Now, the first camp that I was in was called Malken [Pol: Ma_ki].</span> <span id="s622">The camp that I worked and many people worked as I did from that period that were taken from Stutthof; we were put into canvas tents, that was our house.</span> <span id="s623">We slept on straw.</span> <span id="s624">The job was to dig giant trenches, holes for Russian tanks to fall in.</span> <span id="s625">We were so weak.</span> <span id="s626">The food, again, so little.</span> <span id="s627">In the morning, the same procedure like in the concentration camp: Up early, they counted you, they gave you the black coffee with a little bit of bread.</span> <span id="s628">In the morning -- evening a little bit of soup.</span> <span id="s629">Sometime they switched it off and they didn't give nothing in the morning, they just gave the black coffee and at night you got your ration of bread and the soup.</span> <span id="s630">So imagine if you got in the evening your ration of bread and the soup, you think you are going to save your little bread for the next day.</span> <span id="s631">I especially used to think I'm so hungry all day, just a little black coffee, I'm going to eat that soup, that water, and eat one bite of the bread, and the next bite I will tear off a little piece of my blanket and I wrapped it and I put it in the straw that I slept on.</span> <span id="s632">In the morning my bread was gone.</span> <span id="s633">And I cried, I cried.</span> <span id="s634">A woman next to me said "Nessele, why are you crying, Nessele?"</span> <span id="s635">-- She knew my name -- I said I had a little bit of bread, I put it in the straw underneath my head and a mouse must have come.</span> <span id="s636">You there were plenty of mice and rats.</span> <span id="s637">She knew there were hungry people that ate the bread.</span> <span id="s638">She said "Child, give me your little bread, I will put in my bosom and I will give it to you in the morning."</span> <span id="s639">You know whenever we got the bread at night and I didn't eat it, I gave it to Mrs. Feivish (ph), may she rest in peace -- that was her name -- and as she handed that piece of bread to me in the morning, she saved my life maybe.</span> <span id="s640">You know, I'm telling you these things today because people don't understand how human we stayed in this inhumane situation.</span> <span id="s641">I want to bring out this little things that people don't understand, people cannot understand.</span> <span id="s642">As much as we survivors talk, you know we tried to tell the fact, this one killed, this one did, but I want to bring this out Linda, you know it's very important you know.</span> <span id="s643">So in this camp we dug those holes, we finished one area.</span> <span id="s644">They kept on moving us, that's why we stayed in those canvas tents.</span> <span id="s645">It was convenient for them.</span> <span id="s646">They had barracks made out of veneer you know for food and also that were prefabricated that you could quickly unscrew and move on.</span> <span id="s647">Like this we went into two camps, Malken and Dörbeck.</span> <span id="s648">In those camps, they did not have to kill us.</span> <span id="s649">We started to die...die of starvation and diseases.</span> <span id="s650">In the morning, we got up, our hair was frozen to the ground on that straw.</span> <span id="s651">Many people said oh, they cut their hair in the camps, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s652">In Stutthof, they didn't cut our hair.</span> <span id="s653">It was more terrible, because we didn't have water to wash with.</span> <span id="s654">And when you have hair on you, it gets infested with lice; and with lice brings diseases.</span> <span id="s655">By the time came October, November of 1944, it was a mess--walking skeletons with wounds.</span> <span id="s656">We looked horrible.</span> <span id="s657">At one point, at that time, they brought certain kinds of barracks.</span> <span id="s658">Not barracks.</span> <span id="s659">It was like to hold horses--a round wooden thing that they put up for us to be in.</span> <span id="s660">Not in the tents, because we were doing work so they felt that we are still useful.</span> <span id="s661">So they gave us this wooden barracks; and wherever one horse had to stand was five women lying there on the straw--no bunks, not a change of clothes.</span> <span id="s662">You know, Linda, I think that about six months I had not taken off my clothes.</span> <span id="s663">There was no reason to take it off.</span> <span id="s664">There was no water to wash with, there was no change of clothing.</span> <span id="s665">And then you were afraid to take it off, because maybe some person that doesn't have a dress is going to take it, or your blanket or whatever.</span> <span id="s666">You know people in need, you have to understand that.</span> <span id="s667">We stayed there until January 1945, in those camps...in those areas, Malken and Dörbeck.</span> <span id="s668">There was another place that we were moved, but I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s669">It was three separate places.</span> <span id="s670">Then one morning, we were woken up very early, maybe 3:00 o'clock at night, we were told to line up and take everything that we have in that little tent with us.</span> <span id="s671">We were leaving the area.</span> <span id="s672">We looked, we looked for trucks, there was nothing outside.</span> <span id="s673">March, a march.</span> <span id="s674">It was called the Death March.</span> <span id="s675">You know, we marched day and night this way.</span> <span id="s676">During the day we walked.</span> <span id="s677">You had to stop one time, let's say you had to go the bathroom, you had to go at that time to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s678">Now, if you wanted to go another time to the bathroom, too bad.</span> <span id="s679">If you stopped to stay in the back, you were dead.</span> <span id="s680">Whoever stayed behind was shot.</span> <span id="s681">We heard all the time shots.</span> <span id="s682">Also as we walked we saw many, many human beings face down with a bullet in the back in the snow and we saw that they were inmates like us because they were skinny, they wore prisoner garb, we could see it was Jewish people with their stars and with their numbers.</span> <span id="s683">Now, you know, we went through it was the Danzig area--you know, exactly where Stutthof was, where we worked in that area--Poland, Germans, roads, villages, towns... We saw people, they say now they didn't see us.</span> <span id="s684">You know, I put out...in the winter, I put out a little crumbs for the birds.</span> <span id="s685">They didn't have to hand us food.</span> <span id="s686">If they would just put a little crumbs or a potato peel on the street where we had to walk, we wouldn't have been so hungry.</span> <span id="s687">They didn't do it.</span> <span id="s688">They didn't do it, Linda.</span> <span id="s689">I remember on that march -- me, I'm sharing it with you, I never share it, I will tell you that, just once I think I talked about it -- I remember sleeping, they told us to rest a little bit, and in the snow there was manure of a horse or a cow all dried out and straw with it and undigested grain.</span> <span id="s690">I remember taking that grain, washing it in the snow, taking out the kernel and eating it.</span> <span id="s691">I tell you the truth, as I look back, I think I fulfilled a big commandment to save a human life.</span> <span id="s692">And I say it again, I saved my life by doing... I think sometimes I shouldn't tell about it.</span> <span id="s693">It's a horrible thing to tell.</span> <span id="s694">But I feel today I really want to tell you as much as I can.</span> <span id="s695">On that march, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s696">They were beating us with the underside of a gun.</span> <span id="s697">They didn't want to waste the bullets, they wanted to clobber us dead.</span> <span id="s698">See, I have this scar on my face.</span> <span id="s699">One night, we were put up in a barn to sleep.</span> <span id="s700">Sometime they put is in a church, in a school, in a barn.</span> <span id="s701">That night the women saw cows that had milk in the udder; and the women started to milk the cows and drink the milk in their mouths.</span> <span id="s702">I didn't do it, but I was there.</span> <span id="s703">I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s704">I was sleeping, maybe.</span> <span id="s705">All of a sudden, we heard noise: the farmer yelling, "I let you let in these dirty women in my barn, and they are drinking the milk that I am supposed to sell tomorrow in the market!"</span> <span id="s706">Instead of saying, "I'm so happy that they can have one night a little milk."</span> <span id="s707">The guard, the SS, ran into the barn and it was stampede in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s708">They made us go out of that barn.</span> <span id="s709">They were hitting us with the underside of the guns and with clubs.</span> <span id="s710">And I was hit on the head on this side; and I swear to you, fire came out from my eyes.</span> <span id="s711">I had like a slight concussion-- I couldn't...no open wound, but I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s712">Two women quickly grabbed me and held me in their arms.</span> <span id="s713">"Maidl--girl, go, walk, walk, gae, gae."</span> <span id="s714">I didn't know these women.</span> <span id="s715">They could have left me behind.</span> <span id="s716">Many, many people were left that night behind there.</span> <span id="s717">Later, an infection set inside, and a few weeks later it opened up.</span> <span id="s718">But this is the history of my scar.</span> <span id="s719">So this is just a little incident about beating up on your back, on your shoulders, scars all over.</span> <span id="s720">We arrived in the middle of February in a place by the name of Chrinow (ph) in a little place in a barn.</span> <span id="s721">They put us into this barn, and it was so crowded.</span> <span id="s722">I don't know how many of the thousand women were left at that point.</span> <span id="s723">I really don't know a count, maybe 600, maybe 500, maybe 700.</span> <span id="s724">I don't know how many were left behind.</span> <span id="s725">I forgot to tell you something.</span> <span id="s726">While we were walking on the march we had stopped in another camp: it was called Praust.</span> <span id="s727">There we stayed two days.</span> <span id="s728">The healthier were made to march alone and we left some behind and there some people from another camp joined us.</span> <span id="s729">So when we walked already... When we came to the barn, we were not our original thousand women, we were already from a few camps a combination.</span> <span id="s730">They took out a bunch of women, they told them to dig two long holes in front of the barn.</span> <span id="s731">We thought they are lining us up to shoot us.</span> <span id="s732">But they had different plans.</span> <span id="s733">In one hole they put two sticks, a latrine, a bathroom -- people need a latrine -- the other hole, we found out soon enough, would be a grave.</span> <span id="s734">They knew in that barn we are going to die.</span> <span id="s735">People looked walking skeletons, bones covered with skin.</span> <span id="s736">Every day you looked around, somebody was dead.</span> <span id="s737">Every morning, you had to take out the dead and dump it in the hole.</span> <span id="s738">Sometimes you had to do it, sometimes I had to do it, sometimes this one.</span> <span id="s739">They said you have next to you dead, take it out.</span> <span id="s740">And then it was you know very cold and many people thought gee, I will take that blanket or the dress of the dead and put it over me so I will keep warm.</span> <span id="s741">So many, many of these bodies were already naked.</span> <span id="s742">That's why you see sometime pictures near the barracks that are naked because we figure, "They are dead.</span> <span id="s743">They don't need that garment.</span> <span id="s744">Maybe I will save my life."</span> <span id="s745">As I walked to that barn, I will tell you, every day we said to each other, "Live another day, I told you, in spite of the enemy."</span> <span id="s746">But in that barn, I didn't want to live no more.</span> <span id="s747">Food was given to us maybe once in three days.</span> <span id="s748">A little bit of water.</span> <span id="s749">Some people did not even have the strength to go out to get that little food.</span> <span id="s750">Many times, you know, I myself said, "I'm not going to go out."</span> <span id="s751">There were women that said, "If you don't want to eat, go out for me.</span> <span id="s752">Give me that piece of bread."</span> <span id="s753">You know, they called you and helped you go out.</span> <span id="s754">We were there three weeks.</span> <span id="s755">The sight of these three weeks in that Chrinow barn is indescribable.</span> <span id="s756">I tell you I wanted to die but march 10 came and God's will was different the Russians liberated us.</span> <span id="s757">That day of liberation, I just want to tell you that morning the people that said to take out the dead took out the dead and went outside and they came back and said "No guards, we don't see any guards."</span> <span id="s758">Some woman said "Let's run, the village is a mile away."</span> <span id="s759">We couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s760">How could we run?</span> <span id="s761">Some other woman said it's a trick, we will start walking to the village and the Germans will shoot us.</span> <span id="s762">All day long we sat in the barn not knowing that the guards had escaped.</span> <span id="s763">See, they knew that the Russians are coming but we didn't, we didn't know a thing.</span> <span id="s764">At night we hear boots.</span> <span id="s765">We said oh, they are coming, they are coming to murder us, and then we heard Russian language and this was the fighting unit.</span> <span id="s766">And they said, "Ladies, don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s767">We found what was going on here.</span> <span id="s768">We already saw other camps.</span> <span id="s769">And the ones that are alive are going to be helped."</span> <span id="s770">And they said that the next day the medics will come and help us out.</span> <span id="s771">A few hundred of us survived in that barn, what should I tell you, by miracle.</span> <span id="s772">I say it again and again and again.</span> <span id="s773">You know my scar here, I forget even it's there.</span> <span id="s774">I put makeup sometime, I make a joke to my grandchildren, I say it's a boo.</span> <span id="s775">My other scars are covered with my clothing; but my mental wounds I will carry to my grave.</span> <span id="s776">Six million Jewish people lost their life, 5 million non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s777">Why?</span> <span id="s778">Why?</span> <span id="s779">Now you know why (unclear word) people like myself, survivors... You can see why it's not easy for me to sit here and talk to you.</span> <span id="s780">But I agreed to do this tape with the hope...with the hope that humanity will learn out of this horrible...out of this horrible to make a life of people more beautiful.</span> <span id="s781">It's true, we light a candle for our dead, we make a memorial--we do that in our synagogues, in our homes.</span> <span id="s782">But what you are doing in this museum, we the survivors feel... I know my group here in our area, we feel that everyone of us wants to tell the true story for humanity for the sake of generations to come, so it can never happen again to anybody...to anybody ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s784">Tell me the rest.</span> <span id="s785">Will you tell me what after the war.</span> <span id="s786">?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I was liberated that night; and I remember I cried.</span> <span id="s788">I cried at night.</span> <span id="s789">And many times, as I sleep now or I am awakened by a nightmare, I think of that night of liberation and I wonder why did I cry.</span> <span id="s790">At one point, I felt guilty that I survived, Linda, as well as other survivors.</span> <span id="s791">Was I better than my friends and my cousins and my buddies and my uncles and my aunts and my father?</span> <span id="s792">Was I better?</span> <span id="s793">And then I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s794">And maybe I cried for me, because I was all alone.</span> <span id="s795">At that time I did not know how many of [my] family survived.</span> <span id="s796">You see, Linda, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s797">My mother survived the Holocaust in a camp just like mine; my brother (unclear word) survived the Holocaust in Dachau concentration camp; my brother Menashe was liberated by the Russians in that village, in that smokehouse.</span> <span id="s798">So I was lucky.</span> <span id="s799">My two brothers are alive.</span> <span id="s800">My mother has died since, but nobody killed her.</span> <span id="s801">She died by illness.</span> <span id="s802">So that night, I cried.</span> <span id="s803">But I haven't cried since.</span> <span id="s804">You see, I choke up; you will see a tear in my eye, but it doesn't come out.</span> <span id="s805">I learn to laugh, I learn to live, but I forgot how to cry.</span> <span id="s806">The next day when the medics came, they started to carry all the women that couldn't walk from that barn to the village.</span> <span id="s807">You see, the Germans of that village took their horses and the wagons and ran away, they went with the Germans, they were retreating so there were not many horses left, maybe a few horses.</span> <span id="s808">That was a small village, Chrinow.</span> <span id="s809">I always wonder how big it was but I know now that it wasn't big.</span> <span id="s810">I remember small houses, it was like a small little town; and I don't remember really where they made the makeshift hospital, whether it was in a school or whether in some other public building because it wasn't a hospital.</span> <span id="s811">They quickly made some bunks, some wooden bunks that they put the people up.</span> <span id="s812">The only thing that I remember was that I was carried in one of the homes and I was told that I have to wait maybe a day or two until this makeshift hospital will be ready.</span> <span id="s813">I was put on a straw sack, not just straw but it was already a sack of straw.</span> <span id="s814">Next to me, when I opened my eyes, I saw a woman who I recognized as a teacher of one of the Yavneh, of the religious schools--from the girl's school, a teacher.</span> <span id="s815">She looked so horrible, she looked terrible.</span> <span id="s816">I don't think I recognized -- I don't know how I recognized her.</span> <span id="s817">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s818">And I was so glad that she was next to me.</span> <span id="s819">But an hour later she was dead.</span> <span id="s820">You have to understand, many, many survivors died after liberation--the weak.</span> <span id="s821">Many that were even maybe a little stronger and could walk into the village, they started to eat and their stomach was shrunken, they died because they ate.</span> <span id="s822">Some died because they didn't eat.</span> <span id="s823">Typhoid, dysentery.</span> <span id="s824">The next day or a day after they came this Russian people with some help of the villagers that they recruited to do this work and they carried me to the hospital where my hair was shaven from all over my body and I was dunked in DDT to kill all the lice and whatever, insects, and then I was unconscious for three days.</span> <span id="s825">I don't remember naturally what happened but I remember when I opened my eyes I saw a big room with a lot of women laying there and some Russian doctor who happened to be Jewish talking to me and telling me that I was unconscious for three days.</span> <span id="s826">I must have had typhoid, high fever, maybe delirious, I don't know.</span> <span id="s827">My toes were black frozen.</span> <span id="s828">They were considering to cut it off but this particular doctor said to wait, not to cut it.</span> <span id="s829">He thought if it doesn't start to rot, maybe it will peel off.</span> <span id="s830">And it did, it peeled off.</span> <span id="s831">I weighed maybe 55 pounds.</span> <span id="s832">The first time I saw myself was in a reflection in a door in a little window of a door.</span> <span id="s833">When I looked at that door -- I wanted to see what's outside when I could stand on my feet already and look outside, maybe it was a week or ten days after liberation -- I saw the most horrible creature, a skeleton with eyes inside and I turned around to look who is behind me and nobody was behind me.</span> <span id="s834">And it took me time to realize that this was me.</span> <span id="s835">This happened right away after, you know... We got wonderful care from the Russian army, from the medics at that time.</span> <span id="s836">The women that were just little bit stronger among our own women started to be like nurses, carried a little bit of food to give us, make sure -- many, many of us went on hunger strikes after liberation.</span> <span id="s837">We said we don't want to live no more, many.</span> <span id="s838">You found many incidents, different incidents.</span> <span id="s839">And to make sure the little food we got, we ate it.</span> <span id="s840">The fill that was given, we swallowed, the people among ourselves.</span> <span id="s841">Six weeks I was in that hospital.</span> <span id="s842">Then I was given by this committee or whoever was in charge a dress, a pair of underpants, pair of shoes, a pair of socks and I was told to go.</span> <span id="s843">Where?</span> <span id="s844">There was another woman at that time who was from Kovno, which is Lithuania.</span> <span id="s845">Now, I thought the best place to go is back home.</span> <span id="s846">Maybe somebody is alive.</span> <span id="s847">I didn't know [if] my mother survived or my brother survived.</span> <span id="s848">I had hoped that maybe my brother who escaped survived.</span> <span id="s849">So with this woman -- you didn't need a ticket, they gave you some kind of piece of paper that you are a survivor and you are traveling.</span> <span id="s850">So freight trains, you hopped on the fright train.</span> <span id="s851">I hopped.</span> <span id="s852">You couldn't walk, you had feet that were just frozen off, shoes that were man's shoes, you could hardly move.</span> <span id="s853">I was trying to get to _ód_.</span> <span id="s854">Somebody already that we start to talk on the train, we met other survivors from other camps and somebody said everybody says that in _ód_ there is a little bit of a community that helps you.</span> <span id="s855">So that's how I got to _ód_.</span> <span id="s856">In _ód_ -- when I came first to _ód_ there wasn't much organized there.</span> <span id="s857">But there was a space where there was a big room; and I remember like I don't know if there were billboards or just papers hanging.</span> <span id="s858">And it said "Lithuania" and "Latvia" and "Estonia" and "Poland" and "Ukraine."</span> <span id="s859">And people signed in where they are from, what their name is, where they are going.</span> <span id="s860">As I was looking on that billboard to see, you know, I said, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s861">Let me look.</span> <span id="s862">Maybe somebody [is] from my home town."</span> <span id="s863">A woman was standing there, and said to me, "You're Nesse Galperin from Šiauliai, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s864">You are from the dairy business."</span> <span id="s865">You know, you are always identified by what you did.</span> <span id="s866">And this woman said to me, "Your mother is alive.</span> <span id="s867">I saw her alive after liberation.</span> <span id="s868">I think she is in this and this village."</span> <span id="s869">Now, I don't even remember which village it was.</span> <span id="s870">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s871">Anyway, back I go with -- I couldn't move -- back -- people say "Where are you going backwards, crazy little girl, where are you going backwards?"</span> <span id="s872">I got to that village.</span> <span id="s873">Maybe it took me a week to get to that village, or two weeks--I don't remember.</span> <span id="s874">Begging for a little food -- you know, nobody still gave us food, you had to beg or call it or whatever.</span> <span id="s875">And still that one dress.</span> <span id="s876">You know, you were not in very good shape at that point: a big wound here, pus going and smelling terrible, my head wrapped because my head was shaven off with a shmata, with a rag, to cover it.</span> <span id="s877">I got to that village; I found Jewish women, but no Mother.</span> <span id="s878">But women from my home town that reassured me that my mother was liberated with them, and they also heard that people are in _ód_.</span> <span id="s879">But they felt in this smaller village, they can have a little more food to eat and they will get a little stronger, then they will go to _ód_.</span> <span id="s880">Back I come to _ód_, maybe two weeks later or three weeks later--I don't know the time really at that point.</span> <span id="s881">At the railroad already there were women, our own women, waiting for us like a welcome committee saying where is a shelter, where you can go, who can help you... You know what that meant already.</span> <span id="s882">And that's how I was reunited with my mother.</span> <span id="s883">While we were in _ód_, the men from Dachau were liberated.</span> <span id="s884">The men in Dachau were liberated, actually, before, in May.</span> <span id="s885">But by the time messengers came -- many of them sent messengers, they sent two people come to Poland, tell the survivors not to go to Russia, try to come back, try to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s886">You know, we saw at that point that nobody cared for us, nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s887">If it's not going to -- at that point the urge to have a homeland was so big because we saw that the whole world wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s888">So at that point many, many survivors tried to come to the American Zone.</span> <span id="s889">You could travel still, go here, go there.</span> <span id="s890">When I came to the American zone--first to Berlin.</span> <span id="s891">In Berlin already my brother had a friend that worked with transferring people from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s892">It was already the Jewish (unclear word) agency work, the Sohnut (unclear word) and we were brought to Feldafing.</span> <span id="s893">Feldafing was a displaced persons camp near Munich where the people that were liberated from Dachau were taken from Dachau, put there in the hospitals.</span> <span id="s894">Feldafing was actually like a resort area where the Nazis, the SS, had their meetings.</span> <span id="s895">We came to Feldafing in 1945.</span> <span id="s896">My brother had written to my aunt, who lived at that point in New York.</span> <span id="s897">He remembered her address.</span> <span id="s898">He wrote her a letter we survived, would she bring us to America.</span> <span id="s899">That same year, we had cousins in Washington, D.C. that had liquor store, grocery store.</span> <span id="s900">They got from them, you know, backing that they will take care of us, that we are not going to be -- at that point, my aunt already lived in Washington, but the mail was forwarded to where she got that letter--from New York to Washington.</span> <span id="s901">They secured that we are not going to be a burden to the American government.</span> <span id="s902">But because of bureaucracy, because we were from Lithuania, we had to come on the Lithuanian quota.</span> <span id="s903">I did not get here until December of 1950.</span> <span id="s904">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s905">I'm talking about me--not everybody else, just my family.</span> <span id="s906">Five years I had to wait.</span> <span id="s907">Now, how do I feel when I open the [Washington] Post, and I see that all these years Nazis enjoy the freedom of the United States?</span> <span id="s908">And we had to sit there, because on a Lithuanian quota.</span> <span id="s909">There was no more Lithuania, it was already Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s910">So this quota system -- our beautiful Unites States, which I love dearly, did not open the gates for us so easily.</span> <span id="s911">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s912">And now, as you know, I live in Silver Spring with my husband Jack, who is also a survivor of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s913">He is the only person of his family.</span> <span id="s914">He does not talk about his past.</span> <span id="s915">It's hard for him to listen.</span> <span id="s916">And we have three lovely children, who are good human beings.</span> <span id="s917">Somehow we survivors, because we suffered, because we needed, because were hungry, because were naked, implanted in our children to be sensitive to those needs.</span> <span id="s918">And most of them really grew up to be involved in helping other human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS (1) As I told you, my aunt and my uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Jaffe, lived in New York -- they came here in 1928.</span> <span id="s920">And we had sent many pictures to them through the war -- before the war.</span> <span id="s921">Now, when I came to the United States my Tante... She was lovely, she was darling; I loved her dearly.</span> <span id="s922">I used to [say,] "Tante, you have pictures of my family."</span> <span id="s923">She said "When I will die, you will have them."</span> <span id="s924">A few of them she gave us to make a copy.</span> <span id="s925">You can see this is a copy of a picture that she gave us a long time ago.</span> <span id="s926">My father, my mother, my two brothers, me as a tiny little girl.</span> <span id="s927">But after she passed -- when she passed away a few years ago, her children were kind.</span> <span id="s928">They said to me, "Go to the album and take whatever of your family."</span> <span id="s929">So I do have -- I'm luckier than some other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">(2) This is a picture of my two brothers and myself.</span> <span id="s931">You know it helps to show especially children of the United States to see that we were normal-looking, nice... Look just like they do.</span> <span id="s932">We were not different.</span> <span id="s933">We were not abused because we looked different.</span> <span id="s934">We were abused because we were Jews and went to synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">(3) This is a picture of me just a year before, here I was 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">(4) This picture -- I'm going to show you two pictures.</span> <span id="s937">Not just the front of the picture means a lot to me.</span> <span id="s938">This my family in on the Pesach of 1941.</span> <span id="s939">This my grandmother, my father.</span> <span id="s940">My grandmother was 16 when my father was born.</span> <span id="s941">When I show this picture, people think it was his sister.</span> <span id="s942">She was killed in Vilna.</span> <span id="s943">My father was one of 16 children.</span> <span id="s944">Nine were alive before the war, and one is alive [after].</span> <span id="s945">Imagine how many cousins and how many relatives!</span> <span id="s946">I didn't even know their names.</span> <span id="s947">And my uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">(5) And this is the couple... A couple is here--a man and a woman--my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s949">This is taken from _ód_, just before the Nazis came to us.</span> <span id="s950">They had some money, they bought their way out.</span> <span id="s951">And when they came, they told us they did not know that people were being killed but they knew that people were being taken from _ód_ and taken to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">(6) And to follow up this, after my aunt died and I looked through her things that the children were getting ready to throw away, I found an envelope that I'm going to present to the Museum.</span> <span id="s953">When I saw the Swastikas on this envelope, I knew that this is a piece of documentation.</span> <span id="s954">The letter inside was not there, whether my cousin did not realize it and threw it away.</span> <span id="s955">This letter was sent to my aunt to whom I sent all these pictures, Mr. Jaffe, to New York.</span> <span id="s956">And I feel terrible that I don't know what was in the letter, what they were asking for--whether they were saying the truth of what was happening.</span> <span id="s957">And I assume that they were taken 1940 from _ód_ to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s958">Maybe this is already from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s959">The letter came from...it's my mother's uncle and aunt by the name of Hablinski.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">(7) Now I have one more picture that I would like to share with you.</span> <span id="s961">Well, this also...this also a picture I want to share with you, my father on Chanukah going from the synagogue with my two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">(8) But the most what I want to share with you, which is precious to me, the last thing I have from my father, his handwriting is the signed "Pinchas (unclear word)."</span> <span id="s963">So this is very valuable to me.</span> <span id="s964">But I always like to share it with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">(9) Now this particular picture was given to me by a friend of mine, that he received from Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Israel.</span> <span id="s966">This is a document, a copy of a document that we don't know whether the Lithuanians took or the Germans took.</span> <span id="s967">This is a picture of our Rabbis and the scholars before they were taken out to be shot--the thousand men that I was telling you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">(10) Now, I have one more thing that I want to show.</span> <span id="s969">I don't know who has it in print, who does not have it, where it could be obtained.</span> <span id="s970">But this book is called Pinkas Shavli.</span> <span id="s971">Here is a map of the two ghettos that I was talking about, where they were.</span> <span id="s972">In this book, a teacher of my school -- his name is Yerushalmi -- wrote a diary in the ghetto every day of what was happening.</span> <span id="s973">He was assigned to do so by the Jewish Community Council, and it was written originally in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s974">When I saw this book at a friend of mine['s] house, I was very anxious to get it.</span> <span id="s975">And with a lot of persuading, let's put it that way, I got this book.</span> <span id="s976">And I just wanted to make sure that my memories are right.</span> <span id="s977">And as I read this book, I see that this is exactly what I shared with you.</span> <span id="s978">All is written in this book; and it's called -- let me just put it here in the front and you will see what it is: Pinkas Shavli.</span> <span id="s979">It's a diary that was written, just as many diaries, by this gentleman who is not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s980">He has died.</span> <span id="s981">He dedicated it to his son who perished during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">(11) Look at this picture and see the Rabbis that I remember.</span> <span id="s983">This is the cousin that came to us and told us the people were taken from _ód_ to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s984">This is me on the end, this is my older brother, my younger brother, one of my uncles, my grandmother who looked like a sister to my father at that point, and my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">(12) This is me at the age of 12.</span> <span id="s986">And I always show it to children, and tell them that I looked just like any child in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">(13) I will turn this one around too.</span> <span id="s988">This picture, I was talking about my father's signature.</span> <span id="s989">It has the city on it and the date.</span> <span id="s990">This picture was sent in 1930s.</span> <span id="s991">I was 2 years old here.</span> <span id="s992">My two brothers, they are older than me.</span> <span id="s993">This my family on vacation, a copy of a picture.</span> <span id="s994">As you can see, somebody didn't give me the picture, it was just a copy.</span> <span id="s995">My family, my parents, myself as a baby, my brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">After Chaim Frenkl.</span> <span id="s997">Founded by him in 1879.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">See Hilberg, The Destruction of Eurpoean Jews, p. 67.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">**Gas chambers at Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Subcamp of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1001">Women only.</span> <span id="s1002">Opened April 1944 and closed January 28, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Also a subcamp of Stutthof, for women only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Nesse identifies this place elsewhere as Praust--another women's subcamp of Stutthof, located in the immediate area of Danzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0080 page \* arabic4</span></p></body></html>
