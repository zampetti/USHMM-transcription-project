William Luksenburg conducted by Esther Finder.</span> <span id="s13">Today is May 26th.</span> <span id="s14">We are in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s15">This interview was part of the museum's project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum.</span> <span id="s16">[technical comments].</span> <span id="s17">And I am going to start with your liberation experience.</span> <span id="s18">I'd like to know where you were when you realized that you were finally free.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Answer: I was, before liberation we were on a death march.</span> <span id="s20">The death march started in Regensburg, all the way to the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s21">I was actually, they let me go, they didn't shoot me.</span> <span id="s22">I describe it later on.</span> <span id="s23">My liberation came in a little town Liebenau Bad Abbach (ph) along the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s24">On the way, during the March we didn't know it was the end.</span> <span id="s25">We kind of seen that these guys didn't care much.</span> <span id="s26">They were older, like Hungarian SS, and so on.</span> <span id="s27">And as you march you, whenever you, you find yourself at the rear of the column you know you get shot so everybody kept on shoving forward.</span> <span id="s28">In other words, they didn't have to tell you to press because whenever you find yourself at the end of the column you knew that most likely get shot for not keeping up with the group so you push forward.</span> <span id="s29">You push, what I mean, you schlep your feet with the shoes, you don't pick your feet up anymore.</span> <span id="s30">So somehow or other my feet got tangled up and I fell.</span> <span id="s31">And I closed my eyes and I expected a shot.</span> <span id="s32">It didn't come.</span> <span id="s33">And I looked the corner of my eyes, I seen the column going down.</span> <span id="s34">And it felt good, I didn't have to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">And I was laying there and a friendly--must of make some moaning noise or whatever, and a German farmer with a oxen came by, picked me up, put me on his wagon, hay wagon, and brought me to a big farm.</span> <span id="s36">And I remember sitting there and they gave me a piece of bread, big piece of bread with butter, and a big glass of milk, and I could not, my stomach couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s37">I threw it up.</span> <span id="s38">And I sat there and I was breathing so heavily.</span> <span id="s39">And they had the doctor come in and look at me and he thought I had tuberculosis, he hardly touched me.</span> <span id="s40">What happened also while I was there I was--uniform was completely covered with lice.</span> <span id="s41">We didn't bathe or clean since May--since January till May.</span> <span id="s42">So they took my striped clothes off and gave me some of their own old clothes.</span> <span id="s43">And there was some German woman would open up the gate of the farm, took one look at me and cry.</span> <span id="s44">Never seen anything again look like that.</span> <span id="s45">I weighed about 65 pounds, had a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">And so next day the farmer comes over.</span> <span id="s47">He says, "The Armies are here."</span> <span id="s48">I didn't know--they call the Americans "The Armies."</span> <span id="s49">He put me back on the hay wagon, brought me to the town Liebenau, to the Americans.</span> <span id="s50">First thing, they undress me and pour the brown, yellowish-brown powder, which I later on found out was DDT.</span> <span id="s51">Only people who went through what I went through can understand all of a sudden the heat from the lice eating your body completely stopped.</span> <span id="s52">All of a sudden the whole world stood still.</span> <span id="s53">And I was very fortunate that I was liberated by the American Army because there was some colonel who took the doctors from the small town Laufen and pressed them into service.</span> <span id="s54">And there was a women's prison there.</span> <span id="s55">They took the prisoners, women, and they moved them.</span> <span id="s56">And they, they, all the survivors were taken in, they were treated there.</span> <span id="s57">And I remember the first morning, the first round, I was laying on a white sheet and I have seen the doctors on the first round.</span> <span id="s58">And I felt, I felt so bad.</span> <span id="s59">My heart was, like, palpitating and I remember seeing--I was laying on a white sheet which meant a lot because I hadn't slept on a white sheet since my parents went to Auschwitz in 1942.</span> <span id="s60">And I felt I would die.</span> <span id="s61">And I really felt sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s62">I knew I was liberated and I start to cry.</span> <span id="s63">And a German doctor went over to me and he felt my pulse and he said in German, "Wein sie, wein sie, sie ghense scraper home ich (ph)."</span> <span id="s64">"Don't cry, don't cry, you are very much undernourished."</span> <span id="s65">And I remember the next day they came in and they would, some other American officials came in, they would uncover me to show how a human body looked like, and they would uncover me.</span> <span id="s66">I couldn't stand looking at my own body because the biggest part was my knee and the bone and everything was just, just dry bone.</span> <span id="s67">They kept uncovering me, I kept on covering me.</span> <span id="s68">I couldn't stand looking at myself.</span> <span id="s69">As a matter of fact, one soldier took a picture of me and I took one look at it and I tore it up.</span> <span id="s70">I couldn't stand it looking at it.</span> <span id="s71">Wish I would have kept it today.</span> <span id="s72">And I was very fortunate that I didn't get any other, you know, diseases.</span> <span id="s73">Some people had typhoid and so on.</span> <span id="s74">I just was undernourished.</span> <span id="s75">I was fed intravenously and the nurses would walk out with me holding my arms, get me into the sun, and a few months later I came to.</span> <span id="s76">But I could not stand being in jail.</span> <span id="s77">I still had, was in a jailhouse with bars out there.</span> <span id="s78">So I heard that some--the Army's, the American Army's down the valley.</span> <span id="s79">So walked out, went down there.</span> <span id="s80">I shouldn't have.</span> <span id="s81">There are some people from Chicago speaking Polish, because Polish is my mother tongue, so.</span> <span id="s82">They took me in.</span> <span id="s83">I remember they gave me first aid to help out the ________, because all the--I couldn't hold them up.</span> <span id="s84">So they gave me a job to distribute coffee to the soldiers, to hunt the coffee for them and distribute.</span> <span id="s85">And I felt I am not going back to the jailhouse.</span> <span id="s86">So I was, I was given by one of the Germans a room on the, on like an attic and, you know, I came back quickly because I had good food.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">And I remember one day that the food was cooked like big aluminum kettles.</span> <span id="s88">We had chocolate cake, turkey and so on.</span> <span id="s89">And they were digging a ditch and I see they are dumping that, that food, that good food into the ditch.</span> <span id="s90">I said, "No, no, no."</span> <span id="s91">I said to him in Polish, I said, "We have some people up in Liebenau and they don't get that kind of food."</span> <span id="s92">He said "No, no Frauline, no German Frauline."</span> <span id="s93">Want to make sure--they are giving me food but I shouldn't give to the German girls.</span> <span id="s94">I said, "No, no."</span> <span id="s95">And I had some coffee so I bartered the coffee for a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s96">And I came every morning, every day, after chow time, all strings and bags and so on, came rolling in, into the big courtyard.</span> <span id="s97">The prison had a big courtyard, the office in front of it.</span> <span id="s98">I used to roll in and all these guys was yelling at me, "Here, here."</span> <span id="s99">They wanted some food.</span> <span id="s100">Which was nice and I did that for quite a while.</span> <span id="s101">I--but I remember somewhere in the neighborhood there's my clothes, my jacket is somewhere there.</span> <span id="s102">I have to get--I had a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s103">I thought I am going to try to retrieve it, maybe some people want to see what we look like.</span> <span id="s104">And I was cruising and cruising.</span> <span id="s105">I remember when the farmer put me on the hay wagon, kind of made it--tried to remember.</span> <span id="s106">The barn had a special roof and a special look.</span> <span id="s107">And I kept on driving for maybe a week and a half, and I almost gave it up and at the last minute caught my eye and I drove in.</span> <span id="s108">And at that time the Germans were very, they were not as secure as they are now.</span> <span id="s109">She came in, she said, "Mchten some soup," "I want some soup"--soup means potatoes and some milk.</span> <span id="s110">I said, "No, don't be afraid of me, I just wanted to dig up my clothes, my jacket, go back to the station."</span> <span id="s111">We made a fire outside and a kettle and boiled it out.</span> <span id="s112">Came to a boil, I took it off, rung it out, threw in my backpack and drove off.</span> <span id="s113">And I kept it all these years in my closet.</span> <span id="s114">Once in awhile my friends would come in, I tried it on, and the first time I tried it on I ripped it.</span> <span id="s115">That's how I recognize that's my jacket.</span> <span id="s116">And I put it back in the cupboard.</span> <span id="s117">And I kept it all these years and actually I was intending to give it to Yav H'shem (ph), before was any kind of talk about museum.</span> <span id="s118">Yav H'shem.</span> <span id="s119">When I heard the museum was being built I said to my kids and my wife that's where I'm going to bring my jacket.</span> <span id="s120">And I made appointment.</span> <span id="s121">I came down.</span> <span id="s122">And I kind of felt like very comfortable.</span> <span id="s123">I didn't expect make a big deal out of, take so many pictures out of me, made me feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s124">I just came down to make sure that someone is there to receive it.</span> <span id="s125">So that's the story of my jacket.</span> <span id="s126">I want to come back.</span> <span id="s127">One day came in, riding on a motorcycle, on that big--jail, and I see a lot of people standing in front of the office.</span> <span id="s128">Was big office like, on the, on the mound.</span> <span id="s129">And I said, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s130">"A Jewish girl is here."</span> <span id="s131">Well, I hadn't seen a Jewish girl since I left in January, we weren't together, I forget my first _____ and look at Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s132">And I getting closer and I am looking at my cousin.</span> <span id="s133">My cousin was looking for her husband.</span> <span id="s134">She was traveling all the way up from Bayreuth from north.</span> <span id="s135">Those days they didn't have any kind of transportation, you just hitch-hiked on trucks to trains, trains go for half an hour and they stop.</span> <span id="s136">And so, she said, well, you come with us, because this is my--this one uncle by marriage.</span> <span id="s137">So of course I want to have.</span> <span id="s138">I mean I felt, you know, after we're liberated I didn't, I knew I had lost my parents because went from--I knew where they went.</span> <span id="s139">But I didn't expect really anybody alive.</span> <span id="s140">I knew my older brother went to Aushwitz.</span> <span id="s141">So I kind of felt lost and I didn't think I had anybody left, but that felt real good.</span> <span id="s142">So I traded my motorcycle for a watch.</span> <span id="s143">In those days watch, was a big price to have a watch.</span> <span id="s144">And we hitch-hiked back to Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s145">In Bayreuth I was given a nice room in a villa and we had a lot of other survivors and they were already organize kibbutz for preparation to Israel, and I felt really at home because I had someone.</span> <span id="s146">But I--we had the government, huge government in New York, his name was Captain Cooley (ph), and I--he got off my wife some pictures of a lady who was acquainted.</span> <span id="s147">She was older.</span> <span id="s148">She knew how to keep a household.</span> <span id="s149">She was given a beautiful villa from a big Nazi that had a lot of crystals and beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s150">So I remember the first Passover and I got those pictures.</span> <span id="s151">We invited some Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s152">And the crystals and, you know, just beautiful.</span> <span id="s153">It was such a nice, nice thing to be there.</span> <span id="s154">I felt so good, felt my Jewishness was coming back.</span> <span id="s155">You know, I just--as an oppressed person we're very much alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: I have a couple of questions that I'd like to ask you before you go further.</span> <span id="s157">After the war was over did you witness any acts of retribution or retaliation against Germans or collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, the only thing we've seen--I've seen not really.</span> <span id="s159">I myself was very sick so I did not see any action because I was really not there.</span> <span id="s160">Because the only thing I remember, when, for the preparation to open up that jail, the women's jail, they put us in a big gymnasium to wait till they clean up and so on.</span> <span id="s161">And there were quite a few survivors.</span> <span id="s162">Some of them looked pretty good.</span> <span id="s163">And the Americans didn't realize they caught two SS so they pushed them in.</span> <span id="s164">I don't know why they did it.</span> <span id="s165">And at that time these guys, you know, they had so much, you know, was so much bad blood, and they, and they killed them, in no time.</span> <span id="s166">And, as a matter of fact, the American was surprised, angry at them, thought maybe they get some beating or something.</span> <span id="s167">I don't know why they pushed them in between us people.</span> <span id="s168">And I remember they tried, somebody tried to take off his ring and his watch, and I was laying in the corner.</span> <span id="s169">I was just half dead.</span> <span id="s170">And the two guys must have been fighting for the ring, where the, where the toten cuff would be, and by fighting it they lost it and the ring just swung toward me so it came around and I just kept it out and I kept it.</span> <span id="s171">My son got it.</span> <span id="s172">He wouldn't give it to me.</span> <span id="s173">He said it was his ring.</span> <span id="s174">That's the only thing I saw, because later on the Germans were very, you know, you'd see those white flags all over, they're serious, and they, they always blame everybody else but not themselves.</span> <span id="s175">They always pointed out to Hitler.</span> <span id="s176">I did not really, although I myself felt if I had been liberated in January, like some other people did, I'd have been volunteer for the Russian Army and I would have been the first one to go in to fight.</span> <span id="s177">I was so close to my mother and I always remember that she was with me all the time and I could actually, I couldn't kill a fly now but I could actually kill a lot of people dead, just remembering my mother, how she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: You told me that you knew what happened to the members of your immediate family.</span> <span id="s179">After the war did you make, did you initiate any attempts to find any other relatives or friends from before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, after the war every community you encounter as you travel you put your name.</span> <span id="s181">You have--and every Jewish community has a long list and people read them and most of the people remember, when you meet them say, hey, I've seen this and this in this town on the list, he's alive.</span> <span id="s182">So that's how actually people find themselves.</span> <span id="s183">At that time we didn't have communications as we have, know now.</span> <span id="s184">Especially right after war in Germany there was none.</span> <span id="s185">So that's how people kept on traveling and looking and leaving their names on lists, different cities.</span> <span id="s186">People would remember.</span> <span id="s187">That's how slowly, slowly people got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: I wanted to make sure.</span> <span id="s189">Did you go back to your hometown after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s191">I knew what happened to my parents.</span> <span id="s192">I knew what happened to my older brother.</span> <span id="s193">And I met--I was going to Czechoslovakia a few times.</span> <span id="s194">I had a special entry permit to go but those days the Americans were occupying Prague under the agreement, under Allies agreement, then had to pull back.</span> <span id="s195">And I used to go back and forth and bring some people from, crossing from Poland to Prague, Czechoslovakia, and I had a entry system to bring some few people with us.</span> <span id="s196">That's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: And I met a friend of mine who actually lived in the same home, same house where we lived, and he told me not only nobody's there, they don't, they even bulldoze down the cemetery, they bulldoze down the synagogue, there is nothing absolutely there hometown.</span> <span id="s199">And coming back I myself, as a young boy, I experience very much anti-Semitism calling.</span> <span id="s200">Unlike my wife who lived in the Jewish section, so they had schools, the fact of--Jewish school because the neighborhood was Jewish, where I grew up we had very few Jews, a lot of Polish people, and the schools were run by priests.</span> <span id="s201">And as a kid I experienced, I've been called really all the time Jew.</span> <span id="s202">And you're not--I had bad experience as long as I remember.</span> <span id="s203">We had a religious lesson once a week, on Wednesdays, I remember.</span> <span id="s204">So all grades Jewish boys would walk together because if you walk singly you get beaten up by other Polish boys.</span> <span id="s205">So we usually walk groups all grades together.</span> <span id="s206">As a group, you know, we had more power, then nobody would beat us up.</span> <span id="s207">That's how, you meet in one place then walk to the school as a group.</span> <span id="s208">So I really didn't have good memories living in Poland.</span> <span id="s209">And my wife and my oldest son and my daughter went to Poland.</span> <span id="s210">I couldn't go back to Aushwitz.</span> <span id="s211">I couldn't go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s212">I remember incident when my father was _______ was stopped by Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s213">He stood in front of him.</span> <span id="s214">He took his hat off in front of him.</span> <span id="s215">And whatever the Polish policeman said you'd say, "Yes, sir, yes, sir."</span> <span id="s216">And I stood a little boy holding my father.</span> <span id="s217">And I could not, I said to my wife, I could not stand, as a free man, for somebody call me again what they called me originally, so I rather not go because I might get in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: When you became reunited with your cousin and the other surviving family members can you tell me what that reunion was like and what you spoke about?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, first of all, the cousin who was looking for her husband, they finally got together.</span> <span id="s220">They were sweethearts before the war and it was quite, you know--as a matter of fact, she lost her husband in the '67 War.</span> <span id="s221">Whenever we come to Israel, she is a widow like he died yesterday.</span> <span id="s222">She takes us today to his grave and so on.</span> <span id="s223">So that was nice to have somebody.</span> <span id="s224">There was a uncle by marriage but, you know, those days, you know, we kind of kept together.</span> <span id="s225">We needed each other.</span> <span id="s226">There was a group of people and were organized like a Jewish committee and, as a matter of fact, the Jewish community was the richest one.</span> <span id="s227">A small incident.</span> <span id="s228">A lady who lived in Richard Wagner's home went downstairs in the basement and they found big wooden boxes full of silver.</span> <span id="s229">So the poor woman has been trying to make a living, was making ice cream.</span> <span id="s230">And so she would sell the ice cream with expensive Wagner, Richard Wagner silverware, was one of the things.</span> <span id="s231">But we had a, like a community-like.</span> <span id="s232">We got together and, you know, we were given from Germans different special treatments like.</span> <span id="s233">They actually, you know, they give you nice homes and so on.</span> <span id="s234">But unlike other places, people stay in their barracks and they would stay in those barracks, because when I went to Bayreuth I lived in a nice villa and everybody has nice villa so it actually wasn't such a trauma like other people had, where they had been behind barbed wires and living in barracks and so for.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So are you telling me you were never in a DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No.</span> <span id="s237">No.</span> <span id="s238">The only one, I was in that women's prison and I couldn't stand because I've seen those bars, I figured that's not the place for me, and I went down and I met the Polish, Polish soldier from Chicago, spoke Polish and so forth, and then my cousin came in and I moved out.</span> <span id="s239">So I didn't have such a bad experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you have any reunions with other people that you met before or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Definitely yes.</span> <span id="s242">We--I met a young woman in Ryswick, and there was no touching.</span> <span id="s243">I, you know, I always was mechanically inclined.</span> <span id="s244">I realized when I came first day in prison camp that people with some kind of know-how have more of a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s245">And I was always a kid that was mechanically inclined, always doing, making something and so forth.</span> <span id="s246">So I want to describe my first, my first day when I came to the, to that new camp.</span> <span id="s247">Can I describe my first experience when I came to prison camp?</span> <span id="s248">I remember when I was, I was--I escaped one time, before they sent me to Germany.</span> <span id="s249">In Germany I jumped, escaped from school where they kept me before they sent us to prison camps.</span> <span id="s250">And I was, I was caught and they put me to the bad prison.</span> <span id="s251">And ?</span> <span id="s252">misloyalty?</span> <span id="s253">put me in solitary.</span> <span id="s254">That was the most horrible part of my experience.</span> <span id="s255">Slide you down.</span> <span id="s256">You can't fight.</span> <span id="s257">And they serve you food in a bucket down there.</span> <span id="s258">There is no room to sit down, to stand up.</span> <span id="s259">You just rest your buttocks on the one part they cut out and your knees on the other.</span> <span id="s260">You hear screams all the time.</span> <span id="s261">It's night all the time because there is no sun.</span> <span id="s262">I don't know how I got through it.</span> <span id="s263">And I--they pulled me up on the chain.</span> <span id="s264">I really didn't feel sorry for myself but I was thinking about my mother, she should see that I'm walking in my leg chains, and I figured she, she wouldn't believe that.</span> <span id="s265">But instead of Aushwitz they send me to the big prison camp, Resamay (ph).</span> <span id="s266">And my older, my older brother, he came back from prison camp.</span> <span id="s267">Was a dentist.</span> <span id="s268">They sent him back.</span> <span id="s269">And he was telling me who he knew, who he met, and I remember he was telling about they using a ________+, Demarek (ph).</span> <span id="s270">But here I am in a prison, a huge prison, about 10-, 15,000 prisoners, and I see Demarek walking by.</span> <span id="s271">So I yelled out to him, "Herr Demarek."</span> <span id="s272">He was a German youth.</span> <span id="s273">Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s274">If he remembers we were friends or were on the same room with my older brother.</span> <span id="s275">He said, "Come sie here, come sie here."</span> <span id="s276">He came in, took me to his barracks, right away gave me a bowl of soup, and he says, "I know a good prison camp, I'll send you."</span> <span id="s277">I didn't know I already was bought.</span> <span id="s278">There's a guy who called the Lumen.</span> <span id="s279">This guy was like limping one leg.</span> <span id="s280">He would buy like blocks of people, like 500 people for different kind of factories.</span> <span id="s281">I was bought already, sold to him, but he says, "I know a good prison camp, I'll send you."</span> <span id="s282">And he put me on that list.</span> <span id="s283">And I remember I came to that prison camp, came at night, all the dogs and lights, and it was quite an experience coming first prison camp.</span> <span id="s284">And I went next day, they put me in the pick and shovel.</span> <span id="s285">And I never held a pick and shovel in my hand, so at the end of the day I had blisters on my hands, and had just blisters here, I had blisters between my fingers, and I knew next day they kill me, they hit you over the head.</span> <span id="s286">I remember even the company I worked for was Bengera (ph).</span> <span id="s287">So I had a friend, she was actually a friend of my older brother, Wola zu Polska.</span> <span id="s288">And I walked over--she worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s289">I walked over to the window and I says, "Wola, tomorrow will be my last day because they going to kill me, I can't hold a shovel."</span> <span id="s290">So she knew someone that put me in the sick room.</span> <span id="s291">And they apparently afraid some infectious diseases so they make like a fever and they put some kind of grease on my hands.</span> <span id="s292">And then she said, "Can you do something else?"</span> <span id="s293">I said, "I will do anything."</span> <span id="s294">So they looked for steam roll operator.</span> <span id="s295">I was a kid.</span> <span id="s296">I have seen a steam roller operate, I never operated one.</span> <span id="s297">So I came over and the German came in, said, "You a steam roll operator?"</span> <span id="s298">I says, "Really, I don't know how to operate."</span> <span id="s299">He says, "You must be honest Jew because only Jews only lie."</span> <span id="s300">So he showed me how to use it.</span> <span id="s301">And that was one nice thing.</span> <span id="s302">I didn't--I got away from the shovel.</span> <span id="s303">That's when I realized from then on I must be some kind of value because otherwise you will never go on the list.</span> <span id="s304">When you stay with a pick and shovel you don't have no chance to survive.</span> <span id="s305">At the incident with the steam roller, the steam roller had--like today hard drive brakes--had mechanical brakes.</span> <span id="s306">I had to push very hard to stop the steam roller and to turn, some turn it to the left and right.</span> <span id="s307">And the steam roller is a very heavy piece of machinery and here I go down the hill, straining myself, pushing the steam roller and trying to make a right turn at the same time.</span> <span id="s308">I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s309">I went straight.</span> <span id="s310">So the German took the shovel, hit over the wheel and broke the shovel off so he had just a handle, and he kept hitting me as hard as he could and all I could do is put my hands over my head, protect my head, and the guard stood there with a gun just waiting for me to make next--any move.</span> <span id="s311">He kept hitting until he got tired.</span> <span id="s312">He knocked my front teeth, he knocked my forehead, he knocked my front lip, and I thought I lost an eye.</span> <span id="s313">The eye was like this.</span> <span id="s314">And next day I came to work like nothing to it, you know, with one eye, and I worked for that company for a while and even the guy who hit me, sometimes he couldn't eat, he'd point out with his eye where he had a piece of bread or something for me to eat.</span> <span id="s315">So you can't figure this thing out.</span> <span id="s316">And then we finish the road and they build a factory.</span> <span id="s317">So they, they were looking for welders.</span> <span id="s318">So I found somebody who was older.</span> <span id="s319">He was a welder from home.</span> <span id="s320">I said, "Will you please show me."</span> <span id="s321">So he showed me how to do weld and I became a welder.</span> <span id="s322">And a good welder.</span> <span id="s323">When we turn on the steam I had hardly a leak.</span> <span id="s324">It was huge big pipes, like three feet in diameter, and you climb on ladders and you weld up, you know, like a makeshift ladders and so on.</span> <span id="s325">And I remember I would lay a bead.</span> <span id="s326">That means it looks like a machine, piece of machinery.</span> <span id="s327">The German always liked my work, the way I laid the bead nicely.</span> <span id="s328">And then they came in and turned on the steam, you know, everybody would get praises or yelled at you because you didn't a good job.</span> <span id="s329">I hardly had a single leak.</span> <span id="s330">And then this finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Before I let you continue I had, I wanted to ask you or I had asked you if there was feelings you had after the war for someone that you had during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, after the factory was built, everything was finished, they were looking for sewing machines.</span> <span id="s333">I said, yes, my grandmother had.</span> <span id="s334">So by that I was given electric car and I was able to move in the part of the factory where the women used to work.</span> <span id="s335">Other people could not.</span> <span id="s336">I had, you know, prior to movement I used to pick up materials on factory and back and forth, and I start talking to the young woman.</span> <span id="s337">There was no touching, God forbid.</span> <span id="s338">But we used to take a cement bag, old cement bag, write a letter, throw it to her, and she would throw it to me or somebody else.</span> <span id="s339">See, women used to work three shifts, eight times three.</span> <span id="s340">Men used to work 12-hour shifts.</span> <span id="s341">So once in awhile we would go to work and the women would come back, we would wave at each other.</span> <span id="s342">And at one time there was open--no, that was before the access came.</span> <span id="s343">They would open the gate and I would talk to her or sometimes they would let us come into the fence.</span> <span id="s344">There was a dividing fence between us, men and women.</span> <span id="s345">I would talk to her.</span> <span id="s346">And I told her, said, you know--whatever I said, I didn't believe I am going to survive.</span> <span id="s347">I said--I was young.</span> <span id="s348">I said to her, "After the war we'll get married."</span> <span id="s349">And I can't remember.</span> <span id="s350">I remember on the, we went on the wagon, on a transport wagon.</span> <span id="s351">Helen was so--the men was in one wagon so she jumped from the other wagon to be close.</span> <span id="s352">And we didn't get, we didn't receive any food, any kind of provision.</span> <span id="s353">We just lucky.</span> <span id="s354">We were open cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s355">There was snow.</span> <span id="s356">We drink the snow, and we had some kind of--you know, at least you got water, you can survive.</span> <span id="s357">And there were--we went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s358">The people really, they were very brave to stay on the bridges and throw some bread, because they were shot at.</span> <span id="s359">So I am always resourceful.</span> <span id="s360">Rather than fight with everybody--and can you imagine when you throw a bread between 50 people who are hungry.</span> <span id="s361">But, so I sat on the edge, high up on the edge on the train, on the cattle car, cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s362">Somebody was holding my leg and when they throw bread I caught the bread in mid-air.</span> <span id="s363">And I, I wanted to give to Helen half the bread.</span> <span id="s364">But you cannot throw the bread over to other side, give it to Helen.</span> <span id="s365">Everybody's hungry.</span> <span id="s366">You'll never get it.</span> <span id="s367">So she lean over one side.</span> <span id="s368">The train was moving.</span> <span id="s369">I lean over another side.</span> <span id="s370">And we were long time with holding out to stretch your arm and I threw the bread, and of course she didn't catch it.</span> <span id="s371">She was never forgiven for that.</span> <span id="s372">But that was one time episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: We're going to have to pause now while I flip the tape and then you can continue.</span> <span id="s374">Just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">(Pause to change tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s376">[Technical comments]</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And you were telling me about your encounter with the woman that was eventually to become your wife, and I'd like you to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Well, we were separated in Flossenburg, in Rheinsberg, excuse me, and I was sent to the terrible prison camp at Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s379">And I was staying on Sunday, listen to the church bells down the valley, and I was looking at the moon and I was thinking what happened to her, was she alive.</span> <span id="s380">Well, it was so cold.</span> <span id="s381">And I realized that I won't be living long so I been volunteering for work outside.</span> <span id="s382">And of course I was sent that time to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s383">Regensburg.</span> <span id="s384">And the Allies, unknown to us, were coming.</span> <span id="s385">We were walking nights and resting daytime.</span> <span id="s386">And of course, you know, coming back I was found by someone.</span> <span id="s387">Now, after my cousin found me we were in Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s388">Helen, in the meantime, coming from Poland, following a street car, some former cop, I remember she said she saw me in Prague.</span> <span id="s389">So she yelled at them, she told them that I am alive.</span> <span id="s390">So Helen knew I was alive.</span> <span id="s391">And then on my trip back somebody said that she was, too, told me that she was alive and she was in Prague.</span> <span id="s392">You know, people see each other.</span> <span id="s393">So the next time I was going to Prague they were housing some refugees where used to have stalls for horses.</span> <span id="s394">They were huge, big barns like for horses and some people would lay there on the hay or some--I just remember open up the big gate and yell, I said, "Helen, Helen."</span> <span id="s395">Some people there say, "No, nobody here by that name."</span> <span id="s396">And, anyhow, circumstances got so that Helen found out where I was, so she sent me a note that she is in, right in Oberhaus, would I like to see her.</span> <span id="s397">She herself didn't know after all we were engaged or, you know, there was no kissing, no touching, no nothing.</span> <span id="s398">And I tell you, a young person, you know, a young person, even circumstances like this, you think ?</span> <span id="s399">ank?</span> <span id="s400">?</span> <span id="s401">nolow?</span> <span id="s402">.</span> <span id="s403">And so I was away and I came in that weekend and I got dressed and I boarded a train, and on the train I found somebody who knew the town.</span> <span id="s404">He took me in.</span> <span id="s405">And in those days the curfew, all the doorways to the apartment always locked.</span> <span id="s406">So somebody came with me, and Helen had dropped the key to open the gate.</span> <span id="s407">They say, "You know who is here, follow me."</span> <span id="s408">She got so excited she couldn't find the key.</span> <span id="s409">So, anyhow, we met and embraced.</span> <span id="s410">And I told her again, I said, "I would like to get married."</span> <span id="s411">And that watch which I traded for my motorcycle I gave her as well.</span> <span id="s412">That was a big thing.</span> <span id="s413">And we kept on courting ourselves.</span> <span id="s414">I had that uncle by marriage.</span> <span id="s415">He left, he left to America.</span> <span id="s416">Apparently he had some relatives here.</span> <span id="s417">And he didn't think I should get married, that I am too young for it.</span> <span id="s418">So after he left, I was by myself, I said I'm master of my destiny, so we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s419">Got married in '47.</span> <span id="s420">And Helen's family had somebody who was strictly Orthodox so I had to run and get pots and pans, Kosher pots and pans, but the sad part, you know, Helen cooked all the food.</span> <span id="s421">We didn't have caterers.</span> <span id="s422">And the pots and pans.</span> <span id="s423">And so, and I brought up Helen--I had some money.</span> <span id="s424">I bought right after the war a big junk yard.</span> <span id="s425">But Helen says, "No, you are not going to live in Germany."</span> <span id="s426">So I sold the junk yard.</span> <span id="s427">And I had on, in the junk yard a car from Hermann Goering, burnt up inside.</span> <span id="s428">And the only thing I pulled out before I sold it, the Hermann Goering car.</span> <span id="s429">And the Russians, who would buy anything had four wheels and a steering, so I restored the car.</span> <span id="s430">I drove up to Hof.</span> <span id="s431">That was the German border.</span> <span id="s432">And I got a lots of old German marks.</span> <span id="s433">I came in loaded.</span> <span id="s434">But that's how we got, we had money to get married.</span> <span id="s435">Because you have to remember, after the war there was no food and anything you had on the rations wasn't enough, so you had to pay a lot of money if you want to get married.</span> <span id="s436">So finally after work, both days we were fasting, of course.</span> <span id="s437">That's traditional.</span> <span id="s438">Before you get married you fast all day long.</span> <span id="s439">And under the huppah those days the tradition was to take ____________ to pray for the dead, which was hard.</span> <span id="s440">We were surviving by the UNRRA, who had given powdered eggs, powdered milk.</span> <span id="s441">And those days there were, there were lines.</span> <span id="s442">So what the really funny part of it, what you do first, you jump in the line, then you ask what the line is for.</span> <span id="s443">Because you actually need everything.</span> <span id="s444">Sometimes would have toilet paper.</span> <span id="s445">You get two.</span> <span id="s446">Well, first you get in line.</span> <span id="s447">You don't want to go in line--I was on business in Munich and there is a long line, so I jump the line.</span> <span id="s448">What's the line for?</span> <span id="s449">The line is to register for America.</span> <span id="s450">So I stood and I registered.</span> <span id="s451">And sure enough three more--you got to realize, we were liberated there was no Israel, America the doors were closed and, you know, nobody wants to live--after the Pogroms in Poland people were coming from Poland--nobody wanted to stay in the god forsaken camps.</span> <span id="s452">And so, well, there was nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s453">There was--President Truman was a great president.</span> <span id="s454">He sign in a law to send in a hundred thousand dispersed persons.</span> <span id="s455">That doesn't mean just Jews.</span> <span id="s456">There were all kinds nationalities.</span> <span id="s457">We came on that corridor.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: While you were still in Europe, before I had you coming to the United States, you mentioned that you got some help from the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s459">Were there any other organizations that offered you any help by way of food assistance or educational assistance or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: We--I went to school for a while, technical school, and I remember we had our teacher from a big factory from--he was in cell completely, he run away from the Russian front and he was teaching us.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: You want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">(Recess taken.)</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You asked for a break and we're back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yeah, actually that was a, organized by the ORC school, and I had some technical training there.</span> <span id="s465">That helped a lot when I came to this country.</span> <span id="s466">I had some kind of idea about technical work and so on.</span> <span id="s467">And--.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Labor Day 1949.</span> <span id="s470">September the 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Before I have you leaving Europe and telling about your experiences in the United States I wanted to ask you about two events that occurred while you were still in Europe.</span> <span id="s472">The Nuremburg trials.</span> <span id="s473">I want to know how closely you followed the Nuremberg trials and what were your thoughts during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: During the Nuremberg trials I was following closely but somehow I felt that they were given a fair trial but all our people never got any kind of fair trial.</span> <span id="s475">I felt it wasn't fair for those people who killed millions of people get a fair trial with lawyers and so on.</span> <span id="s476">Somehow or other I felt it was so unjust that they can, they can have attorneys and they can blame everybody else except themselves.</span> <span id="s477">I was really angry.</span> <span id="s478">I was following, yes, but I didn't understand American justice then, the American way of life, and I just, I just felt they should be just string up, but that is not the way it is, but at that time I had different kind, I had no idea about justice, you know, because when I left Poland we have different kinds of laws and regulations, different kind of way of justice.</span> <span id="s479">Kind of felt funny for me that they treated them in a nicer manner, nobody gets hit and they get nasty.</span> <span id="s480">Throughout all the time I was angry really that they getting somehow trial, asking questions, they have chance to blame somebody else, not themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Did you feel that justice was served by the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I can't even understand how justice could be served.</span> <span id="s483">Actually those people committed the most heinous crimes the world ever knew, that they, men, women, children, and murder them in such a brutal way.</span> <span id="s484">I, I really, I really--even to hang these people wasn't good enough for me.</span> <span id="s485">A lot of people blame the older generation, not the younger generation.</span> <span id="s486">I felt they should suffer for a long time what they did to us.</span> <span id="s487">Maybe it's not right to blame the younger generation but I just cannot forget, cannot forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Also while you were still in Europe there was a U.N. debate about the partition of Palestine and also the birth of the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s489">I would like to ask you to reflect upon that experience, those experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I remember it was announced establishment, 1948, the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s491">I remember as a kid that belonged to Zionist organization talking about Palestine was talking about going to the moon.</span> <span id="s492">It was so far away, something I couldn't believe could ever, ever materialize.</span> <span id="s493">It was, it was such a, a, such a far away thing to, even to think about that could be possible.</span> <span id="s494">So when they announce the establishing a State of Israel I'm kind of believe it and didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s495">It was such a utopia, you know, the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s496">How could it be really?</span> <span id="s497">Would the Gentile world allow something like this?</span> <span id="s498">But I myself, when I speak to children, I always tell them even living in America we are part of Israel, we have someone we can be proud, they establish and they establish themself with all the technology and everything else.</span> <span id="s499">I give them a lot of credit.</span> <span id="s500">But at that time I decided to come to America and so, you know, we decide to go to America, not to Israel.</span> <span id="s501">So that's the way we want to do.</span> <span id="s502">Israel at that time, things were hard to get and so on and I felt I've been through such a horror, maybe I can have a better life.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Did you have to take any tests, any medical tests or intelligence tests or anything like that before you could come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No.</span> <span id="s505">I didn't have--only thing I had a bad experience, before we came to United States we had to have x-rays, whether have tuberculosis, so on.</span> <span id="s506">And I, apparently I slept with a lot of people with tuberculosis and I had some marks on my lungs.</span> <span id="s507">In those days they had like a .35 millimeter small film.</span> <span id="s508">When I am came to Hamburg they saw those and they told me I can't enter United States.</span> <span id="s509">So I have to go back and make a big blow-up, a big picture, and everybody said wasn't tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s510">And there was a little bit of trauma too because I felt that something happened I can't go, although when you go to Israel your mother take everybody and to America you just could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What were your expectations of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I really--when I came to America we had $20 between us but I, I seen it was a open world and I never felt poor.</span> <span id="s513">I was, I had so much zest to work and I felt good.</span> <span id="s514">I came to the Jewish Refugee Service Agency, which was a great thing.</span> <span id="s515">That's one of my favorite, favorite charities.</span> <span id="s516">They really, it really means a lot.</span> <span id="s517">A child, like Jewish Refugee Service Agency, when you come they gave me, everyone, they gave me $30 a week.</span> <span id="s518">It's such an enormous thing when you come, I have ______.</span> <span id="s519">And after three months I could not take anymore.</span> <span id="s520">I wasn't raised that way and I said I need a job.</span> <span id="s521">I went on construction.</span> <span id="s522">And I worked pronto.</span> <span id="s523">Everybody liked my work.</span> <span id="s524">As a matter of fact, later on I became a journeyman, a journeyman, plumbing journeyman.</span> <span id="s525">I went to school here and I became a master plumber here.</span> <span id="s526">But when I was German I used to run the big jobs.</span> <span id="s527">I was the foreman, the foreman of the job, and I met some people was building homes.</span> <span id="s528">And those days homes were like $16,000 which was to me a mountain of money.</span> <span id="s529">So was great and sitting and talking to the builder I said, you know, Mr.--name was Berman (ph).</span> <span id="s530">I said, "You know, Mr. Berman, I never build before a house like that, $16,000, my God."</span> <span id="s531">So he says, "You know," I says, "I'm start building a new, new part of my building experience and I will always make sure that you get a home."</span> <span id="s532">I remember he came in, showed me the blueprints, "Pick any house you like."</span> <span id="s533">"Well, I'll take a lot."</span> <span id="s534">He said, "I'll make sure that you have a down payment."</span> <span id="s535">He gave me a slip of paper that I gave a down payment, but actually he did.</span> <span id="s536">He did not give salesman's commission.</span> <span id="s537">He gave me his commission rather than that.</span> <span id="s538">And the plumbing company let me do my own plumbing.</span> <span id="s539">I did my own plumbing in the house so I had a certain discount on the house.</span> <span id="s540">Then I even didn't have any labor.</span> <span id="s541">I dug my own ditches and my wife and my oldest son were holding the light till midnight.</span> <span id="s542">I was doing my own plumbing.</span> <span id="s543">I have so much zest, I want to have a house.</span> <span id="s544">That was a big thing, I felt, you know.</span> <span id="s545">But in America money talks.</span> <span id="s546">So I became a master plumber, I couldn't get financing.</span> <span id="s547">And I knew I had to build my family and build something and you cannot build when you work for someone.</span> <span id="s548">So I decided somewhere or other I got to go in business.</span> <span id="s549">So one Sunday morning I looked up in the paper.</span> <span id="s550">And, by the way, we got first money from Germany.</span> <span id="s551">I got $2,000 and Helen got $2,000.</span> <span id="s552">I didn't want to risk Helen's $2,000 so I risk mine.</span> <span id="s553">And I went down there and there was a service station.</span> <span id="s554">The guy asked me how much money I have.</span> <span id="s555">I say I got $2,000.</span> <span id="s556">Those days was enough to buy a load of gas.</span> <span id="s557">Monday noontime I called Helen, I went in business.</span> <span id="s558">And I worked very hard at it.</span> <span id="s559">I went to school again.</span> <span id="s560">I became a master mechanic again.</span> <span id="s561">I went to repair cars.</span> <span id="s562">And from there the people saw, who were running the oil company, that I am able person.</span> <span id="s563">They gave me in a better neighborhood, a bigger station.</span> <span id="s564">And I made success of it.</span> <span id="s565">I start to rebuild different things.</span> <span id="s566">I became a rebuilder in addition to station.</span> <span id="s567">I became with Triple A and I became inspection station.</span> <span id="s568">I did all these things.</span> <span id="s569">As a matter of fact, I worked so hard the first 10 years, I used to get up 5:30 in the morning, get home seven o'clock for dinner, went back, stayed till 11:30 at night.</span> <span id="s570">It caught up with me.</span> <span id="s571">Driving, I lost consciousness and they took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s572">What actually happened to me, I slept through the whole week.</span> <span id="s573">I was so much short on my, you know, sleeping.</span> <span id="s574">I work so many hours, my nights were very short, my days were very long.</span> <span id="s575">But then I realize that, you know, I am not made out of steel.</span> <span id="s576">So from then on I was going home six o'clock.</span> <span id="s577">I told my help don't call me unless the house is on fire.</span> <span id="s578">But, see, being married to Helen, she kept my books, she kept up my morale when I started up.</span> <span id="s579">You know, when you started up on a string you, you really don't know how things going to work out.</span> <span id="s580">You worry you might lose it.</span> <span id="s581">And she kept my morale.</span> <span id="s582">In the beginning she used to come in and she used to bring me parts if I needed parts.</span> <span id="s583">I mean, she was a great help all these years.</span> <span id="s584">And she, she was a good housekeeper.</span> <span id="s585">She was--we had respect each other.</span> <span id="s586">We had a good life together.</span> <span id="s587">We brought up three nice kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: You are running ahead of me but I am going to back you up a little bit because you're giving me too much too fast.</span> <span id="s589">When you first came to this country, I wanted to ask you if you spoke any English and if not how you learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: When I came first to this country all I understood, yes and no.</span> <span id="s591">Was hard because when you, on the construction those people think that you are not a normal person because you don't speak and they would pick on you.</span> <span id="s592">So instead sitting in the shed eating with everybody else, like rain or something, I would go outside, because it was very hard.</span> <span id="s593">Many times I got home, I said to Helen, you know, I never understand English, because it sounded wah, wah, wah, wah.</span> <span id="s594">As a matter of fact, I worked with some people from North Carolina I couldn't understand them now when they speak.</span> <span id="s595">And so, but all of a sudden--in the beginning it just goes in one ear, comes out the other.</span> <span id="s596">All of a sudden it gets in your brain, just like that.</span> <span id="s597">As a matter of fact, I spoke, whenever I went with Helen Helen would stay behind and say "you speak."</span> <span id="s598">Now it's reverse.</span> <span id="s599">But then I was, you know, in construction.</span> <span id="s600">I spoke English.</span> <span id="s601">Then we made some friends.</span> <span id="s602">We met some young couples.</span> <span id="s603">They took us under care, showed us how to, how to manage money, how to cook American way, how to live American way, which meant a lot to us.</span> <span id="s604">We made some friends from Austria.</span> <span id="s605">Came from Buffalo, all over, young people came to this town to start a new life.</span> <span id="s606">Young married couples.</span> <span id="s607">We was there like a toy.</span> <span id="s608">There was one person who was from Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s609">He spoke Jewish.</span> <span id="s610">So we spoke to him Jewish, he translates to the other guys in English.</span> <span id="s611">It was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s612">I was very much preoccupied with wrestling.</span> <span id="s613">So the guy that had a television, he let me watch the wrestling.</span> <span id="s614">So on the first anniversary we came here they made me a cake with written down--at that time there was big wrestler was Mr. America.</span> <span id="s615">They cut Mr. America.</span> <span id="s616">And for Helen, we brought an old iron.</span> <span id="s617">The girls couldn't understand because they--your family must have real muscle over there.</span> <span id="s618">It was, you know, real heavy iron.</span> <span id="s619">So they felt sorry for Helen to schlep that heavy iron, they got us on our first anniversary an electric iron.</span> <span id="s620">But then we went to Americanization school for a year and, you know, when you have some education you can learn another language.</span> <span id="s621">Our education was interrupted but still we had education.</span> <span id="s622">So we started to pick up some Yiddish papers.</span> <span id="s623">We weren't fluent.</span> <span id="s624">So we were going to try some.</span> <span id="s625">People that had Hebrew, we want to have some news.</span> <span id="s626">So we picked up some Yiddish papers.</span> <span id="s627">We slowly got fluent with that.</span> <span id="s628">And then with, in school, the school was great because they did not--they forced us to talk English, they did not talk any other language to us.</span> <span id="s629">You had to learn.</span> <span id="s630">And it was great.</span> <span id="s631">And even when I had, between our friends, between the job, we really master our language pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: When you came to this country did Americans ever ask you about your experiences in Europe and in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s634">We met a German couple from Austria.</span> <span id="s635">I want to point it out that it felt so far-fetched that if we told people what we went through people felt they were like make up story.</span> <span id="s636">How can be possibly something like this?</span> <span id="s637">People really--and we stopped talking about it.</span> <span id="s638">We were talking something unbelievable, nobody can understand.</span> <span id="s639">The best example I have, we met that couple from Austria, and mother didn't send her _______ but she sent her furniture.</span> <span id="s640">They lost a lot there.</span> <span id="s641">But she didn't realize yet the extent of it.</span> <span id="s642">And we're talking, the name is ______.</span> <span id="s643">We tell her, all the time we spoke through a German man, we are telling her all these things.</span> <span id="s644">She did not, she did not get the complete picture what we were saying.</span> <span id="s645">But 10 years later, or less, they decided to go back to Austria, Vienna.</span> <span id="s646">They flew to Europe and they bought a car and they would drive.</span> <span id="s647">And they are driving from Munich and all the way to Munich there is a sign: Dachau 33 kilometers.</span> <span id="s648">She said, "Sam, make a right turn, let's go see."</span> <span id="s649">The difference is the people when they say and they touch they have more pain understanding.</span> <span id="s650">That's how the Holocaust Museum actually is very important.</span> <span id="s651">It's, best example, when she comes back to the States she called Helen crying and apologizing.</span> <span id="s652">What she saw actually, you know, when she saw it so many years later Dauchau was all cleaned up, but still, she saw the ovens, she saw all these things.</span> <span id="s653">She apologized that she did not understand what we were saying.</span> <span id="s654">She felt very bad and she cried, she apologized.</span> <span id="s655">Now she knew.</span> <span id="s656">So for long time we didn't talk.</span> <span id="s657">Helen had a number, want to take it off because with a woman have a tattoo you look like you committed some kind of crime, but a man nobody pay attention.</span> <span id="s658">And somebody ask me to take it off.</span> <span id="s659">I wear it with pride right now.</span> <span id="s660">But it was very hard in the beginning to tell people our story.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Tell me about your family.</span> <span id="s662">You have children.</span> <span id="s663">I'd like to know when they were born and how you chose their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Our children were born and we did not press too much on our past.</span> <span id="s665">We also, maybe a mistake, we didn't speak to them in Yiddish or our mother tongue, in the Polish.</span> <span id="s666">We didn't want to sound like they are foreigners in this country when we spoke with them.</span> <span id="s667">But our oldest one, he is very intelligent kid from the begin with.</span> <span id="s668">He knew, he read, but he didn't ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s669">Once in awhile he asked some questions.</span> <span id="s670">But all my children grew up nice human being, contribute so much, you know, to--is good people, intelligent people.</span> <span id="s671">They are all professionals.</span> <span id="s672">There's one thing in my house, there was no question, everybody is going to have high education.</span> <span id="s673">All was spread up.</span> <span id="s674">Everybody read newspapers.</span> <span id="s675">We are all avid readers.</span> <span id="s676">And, you know, it's a background we came from.</span> <span id="s677">We had families, we had parents, we had grandparents, great grandparents.</span> <span id="s678">My mother and father were involved in different kind of charities.</span> <span id="s679">You know, we were not, so we were not just coming from any home.</span> <span id="s680">So same thing, we made a home, we build a family, we gave them a good home, we make sure we knew always where the kids are, and so, we're retired now and we enjoy our--they're all adults with families and we enjoy them very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You haven't told me their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: My oldest son, Dr. Harvey Luksenburg, doctor of pathology/oncology.</span> <span id="s683">My youngest son, Stanley Luksenburg, he's a doctor of podiatry.</span> <span id="s684">He lives in Cleveland, Ohio, has two lovely kids.</span> <span id="s685">My youngest daughter is 31, Amy Luksenburg Strachman.</span> <span id="s686">She is attorney.</span> <span id="s687">She got three kids.</span> <span id="s688">And she became very religious, which I--very nice because my father was a religious man.</span> <span id="s689">And she got a good life and nice family.</span> <span id="s690">I really, whatever I got left I'm just, I'm thankful to United States Government and the people who gave us a chance.</span> <span id="s691">Me--not for just me, for my kids, because in Poland my kids would never had opportunities if we came back.</span> <span id="s692">It's a great country.</span> <span id="s693">We treasure it.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I'm not sure I understand something you said a moment ago.</span> <span id="s695">Did you speak to your children about your experiences in Europe?</span> <span id="s696">What did you tell your children about your life even before the war?</span> <span id="s697">And kind of go into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Well, we're telling them slowly, once they are growing up, because they've seen the tattoos and they would ask questions.</span> <span id="s699">And when they were young we tell them why don't you wait until you get a little older, it's not a nice story, we'll tell you when you get older.</span> <span id="s700">And we told them.</span> <span id="s701">And they knew, they never seen, they never had a grandmother.</span> <span id="s702">My children grew up without grandparents, which really I feel bad for them.</span> <span id="s703">Everybody, you know, every child should have a grandparent.</span> <span id="s704">I know my grandson come in, he jumps on me.</span> <span id="s705">And they missed it.</span> <span id="s706">They don't have any grandparents.</span> <span id="s707">None of my children had grandparents.</span> <span id="s708">But they took it in stride and they grew up nice people.</span> <span id="s709">And I'm really thankful for them and they, you know, we keep close touch and they keep close touch with each other.</span> <span id="s710">And me and my wife enjoy going, visiting.</span> <span id="s711">That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You were in this country during some big changes.</span> <span id="s713">You were here during the Korean War and the Vietnamese War and for the conflict with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s714">Did you have any comments that you want to make about what you saw and experienced in this country with respect to those events?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Well, being citizen of this country, I felt whatever this country does, I felt, you know, it's right, because they're leader of the world and they, you know, the men on the street got rights but other countries did not.</span> <span id="s716">And I felt bad, especially on the Vietnam War, because I realized that we really don't fight for the Vietnamese, we really were fighting communism there, the spread of communism.</span> <span id="s717">I remember telling about the domino theory and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s718">I did not want to be against my government because I, I always treasure and appreciate what they done for me.</span> <span id="s719">So I felt that this government, my government, decides to go to Vietnam, although it's wrong, but I would not do anything against my government.</span> <span id="s720">I was, I want to be exemplary citizen and even though my heart I felt wasn't right, but I felt this country was good to me and I would never speak out about this, my government United States, no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You were also here during the civil rights movement and the women's movement.</span> <span id="s722">Did you as a survivor have any thoughts on those experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s724">Definitely.</span> <span id="s725">Civil rights movement, I had bad experience because when I came to this country I came to the country of the free.</span> <span id="s726">I came to the people's drugstore and the counter, I could sit down, have a cup of coffee; the black man next to me could only have to go.</span> <span id="s727">I really questioned it and I really felt bad.</span> <span id="s728">Absolutely every--just like me, I always felt should have a place in the sun, so other people should have a place in the sun.</span> <span id="s729">I'm really, absolutely I'm glad the way things turned out that everybody gets more and more rights.</span> <span id="s730">As long as it's not being abused then everybody should have the right to choose, the right to vote, and that's the only way intelligent civilized people should go.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: I'm going to pause now and change a tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">(Pause to change tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s733">[Technical comments]</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: I wanted to ask you what else has been of interest or concern to you in your years in this country, besides the wars and social movements that we discussed.</span> <span id="s735">Is there anything else that sticks in your mind that was of particular interest to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Really, particular interest to me is Israel.</span> <span id="s737">I would like to see the day, literal day when Israel will be in peace.</span> <span id="s738">Although I love this country, I am part of this country, Israel is also part of me, and all I go through, all the pain, all the death, I feel it.</span> <span id="s739">I--that's actually my favorite charity.</span> <span id="s740">I support them in every way I can because my friends, some family still live there, and they need some peace too, and I feel for them.</span> <span id="s741">Interested in this country?</span> <span id="s742">Yes, I am interested make sure that something like that would never happen again.</span> <span id="s743">There's all kinds of denials in this country and I want to make sure and that's the reason I feel that somebody up there wanted me to live to be the eyewitness.</span> <span id="s744">I work as a volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s745">I talk to people, let them touch me.</span> <span id="s746">It makes so much impression.</span> <span id="s747">I tell the people who come, especially young people, to the Holocaust Museum, and I am a survivor of the Holocaust, I tell them what I have seen, what I have heard, all the truths, and they some day, after I will be gone, they will still remember they spoke to a Holocaust survivor who had been to hell and back.</span> <span id="s748">I, I really feel that I, by doing so, speak to children, work at the museum.</span> <span id="s749">I do it not only service for the Jewish people, service for all mankind that something like this should not happen not only to the Jewish people and the others, I really feel whatever any kind genocide being committed all over the world, I feel it personally.</span> <span id="s750">When I read the paper I don't just turn the page, I feel the pain.</span> <span id="s751">I understand what's going on.</span> <span id="s752">And I'm very much concerned, very much concerned what's going on in Russia.</span> <span id="s753">I am afraid because people are hungry, things are unjust for them, and they might turn again, became again some kind of communist or whatever, fascist power come to power and then we start all over again.</span> <span id="s754">I'm concerned about the whole world what's going on.</span> <span id="s755">I read the paper and I'm interested what's happening in this world.</span> <span id="s756">And I hope that people, especially I'm concerned what's going on with the weapons of mass destruction.</span> <span id="s757">I am afraid some crazy people some day, they'll be glad to jump in the grave knowing they take a million people with them.</span> <span id="s758">I would like to see ban all these weapons of mass destruction.</span> <span id="s759">Otherwise it's no future for, not my children, for children other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Have you experienced any anti-Semitism in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes, I have experienced some anti-Semitism in this country.</span> <span id="s762">When I work on construction those people don't know I was Jewish and they would, you know, point out to me various jokes.</span> <span id="s763">I used to get fired.</span> <span id="s764">When you come in on construction you are the last man to go.</span> <span id="s765">I wasn't the last man to go, I was fired because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">I also own some property and of course all my tenants know I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s767">And I one most exemplary landlord because mostly people invite me, come in, have a glass of wine, so.</span> <span id="s768">But sometimes something happen, like one time electric motor would burn up with cinder and the air conditioning stopped work.</span> <span id="s769">When the inspector came in the woman said, "That damned Jew, he don't take care."</span> <span id="s770">So I got angry at the inspector.</span> <span id="s771">I said, "You should have come checked with me, why, why do all these things happen, before you go upstairs and check the apartment room that is 90 degrees heat.</span> <span id="s772">You should come down, I'll show you that the whole wiring and the whole motor burnt to a cinder."</span> <span id="s773">Well, the one lady, one of my tenants, heard the woman, you know, giving her anti-Semitic remark, so I wrote her a letter, I appreciate tenants and I am going to put her out.</span> <span id="s774">So she wrote me a letter apologizing.</span> <span id="s775">I still kept the letter.</span> <span id="s776">And she asked me what can she do.</span> <span id="s777">I said, "If you want to I would like you to make a donation to my synagogue."</span> <span id="s778">And I took that check and I went to my synagogue and I stamped Israel from the side, on the front, on the back.</span> <span id="s779">When she gets that check back that she knew that she gave donation to the Jewish synagogue to Jewish causes.</span> <span id="s780">So it is a lot of anti-Semitism in this country.</span> <span id="s781">Of course it is.</span> <span id="s782">It is a great country but there are all kinds of fish in the water.</span> <span id="s783">But we want to make sure and be always on guard so something like this couldn't happen in this country, too, that should not happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: How has the Holocaust experience influenced some of the choices that you have made over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: The Holocaust influenced me in a lot of ways.</span> <span id="s786">I want-- first of all, the things I used to have in my home, in my grandparents' home, in my great grandparents' home, when I go to Israel, when I have seen the picture from the Western Wall, I want to have one.</span> <span id="s787">When I have seen silver candelabra like my great grandfather had, I want to have one.</span> <span id="s788">I grasp these things what I lost.</span> <span id="s789">I just want to bring them back to life, bring them to my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Also, I want to give my children what I couldn't--I could not be a doctor.</span> <span id="s791">I want to--I am so proud that I gave them education.</span> <span id="s792">________+ my experiences.</span> <span id="s793">I want to give my children not the good things in life, the education to become somebody, which I could never attain when I was young.</span> <span id="s794">Otherwise, you know, I'll try to build a home life like I knew, respect to my wife, respect to my children, respect to everybody else, that taught me, that the Holocaust taught me a lot of things, that people really should be good to one another and to respect each other.</span> <span id="s795">Another thing, I came from a religious home.</span> <span id="s796">During the war what I have seen I really question if there is a god.</span> <span id="s797">But then when you have a family you want to give your family some kind of soul.</span> <span id="s798">You got the sense of the longings.</span> <span id="s799">You are afraid something, you know, you are not, just can't go out and kill another, you are accounted for, in this way you are accounted for something higher.</span> <span id="s800">So you gave--we had a, not a tradition at home, but Friday night Shabbos dinner, early to synagogue, to give the children that sense of belonging, and they do the same thing their own home.</span> <span id="s801">So that's what the Holocaust taught me.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: What has been your best surprise or your biggest disappointment about life in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Well, I'm not really disappointed in life in America because you got, you are master of your own destiny.</span> <span id="s804">You make your own bed, you sleep in it.</span> <span id="s805">I really like living in this country.</span> <span id="s806">I feel great.</span> <span id="s807">I don't have really any big disappointments.</span> <span id="s808">Some times I've--the only small disappointment, the trials were held, the jury trials, they really, the jurors are not voting with their heart, they are voting as a group of people just, I'm afraid it's not going to be bringing justice to this country.</span> <span id="s809">Politically also, it's, I think that president should not have millions for this position to become a president.</span> <span id="s810">A small man or a poor man cannot become president.</span> <span id="s811">I would like to see that change.</span> <span id="s812">And otherwise I like the rights, individual rights for individual people and especially as a Jewish person we enjoy very much rights and freedom in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What would you yet like to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I would like to win a million dollars because I would like to have--when I went to Brandeis and I walked with my wife I said, you know, some day if I made a lot of money I would like to donate, have one of those buildings in my name.</span> <span id="s815">I would like to leave some kind of real memento that the Luksenburgs was walking on this earth and left something behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Is there anything you would like to add before we conclude, anything that we haven't talked about that you would like to mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I cannot and will not understand why the whole world stood still and allow such a horrible crime to commit on men, women, children.</span> <span id="s818">Up to now I cannot understand why the whole earth stood still.</span> <span id="s819">And I have sleepless nights and a hard time because I cannot forget the way my parents went to murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: I thank you for interviewing with me today.</span> <span id="s821">And this will conclude the interview with William Luksenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Conclusion of Interview Interview with William Luksenburg PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT 21</span></p></body></html>
