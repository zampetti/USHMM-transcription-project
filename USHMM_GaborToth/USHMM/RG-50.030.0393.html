1998</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: This is September 21st, 1998, we are in Arlington, Virginia, and this is an interview for the Holocaust Museum with Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s12">And if I could just get you to begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Introduce yourself, say your full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s15">This is -- my name is Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s16">Yestem -- I -- I cannot talk in Polish.</span> <span id="s17">I’m a son of the Stanislavo Marchaj Mulanietch and Neho Marchaj.</span> <span id="s18">[speaks Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: I think you just spoke in Polish then.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Oh, Jesus.</span> <span id="s21">Sorry.</span> <span id="s22">Yes, I -- yes.</span> <span id="s23">You see, when I’m coming to my memory, I don’t know, somewhere in my mind is everything automatically switched to the Polish language.</span> <span id="s24">So now, fine.</span> <span id="s25">Marchaj ema in America, and talk English.</span> <span id="s26">So, I am the -- a boy born in Poland as the first generation of the Polish people after reaching the independence as a country in the 1918, and ri -- and yet Poland was again a state in 1918.</span> <span id="s27">And therefore, being born in ’24, I am one of the first generation of the Polish people.</span> <span id="s28">We -- this what happened just after the war, and I started to think independently, was that I started to understand the great effort of my parents, and parents of my friends, that they fought to reach this independence.</span> <span id="s29">And therefore I found a very -- important for me to learn about the history and fight for the independence.</span> <span id="s30">I understand the very big losses in Polish population to reach this goal, to be again independent country.</span> <span id="s31">Therefore, I understand very well the need to be educated patriotic, as a patriot.</span> <span id="s32">And therefore, a -- from very beginning what I remember in my youth, it was always all events, all occurrences, all anniversary, very enused, very, very touchy.</span> <span id="s33">All -- say for example like anniversary of the Polish constitution, the third May, this was the constitution which was written based on the American Constitution, and written by the Tadeusz Kashoushka, who was the friend of Thomas Jefferson.</span> <span id="s34">And this third May, it was a very big day in Polish history, every more -- every day, every year.</span> <span id="s35">There -- and then we --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What would people do, why -- how could you tell it was a big day?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Well, it means that especially -- may I make a -- a little bit comi -- to come back to the history of Poland, the society of Poland, to the people of Poland.</span> <span id="s38">You have to realize, everybody who want to understand Polish people, and their behavior, you have to assume -- not assume, have to recognize the fact that Poland didn’t exist for 125 years.</span> <span id="s39">This means six generations of the Polish people were not Polish.</span> <span id="s40">You have to realize this fact that people didn’t know, after six generations, what does it mean Poland, especially that the -- the recognizing country, recognizing the nation occurred very late in human history in Europe.</span> <span id="s41">This is the so-called, the spring of the nation, and in moment -- you have to realize the fact that there was no German, there was no Austrian, there was not Polish people.</span> <span id="s42">They were the principalities, somebody was Bavarian, or was the Silesian, was the Galician, was the Pomac.</span> <span id="s43">People didn’t know yet what does it mean Poland, they didn’t know yet what are Germany, they didn’t know what are Austria, and so on.</span> <span id="s44">History was the history of the big family, big kings, but not a big country.</span> <span id="s45">Big Germany.</span> <span id="s46">Germany’s a very modern -- modern -- modern creature, I can say.</span> <span id="s47">And therefore, when Poland reached the independent, people within the territory, within the border of the so- called thow Poland, they didn’t know who are they.</span> <span id="s48">There was a -- here in the United States, you can find a group of Polish people gathering somewhere in the center of park, speaking the same language, and asking each other, who are you?</span> <span id="s49">They are speaking Silesian.</span> <span id="s50">No, I am Mazurin, I am Galician, and I am speaking Galicia.</span> <span id="s51">I am speaking Silesian, I am speaking Mazurin.</span> <span id="s52">They even didn’t recognize they are speaking Polish, because Poland was a -- a totally new element of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s53">So therefore, you realize this sounded -- it was extremely important for the people who reach, and were at the government, at the steering of the new country, like Pilsudski, Marshal Pilsudski who started to fight for -- for the freedom of Poland.</span> <span id="s54">They introduce a very strong, very -- no, they introduce a histor -- education of histor.</span> <span id="s55">And at the time, we and my friends in different country -- different part of the Poland, they started to be the conscious who -- what does it mean Poland.</span> <span id="s56">What does it mean to be a Polish?</span> <span id="s57">Of course, in this development, there was a very big part of the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s58">This -- the church was the -- the first unit of the government, yes, to create a -- the -- to create am -- hard, that’s the [indecipherable] you see the -- if -- if I would like -- sorry -- if I would like to talk in perfe -- about my profession, I -- I had no problem to find the words, and when I am talking on this subject, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s59">So they started to create the conscious -- can I say conscious?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Consciousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Consciousness of the Polish people, what does it mean Poland, yes.</span> <span id="s62">And very big emphasize in this consciousness was a -- that we are Catholic.</span> <span id="s63">And really, really there was a -- 90 percent, yes, of suppold Polish people were Catholic.</span> <span id="s64">And therefore, in -- in the -- in the school, ground school, and then in gimnasium, which is a correspondent to the high school, there -- we started to -- not only to be Polish, but to cultivate Polish.</span> <span id="s65">And one of these big movement in cultivation of the Polish -- Poland, was scouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Organization hartseffo, scouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Mr. Marchaj, what I’m going to do, is because I feel us moving forward, you’re almost a teenager now, I would like to go back a little bit and get even to when you were a little boy, and then we will revisit this idea of how you were surrounded by this new consciousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So, if you could tell us -- tell us about your mother and father.</span> <span id="s70">What -- what were they like, and what was it like to be a little boy in their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s72">Okay, that’s a very, very basic question, because sometimes in America, I’m trying to tell the people that I am a son of the slave.</span> <span id="s73">That is a big surprise.</span> <span id="s74">And if you would try to find a definition who is slave?</span> <span id="s75">The person which is taken away from home, from country, by some big power, to another country, to be totally without freedom, and to have and obey the rules of the -- this who took him to another country.</span> <span id="s76">That’s -- I understand the definition of the slave from Africa to America is exactly the same.</span> <span id="s77">They were taken away to another country, without willpower, without anything, just to go and obey the law of the lord, yes?</span> <span id="s78">So this is my father.</span> <span id="s79">My father was from family where it was seven children, and -- four son and three daughters, and this town, land where he was born, Vol-Volbrum, in Poland, had to supply to the tsar of Russia, a soldier, forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">They were taken away from this small town to, in case of my father to Petersburg to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s81">Now why this happened, you know, there was seven, four brothers, and there was a gathering of the family, because Volbrum, town Volbrum had to supply X number of people -- soldiers to the tsar.</span> <span id="s82">So when there was a tragic meeting in the family, they say, now Miko, Neho, you will go.</span> <span id="s83">And he was taken away to Petersburg, and this was somewhere in the -- in 1905, something like that, maybe 10, ist -- I don’t remember the date.</span> <span id="s84">And so this is my father.</span> <span id="s85">My mother was a daughter of the family --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Can you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: With close?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Okay, I am moving [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s90">So, therefore my f -- so I mentioned who was my father, and of course, even if I would like to ask at that -- at that time, who you were, probably his answer would be, I am shlos -- Silesian.</span> <span id="s91">In spite of fact that he was talking Polish.</span> <span id="s92">He had no knowledge about the Poland [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s93">Then he went to the Petersburg, and he was a -- I can tell you, very intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s94">He didn’t -- he didn’t was -- he wasn’t there a -- a -- a simple soldier.</span> <span id="s95">He was intelligent, so he made advance in his ranking.</span> <span id="s96">Of course, that he will never reach the officer’s ranking, but he reached the starshina, which means like a sergeant, starshina.</span> <span id="s97">Now he was taught not to be only a soldier, or to give the orders to another soldier, he started to be a professional soldier in the armament.</span> <span id="s98">He was a perfectly taught how to be with the armament.</span> <span id="s99">He was a perfectly taught how to deal with the armament, carbine, guns, and everything, how to repair it, how to build it and so on.</span> <span id="s100">So he was out of the service of the soldier, he was in - - somewhere in the kazerna, yes, in the camp, or -- camp somebody [indecipherable] exactly it was Veeberg, which is now in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s101">And he, when the war came, war -- the first World War, he was not a soldier to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s104">Because he knew well all the soldiers, and the first battle that my father faced, it was Tanenberk battle, very famous battle, and he found the only -- he saw the battle after the battle, and he survived this bacca -- the only because he was not in the first line.</span> <span id="s105">He was delivering the armament to this killing.</span> <span id="s106">And he survive, and then he participate in the war, later on the -- on the front, and the Austria, Italy, Austria, some went there.</span> <span id="s107">And then was captured as a -- as a -- you know -- captured by the -- by the [indecipherable] army, so was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: By the which army?</span> <span id="s109">A: By Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Austria, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: And he at that moment, he said that, I am with the Russian, yes?</span> <span id="s112">And Austria, they found him very useful.</span> <span id="s113">Oh, we get a professional, yes.</span> <span id="s114">Let’s use him in the manufacturing in Vienna, yes?</span> <span id="s115">So he from the statusk of what is this, gefarn genay, now what is this American English?</span> <span id="s116">Prisoner of war, yes?</span> <span id="s117">He was no prisoner of war, he was a worker in already a certain industry of Austria.</span> <span id="s118">At that time, he met -- he send the letter and contact the father, and father later came, and he made arrangement, better arrangement for him to be almost like a worker, free worker.</span> <span id="s119">And awadi -- I have even the -- the picture of this visit that, in my grandfather visit my father.</span> <span id="s120">And he was -- and this was the end of the war, I mean, as you know.</span> <span id="s121">This is the end of the war, and Pilsudski, Leggionipulski, they started to fight.</span> <span id="s122">120 soldiers get out from Kraków to fight for Poland.</span> <span id="s123">Do you realize this fact?</span> <span id="s124">100 very well educated soldiers, under the [indecipherable] of Pilsudski started to fight with the three power European power, Austria, Prussia, and Russia.</span> <span id="s125">Fortunately for Poland, all these three powers fought each other, in different combinations.</span> <span id="s126">So it was quite -- no, not easy, but 120 soldiers started to bil -- to fight and build the Poland.</span> <span id="s127">And in 1918, when the treaty in Versailles, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, yes, was involved to promise Poland independence, and Pilsudski was at the moment leader openly.</span> <span id="s128">They gave Poland chance to be a nation as Poland.</span> <span id="s129">So I -- do you know [indecipherable] my father, yes.</span> <span id="s130">My mother was not the same story, but she was a daughter of the restorator in Slominiki.</span> <span id="s131">Is a town of -- very close to Kraków.</span> <span id="s132">And they met each other, they start to love each other, and they were married, yes, I -- I don’t know, probably 18 or twen -- no, 20 -- 18 - 18 - ’18 they were married.</span> <span id="s133">And at the moment, my father, being in some way involved -- he was in connection to the -- this military movement in Poland, and he entered Polish police.</span> <span id="s134">Police, yes?</span> <span id="s135">And he was the -- again, in the county Keldsa, is a part of Poland, he was re-responsible for the armament of the police.</span> <span id="s136">He’s a -- you realize this was the year 18 - 19 - 20, and now you -- maybe you know that -- that in 1920, Poland was not yet fully Poland, because there was on the east a growing Communist, a Red army attack Poland in 1920, with the full power they invaded Poland just to take Poland into the -- into the Communist [speaks Polish] I -- I said in Poland, in Polish.</span> <span id="s137">And at the moment -- you realize this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s138">Poland, they have two years of independence, two years to build the consciousness what does it mean Poland.</span> <span id="s139">They have to fight with the Russian power.</span> <span id="s140">Not only Russian, the whole Socialist block.</span> <span id="s141">And they were very badly defeated.</span> <span id="s142">With Germany and Russian Red army was totally destroyed, which is invading not only Poland, but invading very weak German.</span> <span id="s143">This is the very crucial moment in history of -- of the youth.</span> <span id="s144">Yes, either you will study some -- some historical period, 1920, you will see how weak it was at the moment, Europe, to be captured by Communists.</span> <span id="s145">There was a -- Germany was -- after the war, was totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s146">So, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s147">In 1920 my father fought as a -- as a soldier, again -- Polish soldier against the Communist Red army.</span> <span id="s148">Afterwards [indecipherable] Red army was defeated very badly, and the moment even Polish army ended up to the Kiev, very far, far, deep into the Russia.</span> <span id="s149">But, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s150">W-We can say that since ’20, Poland was a really [indecipherable], yes.</span> <span id="s151">So realize in ’20, in 1939, 19 years later, we were invaded by Germany, and saw the killing again.</span> <span id="s152">But in this period of 18 years, you have mi -- imagination how much we built in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Incredible, incredible.</span> <span id="s154">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Do you remember your -- tell us what you remember about your father talking about this, about being a soldier, about fighting for Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: He was very pacifistic, especially -- especially when we were espouting, yes, and we were in some way paramilitary organization.</span> <span id="s157">So, a very good education, part of the Polish scouting, was the military decoration, to know everything about military, about the -- the simple behavior even, but without using the weapon, yes?</span> <span id="s158">But basically again, how to use the cartography, how to use the geography, how to use the knowledge of the medicine, and so on.</span> <span id="s159">This was a paramilitary organization with -- without -- no, with out the -- the leading us to the militaristic -- no, militaristic future.</span> <span id="s160">No, this was a -- do you know the founder of this organization was in England, Badin Power [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s161">Scouting was a very broad movement in Europe.</span> <span id="s162">And my father was always, but don’t think about to fight, because you are only -- you will be only the -- the target of -- to be killed.</span> <span id="s163">So he was pacifistic at this moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: I’m not sure I understand.</span> <span id="s165">Is that something your father would say to you?</span> <span id="s166">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: But he -- if there was some meeting in the home, yes, and they will usually, in the Sunday, and we were very, very patriotic.</span> <span id="s169">And as you know, in every country there is political issues, yes?</span> <span id="s170">So, my father was -- was now oriented more to build the life, to build something good.</span> <span id="s171">And he said, “Don’t believe in everything what you are teaching you in the school.”</span> <span id="s172">And he said, “Think independently what is going on.”</span> <span id="s173">Yes, and he realized this fact that Poland was so fresh, so unexperienced country, that he had a terrible problem.</span> <span id="s174">Minority, yes, Belarus, yes, and Cryena.</span> <span id="s175">Jewish people, some German, and so on.</span> <span id="s176">Even what I can tell you something about the -- how I -- how I lived with my friend, the Jewish people, yes, because as I mentioned to you, my father, and my mother came from the small town, especially later, I was very much more attached to the family of my mother, especially that my godfather was Jusef Meeta, was a soldier of the Pilsudski army, a regular soldier.</span> <span id="s177">And he was the vouloust, a mayor of this small town.</span> <span id="s178">And he had a very -- my cousin, yes, were the same age, so during the vacation, either they were in our home, or I was in their home.</span> <span id="s179">So this was like my -- the distance between my br -- I had it one brother and two sister.</span> <span id="s180">My brother was six years older.</span> <span id="s181">So at that year -- age, say 12, he was 18, there was no contact.</span> <span id="s182">So the contact was with my cousin, who was 12, too.</span> <span id="s183">And therefore I -- I was very close to the -- to the Titus Kameeta, my cousin, and Barbara Kameeta.</span> <span id="s184">Titus, it was his name, Titus Kameeta.</span> <span id="s185">And later he was a soldier of the -- too.</span> <span id="s186">And it doesn’t matter, this is the case that I was in -- attached, yes.</span> <span id="s187">In this town -- because I started to tell about the Jewish people, Slominiki, say for example, it was a s --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Which town?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Slominiki -- Slominiki --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Which is not the town that you grew up in?</span> <span id="s191">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: But your --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Hi -- I grew up in -- Q: -- cousin’s hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: -- yes, cam -- I -- I grew up, because I meant -- I didn’t mention this, that my father was responsible for the police department, armament only, yes, in Kelsa, and was a -- like a capital -- county town, county town.</span> <span id="s195">This was a -- a 200,000 in -- inhabitant, yes, big town.</span> <span id="s196">And so therefore, he -- I -- Slominiki was 6,000, and there was the -- we knew 3,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s197">Now, that’s the very -- that you -- maybe you are interested in some way, that similar way, Jewish people, if you go now back into history, they didn’t know Poland.</span> <span id="s198">He came maybe when it was the Kasimiros del grossa in the 15th century, when he invade -- in -- invited Jewish people into the very big kingdom at the time, was Poland, yes?</span> <span id="s199">And probably his idea was to move to the new territory, which was at the domination of the king Kasimiros, but in very peaceful way.</span> <span id="s200">Kasimiros del gressa never fought the war, and the -- at the time, there was a -- the greatest part of Europe under his domination.</span> <span id="s201">You know, after ya -- Besarabia -- you know -- you know Besarabia Ukraina into Lithuania?</span> <span id="s202">This was due to the m -- marriage -- married his daughter Elsan, they dom -- started to dominate this big territory, but not Poland.</span> <span id="s203">This was a do -- domination, then th -- this was the aga -- under the -- under the [indecipherable] it’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s204">It was a governor -- king, no, under the how do we -- I lost the word.</span> <span id="s205">Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s206">The [indecipherable] king, Kasimiros del grossa had the influence into the Lithuania because his daughter was married to the agawar, or something like that, yes?</span> <span id="s207">And therefore, he started to enter -- the properties was his idea to introduce a lot of Jewish people, who were the merchant, who were the professional in very many activity, even to -- to make dresses, to -- to -- to make a business, to do something, yes?</span> <span id="s208">At the moment Polish peasant, they didn’t know anything about it, yeah?</span> <span id="s209">So therefore, and I’m saying, in Slominiki there was a 6,000 inh -- in -- in -- inhabitant, and there was a 3000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s210">Who are they, who were they, yes?</span> <span id="s211">Professionals.</span> <span id="s212">Business, bakery, and another activity of the merchant, yes.</span> <span id="s213">And at the time, when I was in the vacation, I played the game like a kid’s game with my friends Jewish.</span> <span id="s214">I -- up to now I understand such an expression, hanush kamoyra?</span> <span id="s215">Yes, hanush kamoyra, this is the Jew -- Yiddish don’t worry, hanush kamoyra.</span> <span id="s216">Or a -- or very many su -- such expression, yes?</span> <span id="s217">So we were together --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: That you learned from your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes, playing the game.</span> <span id="s220">Now, I -- I met them later in the schools, yes, but they have some difficulties, because they -- they were Jewish by religion.</span> <span id="s221">They didn’t know Poland, and the -- very little of these Jewish boys and girls, they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s222">And this was later a terrible disaster for them, when the German entered Poland.</span> <span id="s223">They were so distinguished, so different, that the German can very easy separate them from th -- and I am just saying, but that’s -- this is the -- I mentioned that in -- in my life, I know very well what it means to be Jewish, yes?</span> <span id="s224">You see, in the -- in this -- in this town, you can have it always some curiosity, yes?</span> <span id="s225">You can distinguish the curiosity between these people.</span> <span id="s226">So I can tell you if there will be -- if there were jokes, or some malicious action, they were not organized, or something like -- because they -- people were very different, so they will make jokes on him, or something, some curiosity, like you know, this is the certain period i-in -- in Jewish that they are bill -- building the shackle -- so small -- small hut, yes?</span> <span id="s227">For the -- I don’t know, this is the -- to memorize the traveling across the desert since many thousand years ago, yes?</span> <span id="s228">So, I remember this, that they -- they -- they -- they people, or see -- or like me, I say what’s this, and so on, yes?</span> <span id="s229">But this was a curiosity that sometimes you can make a joke, yes?</span> <span id="s230">But this was not a -- something that I -- I -- I hate this, yes?</span> <span id="s231">It was only recognizing that they are different.</span> <span id="s232">Okay, but this is the word what I said, now what I have to go, because I lost my -- my -- my -- my -- my talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: I want you to just tell a little bit about family life.</span> <span id="s234">What was it like at home, what did your mother do, or how much were you at home with your mother and father, your brother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s236">So, of course that my very young period in Keltsa was -- was n-not significant for me, because i -- I wa -- I was seven, so at seven years old, I remember very little about the Slominiki.</span> <span id="s237">I remember my friends playing the games and this, or going for fishing, or swimming.</span> <span id="s238">Or going to the forest to pick up the berries.</span> <span id="s239">And when I -- my really I enter more active life, when I -- when our family move from Keltsa to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s240">At the age of seven I was with family in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s241">What’s happened, my father was transfer from Keltsa to the headquarters of the police in Warsaw to be responsible for the certain manufacturing in the workshop, and equipment which was needed for the Polish police.</span> <span id="s242">And at the time, I was already a student of the ed -- en -- be -- of high school, my -- my brother was already in the gimnasium.</span> <span id="s243">My -- my daughters -- sisters were in the same -- in different gimnasium for the girls, yes?</span> <span id="s244">And in a moment, as I mentioned to you, that -- that contact with mother and father was a very -- very close, but you had no time to be -- for a very long time together, yes?</span> <span id="s245">This was only sup -- some days.</span> <span id="s246">But, in the morning you go to school, after school come back, workshop -- homework, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s247">My activities a -- by -- after ou -- after school, I participate in bands to play the corono, yes.</span> <span id="s248">Marching bands, and activity of the scouting, yes?</span> <span id="s249">And this was a -- three times a week, yes?</span> <span id="s250">So this is -- my brother, same real story, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s252">His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: His name?</span> <span id="s254">Cheslof.</span> <span id="s255">Cheslof.</span> <span id="s256">He’s a very famous name in -- in the work.</span> <span id="s257">I -- I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s258">And -- and he was already studying [indecipherable] in gimnasium -- my sister was in gimnasium, ri -- yes?</span> <span id="s259">My mother was a so-called housewife, yes?</span> <span id="s260">That’s possible for activity in the home, she had some help, yes, of the -- some maid from her town, who was like a member of our family, forever, Helena Klanofska.</span> <span id="s261">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Just get you to say the names of your two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes, ah, my sister was Yenema, and second Maria.</span> <span id="s264">Yenema, and Maria ga -- work in gimnasium that was a -- you -- you have to know that the gimnasium program was absolutely the same in all gimnasium in Poland.</span> <span id="s265">There was no differences like here in the United States, that -- where you can study whatever you want.</span> <span id="s266">No, there was a program by the Ministry of Education, and the program of every gimnasium are absolutely the same.</span> <span id="s267">And somebody can say, ho ho, this was the very fine matter to brainwash the people, yes?</span> <span id="s268">Because you have a -- this is to be known for you.</span> <span id="s269">Yes, and no, but I can tell you that in my life it was a positive, because this -- this program that was presented to me, I found that this was the very universal program.</span> <span id="s270">There was nothing very exaggerated to brainwash a young boy or a young girl.</span> <span id="s271">So, this is the time when we were to -- to Poland -- to -- to Rashava at ‘35, yes?</span> <span id="s272">And now is ‘35 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Before we keep moving, when you got to Warsaw, where did you live?</span> <span id="s274">A: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What was the neighborhood like?</span> <span id="s276">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: And also, if you could speak a bit about how you observed your faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Ah.</span> <span id="s279">I have the picture.</span> <span id="s280">Maybe later I will show you.</span> <span id="s281">Education -- my education, because it -- what I remember since 30 -- exactly, exactly ’33 to ’39 yes, it was that -- being a student.</span> <span id="s282">Making the homework, go to the school, come back, make homework.</span> <span id="s283">Some certain activity assign from the marching band, and -- and -- and scouting.</span> <span id="s284">Is, of course, vacation, going for the camps.</span> <span id="s285">I’m saying this way, this was a very nice, and -- and straightforward activity prescribed by the almost Ministry of Education, yes?</span> <span id="s286">So, contact with mother and father was duri -- usually in the s -- Sunday, or -- or something like that.</span> <span id="s287">Now, my father, in 1955, yes, he made a decision because of the heart problem, that he has to leave police, not as a rent -- not how to say voluntarily, yes?</span> <span id="s288">He’s -- he said, “I spending police enough of my life.</span> <span id="s289">I am still young.”</span> <span id="s290">He always underlined this, in spite of the fact that he was 50, “that I have to do something for myself.”</span> <span id="s291">And believe or not, he was a very successful contractor -- contractor.</span> <span id="s292">He started to build homes in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s293">Now, we started to live in the part of Warsaw which was so called Saskakampa.</span> <span id="s294">This is the very close, the proximity to the -- to the centrum of Vashar, it was two kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">And when I remembered -- when we came to this part of the town when my father build the first house, there was a fields -- fields [indecipherable] fields, yes?</span> <span id="s296">When, at the end of the war, there was a beautiful, I think most beautiful part of the Warsaw, as a meeting area, like a n -- those were not big houses, small houses.</span> <span id="s297">And in this part of -- of war -- of Warsaw, in Saskacampa, my father build the five homes.</span> <span id="s298">And our -- we -- we started to be very rich now, very rich.</span> <span id="s299">You know what does it mean to be worth in the time -- of course my family [indecipherable] father is a hundred thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s300">It was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s301">And he -- while he was -- he started to do this?</span> <span id="s302">Because he was in -- Michael Marchaj, yes, he was always energetic and full of activity.</span> <span id="s303">What he did, he said, there are my town, there are my friends from the young period, and he had work.</span> <span id="s304">Let’s them be my helper, that I will take them from Volbrum, or Slominiki, I will bring them to the Warsaw, we will build the contemporary barracks, and then we’ll start in spring to build the house, and at the end of the year, the home for stoies with -- were ready.</span> <span id="s305">And my -- for these people, who [indecipherable] brought -- they took -- physically come here, build the barracks.</span> <span id="s306">They -- Helena, our maid, she was a cooker for them, and believe me -- and they were paid very well.</span> <span id="s307">They paid not as a salary by week, or something like, they [indecipherable] in this way.</span> <span id="s308">If you -- by number of bricks, yes, they get the salary.</span> <span id="s309">And they, at the time earned a lot of money in the one summer period.</span> <span id="s310">And they -- they get out for the winter, then next spring they came to another place, and do the same.</span> <span id="s311">So my father did a lot of this very intelligently, and giving the chance to his friends, and now they were so angry to be again and again, so even then selected another friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: So angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Angry -- not angry, no, sorry, a wrong -- a wrong words.</span> <span id="s314">Q: Eager?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Eager, yes they were eager to come here again, even to bring a better friends, to do better job, to do more money, yes, because they were in some way.</span> <span id="s316">So in this way, y -- we -- we -- I remember this, that in the springtime there was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s317">In the -- in the -- in the fall there was a -- a home.</span> <span id="s318">And -- so this was that.</span> <span id="s319">And the -- at the time, nothing’s changed in Marrowshak.</span> <span id="s320">The way of life was the same.</span> <span id="s321">We -- we -- my father -- I say it was worth a hundred thousand dollars [indecipherable] that he di -- he doesn’t have the -- this hundred dollars to spend, yes.</span> <span id="s322">This was the -- his building the future that he recognized the fact that money make money.</span> <span id="s323">You cannot stop to do this.</span> <span id="s324">He was in very big contact with the banks.</span> <span id="s325">He had the open credit in -- in the very famous banks in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s326">The name of my father was known, and he was a good creditor, yes, yes, creditor.</span> <span id="s327">And besides that he build the houses, he made a -- a street, also, with the water, electricity, and sewer system.</span> <span id="s328">Everything was [indecipherable] so when my father started in the very beginning of the street, he -- he -- the end was -- is another home, yes.</span> <span id="s329">So this was the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s330">And now, it’s come ’39 -- 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Before you go there.</span> <span id="s332">I am curious about how your family worshipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Ah, oh, yes, I mentioned it.</span> <span id="s334">Of course you see that there was a church built in the -- in this part of the town where my father participate a lot.</span> <span id="s335">And in the school, yes, as I mentioned to you, there was a program, yes, that y -- y-you can -- you were -- you were taught by the certain rules, and our education in school was in Catholic education to [indecipherable] that we have, and say for example Jewish -- for example Jewish, and -- or ukra -- Protestant, because I was in the -- in the state gimnasium, yes?</span> <span id="s336">So it was recognized by [indecipherable] by constitution as that, fine.</span> <span id="s337">That is a majority of the students, yes they are Catholic, so we have a catahead yes, in the p -- priest, yes, we were coming and i -- they taught us a certain basic facts, and -- of -- of Catholic church [indecipherable] yes, yes?</span> <span id="s338">But, at the time there was such a -- is that somebody was Protestant or Jewish, yes?</span> <span id="s339">He was free to go to another -- his own far -- pre -- is his own, no -- activity, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: In other words, when you were studying tenants of your Catholic faith, maybe a Protestant or a Jewish student --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: -- would leave, go to another class, and they would have their own class?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s344">Because there was so little them at that moment, in spite of [indecipherable] population of the Jewish people, it was very -- quite big, yes?</span> <span id="s345">There was usually in -- in gimnasium -- government -- state gimnasium, mostly in my class it was three Jewish people, and there was five Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s346">Is a -- yes -- no -- what is this in -- belief -- Orthodox -- Orthodox Catholics, yes?</span> <span id="s347">So there they -- they did participate at that moment, and this -- what they wanted to do depends on them.</span> <span id="s348">Yes -- during the -- of course, that -- when was that, Sunday, yes, and -- and it was summertime.</span> <span id="s349">I -- we were very happy [indecipherable] because I played the march band, yes, we march band, so many were to the church, and the gimnasium, went to the church in Sunday, yes?</span> <span id="s350">But we -- we -- we -- we have these privileges that we are saying between us, that we don’t have to go to the mass.</span> <span id="s351">We don’t -- we -- we -- we sit on the greens, under the tree, with our instruments, yes.</span> <span id="s352">We didn’t have to -- to be -- to be in the church, yes, and we listen to this, yes, you know, I am saying we are -- and it was -- you -- you realize this fact, that this was something which is forcibly to -- to put on you, you are re -- re -- very resistance, yes?</span> <span id="s353">So at the moment, to sit on the grass was better than to go to the church, we said.</span> <span id="s354">But this was a -- you know, and not very serious abuse of -- I believe, but just young behavior, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: How old are you at this point, and what -- what are your ideas?</span> <span id="s356">Are you beginning to think about what you might do in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">Of course that -- under very big influence of -- for me, was my brother.</span> <span id="s359">So he was growing more and more, and he was very seriously, and good educated in the technical school to be a constructor on the planes, yes?</span> <span id="s360">Aeronautics.</span> <span id="s361">So, of course my dream was of course when I finish in this, my education in the gimnasium, I will go to Polytechnic to be a constructor of the planes, and at moment I will tell you that Poland was in the -- it was very good to build the planes.</span> <span id="s362">Really fantastic industry of the military plane and sports plane.</span> <span id="s363">Every year the great event for us was the challenges.</span> <span id="s364">It was such a competition of the old country, German, Italy, France, and Czechoslovakia the so -- Soviet Union never, there was a competition to fly -- racing, yes?</span> <span id="s365">A-Across -- around Europe.</span> <span id="s366">There was -- all these plane was [indecipherable] beautiful, beautiful planes.</span> <span id="s367">This is the time when the first Atlantic crossing in the opposite direction from east to west, was made by Scarlinski on the plane who was I don’t know.</span> <span id="s368">The Spirit of Saint Louis was about twice as bigger, you see what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s369">You know what speed [indecipherable] remember, Spirit of Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s370">Now I can see it in the museum in Washington, and that’s was -- it’s -- I saw it in Poland, in Warsaw when Lindberg visited Poland and with the san -- Spirit Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s371">I remember up to now this -- this especial [indecipherable] but special pattern of the heart of the engine made in circles.</span> <span id="s372">You can see this very easy, and I remember this, even this detail, yes.</span> <span id="s373">So I -- I was very enthusiastic about the -- the planes, and another even was the gol -- golden Bennett balloon competition in Poland -- in Poland.</span> <span id="s374">It was a very, very, very nicely developed Poland, in 15 years of Poland existence.</span> <span id="s375">A lot of good teachers, scientists was [indecipherable] by the -- by the society.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You’ve mentioned several times how patriotic your father was, and how his ideas and what was going on at the time shaped you.</span> <span id="s377">Can you tell us a little bit about the things he might have said directly to you, as a son, about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes, but this was -- this was something that I never agree with my father.</span> <span id="s379">It went that he was in, at a certain time, not actively, not by his tek -- life experience, in opposition what’s happening Poland.</span> <span id="s380">You remember the Pilsudski, it was in my -- my god, yes?</span> <span id="s381">You believe or not, I have here in my wallet his picture.</span> <span id="s382">And because I never forgot at the moment that he and 120 young people started to build the Poland, fight for Poland.</span> <span id="s383">Of course that later, this called the first brigade, this wa -- so-called.</span> <span id="s384">Piersha brigada, the first brigade.</span> <span id="s385">All these people were very educated, very aware people, very good educated people in military and professional.</span> <span id="s386">In the process of the development of the country, and administration of the country, a little of these people, very good people, as a soldier, was not necessary very good to be in government.</span> <span id="s387">And my father, because he was more active, and he has a very open eyes as a business man, yes?</span> <span id="s388">He say no, these people are not very good.</span> <span id="s389">So don’t believe everything, you know?</span> <span id="s390">And this was in some way in very malicious -- not malicious, how to say distortion, yes?</span> <span id="s391">The very famous song of this group of people, yes, was [sings in Polish].</span> <span id="s392">It was such a melody, and it was very often played during these festivities, yes?</span> <span id="s393">So my father s-s -- found the song a little bit distortion, he say, “Don’t give me everything what they are singing to you.”</span> <span id="s394">This was always a warning for my father.</span> <span id="s395">But politically, he was not a politician, and politically Poland was in statoos nastemi, s-speaking in Latin, the state of to be born, yes?</span> <span id="s396">So we -- we have no knowledge what does it mean politics, yes?</span> <span id="s397">This new cadre of the people, young people, like a new generation which were growing to reach for this power, never did it, because of the war -- End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: -- me Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: -- and you know, Mr. Marchaj, anything that -- that comes up -- A: -- that’s Teddy, I’m Ted.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Tadeusz.</span> <span id="s402">This is September 21st, 1998.</span> <span id="s403">We are in Arlington, Virginia to do an interview for the Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s404">And this interview is with Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s405">Tape number two.</span> <span id="s406">Can you tell us about your involvement with the scouts?</span> <span id="s407">What were the scouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Scouting organization, as I mentioned in the very beginning -- you know the very beginning in the meantime.</span> <span id="s409">Well, this was a movement established by the Baden Powell.</span> <span id="s410">He was a -- some officer during the first World War, and he had an idea at the time, so far as I remember that people has to do something to avoid war.</span> <span id="s411">So this was a -- in some way I -- I mentioned that like a paramilitary organization, but strong emphasize that the war, and fighting will never be used.</span> <span id="s412">So shortly is picking the education in the scouting organization, it was rather to present the history of nation, if this -- in Poland there was Polish nation, or in France French, or in England.</span> <span id="s413">And this was a -- maybe this is a -- in some way, a -- a contradiction, that we were educated militarily, yes?</span> <span id="s414">But there was never presented to us that we will be a soldier.</span> <span id="s415">And -- but this -- maybe somebody who -- who in Poland was in the command of this organization in Poland, maybe they have some hidden idea.</span> <span id="s416">Let’s keep some cadre, some basic people who will be educated patriotically, and paramilitarily, with some knowledge of the survival, yes, in every possible way, and let’s to exercise this, yes.</span> <span id="s417">So let’s go to the forest, let’s go to the woods, and do what we want to do.</span> <span id="s418">That’s a -- in the United States you have this organization up to now.</span> <span id="s419">I don’t know how the -- how they are calling here, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Boy Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Boy Scout, yes, Boy Scout, yes.</span> <span id="s422">Same story.</span> <span id="s423">And in 90 percent, it was the same, but with some addition in Poland, that we have education in Polish army, yes?</span> <span id="s424">But not army, m-m- military education that’s safe -- soldier were taught, yes?</span> <span id="s425">And you have to know that in -- had the -- one of the Polish town -- I am saying Polish, because it’s no more Polish, but he was always Polish, this Lvov.</span> <span id="s426">But this is strange, because I don’t want to abuse [indecipherable] Cryenian, who claimed that Lvov is L’viv.</span> <span id="s427">Because really, Lvov is in Cryena, but it was built by the -- historically, by the people from Poland, from the influence of the kings, and the big town was like a island in the ocean of the Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s428">So, really, it is a Polish town, but is a Ukrainian town.</span> <span id="s429">So why I’m mentioning that, in the fight for this -- for this town, participate a lot of young people, with the background of the scouting, the youngest soldier in that time, and were called -- and even there was a very famous cemetery, which was destroyed during the Soviet occupation of Ukrainia.</span> <span id="s430">And now there’s a big issue between Ukrainia and Poland, how to rebuild this cemetery, which is a very sanct -- sanctisimus place for the Polish people.</span> <span id="s431">And not to abuse the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s432">You have to find the modis revendi between the Ukrainian who hate Poland because of action of these small kids fighting for Lvov, and now this cemetery again.</span> <span id="s433">And so they are trying [indecipherable] but I think that -- I hope that there will be a solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Can you give us an example of something that you were taught when you talk about paramilitary techniques?</span> <span id="s435">What were some of the things that you were taught in scouting?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Y-You see the -- it will be hel -- very proper to say that at the time I had no time to think about it.</span> <span id="s437">This was a -- scouting was such a big pleasure even to -- to do this or that, and so on, if this is the military or not military.</span> <span id="s438">There was a something that is needed, I think, for the young people.</span> <span id="s439">And -- and therefore the -- this movement of the scouting, Boy Scouts in America, is still in existence, yes?</span> <span id="s440">Or I -- I don’t know if it will exist farther, but there is a need for this, and there was a need for us.</span> <span id="s441">And what -- what I was thinking, first of all, that anyway, if there was a so-called zbouvika is in Polish, the meeting, yes?</span> <span id="s442">Meeting of the -- say, a group of -- is very difficult for me to say, because maybe there is a no -- I cannot translate.</span> <span id="s443">Zasta.</span> <span id="s444">A -- a group, like sa -- shortly speaking, but the doushina, means a unit of the same gimnasium, was divided in -- in sastempai.</span> <span id="s445">Doushina, they consist with say, seven, eight groups of, and every group has a different name, different flags, proportion, different distinction, and so on.</span> <span id="s446">So there was, in some way, a very visible military influence into this group.</span> <span id="s447">But believe me, I never in my -- at the time, in my mind was a feeling that I will be a soldier, yes?</span> <span id="s448">We didn’t think about that, but very soon, it’s happened that we started to think in this way, when the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Did you learn any skills that you would call survival skills, and what were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Oh, oh yes, yes, every -- I can tell you that i -- this independence of movement, and -- and the reading the maps.</span> <span id="s451">When he -- I remember they lost my camp, that our group shot -- I have to g -- [indecipherable] backwards.</span> <span id="s452">My group of -- of this organization was placed or attached to the gimnasium.</span> <span id="s453">This was a pack activity of the gimnasium education.</span> <span id="s454">I -- my gimnasium was called gimnasium iminya, like airport in New York, here in the Washington D.C.’s, Reagan’s and so on.</span> <span id="s455">So this group was Iminya Terayousha Raytanna.</span> <span id="s456">And it was a very historical, patriotic man who fought in one of the uprising against the partition, and he was very famous fighter.</span> <span id="s457">He was captured and executed in Poland.</span> <span id="s458">Tadeusz Rader.</span> <span id="s459">And -- no do -- Rater, sorry.</span> <span id="s460">Raton, it was a fighter, a legal fighter for the im -- for the Polish constitution, during the -- now the -- th-this group was name Iminya Romwilda Trowaguta.</span> <span id="s461">Romwald Trowagut.</span> <span id="s462">This was the gam -- man who fought in Polish uprising, one of the many of Polish uprising, and it was executed in Sitadella in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s463">So, y-you can see, the name of the gimnasium is some fighter.</span> <span id="s464">The group of the s-scouting is Amoura Trowguta, and this was the Vuda -- WDH, Vudabashefska Doushina Hertesk.</span> <span id="s465">Iminya Rumwilda Trowguta.</span> <span id="s466">Number one.</span> <span id="s467">We were the black one in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s468">Very good and known Doushina.</span> <span id="s469">And now I am coming back to the -- to -- to continue what you aski -- what you were asking me, il -- and this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Survival skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Survival skills.</span> <span id="s472">So therefore, the last vacation we had in Lithuania -- now, in Lithuania, but at the time, was Poland.</span> <span id="s473">And why Lithuania was Polish, because you have no -- that’s the whole Lithuania, I will have no problems with it -- with Lithuania, because you can go to the Central Park in Manhattan, you can find the -- the monument of King Leogarro, with the two swords, and there is written under the pedestal, of this monument in Central Park in Manhattan, that this king, and Queen Yadiveega, it was the first confederation in human history of the two states peacefully.</span> <span id="s474">Lithuania and Poland were built now together, big, huge country, yes?</span> <span id="s475">So peacefully created, not -- no single blood was flown, yes?</span> <span id="s476">So, in Lithuania, of course that after the war, first World War was finished, a lot of small countries claim their right to be independent state.</span> <span id="s477">So Lithuania was such a leetva -- whatva -- Estonia, yes?</span> <span id="s478">These country were built due to the treaty in Versailles after the war.</span> <span id="s479">Now, a very powerful man in this political movement was Pilsudski, who created, as I mentioned to you, there was hundred -- with the two hun -- 120 soldier he went to fight, and he was born in Lithuania, in the territory of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s480">And he say, “No, that’s mine, and forget it.”</span> <span id="s481">Yeah, he -- nobody can do this, and he -- if -- he said, “If some -- if the treaty will not accept it, we of Poland, so we will fight.”</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: So you went to Lithuania for the vacation?</span> <span id="s483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: With the scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Is this where you learned some of the skills?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: No, he -- it means that every s -- I mentioned only that the one of my last scouting -- two months I spend there, the last, but in the meantime I was in manning, previously.</span> <span id="s488">But this was the more -- my heart, I was lost there, in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s489">This is such a beautiful country, that you have my imagination.</span> <span id="s490">And it -- in the nature, the rivers, history.</span> <span id="s491">The Polish poetry, like Padameetskavi is one of the Polish biggest poets.</span> <span id="s492">He was born there, too, and his biggest poem was related to the Lithuania.</span> <span id="s493">His poem -- he opens -- he opens this poem, a very famous poem, Pamapdayoush, he open in this way, [speaks Polish].</span> <span id="s494">I will translate.</span> <span id="s495">Leetfo -- my fatherlike -- my -- yes?</span> <span id="s496">He, in some way, he is not saying that Leetva was totally not recognize.</span> <span id="s497">It was always recognize, yes?</span> <span id="s498">But these Lithuanian people -- strictly Lithuanian, they -- they accepted this, oy -- and they are always saying oh, adam mitskabich.</span> <span id="s499">He is a Lithuanian, sorry that he wrote in Polish.</span> <span id="s500">Yeah, but this is the case.</span> <span id="s501">So -- but this is only a certain animosity occurred because of the proud, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Too much proud.</span> <span id="s503">And now, personally, yes, I am answering the question.</span> <span id="s504">Lithuania is Lithuania.</span> <span id="s505">I know that this is the place where he -- Jusef Plusetti was born, and Adam Mitskavich was there, but Lithuania was Lithuania.</span> <span id="s506">So maybe you -- on this case you will find my character in some way, that I am not a chauvinist is very -- how to say it?</span> <span id="s507">Is not - - I am not a chauvinist, shortly speaking, yes?</span> <span id="s508">So, I am open-minded, I want to respect this, and bart -- what I’m saying, that I love Lithuania, doesn’t mean that I have [indecipherable] Lithuania is mine.</span> <span id="s509">And now, in this -- in this territory, survivor.</span> <span id="s510">In some way military education.</span> <span id="s511">We get the military map, very accurate, you know, one kilometer was one centimeter.</span> <span id="s512">And we get a one Polish zokey -- money.</span> <span id="s513">And we get our task force, say.</span> <span id="s514">We are going from here to here, in three days.</span> <span id="s515">You have to pass these -- all places, and this is the straightforward, not roads, because there wasn’t roads, yes?</span> <span id="s516">You have a compass, map, money for survival in the case that you can buy something.</span> <span id="s517">And you have to pass this route going from the place to place, and you have to get the stamp from the authorities of the village, or some places.</span> <span id="s518">There are -- you -- y-you realize this fact, that in every village, there is a so-called vuid.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t know how to translate it, yes, who -- who is administrator from the government side, yes?</span> <span id="s520">Now he had the stamp, he sign it, and so on.</span> <span id="s521">And in this way, you have to go by three days, alone, through the forest, from place to place in three days.</span> <span id="s522">Of course, we did it sometimes, these routes in the zastiempi, in the very small group, yes, five, six, seven boys.</span> <span id="s523">Same [indecipherable], yes?</span> <span id="s524">Now y -- this was so-sometimes more difficult because a route was made by the -- our leaders, yes, that you have to cross the river, yes?</span> <span id="s525">It was a no mo -- no bridges, yes, you have to find a way that you have to be on the other side, yes, and so on.</span> <span id="s526">So this was a survivor.</span> <span id="s527">This was a very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How old were you?</span> <span id="s529">A: At that time I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And how did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I did it.</span> <span id="s532">I did it.</span> <span id="s533">I can tell you that the one -- no, this -- this -- this last one was -- I was 14, because you see, I now recognize this fact that my route was drawn by our leader through the military exercise polygon.</span> <span id="s534">You know what does it mean?</span> <span id="s535">A polygon?</span> <span id="s536">I don’t know how to translate.</span> <span id="s537">Evongsplatz in German, which, it be a subject, the -- th -- what is this, the -- that the -- that the military training ground --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Like training school?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: -- oh, training ground.</span> <span id="s540">And I approach my g -- then, and there was a post of the soldier.</span> <span id="s541">I say, “Hey, where are you going?”</span> <span id="s542">Did you hear what there is going around in here [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s543">And you hear, [makes whirring sound].</span> <span id="s544">The guns shel was passing, and whum!</span> <span id="s545">Yes, there was a so-called [indecipherable] it was not a ex -- i-it was a -- the shell was a real shell, yes.</span> <span id="s546">So if I would be there, I could be killed.</span> <span id="s547">So at that moment I opened my map, and asked to the soldier, he was very respectful for me, oh-oh.</span> <span id="s548">So no, no, so you have to go -- you have to go now this, this, this, and so on.</span> <span id="s549">This was another six kilometers more, yes, and I did it, yes.</span> <span id="s550">A-A-A-And this was a -- a very big pleasure.</span> <span id="s551">Adventure.</span> <span id="s552">Adventure not only this, because you see, I -- when I have to go and to sleep, of course I can do this.</span> <span id="s553">On the ground, with my, you know, rucksack, yes, backpack.</span> <span id="s554">But this is a very romantic [indecipherable] of Poland, that there you have small houses, so- called -- you see, Poland are very attached to the nobilities, but nobilities -- not only very high ranking nobilities, you have a certain gradation of nobilities from grafs and so on, going down, down, down, down, and you have a nobility which we call in Poland shlakta.</span> <span id="s555">It means that these were the previous soldier in the kingdom, yes, that they get the certain privileges from the king, including the -- what is this, coat of arm, yes, and name of this coat of arm.</span> <span id="s556">And they get the right to build a beautiful houses, small houses.</span> <span id="s557">Even -- I don’t know if -- if you have a picture of the sort of house that you could see, it was the house where the [indecipherable] was born, and he lived there.</span> <span id="s558">Such a small house.</span> <span id="s559">And we -- crossing this country, we tried to find such a place.</span> <span id="s560">And we get there beautiful -- no -- treatment, yes?</span> <span id="s561">But very -- but this is -- was a dying, dying history, yes, when I came to such a house, and there was this sitting old man, and he, “Hey, boy, what are you doing?”</span> <span id="s562">And so on.</span> <span id="s563">I say, “May I ask you, sir to spend the night here?”</span> <span id="s564">Ooh, so at once he called somebody [indecipherable], “Prepare this room for this boy,” and so on.</span> <span id="s565">And this was such a nice -- and you are [indecipherable] homes full of history, full of different picture, carvings, and so on.</span> <span id="s566">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s567">So this was the -- my -- my experience of the -- such a -- exercising this scouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Tell us about your health.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Health, oh.</span> <span id="s570">It went that -- I didn’t mention very important fact in my life, that being four years old, I was a victim polio, in Kieltsa, there was epitome 17 cases of the -- of this illnesses, and -- and I was paralyzed at the time from the -- the lower part of my body, and -- and therefore as -- as I mentioned is that I have a small compart with my brother, because when I recover, and when I started recover my ability to walk, I was cripple.</span> <span id="s571">I was walking in very special way, you know, very big movement from side to side to -- to move the legs in the direction.</span> <span id="s572">And step by step, day by day, year by years, my improvement was very big, and -- and I -- I recover almost all my ability to walk, and to this extent that when I was say, 15 - 16 -- this is the occupation time, I had no visible -- visible -- no visible effects of this.</span> <span id="s573">And at the moment I remember that when I was trained by the very big sportsman in Poland, the medalist of the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936, he train us to jump.</span> <span id="s574">He was a -- a dec -- decathlon -- decathlon.</span> <span id="s575">And he exercise us, and all the -- you see this the occupation like maybe we will [indecipherable] to this [indecipherable] in occupation.</span> <span id="s576">So I recover, and I was good swimmer, especially because it was given order by the doctors, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim.</span> <span id="s577">So swimming give me a chance to build up again the muscle.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Do you know if the other children in Kieltsa were able to recover like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Believe me I didn’t want it to mention.</span> <span id="s580">There was only one.</span> <span id="s581">You see, I was born, and my mother told me strictly, “You are not born to us.</span> <span id="s582">You are born on [indecipherable] what is written [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s583">“But,” she said, “you were born in cap.”</span> <span id="s584">You -- you know the legend if somebody’s born in cap, ifchukgu ouradzoni, it means that he is the very lucky person.</span> <span id="s585">I was born in cap.</span> <span id="s586">So, and my -- my name would be Woodsian, you know, terrible name, and when my godfather, Jusef Kameeta, who was invited to be my godfather, he say, “What?</span> <span id="s587">Woodsian?</span> <span id="s588">Never.</span> <span id="s589">He will be Tadeusz Kashoushka.”</span> <span id="s590">So I am Tadeusz, because of his will.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Think back to when you first began to perhaps hear what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s592">I don’t know if you might have heard it on the radio, maybe your father came home and was speaking of it.</span> <span id="s593">Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s595">I have some -- some recognition -- not ne -- re -- not recognition si -- no, admit -- I remember [indecipherable] speaking.</span> <span id="s596">When my brother, as I mentioned to you too, he was a student in the aeronautic department, and he was a very good student.</span> <span id="s597">He, as a award, he was sent to Paris on the Internationale Exhibition of the Aeronautics, as a student, and he did a -- such a gift from Polytechnic.</span> <span id="s598">And he was traveling from Paris to Germany to Poland.</span> <span id="s599">And when he was traveling through the Germany, he had a double [indecipherable] and he told me -- these things I remember -- that in Berlin, he was almost abused by some German because he didn’t speak German, and is a -- ridiculous that he -- consider him that he’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s600">And he just had a problem just to get the lead off this followers who tried to -- to -- to -- to do something with him.</span> <span id="s601">But I remember this.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">That’s one story.</span> <span id="s603">But another story -- Q: This was someone in a train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: At the train station in Berlin somewhere.</span> <span id="s605">Q: Okay, uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: And -- but anyway, he was admirer of Germany because of his progress technologic.</span> <span id="s607">He was -- you understand, he was how to build the planes, and so on, and at that moment, you know, the yoomkers, you know, with big, very famous planes and so on, and was for him, you know, recognized and a-as a professional [indecipherable] were there, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">You -- you -- you follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: That’s the only one of -- of the Germans he is thinking about.</span> <span id="s611">Of course, that -- this the impression about this Volkswagen, you know, this was another story, yes?</span> <span id="s612">Jesus, how many cars?</span> <span id="s613">You know, the -- everybody has a car, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s614">So this was this, but the other part of this, he said, “There -- I was almost beaten there, because they consider me that I’m Jewish.”</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: And what was the conversation like between you?</span> <span id="s616">Did you speculate about what was going on?</span> <span id="s617">Was it surprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Oh y -- yo-you see, this tension started many -- maybe two, three years before the war occurred.</span> <span id="s619">It was a big recognition of the problem that is growing with the German, because demand, you know, maybe you were -- ma -- you rec -- you know where the bigger -- beginning of the aggressive movement on the German was annexia of the Austria.</span> <span id="s620">Then was an action of the Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s621">And this was a very big shame for Poland, that’s a terrible.</span> <span id="s622">You know, the German enter into the certain territory of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s623">Poland enter at the certain territory of Czechoslovakia einder, which Poland claimed that this is the Polish.</span> <span id="s624">And this is a shame.</span> <span id="s625">I -- I -- even at that time, my father -- oh, my father was terrible.</span> <span id="s626">What they are doing?</span> <span id="s627">What they are doing, you know?</span> <span id="s628">And you know, Czechoslovakia under the big power.</span> <span id="s629">And [indecipherable] you see, there was -- this will never happen when Pilsudski was, only now, only now.</span> <span id="s630">This was the -- this -- his officer, you know, from the peersha brigada, you -- you follow me?</span> <span id="s631">These people did a very bad historical movement.</span> <span id="s632">Because later, in few years, we get the same from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s633">So, y-y-you -- you know that this was a -- and therefore, as I mentioned, this is start to grow our concern, what will happen, how will we -- how will -- we will be -- how will we behaves?</span> <span id="s634">And then was the first demand of Hitler, yes?</span> <span id="s635">That he want to have the -- a railroad line across the Polish territory from Germany to East Prussia.</span> <span id="s636">Then, started to claim the Dansk -- Dansik is German.</span> <span id="s637">Absolutely ridiculous because you can call the any time -- any town, you can call it, because the Gdansk is a harbor, was created by the Hunza.</span> <span id="s638">Hunza it was a merchant organization who, along the shore of the Baltic Sea, and North Sea created the harbor for the merchant.</span> <span id="s639">For the handling, for the transportation of goods back and forth, yes?</span> <span id="s640">And Gdansk was built as a harbor in some way by the people -- not the people, by the company -- like you remember that -- what is -- what was Carlotta in the very beginning?</span> <span id="s641">Carlotta in the very beginning - - beginning was a company country, yes?</span> <span id="s642">So in the same way, Hunza built -- not claim the -- not claim the -- that this territory belongs to, but they started to build the wa -- the town.</span> <span id="s643">And with all background, yes?</span> <span id="s644">And -- and never consider is that this is the -- wa -- that this was not -- not a -- not a such a country like Hunza.</span> <span id="s645">Hunza was a -- it was a company, yes?</span> <span id="s646">So this was a -- a very strong -- Hitler said, “This is German.”</span> <span id="s647">This line has to be -- and is growing, and growing, pressure, exploded in some way, and I was participating in this event historical, and of course, at the time, Minister Beck, owsen minister, made a speech.</span> <span id="s648">On the 15th of August, and I have always problem to translate what is Herpen, Herpen is August.</span> <span id="s649">So this was the 15th day, and this was anniversary when the Polish -- 120 Polish, under the leadership of -- of Pilsudski started to war, and he said, openly to Hitler in some way, “We will never give you -- our coat to you.</span> <span id="s650">We will never give you a button from this coat.”</span> <span id="s651">I remember this word nyoldami never gozheeka.</span> <span id="s652">This button you will never get from us.</span> <span id="s653">And this was a strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: [inaudible] which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Ee?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: It was exactly ’39.</span> <span id="s658">I remember I came from the scouting camp, and I went to visit my -- my [indecipherable] parents, as I mentioned, you know, Titusk, Kameeta, and so on, and we -- I was with my godfather, Jusef Meeta.</span> <span id="s659">He took us, yes, me and his children who went to the special place in Borna korkoski.</span> <span id="s660">A -- a field, yes, special bornia field, this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s661">And there was this big gathering, and at this gathering owsen minister said, “We will never retreat from this [indecipherable] man.”</span> <span id="s662">And believe or not, this was the 15th, and 23rd of -- of September.</span> <span id="s663">The paratroopers -- not paratroop -- paratroopers, no.</span> <span id="s664">The parachuters, yes?</span> <span id="s665">The special units of the German army already invaded a very strategic pass in Tutramounti.</span> <span id="s666">Because order was given by the Hitler that this is the day to begin the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: In -- in August of ’39, after that speech, or perhaps even before it, were preparations being made that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: To -- were peop -- I guess I want to ask, what were people expecting, and what were you and your family expecting?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: You see, this was a only patriotic reaction.</span> <span id="s671">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: We will fight.</span> <span id="s673">And build up of our -- I have am -- a big feeling about myself, oh I am strong, and I can resist, of course.</span> <span id="s674">It was, shortly speaking, it was stupid, yes.</span> <span id="s675">It means that megalomaniac.</span> <span id="s676">I am using a wrong word.</span> <span id="s677">You see, when you are proud, you can build up -- no, no, I am strong enough to fight, and so on.</span> <span id="s678">Let’s try to fight, yes we will fight.</span> <span id="s679">But without -- without calculation, you have to calculate how many planes you have, how many guns you have, how many things you have, with whom you will fight?</span> <span id="s680">With the bare hands?</span> <span id="s681">Yes, and this was the case.</span> <span id="s682">That soldier, Polish soldier in battle in the war in 1939 fought with the bare hands with the tanks.</span> <span id="s683">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s684">No, this is how -- I will tell you, because I -- I was the witness of this, yes.</span> <span id="s685">When the Polish cavalry attacked with the -- with the -- with the almost [indecipherable] yes, the German tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So tha -- at that point, you knew there may be a battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s688">I -- even I remember in my -- my -- in my -- my cousin [indecipherable] because I went apart from this day, because I know, in my -- my uncle -- my grandfather say, “Not ta -- Tad, go back home, yes, because is very bad.”</span> <span id="s689">This a -- this was the 20th, yes -- yes a -- is not yet first, yes, of September, “you have to go back in to -- to family, because,” -- and I know that this is [indecipherable] wrote in this memoir.</span> <span id="s690">When the -- when the war is behind it all.</span> <span id="s691">To memorize this, and so on, and I wrote.</span> <span id="s692">And when I was in Poland, she show -- show -- show me this inscription, and -- and [indecipherable] if you said it was some preparation, yes, there was a -- a mobilization, and the -- there is a -- the soldier had to go, you had a certain no -- documents to be in the certain military units and so on, and slowly Poland prepared to do war, but anyway -- and this came to us as a big surprise, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: What was your father doing, and your mother, and [indecipherable] and your brother [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah -- oh yes, absolutely, I -- I remember everything this day, this morning.</span> <span id="s695">I opened the radio -- no, uh-huh, first of all, I not yet know.</span> <span id="s696">It was already the preparation for the war was ordered in some way that -- of course, I know I -- lucky guess, but I knew, everywhere, people are doing up to now, they saying, we -- we tape the window glasses by the paper, yes, to avoid when the blow will hit the glass, and the bomb, and there will be no shrapnels from these glasses, and you will avoid -- first of all, you are strengthening this window, and you are avoiding the splintering of the glasses.</span> <span id="s697">So I, at that moment, day before, and at that morning, I was busy to tape the windows.</span> <span id="s698">And I opened the radio, and I hear the pom per om pom pom per ad da da da dum.</span> <span id="s699">It is Polish anthem playing, and then there will be a -- appeal of the president Ignacio Mashtitski.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">And I am listening.</span> <span id="s701">Today at five o’clock, German army crossed the border.</span> <span id="s702">We are in state of war with Germany.</span> <span id="s703">I jumped on the balcony, my father was doing somewhere, and I said, “Father,” [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s704">I say, “It’s a war.”</span> <span id="s705">He didn’t recognize what I am talking about.</span> <span id="s706">“What?”</span> <span id="s707">I said, “It is a war.”</span> <span id="s708">And at the moment I remember that his voice burst into the cry, “What?”</span> <span id="s709">Once more again he was asking.</span> <span id="s710">I say, “Is a war.”</span> <span id="s711">And he ran upstairs, and was listening, and he said -- because he knew, he knew [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s712">There is no chance, yes?</span> <span id="s713">That’s end.</span> <span id="s714">And of course, this was beginning of the episode of our -- we are calling this rising -- not rising, jammi, because the -- very soon knew, of course, that we saw this first battle fight -- fight by -- by the planes over the Warsaw, this -- you know, this sounds of the machine guns from the area [makes machine gun noise].</span> <span id="s715">This was a fight in here.</span> <span id="s716">And then came this morning, a [indecipherable] with brother of my father from another part of Warsaw and bring this big, huge part of the bomb.</span> <span id="s717">And see, because there was a, “[indecipherable] bombing?</span> <span id="s718">No, that’s not true.”</span> <span id="s719">And he’s taking a [indecipherable], “Look at this, what does it mean?”</span> <span id="s720">And then was a appeal of the mayor of the -- of the -- after a few days that the eight of September, that appeal to the people that all mens who are able to carry the duty, they have to lead the force in Poland -- Varbarshava, and have to go into the eastern direction.</span> <span id="s721">And now, my brother.</span> <span id="s722">He was a worker in the Institute of Aeronaut -- Aerodynamics of the Polish -- Polish nay -- Polytechnic, he was the worker at that time, scientist, and -- not scientist, mo -- scientist, yes, part of the -- of the staff of the Polytechnic, and they got the order for evacuation of this institute into the east, too.</span> <span id="s723">And he was separately, he -- he [indecipherable] say, “Good-bye, maybe we will see each other,” and he gone.</span> <span id="s724">And then -</span></p> <p><span id="s725">-</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: You did get a chance to say good-bye?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh yeah, yes, he-he came to the home, he was prepare -- he took the rucksack, he would take the -- some blankets, and so on, and he departed with the Institute of Aeronautactics.</span> <span id="s728">And I -- I was at that month, as I say, exactly 14 - 15, I begin.</span> <span id="s729">And ha -- my father told me he is decision family, we are leaving Warsaw all together.</span> <span id="s730">Mother, father, me and two sister.</span> <span id="s731">And we started to go, yes, and this was the hour, no, or the saya, no, it’s not the saya, this is -- was a -- hard to say, this was big tragedy because hide -- at the moment I saw everything possible that war is giving us.</span> <span id="s732">We started to go with the crowded roads, together mixed, the soldier, people.</span> <span id="s733">One is going this, another is going this.</span> <span id="s734">And so on, in a couple hours they are flying these planes, German, and bombing these, and you can see more and more graves, killing horses and so on.</span> <span id="s735">Smell of -- of war.</span> <span id="s736">You can see burning houses.</span> <span id="s737">And this was a -- because this is -- this was a first experience of this.</span> <span id="s738">And we didn’t walk too -- very far when we were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s739">I think it was 17 September.</span> <span id="s740">We were in the very small village, Kitchkee, I remember forever, and we get a message from the soldier, that Soviet Union is fighting on the eastern -- our border.</span> <span id="s741">Is attacking us from behind.</span> <span id="s742">So our departure into the east was useless, yes?</span> <span id="s743">So therefore my mother, and my father yes, they made a decision, we are staying here in this village, and we will see what’s happen.</span> <span id="s744">And Warsaw -- and very soon we -- oh, we -- we had a contact around there, for the first time, you know, my father was -- I considered my father that he is a -- a little bit coward.</span> <span id="s745">I always consider his resistance to do something that this the sign of his cowardness, which it was -- which was wrong.</span> <span id="s746">And maybe this --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: I don’t understand?</span> <span id="s748">Co-ward?</span> <span id="s749">A: I -- coward, coward.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Coward.</span> <span id="s751">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Coward, yes, so.</span> <span id="s753">Some sort of coward.</span> <span id="s754">H-He sm -- his resistance to do something, to be -- to be patriotic and so on, because he [indecipherable] father, but there was one day, when we -- everything was just in one bigs mixture of the army, this army, Polish army, almost like a partisan war.</span> <span id="s755">And in one place we were on -- on the road in some -- a crossing road, and suddenly, unbelievable, Polish army is gone, yes?</span> <span id="s756">Cars, cavalry, yes, and the running, and my father, I -- I saw his first time that he jumped because he was a policeman, yes, he was -- he knew what is going on, yes?</span> <span id="s757">He jumped on this criss- crossing of this lot, and asks of this commander, “Where you want to go?”</span> <span id="s758">And he said, “We want to go there, and there.”</span> <span id="s759">So [indecipherable] like aragu -- you like be in the Russian [indecipherable] yes?</span> <span id="s760">With the commander of the -- at the -- at the corner of the street.</span> <span id="s761">This way, this way, yes?</span> <span id="s762">So he did -- get, and he stood in this criss-crossing, and he say, “There are German in opposite -- not Germans backwards.”</span> <span id="s763">It was like this Polish army went like that, but German was on this road, yes?</span> <span id="s764">My father was standing and saying, “Go there.</span> <span id="s765">Not here, not here, because there are the German.”</span> <span id="s766">So they -- they went there.</span> <span id="s767">Believe me it was in one minute my -- my father was still standing on this corner, and dshhhooo, they are going the -- the German -- German -- the -- with tanks, and the tanks, and -- and military [indecipherable] armored [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s768">And he had enough time just to jump out from this street.</span> <span id="s769">And the people [indecipherable] want some of the action.</span> <span id="s770">And then these people entered on the lot where the -- these Polish troops went, in some way creating impression that this road is not used.</span> <span id="s771">And German, they was confused, they went to go, and ssshooo, went there.</span> <span id="s772">Of course, that this was not very long time because they have no chance, yes, and sooner or later there was five.</span> <span id="s773">But not at that point.</span> <span id="s774">And moment I see, ho, ho, ho, my -- my father is not -- is not a such great coward.</span> <span id="s775">[indecipherable] I can say.</span> <span id="s776">This is the os -- episode of this.</span> <span id="s777">And then we stay as four -- four more days and then we get a message that Warsaw, on the 27th of September, surrounded.</span> <span id="s778">[indecipherable] town for -- fort -- this was big tragedy, you know this was how badly was demolished for -- we might -- that’s the first victim of my family.</span> <span id="s779">A girl, three years old.</span> <span id="s780">It was a daughter, it was my cousin, daughter of my -- of brother to my father.</span> <span id="s781">He working in hospital by the bombing.</span> <span id="s782">They -- they bomb everything.</span> <span id="s783">Hospital were not respected.</span> <span id="s784">So she was dead.</span> <span id="s785">Of course, then there -- we came to the Warsaw, first contact with the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: What made your father and mother decide to [inaudible] A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No -- we knew it, yes, already, yes.</span> <span id="s789">We get the message that the Soviet Union is fighting on this part.</span> <span id="s790">So our -- our looking for the freedom in the east, it was just dreaming [indecipherable] bad -- wrong thing.</span> <span id="s791">So why don’t we -- let’s go home.</span> <span id="s792">Come back home, and then fine, we would find what we -- how this new time will be, and we’ll see -- and we approach the Warsaw, and there was a [indecipherable] German surrounding the -- in the Warsaw, and -- with the guard still standing, aiming into the Warsaw, and they say, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s793">In German, and “Home,” yes?</span> <span id="s794">And they just resp -- not respected the -- kee -- making such a movement [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s795">And -- and of course that -- only this street, not -- not something because you can have some mine -- some -- yes, because there was some prepared by the Polish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s796">So they have to go only this [indecipherable] and the -- at end of the day, we -- we found a home, not totally -- not destroyed, but there was na -- no window, yes, everything was blown away.</span> <span id="s797">And that home was still home, yeah.</span> <span id="s798">And this is the beginning of the occupation.</span> <span id="s799">Of course, this is the beginning of a new chapter which -- which is a -- very long, because we -- we were, as I mentioned to you that suddenly the whole life was wiped out.</span> <span id="s800">No supply, no electricity, no water, this, and so on.</span> <span id="s801">So we started -- and winter was very severe, you know, at the time.</span> <span id="s802">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s803">Big frost.</span> <span id="s804">But we managed to -- to cover everything, and ha -- ha -- and ha -- and this is the case.</span> <span id="s805">So September, October, we started to dream about the school, and I was already in -- visitor the school, asking the professors if we -- when we will started to do something, and so on.</span> <span id="s806">Yes, [indecipherable] were enthusiastic, “Don’t worry, we will very soon begin.”</span> <span id="s807">And so on.</span> <span id="s808">So we did it.</span> <span id="s809">The school started.</span> <span id="s810">But -- because there was not even from the German side, there was no yet -- not yet order given.</span> <span id="s811">They didn’t know what they will do with us, yes?</span> <span id="s812">And -- and after a -- say two weeks of our presence in the school, in the di -- director, Yeski said, “And now we have to wait what the German authorities will give us.</span> <span id="s813">But be will contact with us, because if -- if we will have no permission to open the gimnasium, we will do this secretly, yes.”</span> <span id="s814">Yes, in Poland, you have the whole education system working in conspiracy, including the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: This is September 21st, 1998.</span> <span id="s818">We are in Arlington, Virginia, doing an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s819">And this interview is with Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s820">And it is tape number three.</span> <span id="s821">And let’s begin where we left off, which was really school, and what was going on with school?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: So, as I mentioned, in the very beginning of the occupation, we went to the school, for the very short few weeks, maybe days, it’s hard for me to remember.</span> <span id="s823">And then, when we came one day, and that director of the school, Yarosh Yishki, his name, and [indecipherable] what’s means honey, he was such a sweet man.</span> <span id="s824">And he said, “We will be in contact with you, either when will be a commission to do something legally by the authorities, or we will start to teach you in conspiracy.”</span> <span id="s825">Of course, I think that it was something very hard for me to remember the exactly -- but in the very beginning of the springtime, it was organized by the German, so-called -- I -- I will tell you in Polish maybe, because later I will try to translate it is [speaks Polish] grade two.</span> <span id="s826">It means that -- meaning this was that the -- are the schools preparing the student for the profession -- profession.</span> <span id="s827">Zebador.</span> <span id="s828">It means that this here, the time you can see, yes?</span> <span id="s829">That the German established the -- that we can learn something, but only to be a, say, professional, like a mechanics, whatever is, es -- mechanics, I don’t know, carpenter, anything.</span> <span id="s830">It means that -- meaning of this arrangement was just to -- that description of the future Polish people is to be a worker, slave.</span> <span id="s831">And I -- so we started in such a school, but of course it -- the picture were the same.</span> <span id="s832">So between the program established by German, there was secretly delivered history of Poland, language Polish, and this what was strictly forbidden from the -- to -- to maintain the identification of the -- identity of the student, yes.</span> <span id="s833">We are</span></p> <p><span id="s834">--</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: If it was -- how was it secretly done?</span> <span id="s836">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Would they do it in the class, or would -- what were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, yes, and no.</span> <span id="s839">It means that history, and so on, was made on the complete -- we are saying complett -- complete a group of students, yes, assigned by the professor, they were in private apartment, yes, and there was a teacher, yes.</span> <span id="s840">But if there was a legal given, say for example this was a -- no, just writing, yes, you know, you have to teach the writing, and -- a-and some grammary, and so on.</span> <span id="s841">So in this class, there was a l -- Yensik Poleski with the literature selected for us, almost according to the program established by the Minister of Education in Poland, which Germans say forget it, yes?</span> <span id="s842">No, we did it.</span> <span id="s843">And besides, at that moment, conspiracy wi -- to do something illegal in the school, it was maybe illegal for the authorities, but it was not illegal for us, because you -- we identify us very easy.</span> <span id="s844">We know who we are, and there was no totally for -- not the foreigners no, the strangers, yes?</span> <span id="s845">So we know that we are between the Polish student.</span> <span id="s846">So this was easy, yes.</span> <span id="s847">It was because I say, but something that was strictly forbidden, like history and so on, we made it in complete, i-i-in -- in -- in totally di-different places, yes.</span> <span id="s848">But something were -- was, according to the Ministry of Education, Polish, yes, was made by the professor voluntarily, yes?</span> <span id="s849">In spite of the order of the authorities.</span> <span id="s850">Because there was no guards standing in the school, yeah.</span> <span id="s851">And this is the case.</span> <span id="s852">And at the same time, yes, we scouts, our doushina, the first WAGD started to operate.</span> <span id="s853">So we had -- we started power gathering, yes, continuously, like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s854">But not in the school, but somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Tell us about that first meeting.</span> <span id="s856">Who -- who called it, and what did they say, and did you understand that it was something secretive?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s858">We know each other, yes, very good.</span> <span id="s859">And there was a certain kierarchy in our commandant, yes.</span> <span id="s860">And there was a meeting, and the first meeting, say for example I was -- I was in the group with the -- the name was lion -- lion, roar, roar.</span> <span id="s861">And at this meeting came our higher commander, and he say, “We will do this secretly as previously.”</span> <span id="s862">Of course that you are now total -- and it was not yet very well, in the very beginning, organized, but the system started to operate that there was a certain schematic presentation.</span> <span id="s863">The line of the command, yes.</span> <span id="s864">Because there was such a line of command, even in the scouting, Polish scouting, yes.</span> <span id="s865">There was a hartsmish, you know, or -- or commandant of the rayon -- region of Warsaw, then you have this.</span> <span id="s866">So this was starting to -- and this was the very beginning, there was not yet -- because you realize this fact, who can -- who could do this?</span> <span id="s867">We.</span> <span id="s868">And therefore, we are the group that we started to operate in 1940, in March, as an organization.</span> <span id="s869">We have already more or less established the schematic line of order, yes?</span> <span id="s870">But of course, we didn’t know what it was, yes?</span> <span id="s871">And these documents were collected, and were in storage later by the special emissary, yes, who traveled.</span> <span id="s872">Later, was organized quite eerily, the day where the couriers that crossed the borders going through Yugoslavia, Italy, to this way, to search for the -- to deliver the second document.</span> <span id="s873">Then when this was established on the military bases, because the intelligence of the -- of the -- of the British, yes, was involved in this, yes, to -- to fight, to use a people certainly, to organize people in Poland as a help -- as a resistance movement.</span> <span id="s874">And these certain documents were transferred.</span> <span id="s875">And believe me or not that my documents I found not in Warsaw, I found in London, exactly my name and my sowdo -- sudo, yes?</span> <span id="s876">Sowdoyen, yeah?</span> <span id="s877">It -- it was, and it, up to now.</span> <span id="s878">And those documents I have here.</span> <span id="s879">And -- and -- and of course that this what was scouting.</span> <span id="s880">It was like a signal to the higher authorities, yes, because you -- y-you realize that the Polish government in exile have here the representative in Poland.</span> <span id="s881">And they started to organize the very well military organization, yes, military.</span> <span id="s882">Spy, and so on.</span> <span id="s883">But -- but this scouting, yes, this was like a signal, do something because people are, yes?</span> <span id="s884">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Explain that?</span> <span id="s886">It was a signal?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Signal to the higher authorities --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: -- from the representative Polish government in exile in England, they have here the representative, yes?</span> <span id="s890">They have -- it was already -- it is very hard for me to -- to tell you, because I -- I know, and I can find it yes, very easy, i-in -- in the documents -- historical document, yes, how this was established, day by day and so on, and who was the saygoneero grotrovetski, yes?</span> <span id="s891">It was the first commandant of the -- of the home army.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: But, is what you are saying is that this was somewhat a spontaneous thing, and the fact that it was there was a signal to the powers in exile?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Ee, yes, yes, except this was -- y-you have to realize that it was a big chaos, yes, chaos, yes?</span> <span id="s894">And -- and there was a -- nothing was -- i-it was completely everything in ruin, military, militarily.</span> <span id="s895">Poland as a militare was not existent.</span> <span id="s896">But they were a scouting groups in Warsaw, and these groups was very -- very few of them.</span> <span id="s897">You see, all together you can -- you can find that there was as about 3000 in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s898">But these 3000 give the idea that this is possible to do, yes?</span> <span id="s899">And now, Polish government in exile, started to organize this - - from the very beginning, by the nomination of the existing officer of the Polish army, and so on, and this was nominated that he is the -- responsible for this, this is responsible for this, and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s900">And these organizations started, but this was one year later, yes?</span> <span id="s901">And the system was this, that sharda sheray, yes, in -- with the scouting organization was called gray troops.</span> <span id="s902">Like, I -- I can translate in this way, but sheray shalagy.</span> <span id="s903">I have this small anchor, there the symbol, symbol of -- of -- of this organiza -- this scouting organization.</span> <span id="s904">I -- I maybe -- maybe later I will show you this.</span> <span id="s905">And this scouting organization were this more mature, and more responsible authorities, yes?</span> <span id="s906">They get contact with everything, and at the moment they fight.</span> <span id="s907">This is the case that we are now, this organization from England, this we are recognizing, you know?</span> <span id="s908">But we have to re- establish our skin.</span> <span id="s909">And they say no, from 18 up, yes?</span> <span id="s910">They say.</span> <span id="s911">From 18 up, they are recognize as a member of the regular [indecipherable] so-called first what ZWZ.</span> <span id="s912">Zionvic Walki Zibronia.</span> <span id="s913">And then this or -- this even organization was not yet very well organized.</span> <span id="s914">The next step was the Akar, Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s915">Because the Zedvouszet was another spontaneous organization corresponding to the Farasheragi, but not yet established and connected to the government in London, yeah?</span> <span id="s916">Then when government unde -- no, on all these groups found the table to talk -- not to talk, this -- this was not a politic, yes, but to establish the action, yes.</span> <span id="s917">And say, for example, that there must be only one organization, yes?</span> <span id="s918">So therefore, we were part of the Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s919">The Akar, Home Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: But you weren’t 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes -- no, no.</span> <span id="s922">At the very beginning -- the very beginning, I was 15 - 16 - 17.</span> <span id="s923">But, I will tell you that we -- we made a very professional job.</span> <span id="s924">First of all spying.</span> <span id="s925">Collection of the information of the German army movement.</span> <span id="s926">Collection of the information of the location of the army -- German army, storages, and so on.</span> <span id="s927">I had -- besides, there was like another very intelligent sabotage.</span> <span id="s928">You see, Germany used such a slogan, All redare meesen rollen feerdon zeke.</span> <span id="s929">Always have to roll for the victory.</span> <span id="s930">So they give us a signal that we have to do something, that this raider -- that this will -- will not roll.</span> <span id="s931">And there was a very small, very nice sabotage, which was easy to do by us -- for us.</span> <span id="s932">To see -- to pour the sand into the bearing of the wheels.</span> <span id="s933">So every person --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: To put the sand into the -- A: Sand into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Bearings?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Bearings.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Of the wheels?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Of the wheels.</span> <span id="s939">You know, in the railroad, what is axle?</span> <span id="s940">And you have two wheels, and you have here the box.</span> <span id="s941">And in this box is a -- a system that is greasing, yes?</span> <span id="s942">This.</span> <span id="s943">This was easy, quite easy to open on the cap of this, and put the sand.</span> <span id="s944">So, if is -- it was possible in some way to do this, we do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Take us back.</span> <span id="s946">Take u -- take us through that event.</span> <span id="s947">You -- you -- when do you leave your house, what are you wearing, who are you with?</span> <span id="s948">What time --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Ah, what time is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Please tell us the story of doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yes, immediate -- we had the gathering -- we have the meeting places.</span> <span id="s952">It was everything coded, yes?</span> <span id="s953">There was a -- if we use between us, say what will be the meeting, so we said oukashki, or w-whatever, you see?</span> <span id="s954">But this was not really my point, yes, exactly the -- where you are -- we meeting out outatka, yes, and ya -- Aldoni Street, yes, no, no.</span> <span id="s955">It was one words and we know where to go.</span> <span id="s956">The name -- there was no more name.</span> <span id="s957">I was boy, yes?</span> <span id="s958">Not Tadeusz, not Marchaj.</span> <span id="s959">Boy.</span> <span id="s960">It was enough to know, aha, that’s him.</span> <span id="s961">Another story where we participate.</span> <span id="s962">The system of the printing, of the legal -- i-i -- illegal publication, you know, it was a such bulletin information Army Krajowa.</span> <span

this is the -- you -- you see th-this is known.</span> <span id="s1015">[indecipherable] we knew, and we know now, yes, when and where these people were killed.</span> <span id="s1016">This is the impielmiree.</span> <span id="s1017">And this -- this place is very well documented.</span> <span id="s1018">So even I - I -- I wi-will jump to the -- because many, many different ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: This has been a year, maybe a year and a few months after the beginning of the war, but - or the invasion of Poland, that -- are th -- is this the first time that the Germans are rounding up professors --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: -- and killing them?</span> <span id="s1022">That didn’t happen as far as you know, any earlier?</span> <span id="s1023">Because there were these mobile killing units, the Eisengrupen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: I don’t know if you had heard about that happening any earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: You see now -- i-is -- is the dow -- this is absolutely political -- not a political, this was the -- on the order of the certain responsible for this action.</span> <span id="s1027">Some people thought it is of German and Hitler establishment, yes, that what we will do with Poland, yes?</span> <span id="s1028">First of all, if you are cutting the heads of the leader, you are cutting the heads of the nation.</span> <span id="s1029">So they was absolutely action which was already prepare and plan.</span> <span id="s1030">And this action was always in permanent -- permanent -- p-permanent was this action.</span> <span id="s1031">And Palmieri only was the versy first massive execution.</span> <span id="s1032">Because later on, if they found this, that this man is very important for us, yes?</span> <span id="s1033">Take it away, yes?</span> <span id="s1034">And for this purpose was the Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1035">How many people were -- went to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1036">Auschwitz [indecipherable] in the very beginning, this is the ’40 -- 1940, and so on.</span> <span id="s1037">And -- and later -- of course, this is the history [indecipherable] what -- what Auschwitz was for the Jewish people, yes?</span> <span id="s1038">This is the later phase, yes?</span> <span id="s1039">This was order given by the German authorities to -- what was this, the final -- this was special name.</span> <span id="s1040">And -- which is related to the -- to the Jewish extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Fi -- Final Solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Final Solution, yes.</span> <span id="s1043">This was -- this happened after America give the -- started to war in Germany.</span> <span id="s1044">This is ’41.</span> <span id="s1045">The Final Solution I think started in ’41, yes?</span> <span id="s1046">After America started to war with Germany.</span> <span id="s1047">You see, I don’t remember, and I have to read it now, you see, to re -- to memorize this part exactly, but maybe you know, where the massive, Final Solution order to be given.</span> <span id="s1048">Not in ’39, not in ’40.</span> <span id="s1049">This was a little bit later.</span> <span id="s1050">Because i -- you -- ee -- I remember that in it -- when I was traveling to Slominiki, during the occupation, in the very beginning of [indecipherable], it was almost like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1051">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1052">They suffer in the same way like any Polish people, yes.</span> <span id="s1053">But then, yes came, yeah, take it away to Kraków ghetto, or somewhere, yes?</span> <span id="s1054">Or kill them in this place, yes?</span> <span id="s1055">And [indecipherable] this is the -- here, w -- this order, you know, was probably, when you are starting to -- to re -- to look at these documents, this was in co -- cooperation with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1056">In the same way, Soviet Union perform action against Polish people, in the we -- east.</span> <span id="s1057">You know how many intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s1058">The prisoner of the war, you know, the -- all officers in Polish army, that was captured by -- by Soviet Union were executed, yes.</span> <span id="s1059">Why?</span> <span id="s1060">Well, because when you are cutting the head, you are cutting everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So the -- the -- do you remember hearing about the death of your three professors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Y -- not so -- not at once, but it was a -- a -- you realize this fact, that massive execution, it was secretly done.</span> <span id="s1063">But this came to the public knowledge a little bit later.</span> <span id="s1064">But, what’s happen in Palmira, later in the few years later, happen publicly, as the execution of the hostages on the state.</span> <span id="s1065">And in such a execution of the hostages of the state, was Keit, my cousin.</span> <span id="s1066">Very shortly -- very short -- no, maybe -- zi -- again, y-you know, it [indecipherable] to do this -- to grab this interview, but you are touching a -- a certain problem that -- that -- that maybe is good to show you, and mention in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1067">Now -- now -- no -- no -- maybe next time.</span> <span id="s1068">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Tell us what happened to your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: You see, it to -- happened to my three cousin.</span> <span id="s1071">But one was executed, hanging by head publicly at the very famous place in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1072">There is a -- a chateau, Tass Vaviddo, very old, you know, maybe thousand years old, mas -- yes?</span> <span id="s1073">So at the -- at the base of this castle there was executed 20 people by hanging.</span> <span id="s1074">Two others my cousin just were arrested, they were captured when the prinkit, the information, yes, harsis [indecipherable] from the scouting.</span> <span id="s1075">He was captured by German on the inflagrante -- the -- the sport, yes?</span> <span id="s1076">He never -- he -- we knew that he was tortured, yes, to -- to reach the point farther away, yes?</span> <span id="s1077">No, he just -- he -- he died.</span> <span id="s1078">Just simply he was tortured to death, and we don’t know even where he was.</span> <span id="s1079">And we have two of them such.</span> <span id="s1080">This is me -- in Auschwitz is a -- my another cousin ferder my mother.</span> <span id="s1081">Yes, he died, yes, he was just -- he went to the Auschwitz, and then after, quite a short time, he was -- he vanished, yes, perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: These cousins are the cousins you used to go visit, and spend summers with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yes, it means that -- no, no, these cousin -- these cousin that in the summertime, Kitous and Barbara, they were spare, if I can say it.</span> <span id="s1084">It i -- it is nothing happened to me, but his father and my -- my grandfather -- no, and -- what does this say, I said not the grandfather, he was a godfather, yes.</span> <span id="s1085">He was when the freedom in the first day of so- called freedom in 1945, he was arrested by the ent over there, and he went for a few years in the gulags in Donbas.</span> <span id="s1086">When he came back, big man, he was -- weighed 40 pound -- 40 kilos, yes?</span> <span id="s1087">So he was skin, and this.</span> <span id="s1088">And he came, he was at least to die here.</span> <span id="s1089">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1090">But this is -- what I am saying, another part, because this is after ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1092">At this point where is your brother?</span> <span id="s1093">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1095">Of course you know that my -- my brother, you see, besides of the certain -- the problem of the family problem, he was at this age, yes, that he tried to do something on his own, yes.</span> <span id="s1096">He -- he -- I was dependent on my -- my parent’s care, of course that I work, as a worker somewhere, to earn a little bit money.</span> <span id="s1097">And my -- my -- my son -- or my son, my brother, yes.</span> <span id="s1098">He started to work somewhere in the certain company who build something in -- what was the bwonia?</span> <span id="s1099">Some place they build some roads and something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: He came back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1102">He Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1103">And then in -- of course it -- i -- i -- y -- y -- you -- you can -- of course he was in the conspiracy, university, he studied.</span> <span id="s1104">In the very beginning he now -- you see, because he -- he left home -- home was always home for every [indecipherable] yes?</span> <span id="s1105">If he had a idea ha -- I was to do something, yes?</span> <span id="s1106">He went, and he tried to earn some money, yes.</span> <span id="s1107">But generally our home was base for us -- for us.</span> <span id="s1108">And in spite of, I would say, somebody at the age of 26 or something like that, they should be independent.</span> <span id="s1109">But this was a very special time, yes, that -- that his profession was very good, in the peaceful, when he was working in [indecipherable] army, where you have the [indecipherable] in -- i -- i -- i -- during the war.</span> <span id="s1110">So there was a -- the -- we tried to accomplished our l-life almost day by day.</span> <span id="s1111">You see, y -- I say, when I started to work somewhere, yes, that I have [indecipherable] work for half year, yes.</span> <span id="s1112">And I earn some money, yes, to help the parents.</span> <span id="s1113">And then, you see, at that moment, this is the case, which is worse to -- to lie about it, how a empty place, when the Jewish people were eliminated in the life of Polish peop -- of Poland, in this vacuum place, th -- another people entered.</span> <span id="s1114">And they started to make a business, yes, a business, make a life what since thousands of years, yes, Jewish people did all over the world.</span> <span id="s1115">In some way, this was -- call it opportunity, i-it was a empty place.</span> <span id="s1116">Suddenly, from -- from the town of Slominiki, 3000 people vanished.</span> <span id="s1117">We -- this was not action of the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1118">They were taken away by the German according to this Final Solution, yeah.</span> <span id="s1119">Of course, that -- what is here the [indecipherable] now I will -- I am antery with something.</span> <span id="s1120">You see, people always identified the same by allegiance.</span> <span id="s1121">Majority of the Jewish people in Poland were Orthodox Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1122">Very -- they established they life in the Orthodox way.</span> <span id="s1123">You can see, yeah?</span> <span id="s1124">How?</span> <span id="s1125">Black suit, a special hat, the -- this now, what is this, paysa -- paysak -- th-the -- the air -- hairs, yes, are long.</span> <span id="s1126">They -- they were -- even they will try to hide, they were always recognized by Germans.</span> <span id="s1127">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1128">Now, in the very beginning there was some promises given to him.</span> <span id="s1129">Oh, we are sending you to another establishment, and so on.</span> <span id="s1130">And now I am coming to the very, very special situation, and we -- our family, and Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1131">In our home, in home that was base of our family -- this was a nine apartment house, there was living a couple, Mr. Majinski, Rudolf Majenski e Stefania Majinska, that was known for my parents.</span> <span id="s1132">Later I was informed by father, because he was a great conspirator, I didn’t know that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s1133">I -- I knew only when something happened, very dramatic.</span> <span id="s1134">My father knew it.</span> <span id="s1135">Now, who was my father?</span> <span id="s1136">I tel -- I told you, my brother was in organization Armia Krajowa, I was in organization Shara Faragi bayana Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1137">My sister, one younger sister was in Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1138">The older sister, she started to be married, so forget it.</span> <span id="s1139">No, Mother was not, but Father was, and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1140">But officially, yes, he was in organization so-called Zhigotta.</span> <span id="s1141">Where did you hear something like that?</span> <span id="s1142">Zhigotta was a selected -- is not military organization.</span> <span id="s1143">The purpose of -- existence of this organization was to recognize potential enemy of the Polish people in this territory, and protect the people who need the protection in this te-territory.</span> <span id="s1144">And father -- because my father was a previous policeman, he had a contact with the Polish precinct, because during the war there was a German police, and there was also called a -- a -- another pol -- police which cooperate with German.</span> <span id="s1145">Yes, big name cooperate.</span> <span id="s1146">In any country you have to have a police, so it’s better to have the police -- Polish police than German police, yes.</span> <span id="s1147">So this -- in this policemen, there were people and people.</span> <span id="s1148">Y-You follow me, they were -- because if somebody’s in the power, and he want to do this, and this the war time, fine, I -- I’m a god, yes.</span> <span id="s1149">So he used the power for the wrong purposes.</span> <span id="s1150">So my father had the, in this precinct, a very -- policeman who were very sure like he Polish, yes.</span> <span id="s1151">I can tell you that my first shooting with the gun was -- but shooting only for exercise, yes, was I used the gun of the policeman, who gave us ammunition, and he go and try to shoot, yeah.</span> <span id="s1152">So there.</span> <span id="s1153">And my father was in contact.</span> <span id="s1154">So through these people, he knew a lot of the different things that will happen and so on.</span> <span id="s1155">So first Majinski, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Sunday, there came a message from the police precinct, Neho, Majinski sa -- are the -- the conspirator.</span> <span id="s1157">Next day there will be Gestapo to take them away.</span> <span id="s1158">Now, you realize this fargit, to be involve, if -- if you will prove it, Gestapo will prove it, yes, that you are hiding these people, physically, yes.</span> <span id="s1159">Now, say for example that somebody has a hidden place.</span> <span id="s1160">Fine, at the moment if such a case happen, this family who try to hide these people, bang, bang, bang in spot.</span> <span id="s1161">In this case, not -- my father was a owner of this home, so in some way again, this police -- because the -- the police shoo the duties, yes?</span> <span id="s1162">So my father get a message, warned them to get away, because they will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1163">And in some way this policeman from the precinct presented this case maybe to Gestapo maybe in such a way that may be presented the Marchaj, Neho is a -- is a owner of this house, and look at this, this pi -- yes.</span> <span id="s1164">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1165">That simple.</span> <span id="s1166">He and she, they were Jewish, definitely, but I didn’t know -- they are Mrs. -- Miss -- Mrs. Majinska, Stephania was the chairman of the very ca -- very known in Poland charity organization for the poor people.</span> <span id="s1167">The Mr. Majinsky, Rudolf was a -- a doctor, at the age at the time about 70.</span> <span id="s1168">And you see th -- you -- you have to know that there were cases that some Jewish people met and other Jewish people who were involved in something, and he just send the message, oh, you are this, here, and bang -- zekonds perasi, a-and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: What did your father say that made -- to the police, that made the Gestapo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: It means that the message came to the -- from Gestapo to police precinct to prepare action.</span> <span id="s1171">But by this bypass to Neho Marchaj came from this policeman who knew, get the message from Gestapo that they will be taken away.</span> <span id="s1172">So now, ma -- Marchaj, as I mentioned to you, he was involved to -- to search for such information, so for a -- my father, police precinct was a source of information, too.</span> <span id="s1173">Of course h-he had averiman information -- I don’t know even, you know, I -- how broad knowledge of my father was.</span> <span id="s1174">So he -- they were taken away at once.</span> <span id="s1175">My father found the place.</span> <span id="s1176">They were taken away about six, seven blocks in the same area, in south Katinpatou, and vanished, yes.</span> <span id="s1177">The -- the pr -- the wa -- the -- the -- the -- the table in kitchen was arranged in such a way that these people left this place almost half an hour ago, yes?</span> <span id="s1178">It was a still hot water, this and so on.</span> <span id="s1179">And really, next day came, and they found empty, empty, empty room.</span> <span id="s1180">But of course, all -- me, father, me -- mother not, but me, brother and sister, the -- we get out from this, no -- because we didn’t know what -- what will happen, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Your father hid them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yes, he arranged the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1183">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yes, so -- and they survived.</span> <span id="s1185">You know, they survived later, they -- they -- they found son of the Majinsky, Stanislau Majinsky and Hilda Majinsky, they were living in Saskacampa, and they survived -- all survive.</span> <span id="s1186">And the next day, they came back looking that this camouflage, yes, that they departed was just coincidence, only maybe they will come back.</span> <span id="s1187">They came back, the Gestapo, and found the apartment in the same way.</span> <span id="s1188">So they get the knows, yes, they know -- they knew at the time, yes, that they get out, yes.</span> <span id="s1189">And at that moment, why my father was badly beaten by the -- by this German -- by Gestapo, and they throw him into the basement.</span> <span id="s1190">And believe me or not, Stanislau Majinsky, who was the witness, who came the same day when Gestapo come back again, he came to ask father about something, but he ran to the different apartment.</span> <span id="s1191">My father was beaten and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1192">Now, what’s happen only, and this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Were you there when your father was beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Beaten, yeah.</span> <span id="s1195">Only f-from this, you know, from this hatred, you know, that somebody’s escaped, they have no proof in some way, maybe as I mentioned to you, maybe in some way Gestapo was involved by somebody from this precinct.</span> <span id="s1196">Not mar -- Marchaj, he’s a owner, and they make it a lot of maybe some movement, Majinsky?</span> <span id="s1197">They are Jewish?</span> <span id="s1198">You follow, they -- you can do something if you ca -- if you -- if you want to do something.</span> <span id="s1199">So happily, yes, happily, it was not very big damage to our family, yes?</span> <span id="s1200">Now, another story of action of my father.</span> <span id="s1201">He had a friend.</span> <span id="s1202">I don’t remember now his name, but -- first name, but I remember very good name, Sigoua, who was the machinist of the first class machinist before the war, and first class machinist either are leading the -- in the express train, or the freight train.</span> <span id="s1203">The -- the -- to -- to -- to -- to be machinist of the express train, obviously has to be responsible man.</span> <span id="s1204">In same way, if you are making a transport of the freight train, very long, loaded and so on, a first class machinist has to be.</span> <span id="s1205">One day, and I was witness at that time, he came to our house, and very moved, and he say, “Neho, I was in the [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1206">“What’s happened?”</span> <span id="s1207">“I delivered the transport of people to Birkenau, and do you know, I didn’t know that I am going there, because I,” -- at that moment very rare, was -- is -- was not yet very public, yes?</span> <span id="s1208">Maybe such a case is like Sigoua case.</span> <span id="s1209">Send the message to the world.</span> <span id="s1210">And he said to my father, “These people went for dead, to be killed.</span> <span id="s1211">And I saw it by my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1212">I was inside a delivery train to the -- to the oven.”</span> <span id="s1213">And he described [indecipherable] and say, “I cannot drive now, unless I will do something.”</span> <span id="s1214">And he asked my father.</span> <span id="s1215">“Please, I want to change my name, I want to have the document for me and my family.</span> <span id="s1216">I want to have a place on the next train, but not with the people, but some military train I will derail.”</span> <span id="s1217">And that’s [indecipherable] he got a new document, and his name was, I remember Bojenski, they changed name to Bojenski.</span> <span id="s1218">He left home, took family, and vanished.</span> <span id="s1219">And as he said, with the transport of the military train to the east, with his -- and for this man was prepare the same, yes?</span> <span id="s1220">And he derail in this special place, he know what to do, how to derail the train, yes?</span> <span id="s1221">You know, at the certain point where it was a curvature, and downhill, yes, he just put the full fa -- power, and jumped from the train, and the train [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">And this is the history [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1223">So this is what I’m saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Did your father -- when did your father tell you that story?</span> <span id="s1225">A: This was just after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: After.</span> <span id="s1228">But I was the witness when he was talking about this -- Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1229">Q: Oh, you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1231">When he came to my father, I was present.</span> <span id="s1232">When he was talking about where he was, and what he did.</span> <span id="s1233">Because he was -- he suddenly feel guilty, but he didn’t -- he -- he never knew, he got a destination point this and this and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1234">They -- they not inform [indecipherable] Mr. Sigoua you are taking the train with [indecipherable] to be -- Jewish people to be killed, no.</span> <span id="s1235">So this was a -- two occurrences where I know.</span> <span id="s1236">I can tell you only another, that when my father died --</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Just one second.</span> <span id="s1238">When you heard him tell that story -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: -- about going to Birkenau, what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Oh, boy.</span> <span id="s1241">You see, this was a nightmare for everybody.</span> <span id="s1242">This was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1243">You see, i - especially, you see, I have no thoughts or feeling at that time, but you know, later I was, after the war, one of the first visit to the south when I was again visiting my parents, yes, the -- say, godfather, yes.</span> <span id="s1244">I visited the -- the Auschwins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Auschwitz -- Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1247">I visited almost -- I can’t -- no, I don’t want to be cruel -- not cruel, but to hurt somebody by telling.</span> <span id="s1248">It was almost hot, because this was in -- in -- I was there in May after the war.</span> <span id="s1249">So, ’45 May.</span> <span id="s1250">I never was yet at the time in Stutthof when I was a few times ish -- in -- in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1251">Oh, Birkenau was absolutely terrible, especially when -- if you are visiting Birkenau, or Auschwitz, or if somebody is making the picture, movie, it’s just impossible.</span> <span id="s1252">You have to smell this.</span> <span id="s1253">You have to -- to touch this mad -- this -- this -- everything.</span> <span id="s1254">But y-you see, that’s a -- and what -- what is our reason is just to avoid this, but not by the remembers.</span> <span id="s1255">Of course we remember, but to do something that -- that people will make a conclusion frim remembrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: But when you heard that story, did you s -- did you and your father exchange any thoughts, was there -- did you know before you heard that story that exactly that was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Do you know -- I will tell you something, what’s a -- what was the occupation?</span> <span id="s1258">You are a subject of the German power, not a object that you can do something in reality.</span> <span id="s1259">You were only a hunted animal.</span> <span id="s1260">Do you realize how many places is in the Warsaw where 40 people in spot were shot?</span> <span id="s1261">Dra -- men remember, yes, a special plaque built into the wall.</span> <span id="s1262">Is over 600.</span> <span id="s1263">This is only the every day -- daily bread, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1264">So this was not a sensation for us at that moment.</span> <span id="s1265">This was normal, yes?</span> <span id="s1266">You are -- you were -- you left home going to the town, yes, and suddenly say, very usually -- usually this was the place, your train entered the bridge, and suddenly -- this was always the point where you are crossing a dangerous line, yes?</span> <span id="s1267">Because very many times, you have to go to the bridge because you have to go from here there.</span> <span id="s1268">But one end, and under, then suddenly you see the crost by the -- by the police German, yes?</span> <span id="s1269">And then trains stop and they are coming to the -- get out, you, you, you, you, this way, please, this way, yes?</span> <span id="s1270">There were special -- we -- we call it buda, vudit, yes, a keester, a case, or I don’t know how to translate swo -- the word buda.</span> <span id="s1271">And they load it, and usually these people who were in such a car, never come back.</span> <span id="s1272">Now, during the war, lo -- you have to be in some way -- you have to use the authorities of German, and therefore I -- I will mention for you who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Stop you right there, cause I feel like we’re getting ready to tell a story, and -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1274">So we’ll come back on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: This is September 21st, 1998.</span> <span id="s1278">We are in Arlington, Virginia, wi -- doing an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1279">The interview is with tad -- Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s1280">And this is tape number four.</span> <span id="s1281">What I’d like to begin with is if you can tell us -- tell us about how the resistance that you were involved in was organized.</span> <span id="s1282">How did you know when to gather, how did you get assignments?</span> <span id="s1283">And I want to go through some of these details with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: I’m trying to memorize -- to recall.</span> <span id="s1285">The first rule of conspiracy is the secrecy.</span> <span id="s1286">So, my contact, and everybody contact in organization, where the final solution could be a debt, yes, there were maintained very certain rules.</span> <span id="s1287">Don’t talk too much.</span> <span id="s1288">If something happen, answer only questions.</span> <span id="s1289">You cannot go beyond the questions, because you are introducing yourself in very big trouble.</span> <span id="s1290">Of course, in our organization, yes, we were divided in the troops, yes, so they say we -- we call it a gathering, it’s very hard to translate, grupavania.</span> <span id="s1291">That’s a very big unit, grupavania grove, yes?</span> <span id="s1292">What does it mean grove?</span> <span id="s1293">Is a part of the town, grove, and this was a grupavania.</span> <span id="s1294">And this grupavania, this group of certain part of the town was divided in the section, or -- boy, oh boy.</span> <span id="s1295">Platoons, yes, is better, yes?</span> <span id="s1296">And each of these platoon have the number, and who knew?</span> <span id="s1297">Who is in the -- or leader of the certain platoon?</span> <span id="s1298">It was known to the greater ka -- hierarchy, yes?</span> <span id="s1299">Probably even in London archives was only all -- not archives, in London possession was known, I’m guessing only, that they knew ours grupavania grow to even in here, in grove grupavania, there was a leader of this, and he knew who is under him.</span> <span id="s1300">But in general, yes, how is relation, like say for example, as grupavania grove to -- to the commandant of the Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1301">Like Groetravetski, yes, General Groetravetski, he was captured, and -- and he was hold in the Mauthausen for a very long time.</span> <span id="s1302">But anyway, he was killed.</span> <span id="s1303">Then it was -- after him was General Burkomarosky.</span> <span id="s1304">So this was known for very few people, who is this man, and what is his name?</span> <span id="s1305">I didn’t know -- I knew -- I know now, after the war, who was my -- or when -- when we started the open fight during the Warsaw uprising, no, it wa [indecipherable] it was everything open, yes?</span> <span id="s1306">Because there was a meeting of the -- of the leadership, and they knew this, this, this, and at the moment when they knew what’s the name, inu, and everything.</span> <span id="s1307">Family name.</span> <span id="s1308">But during the occupation I can tell you that I know rish my -- my leader of this platoon, I knew who is his -- and of course, I know him.</span> <span id="s1309">I know who is the -- how say, the second in row, yes.</span> <span id="s1310">His pseudo name was Hinshaw, and then ma -- it was my friends.</span> <span id="s1311">Friends who are the member of the platoon.</span> <span id="s1312">And there was as has -- seven -- seven, and everybody has a pseudo, yes, and we know each other.</span> <span id="s1313">Between us there was no problem, yes.</span> <span id="s1314">It was a -- I know that he is in my troop, and of course that he is my soldier, yes.</span> <span id="s1315">And at that moment, of course, sometimes, we exercise, of course, some youth -- youthful stupidity, I can sell you, that we tried to prove how we are very resistance against the pain, yes?</span> <span id="s1316">We could say, [indecipherable] you Gestapo will touch you, and they will be investigated, and you will be beaten and so on.</span> <span id="s1317">Did you say who is next to you, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1318">So I remember that -- of course, as I said, stupidity, because later, when I was really in prison, I don’t -- I can tell you, prison in the Communist Poland, and I was investigated for a very long time, I didn’t know myself.</span> <span id="s1319">I didn’t know myself, camut -- how much I can stand.</span> <span id="s1320">So, you see, what we did, we sometimes, to prove it that I was such a resistance to pain, we -- we -- distinguished the cigarettes on the hand, without crying, yes.</span> <span id="s1321">You know, very naïve.</span> <span id="s1322">But we did it, this was the -- no, I -- I call it this is stupidity because -- because the facts where it was, you were in the hand of the oppressors, yes.</span> <span id="s1323">At that moment is the best way to die as fast as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: How did you know these boys?</span> <span id="s1325">Had you known these boys before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1327">This was the boys from -- I can say, our block, yes.</span> <span id="s1328">The same -- the same territory, yes, Saskacampa.</span> <span id="s1329">And say all of my friends in the -- in the block, three, four blocks area.</span> <span id="s1330">Of course that this is the -- and in these four blocks there was a few platoons.</span> <span id="s1331">You see, everybody different.</span> <span id="s1332">And anyway, we knew because we were in same block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">And I can tell you that say now we are entering -- we are approaching to the -- to the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s1334">So I was attached to the platoon, I -- I have to -- to check it exactly, you see, but later I will give you a proper -- proper number.</span> <span id="s1335">We are assigned to the certain targets for the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s1336">Fortunate then -- not fortunately, our platoon -- few of them, too, because th -- we -- we were not only we, because there was another.</span> <span id="s1337">Our goal was too attack the -- the building -- school building, which was the quarter of the SS regiment.</span> <span id="s1338">You have an imagination that, you know, even [indecipherable] approaching the day, D-day, these are the -- the first of the August, when we started the Warsaw uprising, but you want to touch this problem now, or you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Not -- not quite.</span> <span id="s1340">I’d li -- I have a few more -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: -- organizational questions, but I -- but -- but I do want to know that.</span> <span id="s1342">If you could, just think back and tell us -- give us an example, how would you be told about a meeting, and then how would you be given an assignment, and then how would you do it?</span> <span id="s1343">If you could sort of walk us through that.</span> <span id="s1344">Any example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: You say it, I’m trying to the -- you see, this is such a -- such a difficult problem.</span> <span id="s1346">See, I -- I will tell you that I participated as a courier, yes -- not a courier, carrier, carrier of the bulletin informatseeni.</span> <span id="s1347">This was used like il-illegal publication which were printed, I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1348">What I know, that this assignment came from my platoon leader, yes?</span> <span id="s1349">I mean, he say, “Boy, such and such a day, at this and this time, you are going to the street -- Stanislau Powgas Street.</span> <span id="s1350">There, in the certain point, there will be a package.</span> <span id="s1351">You will take this package, and you will carry this package to the -- to the center of the town.”</span> <span id="s1352">I -- I remember which is forbidden, it was -- but then not to remember, but -- sorry is this -- you cannot have a [indecipherable] and you cannot stop to remember certain fact.</span> <span id="s1353">So wileeta Hosha Street, and we stare ar -- to the certain point, there will be a box, you put into the box, and that’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: And -- and when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1356">I did it, period.</span> <span id="s1357">Yeah, now, another story.</span> <span id="s1358">I -- I know because this is related to my courier activity.</span> <span id="s1359">About how we are e -- how we -- we will use the authorities German, as a protection.</span> <span id="s1360">So I work for a few months or half year.</span> <span id="s1361">I have this document [indecipherable] but I don’t remember now that I was a worker in the manufacturer of the electrical batteries, yes?</span> <span id="s1362">Which were produced for the public, yes.</span> <span id="s1363">Of course, if this such a c -- such a situation it would be worth to make a sabotage, yes, I would be used.</span> <span id="s1364">Say, for example, to put something into the mixture of the battery, to make this battery work less after short time, yeah?</span> <span id="s1365">But anyway, I -- I stop to work this, because I found a better solution for me, and a protection that I was -- it was so cold luft shutz heirbdidst.</span> <span id="s1366">I am saying in German.</span> <span id="s1367">It means that the LHD.</span> <span id="s1368">And this was in translation a service for the -- for the fire department help.</span> <span id="s1369">The front start to approach Warsaw, so Warsaw was faced it will be bombed, we will have the fires, and so on.</span> <span id="s1370">So German authorities organized of course in certain way, the fire department, yes, to make this fire department better working.</span> <span id="s1371">To build the retention in vessels, i - dig in the wall, in the earth, to collect the water for -- to -- for the fire extinguishing.</span> <span id="s1372">And this service, according to my morality, I can say -- not only morality, but my -- my understanding that my work is not a work that will support German military activity.</span> <span id="s1373">Because this what we have, what built, it was for the protection of the civilian people in Warsaw, yes.</span> <span id="s1374">And it was a good protection for the -- another authorities of German, because it had a s -- let’s say certain how to say documents, yes?</span> <span id="s1375">That such and such person is working in department of the -- say fire department in Herakoska traga, yes?</span> <span id="s1376">Will be s-stamp with the -- with the say vrona, say the German eagle, you know, this hakencroitz?</span> <span id="s1377">And in the case of the wapanka -- wapanka, that’s was very popular way hunting for the people, as I mentioned yes, that there’s a bridge, they stop here, they stop [indecipherable] and get out, yes?</span> <span id="s1378">And they you, you, you.</span> <span id="s1379">And that moment, say, for example, this was a document that I could show to the Germans, yes, that I am loyal to them, I’m working for the fire department, which is a -- I don’t want to use this America -- American expression, a work [indecipherable] for -- my work was [indecipherable] but it was working, by even this was not working so good, because this German who a issue as this special document, they said, “But if you will be in the wapanka,” you know, in this stoppage and selection, “in the very beginning, don’t show to the authorities, because could happen,” [makes tearing sound] “and you are nothing.</span> <span id="s1380">So, hold it when you will go to -- for the investigation, at that moment, take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">And it is possible, they -- they told us, that if s-somebody from the febia will know that you were captured, send a message to the fire department, and fire department will know what to do.”</span> <span id="s1382">You see, there was in some way, between the Polish people, and even with the German, because who was this fire -- fire fighter from the German side?</span> <span id="s1383">He was another professional firefighter.</span> <span id="s1384">He was not there from Gestapo, he was not from [indecipherable], he was professional firefighter, to fight the fire.</span> <span id="s1385">So they know what to do, yes?</span> <span id="s1386">And at that moment, these authorities will go to the German Gestapo, or whoever is, this and will reclaim you, unless you are not carrying at the moment weapon, and -- and you are -- you are subject to another activity of the -- of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1387">So this was say where I participate, in ahardai elijli to protect myself.</span> <span id="s1388">Now -- now what was the si -- very frightening situation?</span> <span id="s1389">My father was a conspirator, so -- and I was carrier of the -- of the certain technical documentation or information, or so-called publication.</span> <span id="s1390">And I was neglecting a lot of safety factors.</span> <span id="s1391">So when I have a package, which I don’t have to deliver, strictly from point A to point B, but sometimes I get it, for the distribution between my friends, yes, in Klaus, and I have to keep it because I -- I couldn’t take it and -- and go, no.</span> <span id="s1392">So I -- I put in different places, yes?</span> <span id="s1393">I hide it in different places, and I -- I -- I keep it for one, two, three days.</span> <span id="s1394">My brother was arrested by the Germans, and he was in terrible trouble, yes?</span> <span id="s1395">On the basis of the certain -- not a military activity, because he was a soldier of the army -- Home Army, but for the -- to earn some money, he was involved in certain activity -- I can tell you, simple.</span> <span id="s1396">The alcohol distribution, or production of the illegal alcohol, yes?</span> <span id="s1397">This was against the German law, but not military law.</span> <span id="s1398">And my brother enter a big problem of this, and he was taken by the German authorities to explain his activity, because he was, according to the German law, he was a parasite in this society.</span> <span id="s1399">Yes he had to go for the so-called forcible work.</span> <span id="s1400">He went to the concentration camp, could be sent.</span> <span id="s1401">But now, how the sociality -- sociality, yes?</span> <span id="s1402">No.</span> <span id="s1403">What is this na -- name in -- very famous person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Oh, celebrity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Celebrity.</span> <span id="s1406">He was in -- in -- in Gestapo hand, first, at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1407">And there was a very famous, in Poland, sportsman, as I mentioned few hours ago, that train us.</span> <span id="s1408">It was Aloukelski and Gerouto.</span> <span id="s1409">Gerouto was the decathlon, and Aloukelski was the javelin thrower, and jumper, and so on.</span> <span id="s1410">And both were Olympian.</span> <span id="s1411">And, believe it or not, even Gestapo recognized an Olympian, because he was Olympian in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1412">And believe or not, he went to this certain ranking officer of Gestapo, Mr. Gerouto Rito, and he say fine, I -- maybe I can help him, yes?</span> <span id="s1413">It was a very big risk, yes, because he was a Polish, but he has all these documents, and so on, the Olympiada in -- in Berlin, and he went into the jaw of the beast to -- to try to do something in, and he did it.</span> <span id="s1414">He recognize him, okay, ma -- yavolt, in German, fine.</span> <span id="s1415">But he’s a very bad guy, he’s a parasite.</span> <span id="s1416">He will go for the forcible work.</span> <span id="s1417">Okay, and we know, yes, perhaps he will be transferred from this prison to that prison.</span> <span id="s1418">But this other prison was only the holding place, yes?</span> <span id="s1419">And they were German but not Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1420">And there, if somebody has again connection between the people -- the people, yes?</span> <span id="s1421">You can pay the bribery, and he gets free.</span> <span id="s1422">And this happen.</span> <span id="s1423">And my brother get out from there.</span> <span id="s1424">Okay, so one -- one case is okay, but now what to do with this brother?</span> <span id="s1425">He has to have some -- some documents, yes.</span> <span id="s1426">So there was a [indecipherable] okay, so you know, I was in the -- i-in the fire department, so just what, I have to do this for you, and you will be a firefighter, and you will have this document, that minimum that you have to have, you know.</span> <span id="s1427">Because you cannot be -- survive the occupation doing nothing, or -- you see, because this is what the first act where you were stopped by the -- by the German, yes, documents.</span> <span id="s1428">You are somebody or not, working or not working, useful or not useful.</span> <span id="s1429">Why?</span> <span id="s1430">Because they need only to have the hostages, or something.</span> <span id="s1431">So if you have this, fine, you are in some way prepared.</span> <span id="s1432">Now, how this related?</span> <span id="s1433">Of course that this is a meaningless situation, but I’m saying how life was in Poland.</span> <span id="s1434">I put the -- this certain documents for the distribution in some place that my father found it.</span> <span id="s1435">And this was forbidden for me.</span> <span id="s1436">Oh, reprimand terrible, yeah, if I can find, Gestapo will find, yes?</span> <span id="s1437">And he was so nervous and preoccupy of this what I did, that he forgot that he has to go with my brother to the fire department chapter of the German police.</span> <span id="s1438">And in his passion, he put this -- this -- this document that I was hiding, put into the pocket and went -- at the moment brother [indecipherable] and now, let’s go, we are going.</span> <span id="s1439">And they went into the -- what I say?</span> <span id="s1440">The jaw of the beast.</span> <span id="s1441">And my brother -- that’s the relation of my brother.</span> <span id="s1442">But they -- they passed some gates, and so on, and he’s going somewhere from the fire department, and then he was sit down, and sitting, and something hit, and my brother look into the face of -- of my father, and if he’s paralyzed, almost.</span> <span id="s1443">He found that he has in the pocket something that is that.</span> <span id="s1444">But quietly he went somewhere when this -- they were approaching of this interview, he put into the basket, garbage basket this, ended out.</span> <span id="s1445">Of course that means this -- in this document there was absolutely nothing that related to the person, and so on.</span> <span id="s1446">But this was on the [indecipherable] action of the weapon, or something, how to operate or some -- something.</span> <span id="s1447">So I’m saying that’s the -- this is the -- such a -- traps or occurrences can happen.</span> <span id="s1448">M -- and of course, as I say, this is a meaningless, this has nothing to do with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: No, but it’s telling.</span> <span id="s1450">It’s a telling detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Telling the -- telling you -- telling you that how is it, yes?</span> <span id="s1452">You could be in very big trouble.</span> <span id="s1453">And how to avoid the trouble, and so on.</span> <span id="s1454">Not that’s -- but this is the way how occupation was day by day, that we survived this occupation day by day.</span> <span id="s1455">Now, e -- e -- e -- you see we are very close to sa -- execution.</span> <span id="s1456">I knew that somebody will be shot.</span> <span id="s1457">Even me.</span> <span id="s1458">You see, our dream of everybody of us was to have a weapon, enough to have a parabellum, or to have some FN nine millimeter, or maybe who dreamed to have a machine gun?</span> <span id="s1459">How to find it?</span> <span id="s1460">How to do this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1461">In Saskacampa, this was a part of -- of the town that was at the Vistula River shore.</span> <span id="s1462">And along this Vistula River shore, some very common soldier with the shvesta and -- and other service men and women -- service women, make a walk along the shore, usually afternoon, peaceful situation.</span> <span id="s1463">So we -- this we did what the -- where is the target to [indecipherable] the from the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1464">So we knew exactly, you know, that we were -- there was our territory, you know?</span> <span id="s1465">So, first was the scout, yes?</span> <span id="s1466">What he has?</span> <span id="s1467">Oh, he has a parabellum.</span> <span id="s1468">Fine.</span> <span id="s1469">Besides what?</span> <span id="s1470">And then on the bicycles, bikes, yes, we drove there.</span> <span id="s1471">I am talking about -- because I didn’t know this, yes, but I was very much involved in -- in such action.</span> <span id="s1472">As a -- as a security and so on.</span> <span id="s1473">But the [indecipherable] in particular, and then usually this was a very easy gun, yeah, take it out, and he was very happy to be alive, yes?</span> <span id="s1474">And get out.</span> <span id="s1475">But one case was very different.</span> <span id="s1476">[indecipherable] was -- result was I wasn’t this -- now, I am not saying that -- that persecute myself, but for the re-really fact, but because I was in some way still responsible for this, because I -- I participate many times in such a [indecipherable] is going a officer, what he has?</span> <span id="s1477">FN7 millimeter [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1478">Ah, dream.</span> <span id="s1479">Seven, it was very small, and very handy.</span> <span id="s1480">Okay, who is with him?</span> <span id="s1481">A shvester.</span> <span id="s1482">Okay.</span> <span id="s1483">So they drove it, they stop at him, they pull the gun, and this officer at that moment pulled the hand from the pocket of the -- with the hand -- handgun in this, what was not in the holster, yes, but he took it from there.</span> <span id="s1484">What he want to do with this, maybe he want to give it up -- up.</span> <span id="s1485">It doesn’t matter for at this my friend who s - was standing in there on front of him, he just pulled the trigger, because he didn’t know what he will do.</span> <span id="s1486">This shvester panics, and with the bare hand, jump on the -- another friend.</span> <span id="s1487">Same story, just he pulled the trigger, and it -- it was holding gun to -- to shoot, and he killed this shvester of the Red Cross, and this officer was the medical doctor.</span> <span id="s1488">And both die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: He killed them both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1491">In four days, in this place, they brought the 40 people, and shot to death, as the reparation.</span> <span id="s1492">Now, few days later, I -- my father called me.</span> <span id="s1493">He -- I -- I didn’t told him anything, and he, “Tadeusz, tell different -- I am telling you, and you have to tell all these.”</span> <span id="s1494">And he’s mentioning by name this, this, this, this, this.</span> <span id="s1495">“If this what -- will occur once again, you and all your friends, you will be executed, because your action was absolutely not accepted by the authorities, and you found the result what’s happened in this place.</span> <span id="s1496">This is not a way that you will fight.”</span> <span id="s1497">We get the warning, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: This was a warning from your own command?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: My -- our command.</span> <span id="s1500">But my father knew it.</span> <span id="s1501">He knew it, and everything.</span> <span id="s1502">And he said, “This is not your action.</span> <span id="s1503">When will be needed weapon, you will get it.”</span> <span id="s1504">And, I will tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Because you were trying to just get weapons on your own?</span> <span id="s1506">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: And it wasn’t something that was authorized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No, this was not assign -- yeah, that’s was our private -- private action.</span> <span id="s1509">And this action cost too many lives.</span> <span id="s1510">Of course, as a explanation, as a -- some -- to throw out this guilt, yes, I will say, anyway, these people will be killed.</span> <span id="s1511">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1512">Because the hostages, for the killing, were permarently delivered anyway.</span> <span id="s1513">So -- but I’m just telling you that you -- you will understand in no other way we have t-to do.</span> <span id="s1514">So there was a legality, and there was something illegal.</span> <span id="s1515">Like, for example, there was a execution, yes, yes, there was a legal execution, yes, that I -- what -- what I -- as I mentioned t-to you -- your -- my father was involve to select the people for protection, or select the people to be eliminated.</span> <span id="s1516">And one of such elimination I knew that will be done.</span> <span id="s1517">But again, it was something done that wo -- shouldn’t be, yes?</span> <span id="s1518">Because it was a history of the yacht arina.</span> <span id="s1519">It was on the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s1520">And this yacht arina has on the board, a radio station.</span> <span id="s1521">And in the marina, when this yacht was anchored, was in charge of -- of the marina was Gulka, his name was Gulka, and it was, without any doubt, yes, known and investigated that he is a confident of the Gestapo, and -- and he is guilty the dra -- death of the five boys that were operating the radio station on this yacht, and Gestapo came and they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">One of them jumped into the Vistula River and vanished.</span> <span id="s1523">And he survived.</span> <span id="s1524">And the -- after many months of investigation, it was confirmation, and there was given by authorities, acceptance of execution Mr. Gulka.</span> <span id="s1525">And I knew it.</span> <span id="s1526">And believe me, I met him every day, many times I was on this marina for another reason, because I have a -- anothers -- my small boat, and now a man who was shooting, I knew him very well, because he give me this message.</span> <span id="s1527">“Tadeusz, if you have something, you have to finish the -- the -- some -- if you have some problems with Gulka or you -- the -- yes -- you -- he will be killed.”</span> <span id="s1528">And he came.</span> <span id="s1529">He executed this Gulka.</span> <span id="s1530">The dog, who in defend of his master jump on this guy, he killed his dog.</span> <span id="s1531">But this was, in some way, this is the characters, yes?</span> <span id="s1532">Character of the people.</span> <span id="s1533">He was so full of hate, yes, that he did something what he shouldn’t do, yes?</span> <span id="s1534">He went home, and he kill his wife and child in the creek.</span> <span id="s1535">So you see, character in character, military action, and other military action, you have to recognize that there is a killing which is say, so-called legal by the military norms, but in this case, this is just a simple crime.</span> <span id="s1536">That’s my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Can you describe any friendships you had within this platoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Oh, up to -- no, up to this day, of course, of course that.</span> <span id="s1539">First of all, with the two of them, I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1540">Marchashu Pariski is one, and Bogedon Palmoski is another one.</span> <span id="s1541">I -- I can tell you that Marchashu Pariski, who is a doctor, medical doctor in -- in Warsaw, and Bogedon Palmoski is a architect.</span> <span id="s1542">He was here in America.</span> <span id="s1543">And he survive.</span> <span id="s1544">And I can tell you that Matchie, I just took him, grab him from the behind, I say, “Let’s go from this camp, and go, and you will be a draftsman.”</span> <span id="s1545">Because he -- he think I don’t know how to make drawings.</span> <span id="s1546">I will teach you.</span> <span id="s1547">This is the -- on the appelleplatz in Stutthof, when the meekis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1549">We’re going to get to that.</span> <span id="s1550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: So another [indecipherable], unfortunately he was killed in accident by car.</span> <span id="s1553">Zigmund Paloalouk, very famous name from Bizantium, Paloalouk’s Bizantium.</span> <span id="s1554">He is living in Canada.</span> <span id="s1555">And that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Were you at some point ever trained how to use weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: I mention you -- I mention you that the first -- th-the first and the only shooting from the gun, it was from the police gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: So you were never taken out and -- A: No, no, ye-ye-yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: -- taught how to shoot a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: -- yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1561">Oh, of course, that during the -- our lecturing of the weapon, yes, they were delivered, a certain weapon, the -- just how to operate the machine gun, yes?</span> <span id="s1562">So this was yes.</span> <span id="s1563">It means that we were familiar how to operate, say, Meisner, Schmeitzer, or another gun, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Can you describe where that would happen?</span> <span id="s1565">A: Home, family home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: There’d be some guns in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Yes, yes, of course they’d be in hidden place.</span> <span id="s1568">Yes, it was not on the table, yes, but they were.</span> <span id="s1569">So now, another story, this was a tragedy, yes, a finishing tragedy because at one time, y -- we -- we -- we pick up the deserter of the -- of the German army, and he was staying for two days in the home of my friend, Raphael Padolski, very good painter e Australia.</span> <span id="s1570">And there was a mother, father, and he.</span> <span id="s1571">And now it’s happen he get everything -- help from us to depart somewhere, and -- but he was captured.</span> <span id="s1572">German -- was captured by German.</span> <span id="s1573">And you -- he know where he stayed, and he brought them, and the whole family was taken away to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1574">Father die, mother survive, and Raphael survive.</span> <span id="s1575">And now another very, very strange that something happen, that you have to put your -- your future on judgment of the certain situation which could be a deadly.</span> <span id="s1576">I pick up this -- my order for me, yes fine, go to Raphael, and take the clothes, and everything of this guy, this ch -- this deserter.</span> <span id="s1577">So I took this everything with me, and instead to go home, I went for my service time into the special place of this LHD, the fire department location, which was located in Saskacampa.</span> <span id="s1578">And I took this package, and I put in someplace in this -- in this building, a building there was a -- a-abandoned villa by a very rich family in Saskacampa, and there was a -- our station.</span> <span id="s1579">And fine, because okay, tomorrow morning I will -- I will take it [indecipherable] for hiding, yes?</span> <span id="s1580">I went to the bed, you know, the bank bed, yes, because you have to stay -- service was to stay for the night.</span> <span id="s1581">I -- I -- I hear the whisper, yes?</span> <span id="s1582">People in this room are whispering, and talking [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1583">You see that something is -- something happened, and then I hear you, ask Tadeusz, ask Tadeusz.</span> <span id="s1584">Oh, they found it.</span> <span id="s1585">If you will believing this, there was a -- 40 person in this room, big, huge hall.</span> <span id="s1586">And now -- and I -- I -- I know this guys, this man quite -- you know, with the good character, some alcoholics, some this, you know, because there was a -- the selection of these people, not -- not like me, there was the -- a -- like a coincident that they was there.</span> <span id="s1587">And now I have to answer the question.</span> <span id="s1588">I have to say, yes, that’s my [indecipherable] opened my future to the absolutely unknown person.</span> <span id="s1589">And I said, “Yes, that’s mine.”</span> <span id="s1590">So I have heard only very bad expression in Polish language, untransla -- untranslatable, “Get out from here.”</span> <span id="s1591">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1592">And blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1593">So I took it that, and I go home, and hide it, and nothing happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Did that mean that you never went back to your job?</span> <span id="s1595">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: No, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1598">I came next day after they ansa.</span> <span id="s1599">So, you see, this was a very difficult time in Poland, that where somebody was a Polish, very rare was a canalya, you know, was a -- a bad man.</span> <span id="s1600">In spite of fact that I -- I -- I can tell you, that many of them were simple pigs, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: But did Poles inform on other Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Oh yes, solidarity was.</span> <span id="s1603">And it was very easy to distinguish what the [indecipherable] saying this was the period of time where you recognize the enemy, because this enemy, it was not the Polish.</span> <span id="s1604">But this is another period of my time when I was in Communist Poland, and I was [indecipherable] Poland -- Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: What you’re saying is that during this time -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: -- Poles were supporting other Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1608">No, I di -- I’m giving you the example.</span> <span id="s1609">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: An unknown person, [indecipherable] I course, but I -- I took a good -- good point, yes, immediate.</span> <span id="s1611">Because you see, if I will -- if I would do a different action, and I will say, no, that’s not mine, you see what will happen, some provocation, maybe we will have to send the message to the -- to the police, German, and he is finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: How were you feeling in the middle of these actions?</span> <span id="s1613">Were you afraid, ever?</span> <span id="s1614">Some of these sound very intense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: You see, we -- we were, in the five years, yes?</span> <span id="s1616">’40 - ’41 - ’42 - ’43 - ’44 - ’45, six years, yes, you are all the time aware -- very close to death.</span> <span id="s1617">There was not normal, nothing was normal.</span> <span id="s1618">You know, y -- I -- y-you never knowed if you are going to the Warsaw, if will be back.</span> <span id="s1619">It’s because you are entering a simple operation wapanka, and you a -- you are in trouble, terro -- very serious trouble.</span> <span id="s1620">You see that in -- in Warsaw, there was -- Warsaw was dying as a town day by day, execution by execution, but totally different stories in [indecipherable] which was a act of heroism, yes, and cost Warsaw, a town, and -- of a quarter million people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: So you felt close to death most of the time?</span> <span id="s1622">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Did you feel afraid, or what gave you the courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Just life, and you have t -- you have to live.</span> <span id="s1625">You have to -- you have to survive.</span> <span id="s1626">Therefore I am saying, the sa -- the same story about -- is -- was a -- you can’t compare, you know, this -- the fate of the Jewish people, yes, that’s a totally -- totally different.</span> <span id="s1627">So therefore, I am saying, if there was a -- if there was a Warsaw uprising in ghetto, they were our troops fighting for Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1628">But this was a helpless, this was useless.</span> <span id="s1629">You cannot fight es -- insane -- in the few months later, and this happened to the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1630">You realize this fact, that it was a -- around eastern -- no, [indecipherable] holy, holy period, yes, Easter, yeah, I am saying good.</span> <span id="s1631">It was a end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1632">End.</span> <span id="s1633">It was the final days where the young desperate people said fine, we have to die, die fighting.</span> <span id="s1634">And they started to fight.</span> <span id="s1635">But there was no -- no -- you say -- you see this was a very small scale, yes?</span> <span id="s1636">If you get main ghetto wipe out, yes, was done without any resistance, yes?</span> <span id="s1637">You see, as I mentioned to you, there was difficulties for the Jewish people to -- to try to escape, because these routes were available, yes, but they were so different in behavior, in everything, that -- that they just give up, you know, like in this picture that you see s -- with the hand up, and I am going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Did you ever observe any collaboration between the Polish underground and resistance and the Jewish resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Y-Y-You see, there was no collaboration in so-called ni -- call it peaceful -- peaceful, you know -- there was no uprising, no.</span> <span id="s1640">There was no.</span> <span id="s1641">Because you see, even for us, we have no collaboration with the Communist resistance, yes?</span> <span id="s1642">Even worse, we were punished, we were killed by them.</span> <span id="s1643">We -- as a potential enemy when the Soviet Union will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Human behaviors, yes, only human behaviors, yes, then -- the troops, which were close to ghetto, and this is the certain part of the Warsaw, we were far away.</span> <span id="s1645">They fought from outside into the ghetto, when there was a point of fighting, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: The Polish troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Yes, Polish troop.</span> <span id="s1648">Where there was a -- Q: Your comrades?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1650">Very special troops, yes?</span> <span id="s1651">They -- w -- they tried to fight.</span> <span id="s1652">Ila -- a -- like from the -- from the other side, from the backside of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1653">But of course, this was without any sham.</span> <span id="s1654">This was only act of solidarity.</span> <span id="s1655">But same story, that for us, when we started the war -- abs -- Warsaw [indecipherable] there -- help was six -- 2000 miles away, yes?</span> <span id="s1656">Or, was just behind Vistula River, yes?</span> <span id="s1657">Soviet army.</span> <span id="s1658">So the fly -- flies -- the planes came from the Italy, yes, or from Britain to drop the armament in the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1659">It was one wit -- witness of the one fight -- one -- one flight that was shot down.</span> <span id="s1660">This was a in -- in my eyesight.</span> <span id="s1661">I -- I have the document, I know the name of these pilots, and the crew, and one survivor was found there.</span> <span id="s1662">They -- they -- this was a act of heroism, yes, because you have to realize that suddenly plane flying -- I don’t know, six hours from Brindisi, somewhere in [indecipherable] or some -- somewhere there, they are approaching the Warsaw, Warsaw is in flame, and he is flying over the roofs of the do -- of the -- of the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">And he, pilot, he came this thousand miles to drop in the spot, because if he -- he can fly, you know, and drop someone and get out, yes?</span> <span id="s1664">He was going back and forth, he vanishing the -- in the smoke of the -- of the burning say, and -- and believe me, he did it so many flights, that the Germans at the gun, they knew, aha, he is going the -- we have it, yes?</span> <span id="s1665">He will come from this point.</span> <span id="s1666">And I see the one shot from the big anta -- anti- aircraft, and hit him in the -- in the tail, and the plane went down, and exploded.</span> <span id="s1667">I -- I have the greatest -- the greatest feelings of my friendship to this pilot who did it.</span> <span id="s1668">It was a soldier’s duty.</span> <span id="s1669">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1670">He was trained regardless if he will be killed or not.</span> <span id="s1671">It was a very, very act of heroism.</span> <span id="s1672">No, therefore I am saying that are we [indecipherable] and that’s just behind you Vistula River, just in the face sig -- and this happen, you know, that in this troop standing in the Soviet army, at the Vistula River, they were Polish soldiers, yes?</span> <span id="s1673">And without permission of the commander of the si -- great Red Army, they launch the attack, and started to cross in Vistula River, and they did it, but that’s it.</span> <span id="s1674">They passed the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s1675">They created the bridgehurt, no German heres, and it was cut off, and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: I’m wondering -- we were -- we are beginning now to talk about the Warsaw uprising, so if you could go back a little bit before it begins and set the context.</span> <span id="s1677">What was going on right before it began?</span> <span id="s1678">You know, in the weeks or two.</span> <span id="s1679">Did you know something was maybe being planned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Te -- tell us a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s1684">A: You see, there was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: When it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: -- two -- two concepts.</span> <span id="s1687">This was everything in July happen.</span> <span id="s1688">June, July, August, September, yes?</span> <span id="s1689">This was a very crucial point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: The year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Year, ’44.</span> <span id="s1692">And at the -- at the certain day, I think if it was July, I get the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Mobilization point, go to the mobilization point.</span> <span id="s1694">We know what to do.</span> <span id="s1695">We have to have this, this, this, this, this, and we are going to the certain place, and we are ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: What was it that you had to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: You know it was that -- no, I am saying -- Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: -- you have to take the food, medicine, weapon, whatever it is, some clothes, good shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">We are leaving Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1702">We are going outside of the walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: And at that point you did have a weapon?</span> <span id="s1704">A: Yes, of cour --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: You had been given a weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Yes, immediate -- at that moment we are going to the second point where we will get the weapon.</span> <span id="s1707">Of course that somebody of us had a private weapon, and -- and we -- it -- a decision by the authorities, yes, our Home Army was that we will not fight in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1708">We are going into the forest, and we are starting a regular partisan wa -- war.</span> <span id="s1709">Now came the politic ish.</span> <span id="s1710">Because so -- fine, we are leaving Warsaw, and Warsaw is open, so some of you in -- will enter like to the old towns, yes?</span> <span id="s1711">And we will be in the forest.</span> <span id="s1712">And this, it was political thinking, yes?</span> <span id="s1713">So it means that there is a capital town of Poland without Polish authorities, yes?</span> <span id="s1714">There will be authorities brought with the Soviet Union army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">This was the political issue Q: [inaudible] End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: This is September 21st, 1998, we’re in Arlington, Virginia, doing an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1718">The interview is with Tadeusz Marchaj, and this is tape number five.</span> <span id="s1719">And you were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: To leave the Warsaw, or not to leave the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1721">So, as -- as I mentioned that is no doubt for me now, but very little I know during the time when this decision was made by the authorities, if -- this I know now, but at that time I know as a soldier of the underground army, Home Army, I have to go somewhere, wherever they may ask me to go.</span> <span id="s1722">And of course, the -- the -- it was very easy to understand that this is the only one -- one way to go, is that to go to the compinose kapushta over another part of Poland with the forest, and to -- to continue the fight with the Germans in the form of parti -- partisan action.</span> <span id="s1723">At that moment it was a big motion.</span> <span id="s1724">I can say commotion in the movement of army.</span> <span id="s1725">A lot of evacuated, the authorities si -- i -- of German macht, German power.</span> <span id="s1726">A -- e-evacuation of the unnecessary departments of the army, and ha -- in -- including the -- this was a quite good opportunities to pick up the weapon, because a lot of soldier of the cooperating army with the Germans, were passing Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1727">Hungarian, Italian, and -- and they were very friendly.</span> <span id="s1728">That means that for the food or something like that, you can -- you can buy carbines, machine guns, and so on.</span> <span id="s1729">But this -- this lasted about -- aha, this is the very -- maybe important to mention this was a time when there was a assassination of the Hitler by -- by the -- in Volchance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: The -- the attempt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: The attempt, yes.</span> <span id="s1732">And this was a very big excitement, yes the -- oh, maybe this is the crevend of the war.</span> <span id="s1733">No, it was -- he survive, and so -- so, and then the situation was quiet.</span> <span id="s1734">In order -- and we are s -- we were ready to go in this so-called point of mobilization, which was aimed in home of my father.</span> <span id="s1735">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: The point of mobilization -- A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: -- was in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: -- and because my -- ma -- my troops were very close to us, and this was a -- we had a quite big apartment, so okay, that’s it, and this is the point.</span> <span id="s1739">And then after a few days, they -- not existing is a situation normal, yes, the way things get farther -- further.</span> <span id="s1740">And it passes one month and then it came the first of August.</span> <span id="s1741">And we get the message, yes, that we are attacking -- no, first of all, no, we have to for the gathering place.</span> <span id="s1742">There will be a - our commander, and everything what is needed to perform attack on the -- on the school full of the SS soldiers.</span> <span id="s1743">It is exactly at five o’clock, we -- we gather in the apartment of the shistof, his name was Soukoski, and I remember that he was a very devoted Catholics, Christian, and [indecipherable] the history of Poland, he was -- his name was Soukoski, and he was on the family of the Soukoski who was marshal of the [indecipherable] Napoleon.</span> <span id="s1744">Soukoski.</span> <span id="s1745">He was a -- he died -- died in Egypt, in very strange -- in circumstances.</span> <span id="s1746">Alas, this is not important.</span> <span id="s1747">History is telling that he was poisoned by Napoleon because he was a big enemy of a -- Napoleon, and -- and -- and he had some plans, who knows?</span> <span id="s1748">Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1749">We gather, and he -- and I remember when he has said -- asked us, “Please, go to the knees, and really pray to our God.”</span> <span id="s1750">Oh, boy.</span> <span id="s1751">He use this very old poem, very old poem, probably from the 10th century, when he is praying to the mother of God, [speaks Polish].</span> <span id="s1752">I forget it.</span> <span id="s1753">Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1754">And -- and believe me, this pick up us.</span> <span id="s1755">We were lifted mora, and we just took our weapon, whatever we have, and we started to go.</span> <span id="s1756">And we were passing on the way to the -- our gathering place, my home.</span> <span id="s1757">And at the door was standing my father.</span> <span id="s1758">And he said to me, “Show me what you have to fight.”</span> <span id="s1759">And I had at the time my private 7FN.</span> <span id="s1760">He gave me this [indecipherable], “I would rather allow you to go with the bricks in the hand than with this.”</span> <span id="s1761">And he gave me, here is the weapon, and he gave me the parabellum nine millimeters -- shtuon parabellum with very long -- special edition of this, with the long barrel, and 200 pieces of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1762">I said -- he was not a coward.</span> <span id="s1763">He knew where I am going, but he didn’t say, “Tad, stay home,” yes?</span> <span id="s1764">Believe me -- probably, after my experience now, I will say to my son, “Stay home.”</span> <span id="s1765">We went and we had to approach our point where you had to cross a big, street, and be approaching this street.</span> <span id="s1766">We know that they are movement of the -- of the armored carrier, light -- light wagon.</span> <span id="s1767">So we have to pass this street very fast.</span> <span id="s1768">And when we in group, in some way, we mobilize this big movement, this alarm another post of the German -- the German soldier, and they open fire to us.</span> <span id="s1769">Believe me, this was a -- a -- so frightening that never in my life experienced something.</span> <span id="s1770">Because my friends were in the first line and were jumping to the housing.</span> <span id="s1771">I was somewhere in the middle, and I had to run in the gun’s fire.</span> <span id="s1772">But I couldn’t, so I dropped into the tarfofal field -- potato field, and in this field, yes, th-this shooter, yes, they knew that I am there because I was there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1773">And you have no imagination what does it mean when -- when the shooting is of the bullets is whizzling, yes, above your hand -- head, and you can -- you hear the shots, and -- and bullet sounds, and you can see the potatoes cut.</span> <span id="s1774">It was -- it was a -- it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1775">Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s1776">And we were soldier that we never shoot to the people, to the -- another soldier.</span> <span id="s1777">And we didn’t wa -- we didn’t were -- no, we went -- we were not in the real fight.</span> <span id="s1778">Young chicken.</span> <span id="s1779">So at last -- no, I found from bravery that I say no, now I am jumping, yes?</span> <span id="s1780">I jump [indecipherable] nice, and I -- I see the -- I saw the -- the red brick’s powder, yes, in front of me, because he shoot at the edge of the house, knowing that I will pass this point.</span> <span id="s1781">And I pass, and nothing happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">And believe me, my first -- first was where I can have a droplets of water.</span> <span id="s1783">My -- m -- I’m -- I’m telling only to emphasize the fact that everybody could have the same thing.</span> <span id="s1784">Don’t telling me that you can be brave like -- like hero.</span> <span id="s1785">No, the organs, your body will react in some way -- maybe my body.</span> <span id="s1786">I went into the appletel.</span> <span id="s1787">They are still shooting, but a little bit far away.</span> <span id="s1788">But it is [indecipherable] as you think, my first will was to have an apple and juice.</span> <span id="s1789">And I climb on this -- on -- on this thing.</span> <span id="s1790">I take the apple, bite it, and I was in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s1791">And at that moment, of course, I became right [indecipherable] yes, a story of bravery, Marchaj, who in spite of the fire, he climbed the tree.</span> <span id="s1792">That’s was a very bravery man.</span> <span id="s1793">So no, no, it was not me, not here.</span> <span id="s1794">It doesn’t matter now.</span> <span id="s1795">Time -- and when I get the sip of the juice, I went down in -- into the building where we have to -- supposed to be.</span> <span id="s1796">And then was I -- we found the three guys, very professional tadif.</span> <span id="s1797">The three brothers Rainishevski.</span> <span id="s1798">Three brothers.</span> <span id="s1799">You know the -- as special -- as the special cond -- special diversion -- there was a special name, forget it.</span> <span id="s1800">Doesn’t matter, they were professionally killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: These are Polish?</span> <span id="s1802">A: Polish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1805">But -- tadif.</span> <span id="s1806">[speaks Polish].</span> <span id="s1807">They were giving them special action to execute -- even the execution, yes?</span> <span id="s1808">Or special action to assassinated somebody, and so on.</span> <span id="s1809">So they were very, very brave, you know, it -- they were soldier.</span> <span id="s1810">And they get out from this building, from these fences, and he -- they started to shoot [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1811">Fine, they jump, they empty magazines, you know, of the bullets, and they came back and say, “Who has ammunition?</span> <span id="s1812">We are without bullets.”</span> <span id="s1813">I say, “I have.”</span> <span id="s1814">From my father.</span> <span id="s1815">“Oh, sit down here and load.”</span> <span id="s1816">Yes?</span> <span id="s1817">And to say sit down, they give me empty this and I started to load, yes?</span> <span id="s1818">And they get out for another jump, and again this was the -- the lack of professionalism of these three brothers, because they were surprised by the action of the German.</span> <span id="s1819">German were not in the same place.</span> <span id="s1820">They were a little bit farther to the left or right, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1821">They attention was to look at these direction and to ge -- fire from the sideway, and the -- suddenly the gates opened, and these two brothers are carrying the third one.</span> <span id="s1822">Bloody [indecipherable] blo -- blood from the head, from -- yes.</span> <span id="s1823">And -- and they came and say, “Where are our leaders?”</span> <span id="s1824">Yes?</span> <span id="s1825">Because we came to this place, and there was no single person who will be giving the orders what to do.</span> <span id="s1826">But of course they started to cry, “Where is the sanitary -- sanitary, sanitary,” and so on.</span> <span id="s1827">They move it from another, and took it -- took him to the quiet place, and fortunately he survive, he survive.</span> <span id="s1828">And it was a one of the oldest of us who was thish free Christopher Soukoski, he took leadership.</span> <span id="s1829">And he say fine, we have to move this from this point, because we cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1830">We have to go to the -- another place, and make a hort.</span> <span id="s1831">Yes, he was -- you know, he looks like a -- you know, like a -- I don’t know, bookkeeper from the pousher, you know, but he -- I will never say that he is able to do this.</span> <span id="s1832">He organized us, and we went into the second location, and came the first night, and we put the post, you know, and so on, regularly, according to the certain routine of the military action, and we -- we have a rotation in the -- in the -- to be a -- alive, and searching for the possibility of the German attacks, and so on, but they didn’t think about it, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1833">But, this night we hear the Soviet things.</span> <span id="s1834">They were one kilometer from us.</span> <span id="s1835">No man’s land was between Soviet Union and us.</span> <span id="s1836">They penetrate our scouts, I can say, jump in they direction.</span> <span id="s1837">They made a contact with them, and there was nothing whatsoever, some action and action, and so on , no question.</span> <span id="s1838">And they turn back and went back.</span> <span id="s1839">I don’t know, maybe on this basis, the leaders -- our troop -- aha, of course that our target, this German school full of -- of this, we never attack this.</span> <span id="s1840">Of course that there was another attack on the -- on the bridge fet of the -- the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s1841">Absolutely all of them attacking this day.</span> <span id="s1842">All, n -- even survivor, even the women, there was not.</span> <span id="s1843">They try -- this was -- this would be our future, our fate when we do the same to this professional, this arms up to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1844">So came a quiet, and maybe they give some information about the movement in the front, and so on.</span> <span id="s1845">They made a decision, go to the waiting position in your first -- first gathering, so -- in Saskacampa, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Someone -- a courier came, and gave you a message?</span> <span id="s1847">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1850">Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1851">Some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Courier [indecipherable] group gave you a new message.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1854">It means that, shortly speaking, during the night -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: -- and during the next day, and during the next night, they found themselves, they made a decision to go, that -- give up the weapon, that -- our private weapon, and this which we’ll get from this first place, and go to the first location when we left our territory in Saskacampa going into the gathering place in Grokov, yes, where we were, you know, when -- when this shooting occur with us, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: -- especially in -- with me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1858">But what’s happened now?</span> <span id="s1859">When I came from -- because this is the time that we give the -- give the order us to go home, because this is closer to wis -- to wint -- to Vistula River, maybe we will cross Vistula River, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1860">Our -- our situation was this, wait for the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1861">When I came home, it was a shock in the -- in my home.</span> <span id="s1862">Sister are crying hysterically, “You’re alive!”</span> <span id="s1863">I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1864">“Y-Y-Y -- our mother is looking your body in the field in Grokov.”</span> <span id="s1865">I say -- “One of a -- your men from your group came back, and he said that Tad, especially Tad, is dead.”</span> <span id="s1866">When my father investigated him, how was wearing, what was he wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Describe it.</span> <span id="s1868">And he start to make fantasy.</span> <span id="s1869">“I saw,” he said, “that he was killed by German with his parabellum.”</span> <span id="s1870">He exactly described this gun that I had, this gun that is -- was given by my father.</span> <span id="s1871">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1872">So, my mother was looking for my body, and in the basement I met my father, yes, finishing the coffin for me.</span> <span id="s1873">So, the coffin for me, it was already built.</span> <span id="s1874">But I’m still alive.</span> <span id="s1875">That’s was the end of my participation in Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: What was your mother’s reaction [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Oh my, you have imagination.</span> <span id="s1878">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1879">So we waited for another few days -- not few, this was the 23rd of September, and the -- our territory was surrounded by Germans, as I mention in my beginning of this story.</span> <span id="s1880">We left, because you had to left, you know?</span> <span id="s1881">What does it mean, you know?</span> <span id="s1882">For us, the reality of the Warsaw uprising vanished, yes?</span> <span id="s1883">We were no weapon, no commands.</span> <span id="s1884">We did whatever it was -- has -- has to do, and we went into the Pruszków, yes, by the -- by the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: What did your father, when -- when you went home and told your father about what happened, and that the leader didn’t show up, it -- did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Ah, you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: -- did -- what -- what was his reaction --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: -- what my react -- shi -- you see, he -- my father was a -- he was a quiet man, he was a -- he can burst sometimes, and terrible, yes?</span> <span id="s1889">But in -- in reality, he was very quiet man, and he didn’t blame me, he didn’t do, he didn’t complain about somebody.</span> <span id="s1890">Be happy that you are alive, and that’s it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: So what happened then, at some point, were you ordered to surrender?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: No, it means that at that moment, it was our decision, yes?</span> <span id="s1893">It means our decision -- Q: Group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Groups, yes, because as I mentioned to you, we came back and then, when we went -- when we give up to the -- to the Germans, at that moment we were almost together, yes?</span> <span id="s1895">So decision was, fine, what we are doing, yes?</span> <span id="s1896">The youngest of us, yes, Marix Keptinski, he was so young, that according to this request of the Germans, yes, he was not eligible to get out, yes, he was 16.</span> <span id="s1897">And he stayed, and Matchie Shapinski, me, Zigmund Paolernuk, mys -- my brother-in-law, Paulo Logansun, we went to the gathering place given us by the Germans, and we lost surrender -- peaceful surrender, not as -- as I mentioned to you, not as a soldier of the Warsaw uprising, because if we surrender as the Warsaw uprising says to be honorable soldier, yes, we will be killed in spot.</span> <span id="s1898">At that moment I told you this, that the authorities of the army in the west, under the command Eisenhower, they didn’t send for two -- almost six weeks, the message to the Germans that they have the three soldier of the Warsaw uprising as a prisoner of the war according to the Geneva convention.</span> <span id="s1899">This was after six weeks, in spite of fact we were wearing certain distinction bands on the head -- arm bands, bla -- white and red.</span> <span id="s1900">And at that moment, we should be respected as a soldier.</span> <span id="s1901">Now, this never happened in first six weeks in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1902">Every soldier captured was killed in place.</span> <span id="s1903">Banded.</span> <span id="s1904">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1905">Even then, you know, that didn’t - did was naro -- no rule at all, because the civilian were killed in thousand.</span> <span id="s1906">They used the civilian as a shield in attack to the certain position of the -- of the fighting soldier in Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: But when you went to this place to surrender, what were you surrendering as?</span> <span id="s1908">A -- a Polish citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: No, [indecipherable] that I surrendered myself to the -- a very big, unknown fate.</span> <span id="s1910">Yo-Yo -- you -- you follow me?</span> <span id="s1911">I give up my body, and mind to -- to go somewhere, where German would be leaflets set to us.</span> <span id="s1912">You want to -- you have to -- simply was pick man between the age this and this has to leave the -- Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1913">They will be respected as a people, not -- not so -- but there was a -- in this message there was no mentioning soldier, that pe -- men from age to age, they have to leave the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1914">There was nothing about a soldier.</span> <span id="s1915">If we will do this -- either, exposed the troops, yes, as we are going, and we are the soldier of the Warsaw uprising, they will shoot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Well, so it was a general call for men to be evacuated from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Yes, no -- you so -- simple story, they tried to remove the potential fighters, yes, and to find workers for them -- some work in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Did your father go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: No.</span> <span id="s1920">No, he was as -- over the age.</span> <span id="s1921">That’s the one story, and probably at that moment he -- he was not so stupid to go, yes.</span> <span id="s1922">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1923">We -- yo-yo-you -- you -- you can -- you see this is a psychological problem for us.</span> <span id="s1924">After the shock, we saw ourself that we are zero.</span> <span id="s1925">That - that our -- we give up everything already, and it was only lucky condition, yes, that we survive.</span> <span id="s1926">And now, you realize this is after big emotion, and giving up to fight, and suddenly everything collapsed, I have to build up again something without weapon, without the commander.</span> <span id="s1927">So organize something for what?</span> <span id="s1928">We saw already what’s happened.</span> <span id="s1929">So, fine, we know that if -- or this we will -- this we’ll know at the time very well.</span> <span id="s1930">That if yee -- you were -- if you want to oppose the Germans at that moment, you are killed.</span> <span id="s1931">You are dead.</span> <span id="s1932">So, at that moment we took a risk, yes, to give up ourself into the German hands, but not as a soldier, but as a people that they are asking for.</span> <span id="s1933">We are the men of 18, get out from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: So when you got ready to go to that -- A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Did you say good-bye?</span> <span id="s1936">How -- please tell us about saying good-bye to your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Oh yes, it was a lot of tears, and well wishing, you see, because at the moment my brother-in-law, who was not in the army, yes, because he was already new married man, yes, husband of my sister, but anyway he had to go, yes?</span> <span id="s1938">So he joined us, and -- and other people, too, the neighbors, and so on.</span> <span id="s1939">It not only we, there was a -- from Saskacampa there was 3000 men had to left -- had to leave, and -- and just taking a chance.</span> <span id="s1940">Another chance, you see, to say -- to give up your future into the unknown fate.</span> <span id="s1941">You know?</span> <span id="s1942">What happened with us?</span> <span id="s1943">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1944">It’s -- a chance was a 50 - 50, maybe less than 50 - 50, because in the -- in the history that will follow, I had a very little chance, you see?</span> <span id="s1945">I could be a captured in --in -- I can be locked in the Stutthof, as a inmate, period.</span> <span id="s1946">And could be treated in -- like a 17,000 last inmate in Stutthof, they were drowned in the Baltic Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">You know this?</span> <span id="s1948">Very last group of the Stutthof people were loaded on the barges, and drowned in the sea, wintertime.</span> <span id="s1949">So -- but there was a lesson, of course.</span> <span id="s1950">You -- you see, there was a lesson that -- that -- that he -- we -- I get this lesson, that you have to be active.</span> <span id="s1951">Active.</span> <span id="s1952">Y-Y-You have to do something that you are thinking that this is proper.</span> <span id="s1953">Just to give up themself -- I have an idea what I will do.</span> <span id="s1954">This happened in Pruszków, when we came to the Pruszków, a group of our neighbor, yes, they -- they give up the initiative into the German’s hand.</span> <span id="s1955">It mean that not in such a way that -- to the -- because we were all in the German hands, but they didn’t try to make a own movement.</span> <span id="s1956">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1957">They say, “Oh, I, now I’m here, okay, I will be here, yes?</span> <span id="s1958">I will not do anything unless somebody will touch me for -- by the -- by the arms, and get up.”</span> <span id="s1959">We left the Stutthof in the -- of course, that is the coincident -- we left the Stutthof in the first transport, and we made the decision.</span> <span id="s1960">Now, they are asking us to get out?</span> <span id="s1961">Yes, we are going.</span> <span id="s1962">And we get out, and we enter the transport to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1963">This other, my friends, I call them.</span> <span id="s1964">Inie Pavouschevski, come on with us.</span> <span id="s1965">Yes?</span> <span id="s1966">No, he say, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1967">The next transport went to the Austria.</span> <span id="s1968">Austria, Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1969">None of them come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Let’s go back to your s -- you’re standing around, you’ve been called, you’re surrendering, your -- your -- you’re following this order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: This order from the Germans [indecipherable] A: May I interrupt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Mo -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: S-Sorry.</span> <span id="s1975">I never disobeyed the order of my authority.</span> <span id="s1976">You see, they told me, give up your weapon, go int -- go to this gathering place where you were, and ga -- and li -- wait for the farther orders.</span> <span id="s1977">Sorry, your farther’s orders never come again, yes?</span> <span id="s1978">Because at this moment, yes, earlier and be -- on the September 23rd, German came and say, “Get out from here.”</span> <span id="s1979">Now -- so, yo-you realize this fact, sometimes I am th -- I am thinking on this subject, and I say we didn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1980">Because either I will -- we could fight, but maybe it was n -- I can say providence made the -- another decision with our life, yes?</span> <span id="s1981">At -- maybe they save -- spare our life in this way, and with it, a lot of our life -- in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: How did the Germans treat you when you went to this gathering point?</span> <span id="s1983">What -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: This was a -- you see, there was a very many kinds of Germans.</span> <span id="s1985">Even they were the certain cooperating army from outside Germany, it’s like Ukrainian army, Hungarian army, Lithuanian army, Estonian army.</span> <span id="s1986">Or this is, I will tell you something, because I met very s -- fast aggression, yes?</span> <span id="s1987">The men who hire me in [indecipherable] company -- you realize this fact?</span> <span id="s1988">Men who hired --</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: -- me when I came this, he was a soldier of the Estonian army, and he was in Suchenwald.</span> <span id="s1991">Okay, so what I am saying -- and they’re for.</span> <span id="s1992">In this case, because the guerilla [indecipherable] was a very high authority --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: In Germany, yes, very, very.</span> <span id="s1995">And he -- I -- in some way I am considering ou -- considering him as a -- as a honorable general, because what he said, he -- and promise, he did it.</span> <span id="s1996">If he give the order to do this, he did it.</span> <span id="s1997">And he was not the apparachik Hitler Nazi -- you know, like Himmler, or something like that, no.</span> <span id="s1998">So, but I’m not -- I’m not apologizing him -- making apology for the -- for the action that the -- of the [indecipherable], but when we came to the gathering place, there were army soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Army, not SS, not some -- some unknown people.</span> <span id="s2000">They loaded us to the -- to the we -- wagon, and we had to wait closed in the wagon for about 60 hours, because at that moment they -- there was heavy fight along the train going to the Pruszków.</span> <span id="s2001">And this -- this railroad track was passing through the lines of the Warsaw uprising, and Germany.</span> <span id="s2002">And inside of our train, there were killed people.</span> <span id="s2003">Probably by the -- by the friendly fire.</span> <span id="s2004">Because you see, some Polish soldier saw the train passing.</span> <span id="s2005">Saw the train, German train, so let’s shoot them.</span> <span id="s2006">And we arrived the -- to the Pruszków, and in Pruszków was first to relax, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: What was Pruszków, where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Pruszków, it was a previous big company, building the -- the machinery, and -- and the wagon, railroad tracks, and so on.</span> <span id="s2009">This was this, and -- but at the time was totally empty.</span> <span id="s2010">[indecipherable] manufacture the hose, and everything was empty, and there was only water in hydrants, nothing to sleep, just concrete, railrer tracks, and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: How long of a ride was it?</span> <span id="s2012">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: How long were -- did it take to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: No, it’s a -- from -- from this place where we entered the train, to this, this was about -- waiting time was -- to -- to wait for the free passage, yes?</span> <span id="s2015">And it was about two hours, and -- and that’s it, we were in -- in the -- in the afternoon, ear -- early afternoon, we were -- in early morning, and early afternoon we were there.</span> <span id="s2016">And of course, you see, this is a story that we get something from mother, this from sister, and so on.</span> <span id="s2017">I remember after I get there, and now that’s -- this was mother.</span> <span id="s2018">You know, he give me the gold bracelet, you know, maybe you will have to eat -- to use this, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: This is your mom?</span> <span id="s2020">Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: From my moth -- from my mother.</span> <span id="s2022">A-And I can tell you I sure that I brought it back.</span> <span id="s2023">All the time I have it with me, in the belt here, under the belt.</span> <span id="s2024">So, I brought back, and more.</span> <span id="s2025">Not more in such a case because [indecipherable] myself, yeah.</span> <span id="s2026">And in the Pruszków, there was a selection, yes?</span> <span id="s2027">I -- I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2028">You see, I -- I even don’t know exactly how a -- how long I was this -- very shortly, the 23 and yes, and the morning 25, it is [indecipherable] two days after two days, we -- and we were loaded to the transport, and - and we reached the Stegna.</span> <span id="s2029">Stegna.</span> <span id="s2030">And this was the beginning of the oppression, because at the time there, we found the German superselect Gestapo, with the Topenkoff, you know, the -- you know what this Topenkoff meaning?</span> <span id="s2031">Skull -- skool, yes?</span> <span id="s2032">Skool and bones.</span> <span id="s2033">You know, this is the symbol on the -- on the -- here, on the collars.</span> <span id="s2034">On the black, white skull with the bones, this is -- was the symbol of SS.</span> <span id="s2035">And of course we -- we arrived very -- beginning of the night, and with the carol, and of course that I -- I said this was the fright -- frightening, this was in -- inhuman, you know, when this prisoner from the Stutthof tr -- well, he had a smart idea.</span> <span id="s2036">He tried to penetrate us, and he lose our identification of the -- of the -- of the -- of the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: So right when you first got to Stegna, which is Stutthof -- A: Stegna, no, is a -- a railroad station not far from Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2039">I’m just clarifying, okay.</span> <span id="s2040">So you -- you -- you’ve arrived nearby Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2041">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: The concentration camp?</span> <span id="s2043">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: And what you’re describing is a prisoner from there is trying to kind of melt into your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: It means that in the potato field, they were working inmates of the -- of the -- of the -- of the concentration camp, under the guards of the periphery.</span> <span id="s2048">And one of them started to -- to penetrate this through the potato field, our group.</span> <span id="s2049">But some boy, he [indecipherable] you know, maybe 12 years old, you know, he showed him, yes?</span> <span id="s2050">And that morning when he started to run away, wherever -- in what -- in whatever direction he run, he hit the guards.</span> <span id="s2051">So he run another way.</span> <span id="s2052">And then this -- this -- he was surrounded closer, and closer, and closer and then was beaten terribly, you know, the carbines were broken on his body.</span> <span id="s2053">And -- and they last all day, they, believe me, this was like a [indecipherable], yes, for us, and for them, you know.</span> <span id="s2054">They -- they can do and get a gun and shoot him, and that’s it, it’s finished in any moment, yeah?</span> <span id="s2055">No, they did it for -- for us.</span> <span id="s2056">We get a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2057">And they took him, you know, the -- you know, dragging him, and then -- then he vanished then.</span> <span id="s2058">Later -- later, I saw the [indecipherable] of this gun, I saw the execution of this man -- of this man, because he wasn’t killed.</span> <span id="s2059">When he entered the Stutthof, of course, during the night, barking dogs, you know this -- in white uniform, yes, to -- to be s -- visible, you know, in the crowd, with these bats, yes.</span> <span id="s2060">Sticks, and so we went there, exhausted emotionally, and everything, and it’s -- some of us started to realize where we are.</span> <span id="s2061">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2062">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2063">I didn’t know that where I am, but there are people who knew.</span> <span id="s2064">And the same day, the same night, one of us newcomer, he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s2065">He went just -- in spite of the warning voices, halt, halt, yes, and then you hear only two shots bang, bang, and he fall down on the -- on the electrical fence.</span> <span id="s2066">So was killed finally by the -- by the shock, electric fence shock.</span> <span id="s2067">He was taken away and then the next few days -- two days, we spent on the -- in the open place, sitting on the sound, without weapon, without nothing, just sitting.</span> <span id="s2068">And there was s -- the -- our older people from our group, fluently speaking English, with the li -- booklets -- no, leaflets from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2069">They s -- that’s for me and [indecipherable] they started to talk to them.</span> <span id="s2070">They permit them to talk to the authorities of the camp, and they presented this, that we are the volunteer.</span> <span id="s2071">We came here, and we gave up our person to the authorities, and so on.</span> <span id="s2072">And I think that you will accept the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2073">And of course did I mention here in my -- in my s -- letter that probably this was not only this, but they were -- they were overloaded.</span> <span id="s2074">It came too many persons, and the struthel was not so -- there was a fareetenslager like Birkenau, where can destroy the fi -- 5000 people in day.</span> <span id="s2075">So -- so -- have a problem, that’s a one story.</span> <span id="s2076">They -- they need me, they need work to be done, somewhere.</span> <span id="s2077">If you want to build the conce -- any concentration camp as a subcamp of the Stutthof, you have to organize, yes?</span> <span id="s2078">You have to guard, you have this, and you have the shelter for the guard, you have the kitchen for the guards.</span> <span id="s2079">Because even if you don’t have to think about the inmates, yes, the prisoner.</span> <span id="s2080">But you have to do this by the guards.</span> <span id="s2081">So they had not.</span> <span id="s2082">So this was a probably the case that, fine, let’s use it as a worker, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: What kind of people were mostly there?</span> <span id="s2084">Poles, or was it a mix of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: This in this group, exclusively Polish people from Praga.</span> <span id="s2086">Praga or Saskacampa.</span> <span id="s2087">This was 5000 people that arrived at Pruszków, in the first transport, that I was in.</span> <span id="s2088">So probably in 99 percent was only Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: But in the whole concentration camp, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Oh no, no, this was a [indecipherable] concentration camp existed since 1939, when the - when the -- Poland was attacked by Hitler in Gdansk, and this territory, yes, that were captured by Germany, there was a lot of opposition, a lot of Polish patriots, and so on, so they -- again, what I said, the -- cut the head, and you will -- you have a problem resolved, yes, and therefore the most people [indecipherable] were sent to the Stutthof from this territory.</span> <span id="s2091">And say e -- in the -- in the Stutthof camp -- subcamp in Sofinbaden, there was the people from Poltuleetsa.</span> <span id="s2092">Poltuleetsa there were ordinary cashoops, you know, cashoora -- cashoop is the Polish people who are calling themself as a cashoop, they are speaking Polish, but if -- if you are -- if you would ask him, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s2093">He will say -- give you the answer, “I am cashoop,” yes.</span> <span id="s2094">But like, say maybe you can go to beautiful places in Zakoparna, i-in Mounting, yes?</span> <span id="s2095">Who are you?</span> <span id="s2096">I am Gourat, yes?</span> <span id="s2097">And if you will -- if you will study this situation here, you will find that who are the gouras in Polish territory who are speaking Polish, and they are very Polish people, yes?</span> <span id="s2098">They are the stits -- you know, sitz, they travel as a tribe across the Europe, and finish his journey in Scotland.</span> <span id="s2099">Scottish people are absolutely Polish cashoops.</span> <span id="s2100">We are dancing in the same way, and they are singing in the same, they are playing the -- the -- no -- pipes, yes?</span> <span id="s2101">This is the tribe that didn’t reach the Scotland, but are Polish now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: When you first got to the outskirts of the concentration camp, and you saw the man who was hunted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: And then another person who was with you committed suicide -- A: Suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: What were you realizing?</span> <span id="s2106">What was going through your mind about where -- what kind of situation you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: No, I -- yes, no, not only this, because you know, as I mentioned, you know this -- was a few days later, execution of the men.</span> <span id="s2108">And I was able, from this position where I was, to see this execution, and to hear the music playing during this execution.</span> <span id="s2109">Beautiful melody of Lehas.</span> <span id="s2110">You know, [sings].</span> <span id="s2111">I hear it in concentration camp and when the man was hanging.</span> <span id="s2112">And at that moment, you see, where you were at work -- I am work, you see, I have to leave this place as possible, as fast as possible, to get out, to have a chance at -- and suddenly, they calling for the professionals by -- by the baroof -- baroof -- profession.</span> <span id="s2113">And I -- I am there, and I say I’m a draftsman, I am [indecipherable] e bin sifener, and they find -- note it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: But you weren’t, were you?</span> <span id="s2115">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Were you a draftsman?</span> <span id="s2117">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Yes, I was, you see, a -- during the war, as -- I was the -- say, I did the first degree in my technical education.</span> <span id="s2120">So I was a good draftsman at that time, and I -- I -- I can do this very well.</span> <span id="s2121">And at that moment, I capture my friend, Shapinski, come on, you.</span> <span id="s2122">Are you going to [indecipherable] you.</span> <span id="s2123">Take a chance to get out from here.</span> <span id="s2124">Later we will think about it, what to do, yeah.</span> <span id="s2125">In the same way ask the people to dig that simple -- simple worker.</span> <span id="s2126">I send -- I -- I told to my -- to my -- to my s -- brother-in-law, “Nietai, get out from here, and you will [indecipherable] you will -- you will have a -- you will u -- use the digging devices, and you will be worker, yes.</span> <span id="s2127">Get out from here.”</span> <span id="s2128">And so a lot of people, it was about, as I mentioned, about 150 they selected us, and they, next day transported us to the</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">-- another subcamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: Just in that little bit of a moment, you were really taking kind of a -- a leadership role with people that you cared about, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: -- were trying to help.</span> <span id="s2133">Di -- what made you do that?</span> <span id="s2134">I mean, you weren’t just looking out for yourself [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2136">You see, as I -- I -- I -- I would like to live it, we were in the group from the troops, yes, somehow our Home Army troop.</span> <span id="s2137">We were together all the time.</span> <span id="s2138">I will tell you then something that -- not that I’m -- to emphasize that I am such a good boy, yes, that I’m so patriots, that I am so friendly to another friends.</span> <span id="s2139">You see in this concentration -- you know, in the Pruszków, I met Garouto, you remember, the Olympian, that he was - he’d once help us, and he taught me as a light athletes to throw the javelin, and s -- jumps, and so on.</span> <span id="s2140">He met me, “Oh, Tadeusz, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s2141">Fine.</span> <span id="s2142">Let’s go, and you will be my hemp -- helper.”</span> <span id="s2143">And my answer was very simple.</span> <span id="s2144">“I am not alone.”</span> <span id="s2145">“How many you have?”</span> <span id="s2146">“Five.”</span> <span id="s2147">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2148">“I cannot,” he said to me, and I said, “Don’t worry, [indecipherable], I -- I will manage.”</span> <span id="s2149">And we went together.</span> <span id="s2150">So we went into the Stutthof together, and in the first time [indecipherable] I was -- the -- we were together.</span> <span id="s2151">So, we left Saskacampa, and we left Stutthof in the same time.</span> <span id="s2152">And really, wi -- this was my [indecipherable] to exers -- to eck -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: No, exaggerated [indecipherable], I was initiate -- initiator.</span> <span id="s2155">I was in this game, believe me, I was my father.</span> <span id="s2156">Yes, I behave like my father.</span> <span id="s2157">Don’t be waiting.</span> <span id="s2158">You have to be active.</span> <span id="s2159">Go, search.</span> <span id="s2160">You -- you have a -- your mobility will give you a bigger chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: -- we’re in Arlington, Virginia doing an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, with Tadeusz Marchaj.</span> <span id="s2164">And this is tape six.</span> <span id="s2165">See, so we left you, you are now in Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: And you’ve been there for a day or two.</span> <span id="s2168">A: Day or -- day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: A day.</span> <span id="s2170">And what is your physical state at this point, and your mental state?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: First of all -- no, what was the -- the physical state, it was just that I was in good shape physics.</span> <span id="s2172">It means that all these experiences with the exhaustion due to the heat and so on, I can stand it very easy.</span> <span id="s2173">Mentally, this -- there was a lot of thinking.</span> <span id="s2174">It was not a -- a devotion to started to think what I will do, what I will do.</span> <span id="s2175">No, I have to do something.</span> <span id="s2176">In - in the possible -- in the margin of my possible ways, yes, to do something.</span> <span id="s2177">So, I know how to manage, to sleep on the -- on the sand, under the sky.</span> <span id="s2178">This is something experience, you know, that it -- it was too bothering me, yes, i-it was a -- almost natural, yes.</span> <span id="s2179">When I was re -- lying on my back, and instead of ceiling, I saw beautiful constellation, I say at that moment, I’m in the camp, but a little bit different, [indecipherable] at camp.</span> <span id="s2180">It means that mentally I -- I try to relax, and not even to find, in this condition the work that I am still -- i-i-in the nice wert, that around me something that I want to reach there.</span> <span id="s2181">And therefore, the -- I was able to think only what was needed, what I will do next day, yes, if they will select me, yes, because these -- they were starting to talk about the selection, we had talks about selection.</span> <span id="s2182">And therefore, when this came, I was absolutely sure who are you, siekner, and I am going to leave this place as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s2183">What I can do, I took my friend with me, I advise my brother-in-law, and another friend, Zigmund Paolernuk from my troops, to go find.</span> <span id="s2184">We will use the physical force to dig the earth.</span> <span id="s2185">And we left.</span> <span id="s2186">Of course, in me -- in the meantime, I know - not as I -- as I mentioned this execution and so on, this closed my knowledge about the Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2187">You know, I know that Stutthof, about the Stutthof you can write in books.</span> <span id="s2188">Is story of thousands of peoples, and each of the story was the same, yes?</span> <span id="s2189">Sitting in barrack, and get the piece of bread, go to work, and come back, and so on.</span> <span id="s2190">Fortunately for me, of course, this a -- my lucky star was shining about me, that I never was a such a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">And I am very pity for these people, and I know immediate what I will say that I saw it, but without pain.</span> <span id="s2192">It was that I get a knowledge without pain.</span> <span id="s2193">I was observant, almost, yes?</span> <span id="s2194">And my faith, it give me the chance to be only in this position, because I knew very well that Stutthof wasn’t a nice place to be.</span> <span id="s2195">And that’s all, and fe -- I -- I -- I -- I mentioned in the very beginning, you know, that I was in some way curious when I read this Gittorda Schnyder book, that she probably has the same practice like me.</span> <span id="s2196">That she didn’t fight -- that she didn’t find the Stutthof, and Suchenwalda only as a martyrdom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">She took away -- she took away something more.</span> <span id="s2198">More teaching element, about the humanity, and so on.</span> <span id="s2199">Little -- I -- I was very surprised, you know, that they tried to save this SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: You’re talking about an author of a book -- A: Of the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: -- we should just make that clear.</span> <span id="s2202">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: And we don’t need to go into that, but the -- A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: -- the name of the book is, “The Unfinished Road.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: “Unfinished Road,” and this is the book about the Suchenwalda that we are -- that we will start to talk about this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: So, you’re feeling pretty good, and there is an off -- there is a selection, or an opportunity, and you volunteer yourself as a professional draftsman?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Draftsman, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Tell us what happens then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: So, next day, I think so, this was the day of -- I can look at the date, but this is not so important, but same day that -- August 29th, yes?</span> <span id="s2210">They started to organize nus -- us, and we left on the August 30th.</span> <span id="s2211">So I was in -- in concentration part har -- in Stutthof, I was five days.</span> <span id="s2212">I came 25th, and I left 30.</span> <span id="s2213">And therefore, this was the five days, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s2214">What I saw -- I saw the -- oh, I already mention, yes, that it was enough to -- to have a full knowledge what does it mean, and the -- to be in -- with this knowledge, to be free, without experienci-cing a real life in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2215">That’s was a big, big, lucky condition that I faced at that time.</span> <span id="s2216">So we went to the station, Stegna.</span> <span id="s2217">We entered the railroad track, personal.</span> <span id="s2218">Free for the open public, not a -- not a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Car -- I say -- cattle car, yes.</span> <span id="s2221">And in very cultural way, we arrived to Leibush.</span> <span id="s2222">Cultural way because we were sitting on the banks, yes, open doors, open windows.</span> <span id="s2223">If somebody would like to escape, lees you can do this.</span> <span id="s2224">Even you can do this, yes.</span> <span id="s2225">But of course that my feeling, and everybody feeling was no, no, no, no, that’s is not the time, yes.</span> <span id="s2226">My feeling is.</span> <span id="s2227">Maybe somebody, but nobody make attempt.</span> <span id="s2228">Where is this -- the Leibush?</span> <span id="s2229">There was a very loose, small camp, surrounded by the fences, barbed wire, and post towers.</span> <span id="s2230">And we spend there -- hat there was a first registration.</span> <span id="s2231">First registration beyond the Stutthof, because in Stutthof we never entered the registration of the Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2232">Certain notation about the -- about our profession technically was for the special people who were looking for this, but this was not for the authorities of the -- of the camp.</span> <span id="s2233">So therefore, this is my problem life, that I cannot find the records of my presence in the Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2234">But doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2235">In -- in -- in the first registration, was in Leibush, but there was a very short time, I think that this something lee -- about two days, you see.</span> <span id="s2236">And from this point they took us to place called Brucie -- Brucie.</span> <span id="s2237">And there was a official name of this, it was hausencommander -- commander Leibush, commander Brucie, hausencommander SS trupen eeboongsplatz, bruce sopienbardai.</span> <span id="s2238">It means that this complex -- aha, now, of course I can make a digression, that we entered the territory when we were moved from Leibush to Brucie.</span> <span id="s2239">We can say like a capital town of the pulligol.</span> <span id="s2240">There was a territory in -- in cashoops, yes, but this was the Polish territory before the war, but as izproisin in Germany during the occupation.</span> <span id="s2241">And they -- this territory was about 50 kilometers by 40, yes?</span> <span id="s2242">Big, big, totally secluded.</span> <span id="s2243">People, if they were living, they throw it away, and they started to build a eebungsplatz, which this means exercising some military action.</span> <span id="s2244">But not only because I knew a little bit more, because I was a draftsman at the drawings.</span> <span id="s2245">That was not only eebungsplatz, that was a future launching territory of the rockets in the direction to the north.</span> <span id="s2246">All orientation of the launching pad were north.</span> <span id="s2247">It was not to Sweden because this was exactly Sweden in front of this territory, yes.</span> <span id="s2248">This was probably -- the goal was United States.</span> <span id="s2249">And of course, at that time, Germans were able to send the rockets V17, from Europe to America, over the North Pole.</span> <span id="s2250">And of course there was missing only one element, yes?</span> <span id="s2251">Rocketry was perfect, but there was no atomic head, because there would be a stupidity to send a simple explosive, yes?</span> <span id="s2252">They were waiting at the time for atomic head.</span> <span id="s2253">If they will -- if they would have had atomic head at that time, the launching was -- would be Sofinwalda.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Yeah, so we came there, first to Brucie, and this was official subcamp of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2255">But they have no ability to the people, yes, so the -- they -- this was in s -- in the state of the -- to be born, yes?</span> <span id="s2256">Start was nastendi to have people and labor camp for this arrangement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">And in Bruce was again the selection, and I -- and selection -- in Bruce, a certain people who were for the physical work, like my -- my brother-in-law, Zigmund Paolernuk, they went into the orlik -- in the place orlik, and they started to be a simple worker.</span> <span id="s2258">And they build the -- they build the hospital for this territory.</span> <span id="s2259">It was a lot of different -- different section of this territory.</span> <span id="s2260">I was sent to Zochenbad.</span> <span id="s2261">In Zochenballid there was a ballitunk.</span> <span id="s2262">It means that the -- the place where you are -- management place of this -- of this territory, and there was a -- some engineering stop, and we came as a draftsman to make a drawing for them.</span> <span id="s2263">And as -- as I mentioned yes, that this was the so-called SS from erbiten unken naming number 128.</span> <span id="s2264">This was the official name.</span> <span id="s2265">And when we came there, we get shelter in the barracks, which were built already, wi -- ve -- with very little fancies, bar fancies, and a lot of different storage houses for the -- for the any materials, yes, that could be used to build this beauti -- big -- big enterprise, Sofienwalda, SS evungsplatz isproisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">And there were -- we get the -- this card, in number, I -- this is the card that I only -- you see, I don’t know why I have it, and not my friend.</span> <span id="s2267">This was the escarta.</span> <span id="s2268">It means that coupon for the food.</span> <span id="s2269">Why, after it -- it -- about one week, we build our arrangement.</span> <span id="s2270">We made a arrangement to build a kitchen, and we started to -- to have a cook, who cook for us the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: In your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: In our barracks, within the certain fences, yes, barbed wire fences.</span> <span id="s2273">But very loose, you know, there was no guard standing, you see?</span> <span id="s2274">There was another big fence, around bigger area where was the management building, where were the storage houses, and this territory was in some way guarded by the -- by the guards.</span> <span id="s2275">But very loose, even as you hardl -- shortly speaking, we were treated as a worker.</span> <span id="s2276">We could get out from our -- from -- from this camp.</span> <span id="s2277">We can go to the town by permission, written permission, and you see now, after the Stutthof, we were in paradise, you know?</span> <span id="s2278">You -- what -- what you had to do, you had to work, yes?</span> <span id="s2279">Of course the food was -- you -- you have imagination, but it was eatable, and was enough.</span> <span id="s2280">Not die.</span> <span id="s2281">And treatment was, as I mentioned, on the basis the lord and servant, and German and Polish, yes, so th-th-this was the relationship, but a very -- but it, first of all they -- they recognize our professional.</span> <span id="s2282">If I make a drawing -- and I remember when I made the first drawing, yes, oh, nice, yes.</span> <span id="s2283">And they even ge -- they applauded me, oh, very nice drawing, yes?</span> <span id="s2284">Th-They recognize me as a professional, you see, because they were in the SS uniform, but they were professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: S-S-So there was a certain amount of respect.</span> <span id="s2286">Did you ever encounter SS troop -- men who were hostile towards Poles?</span> <span id="s2287">Just Poles, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2289">Y-Y-You see, we had a -- we were mis -- as I understand, because nobody explained me what was our status at that time, but I understand that they don’t want to have any trouble with -- with the new development.</span> <span id="s2290">It was they were happy as is.</span> <span id="s2291">We are the worker making work, and therefore, why to think about to build the fences, to build the bunkers, yes, for the penalty, and to do some oppressive elements in this -- in this camp, like -- like in stut -- stut -- Stutthof, because there was a just the -- the history of any concentration camp where they try to destroy the people, it was just to -- to key the -- such a condition that the human body weight is going down and down and down.</span> <span id="s2292">Is a terrible way of thinking about, because this was a technological problem for the German.</span> <span id="s2293">How to destroy the people.</span> <span id="s2294">So is easier to destroy the 50 kilograms body than the 150.</span> <span id="s2295">So therefore the first priority was just to -- to -- to lose the weight.</span> <span id="s2296">Terrible.</span> <span id="s2297">You know, what -- what was the Birkenau -- Rejinka this t -- hundreds of barracks where they deliver these people, 5000 a day.</span> <span id="s2298">What they did in these barracks?</span> <span id="s2299">They make the easy way to destroy the bodies.</span> <span id="s2300">From 100 to 50.</span> <span id="s2301">So this was a -- moral issue doesn’t exist at all.</span> <span id="s2302">There was only technological problem.</span> <span id="s2303">So we were not in this position, yes?</span> <span id="s2304">Stutthof was.</span> <span id="s2305">So we -- we were regular worker.</span> <span id="s2306">A little later change everything, yes?</span> <span id="s2307">In the very beginning was -- and now, to -- to give as the feeling that we are not so easygoing Polish people, so we had a visit from the personnel, from Stutthof, and I was beaten by such a SS man, who came to us, and he -- I didn’t yet, at that moment to understand his German very fluently, he started to put me in the corner of the -- of the room, and took a -- a -- a line for the -- for the for measurement, and he push me i-in such a possin that I didn’t understand what he wanted from me?</span> <span id="s2308">What -- what I have to do?</span> <span id="s2309">And he just tried to put me in the corner and measure what is the dimension of my body to build a bunker.</span> <span id="s2310">You know what was the penalize bunker for them.</span> <span id="s2311">Is the three dimensional for the width, and - and this, and you had to stay there in -- in the standing position for I don’t know, two, three, four days, without sitting.</span> <span id="s2312">So I suffer in the same, you know where?</span> <span id="s2313">In the Polish prison.</span> <span id="s2314">Exactly in the bunker.</span> <span id="s2315">So, you know, the Polish prison -- at that moment if somebody is asking me, they were not better than Hitler, bunkers.</span> <span id="s2316">So, but of course, this is not the Polish.</span> <span id="s2317">I said Polish, but is wrong, this was the Communist.</span> <span id="s2318">Cause the Communist really -- so, he came to us to give us the warning, you are not a free peop -- yes a -- yes, so we had this visit.</span> <span id="s2319">And this was a very nice, everything, up to the -- of course it -- I -- I presented here in my memoir, you know, the -- the name of the -- of the people that -- which is very interesting to point one, that there was a engineer from Boinies, who was in uniform s -- SS, and -- but was origin Dutch.</span> <span id="s2320">Now, this was a totally like us, yes, behaves, but not -- not very openly.</span> <span id="s2321">When we were only with us, he behaves in very special way.</span> <span id="s2322">And later he vanished.</span> <span id="s2323">At a certain day, when the alliance of frenzif in the west started to go into the Holland direction, he vanished, and then we -- we have a message, not the message, rumor, that he was a spy.</span> <span id="s2324">He left the office, taking a document, and he just got out.</span> <span id="s2325">So, was the Boinies, when I -- I -- I just mentioned it, when I -- when this Robert, SS man, like orengutang, you know, he looks, and he just make the sketch, and put on -- on the desk, to do the drawing.</span> <span id="s2326">So when I asked the -- my authorities what I have to do with this sketch.</span> <span id="s2327">At that moment, they say, [indecipherable] he did show, yeah -- so wit -- this was his answer.</span> <span id="s2328">And -- and then this was up to the November 23.</span> <span id="s2329">On November 23, in the very beginning of the day, we were awake up -- woke up surrounded by the many guards.</span> <span id="s2330">And they throwed us from the -- from the barracks.</span> <span id="s2331">They made a search our body, anyway they didn’t find gold, and -- and because I was always with me, and -- but they searched the barracks, they took a lot of things from the barracks, and -- and they force us to build a second row -- second fence.</span> <span id="s2332">And they read to us the order of the commandant that since today, we will be treated as a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s2333">And our unsubordination to the order will be penalized at once by the death, but -- and the crossing the border of the guards line, you will be shot without warning.</span> <span id="s2334">It’s like at the big a -- concentration camp, and fi -- but it was given this, and of course everything was cancelled in our -- our walking, our letter, wa -- everything is this.</span> <span id="s2335">And we were regular prisoner, but again, it was dying [indecipherable] you know, the Third Reich was dying, and this impulse, yes, was given by the -- by the order of the higher authorities, yes, that is --that we are prisoner, but you have to execute this in some way.</span> <span id="s2336">But, to execute this, you have to have a power, you have to [indecipherable], what I wrote in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s2337">You have to create a condition of the real concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2338">And of course, the -- our regime of our work time, walking, correspond mail, and so on, was like in -- in the concentration camp, but there were no pressure.</span> <span id="s2339">There was not standing by a cr -- crematorium, yes?</span> <span id="s2340">There was not a standing by oppressor who are waiting to kill you, yes, because there was a -- the only one purpose to be in -- i -- in Stutthof, it was to be killed.</span> <span id="s2341">Here, we were still worker, treated as a -- as a politisha pratinga, but -- but they recognized the fact that fine, I cannot kill him because he is working for me, give me the purpose.</span> <span id="s2342">My presence here was totally different than in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2343">And of course, day by day, November, December, you know, Red Army’s approaching in the west, is, you know, the alien forces are entering almost Germany.</span> <span id="s2344">So this is the case when in February, yes, it was a -- oh, was only we, yes, and the poltuleetsa camp, it was a Sofenwalda, we are there.</span> <span id="s2345">There was a prisoner from the poltuleetsa, as I mentioned, this was the prisoner, political prisoner cashoops, that never try to recognize a power, and authorities of German.</span> <span id="s2346">You know, they were really Polish people who said no, we are Polish people, and we are not recognizing you as a power.</span> <span id="s2347">So they send them to the prison.</span> <span id="s2348">Of course, a lot of them, they recognize this power, and they went into the German army, fighting on the west -- east front.</span> <span id="s2349">So you see, this was another set -- another chance for the people, yes, to go with, or to go against.</span> <span id="s2350">You see, they said, I am going against, and they won.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">They who said, fine, I am going with German, they were loser, because they were forced to be a German with all privileges to be soldier, and to be killed in the name of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s2352">So, you see, when I give up myself to the German, I did something opposite were these people in poltuleetsa.</span> <span id="s2353">Is a very hard to find the choice, wh-what I have to do in my life now?</span> <span id="s2354">So, this is the nu -- you cannot find the answer what you have to do.</span> <span id="s2355">This is the -- you, your ability, imagination, and decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: A-And you’re, at this point, you’re still with your -- your two friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: Yes, ah, now, before this happened that they locked us as a political prisoner, my friends, who are -- who were Jewish origin, you know, Matchie Shapinski is a Jewish, but -- he was a Jewish, and I know that he was a Jewish, because I know who is a professor Batswell Shapinski, very famous mathematician in Poland.</span> <span id="s2358">So, I never discuss this problem with ma -- Matchie, yes?</span> <span id="s2359">We were very good friend, yes, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: But he was pretending to be Catholic?</span> <span id="s2361">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: I never re -- never saw him a -- a -- a -- performing the act of the -- of the Catholic boy, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Ahh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: But he wasn’t openly Jewish?</span> <span id="s2366">A: No, no, oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: No, this is the way that he survive.</span> <span id="s2369">A lot of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: He was hiding, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: -- fra -- I am saying, it was an terrible story for the Jewish people in Poland, that these Orthodox people were so distinguished, easy to recognize, that even they have no chance to hide themselve, because they were just -- the Jewish know the -- like -- like a looking at the -- at -- at -- at the shape, yes?</span> <span id="s2372">So you know that this is a shape, so when you look at these guys -- see, here you know he is a Jewish.</span> <span id="s2373">Y-You see, they were so different that they find a problem to hide themselves.</span> <span id="s2374">Even to find the hiding place for them.</span> <span id="s2375">You follow me?</span> <span id="s2376">You couldn’t go to forest on, to find as a prisoner like a partisan.</span> <span id="s2377">[indecipherable] know how you could do this, where you have the family with the children.</span> <span id="s2378">So alright, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Your friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: -- Matchie, my friend, one day he went -- we -- we are free to go.</span> <span id="s2381">He went to the place with the scorshishina, and he was at the doctor, and he came back, and say -- said, very sad, “Tadeusz, I have tuberculosis.”</span> <span id="s2382">“Matchie, [indecipherable] what you are talking about?”</span> <span id="s2383">“No, but maybe I have a chance to get out from this place.”</span> <span id="s2384">“Fine, so I will go to my -- my uncle and -- a-and [indecipherable] this [indecipherable] near Kraków, you know, Slominiki.”</span> <span id="s2385">So fine, okay.</span> <span id="s2386">The same day I met Bogdon Palmoski.</span> <span id="s2387">I have tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2388">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2389">You know?</span> <span id="s2390">And his brother Palmoski, he has the tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2391">You know, how brave was this doctor?</span> <span id="s2392">He’s not out for me, who gave they - them this test -- a test really, how to say, the prognosis -- no, really -- Q: Diagnosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: Diagnosis of this doctor, because German were -- were very afraid this, coo -- tuberculosis for them, they all -- they were very afraid.</span> <span id="s2394">And because the gia -- German authorities everywhere, yes, for them tuberculosis was like a cancer that ee -- that could spread this cancer by the -- no, congestion, yes, congestion.</span> <span id="s2395">Congestion?</span> <span id="s2396">No, not congestion, no.</span> <span id="s2397">That some illness is -- could be transferred to another person by -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: Contagious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: -- by virus -- contagious.</span> <span id="s2400">Q: Contagious, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: That, contagious.</span> <span id="s2402">They -- they were very afraid, the disease of tuberculosis is contagious, forget it.</span> <span id="s2403">And believe or not, three Jewish boy left Sofenwald.</span> <span id="s2404">I, of course, at the time, I was serious.</span> <span id="s2405">I say -- even Balmosi get this.</span> <span id="s2406">I was a little bit start to think, but I persuaded myself.</span> <span id="s2407">Tadeusz, you are facing some act of mercy of a person who is giving help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Physically, he could be killed.</span> <span id="s2409">He made a help for them.</span> <span id="s2410">I have to respect this.</span> <span id="s2411">I cannot do something, because probably he bisk -- this -- this -- this doctor was probably a Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">He’d been some way.</span> <span id="s2413">He covered, I don’t know, maybe not the first generation, maybe second generation Jewish.</span> <span id="s2414">He give it a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s2415">And they left the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2416">So I was, as you can see, the only time that I was together with them, and so then I was alone.</span> <span id="s2417">Okay, but they get to Kraków, and they have a very good life with the family i -- my family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: But you’re alone in Sofenwalda?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2420">And then came this November 23 [indecipherable] ah, there was a -- I can tell you, I made many attempts, but in different way to arrange my departure from the -- from this.</span> <span id="s2421">As I mentioned my -- my -- my godfather, Jusef Kameeta, who was before the war a -- a - a mayor of this Slominiki, yes?</span> <span id="s2422">During the occupation, he was all -- still recognized by the people of Slominiki as a representative of -- of the society, of -- of this town.</span> <span id="s2423">And he had a good connection, as I mentioned, connection, celebrities played the role in the life.</span> <span id="s2424">He approached the German authorities of the SS bowelitung near Kraków -- y-y-you -- you see the same name, SS bowelitung in different place.</span> <span id="s2425">I was in the hand of SS bowelitung from the [indecipherable] numery -- number 120.</span> <span id="s2426">Similar arrangement of the -- of the enterprise of the SS, to build something, was near Kraków.</span> <span id="s2427">And he sent to me letter, before this 23 of November.</span> <span id="s2428">“Tadeusz, I will ask a help from the authorities of the SS bowelitung near Kraków, to transfer you from this place to another place.”</span> <span id="s2429">And this letter one day arrive, official letter in for me.</span> <span id="s2430">Not for me, but for the -- is -- is not here.</span> <span id="s2431">I - I never -- because I -- I couldn’t make this am, but I am just [indecipherable] because these are not how this was played.</span> <span id="s2432">And this -- this order to transfer person -- Tadeusz Marchaj from there to there came, and yost volga viost called me.</span> <span id="s2433">“Hey, Tad -- Tadeusz,” he was -- he was speaking to -- to -- to me in this way.</span> <span id="s2434">“You want to go home?”</span> <span id="s2435">I say, “No -- I can say so.”</span> <span id="s2436">I was talking German.</span> <span id="s2437">“But you see, I’m a berstubenfeer volgangyos, and if you want to be transfer, this letter has to build -- has to be undersigned by be -- the two rankings higher officer.</span> <span id="s2438">At the time, I will respect.</span> <span id="s2439">I will have the right to respect.”</span> <span id="s2440">[indecipherable] this?</span> <span id="s2441">Between them, there were the some -- some connection,</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">I-I don’t know, like a social connection.</span> <span id="s2443">And he want to be respected, yes, by -- by the other guy, yeah?</span> <span id="s2444">And this letter went back.</span> <span id="s2445">So I get this letter.</span> <span id="s2446">“Okay, I will have touchiga.”</span> <span id="s2447">, my uncle answer.</span> <span id="s2448">And this letter, with the two highest order officer, came after 23rd of November.</span> <span id="s2449">I was already political prisoner.</span> <span id="s2450">So, was another attempt made, that he said ah -- my -- my -- my -- my unc -- my godfather said, “Tad,” -- it was yet possible to -- to send the letters, because it was very, very limited.</span> <span id="s2451">“Can you get you from the prison -- from the camp, because I will send a man who will pick up you, and will deliver you to Kraków.</span> <span id="s2452">He will have to -- he will have some documents for you,” falsified, I don’t know, maybe yes, maybe not.</span> <span id="s2453">You should --</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: He wrote that in a letter?</span> <span id="s2455">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: He wrote that in a letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Oh, no, no, it means that I will send later, when I came back -- Q: Oh, yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: -- it was such a -- because feesay I will -- maybe there will be a -- a -- a visiting -- a -- our friend.</span> <span id="s2459">Association do have a chance to get out from -- from this, and that was enough for me to understand what they are they trying to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: As the war is coming closer to an end, how do things change for you, or do they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: No, i-i-it means that of course that I’m saying -- I -- I mention only this to say that I was always active, and somebody was -- has to be active to do something, but fail, fail, fail.</span> <span id="s2462">Now, this is prepare, 23rd is coming, prisoner and -- political prisoner, [indecipherable] moment is everything finished, yes?</span> <span id="s2463">It means that now I -- is still something that I can do.</span> <span id="s2464">And I -- what I am thinking, what I did -- I -- in what a condition, I’m -- I am paralyzed, almost, because I entered the room of my authorities, Mr. Rudy -- Rudy Brann, and took a stamp in Blanco, on the paper, with the here, and there, white paper, that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Took it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: I enter his room -- Q: You stole it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: Stole it.</span> <span id="s2468">I stamp it, and put in my pockets, and maybe I can write here something on this paper as a passport, yes, to get out.</span> <span id="s2469">But if -- believe me, if this somebody will caught me in this moment at -- in the desk of the serouti brand, they will probably, i-in spite of some friend will kill -- they will kill me, or send to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2470">What a risk I make.</span> <span id="s2471">Oh, now zlotas.</span> <span id="s2472">The war is approaching, end is approaching.</span> <span id="s2473">As I mentioned, they are only -- we are in de -- Sofenwalda, this business is finished.</span> <span id="s2474">We are at full liquidation, and they liquidate also our camp, and transfer to the poltuleetsa camp, to be together under one command, one -- one rooms, one guards, and so on.</span> <span id="s2475">And the -- this is the day when is coming the liquidation of the -- of the Jewish women part of the camp.</span> <span id="s2476">And one day, this is the -- this is the -- this is the -- ah, wait.</span> <span id="s2477">In the -- yes, yes, this is -- just I mentioned, only February, 1945.</span> <span id="s2478">We got the orders, yes, we have to go to this place, and to clean a certain buildings where the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Within Sofenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Yes, in the -- within the Sofenwald, wa -- the -- was get to [indecipherable] Schineder -- Schnyder, and -- and we went and entered this roo -- this part of the camp -- we was totally separated from another.</span> <span id="s2481">And you see, this is the building, and this is the building -- of course, tha -- sa -- you see only fragment of this -- part of this.</span> <span id="s2482">But they are there standing, two big, huge buildings, where the Jewish women were.</span> <span id="s2483">And -- to clean the -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2484">Now, when we enter this territory, I say, there’s women no more.</span> <span id="s2485">There is no Jewish women here, yes?</span> <span id="s2486">The camp is not surrounded by -- by guards, there are a few guards which came with us, were outside, and they give us the order, clean these rooms and so on.</span> <span id="s2487">And I cleaning this, and walking around this -- this buildings, I entered the room where from the darkness of this room came a -- a woman.</span> <span id="s2488">So I -- I ask her, [indecipherable] here?</span> <span id="s2489">What they are doing here, in German, yes?</span> <span id="s2490">And then she started to -- to talk too fast for me to understand, but I could understand that they are waiting.</span> <span id="s2491">They’re waiting for something.</span> <span id="s2492">I think they was maybe -- maybe I -- I -- I don’t know, now I -- I am trying to -- to fantasy.</span> <span id="s2493">But maybe these Germans who departed with all these Jewish women -- I don’t know, but this was very difficult to -- to -- to -- to understand, because all these women that were in this room, they were sick.</span> <span id="s2494">Typhoid, and everything, something like that.</span> <span id="s2495">And they -- they look at me like I [indecipherable] messenger that -- that the war is finished, you see, because they ent -- in they room, they enter not a German.</span> <span id="s2496">A-A-And I say -- I couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2497">I say -- I get out from this room, yes, and of course, so far what -- what is later explained by another books, that they came a car, this day, they loaded this girls, and they transported to the woods somewhere, and all were killed.</span> <span id="s2498">So I just wrote to get through th -- that probably I am the last -- last one that saw your friends.</span> <span id="s2499">A-And that’s all.</span> <span id="s2500">Of course, then, it came at order -- evacuation totally, we have to go.</span> <span id="s2501">But in one direction, not in the direction when Jewish women departed, or Estonian soldier departed.</span> <span id="s2502">We started to be moved by an -- under the order of the SS at the time yet, yes, into the direction of Gdansk, to the north.</span> <span id="s2503">To the direction of that Red Army.</span> <span id="s2504">And then, when we approach it -- I am talking more or less fast, we enter into the hand of the army -- regular army of the German.</span> <span id="s2505">And we enter under the command of the German army, and they say to us -- oh, they didn’t say in this way, but you are the worker, you will work here, and you will do whatever we will give you to do.</span> <span id="s2506">And we were the worker to -- to dig the trenches, ditches, anti-tank, in the certain territory of the predictable direction of the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s2507">Of course, never happened.</span> <span id="s2508">So whatever I did, didn’t work at all.</span> <span id="s2509">So I -- I -- this is where my clear -- clean -- my conscience, yes, that I -- I was not a helper.</span> <span id="s2510">So -- but situation was always this, you see, when we transp -- we were transported on foot, and this the wintertime, and we are going against the traffic of the flicklinger, the -- the escapee of the -- all population from the east Prussian.</span> <span id="s2511">We were surrounded by such a fatije that it was a just impossible to take a risk, because it was such a possibility that I can jump this -- mi -- my surrounding Germans, and to hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s2512">But the chance was only one, yes?</span> <span id="s2513">Either successful, or I am dead.</span> <span id="s2514">There was no -- no other chance, yes, if -- there were -- when somebody was - was -- if the -- some soldier, and especially the -- especial troops which were -- made the order for any possibility of the desertion -- you see, I could be treated, yes, that I am a German, yes, who’d thrown away the uniform, and he’s now at hiding, yeah?</span> <span id="s2515">So, in every case, I faced the death.</span> <span id="s2516">So, for me at that moment, my job then was follow up with them.</span> <span id="s2517">And in this way, I -- I reached the point when we were taken away from the SS, because SS very fast started to vanish, yes, because we were approaching Red front, and we enter into the hands of the regular army.</span> <span id="s2518">And these were regular hand.</span> <span id="s2519">I know that they were enemy, our, but they were regular army, like the Polish army who fought German.</span> <span id="s2520">I -- I am recognizing any army as a army, yes?</span> <span id="s2521">And they were German army, but army, not a -- not a beast in the form of SS.</span> <span id="s2522">And they treated us -- but they warn us, you see, in this direction, there is Soviet Union troops.</span> <span id="s2523">And there are our troops.</span> <span id="s2524">Now, if you want to be between them, you will be killed either by these, or by them.</span> <span id="s2525">It’s very simple, yes?</span> <span id="s2526">So, that’s the one story.</span> <span id="s2527">You know that I mention you, in -- during the coffee break, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Believe me, I had a idea to reach the point that we would start to go into the west, because my dream at the time was not to come back to Poland, but to go to the west.</span> <span id="s2529">I’m honestly speaking.</span> <span id="s2530">Background of my action was, under this pressure, there was nothing that -- that was waiting for me, because I knew what is there in the Soviet Union, and Communist -- and -- and in this way, I reached the point when we were totally surrounded.</span> <span id="s2531">The only one way to enter the territory behind the Vistula River, and the depression [indecipherable], we dig the dams, and we let water run into the depression, and we surrounded ourself in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s2532">The remnants of the army, yeah, by the water.</span> <span id="s2533">And -- and the fifth of May came for us the freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: And how did it come, exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: How they come?</span> <span id="s2536">I saw like a hooves, you know, cribe on the horses, with the flying papasha, you know this?</span> <span id="s2537">And -- and when I look at this, they were very special animal.</span> <span id="s2538">You see, a very independent soldier, very -- I can say that there was not command for them at that moment.</span> <span id="s2539">They enter this territory like a conquistaros, yes?</span> <span id="s2540">Everything, ah [indecipherable] you have the watch, i -- give it to me, yes.</span> <span id="s2541">Everything was them.</span> <span id="s2542">And I am not blaming you.</span> <span id="s2543">Probably I would do the same, you see?</span> <span id="s2544">But they enter, as I mention, like people not from Europe, exactly not from Europe.</span> <span id="s2545">This was a -- I remember Polish army.</span> <span id="s2546">I remember the Italian army who was the prisoner between us later, soldier from the Mussolini army.</span> <span id="s2547">They came, and I met first military -- first Polish police, who entered this territory, because aha, when the Russian came, and we wanted to go, they say milsha minadda.</span> <span id="s2548">No, no, no, stay here.</span> <span id="s2549">Oh, you see, this was a ha, now we are going to Siberia.</span> <span id="s2550">Believe me, we know exactly.</span> <span id="s2551">We already get before my -- before Warsaw uprising, that the Polish soldier from the Akar, Home Army, they were -- when they were capture, and not killed, they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s2552">In the gulags at Heepalago.</span> <span id="s2553">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: Did they know, though, that you were from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: Oh, no, no, they -- they -- in [indecipherable] Italy -- Q: -- the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: -- there was a thousand of people, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, and Polish people, you see?</span> <span id="s2557">All the [indecipherable] not the German -- and there was a lot of that such a people, surrounded -- you know, you never hunt the -- the -- the rabbits, or -- or this, when you have the circle, you are circling a certain territory, yes, and you can -- and the -- the people are approaching into the center of this surrounding territory, you see.</span> <span id="s2558">You couldn’t see in the very beginning do -- the -- the animal.</span> <span id="s2559">And then you see [indecipherable] and then is a boiling animals inside of this.</span> <span id="s2560">So therefore, when -- when the -- when we re -- we were encircled by the -- by the army, Red Army, and this army approached to the closer and closer to the sea, you see when I would -- I took the map with me, to understand for you what the big territory was first surrounding, and then the army started -- Red Army started to close it closer and closer to the -- such a small point.</span> <span id="s2561">So there was a thousand of people, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: But when they first came in, what was your reaction?</span> <span id="s2563">Were you -- did -- did you feel that you were being liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: No, never had that feeling.</span> <span id="s2565">Sorry.</span> <span id="s2566">I never had a feeling that I will liberated, and the first approach was such I want to go home, and I hit the guards of the Soviet Union soldier.</span> <span id="s2567">No, no, no, there -- it was not looking for me, freedom.</span> <span id="s2568">And now I -- listen to me.</span> <span id="s2569">When I then came the opra after three days staying in those woods, which was very comfortable, nice weather, we started to go outside, and press down is a prousht.</span> <span id="s2570">And there they told us, in Russian but I understand.</span> <span id="s2571">Go to the vieni commandant -- go to the military commandant in -- in s -- Cherf to get a propouskou.</span> <span id="s2572">Is a pass -- pass document to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2573">And this was a trap, because such a pe -- boys like me, the first question they ask you, Atko darry?</span> <span id="s2574">Where are you -- where are you from?</span> <span id="s2575">Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2576">Warsava.</span> <span id="s2577">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2578">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2579">Young man from Warsava, who was he being here, in concentration camp?</span> <span id="s2580">You follow me?</span> <span id="s2581">They knew exactly.</span> <span id="s2582">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: But -- sa -- spell it out, then -- A: Atkou --</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: If you were a young man from Warsaw, and you were here -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: -- what did that mean for the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: For them?</span> <span id="s2587">For -- for the Russian was one, this is the -- from the Warsaw uprising boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: So wa -- and what does that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2591">Ah, what does it mean?</span> <span id="s2592">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: We were the enemy.</span> <span id="s2594">According to them, we were the enemy of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2595">You will follow me, and therefore, the only one solution for us is there -- to send them to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2596">You see, because we didn’t fight with -- for God’s sake, we didn’t fight with the Soviet Union, we fought with German, but all the time, in history of the second World War, sorry, Soviet army was our enemy from the 17 of September, 1939.</span> <span id="s2597">And then when th -- came in the ’45, it was the same army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">End of Tape # 6</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, and this is with Tadeusz Marchaj.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Marchaj.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: And this is tape number seven.</span> <span id="s2603">And what -- what I’d like now is just if you can say very briefly what happened to you in the couple years after the -- the -- the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2605">But be-before I will answer, I say that my first contact with the Polish authority, which was a platoon of the Polish militia, young boys, maybe my age, they warn me.</span> <span id="s2606">They give me -- they gave me, in spite of fact that they were Communist, definitely, they give me, “Hey boys, you want to be home?</span> <span id="s2607">Forget about that you are from Warsaw, if you don’t want to be in Siberia.”</span> <span id="s2608">Exactly he told us this.</span> <span id="s2609">So, I knew that this is the confirmation what I was thinking.</span> <span id="s2610">Okay, now, after the war, when I was come back home, I found everybody survive.</span> <span id="s2611">I found already my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s2612">I found Matchie Shapinski.</span> <span id="s2613">I found Zigmund, and a lot of my friends.</span> <span id="s2614">And I -- we started a new life.</span> <span id="s2615">Of course, in the -- but of course that we are in the same area, but my family was everything intact.</span> <span id="s2616">Family, and yet, father, mother, brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s2617">The whole war passed away, and we survive.</span> <span id="s2618">I was the last one.</span> <span id="s2619">And again, like in my Warsaw uprising, my first day, I didn’t find my mother, because she was at the Gdansk, in this territory, looking for my body, because again came some messages that Tadeusz, he work in Sofenwalda, ah, yes, he had the problem with the legs.</span> <span id="s2620">You know, what is the background my -- my -- polio, he had a problem to walk.</span> <span id="s2621">Not what -- not me, another has.</span> <span id="s2622">That doesn’t matter, mother came, found me in good, and we started life.</span> <span id="s2623">Now what’s happened to our family?</span> <span id="s2624">I went into the school.</span> <span id="s2625">Objectively I’m saying that at that moment, Polish government didn’t recognize me as a enemy of Poland, because I never was, yes?</span> <span id="s2626">I was enemy of the certain system, but when I am not accepting something, it doesn’t mean that I am a -- a criminal, to destroy the system that I don’t like.</span> <span id="s2627">So I entered the Polish pri -- Warsaw Polytechnic, and started to education of the aeronautical department.</span> <span id="s2628">And everything was beautiful.</span> <span id="s2629">I remember this time forever, as a very beautiful time, because I started to dream -- realize my dreams.</span> <span id="s2630">I started to fly with the gliding glider aeroplane.</span> <span id="s2631">Even very famous kokoruznik that killed us at the -- at the fee -- on the field of -- of -- of grines.</span> <span id="s2632">So I flew this kokoruznik, beautiful planes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2633">So I married, but it came -- because you see, at the time was everything occur in Poland.</span> <span id="s2634">A certain people were in power, but then this power shifted.</span> <span id="s2635">And there came to Poland so-called verification of the society.</span> <span id="s2636">So they started to select who are you, what is your background, and if it’s not good, get out.</span> <span id="s2637">At that moment I was the assistant on the faculty of the Warsaw Polytechnic, and there was a first e-e-e-exercise the -- this verification, and I get a paper from the rector, and say sorry he even not pape -- I get a paper, but he called me, and very sadly, he said, “[indecipherable] Mr. Marchaj, you cannot be in the staff of our faculty, and it is not my.</span> <span id="s2638">This is the order, and I cannot do anything to do.”</span> <span id="s2639">So suddenly, I was cut off from my dreams.</span> <span id="s2640">And this was a order that even it’s forbidden for me to enter the airfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: And then you end up in jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: No, that’s the -- at that moment, you see, what’s happened, I started to do this, I started to dream.</span> <span id="s2643">I have to leave Poland, yes?</span> <span id="s2644">I have to leave Poland, if legally, or not legally, I will do this.</span> <span id="s2645">And I started to plan to escape from Poland, very close to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s2646">Vistula River.</span> <span id="s2647">The good boats, and to get out of this country, and going with the very -- speed boats, designed by us, designed by the proper, it was designed by us and prepared by us.</span> <span id="s2648">And these boats were faster than any boats in this area.</span> <span id="s2649">And we had a very great chance to escape.</span> <span id="s2650">But, I have the friends who are not very conscious.</span> <span id="s2651">They st -- shared this -- our -- because they want to participate in our escape, and one of the friends of the friends was a confidant of the -- of the ed -- Polish secret police.</span> <span id="s2652">And before we -- we make a first attempt to get out to the sea, we tested our boats on the Vistula
