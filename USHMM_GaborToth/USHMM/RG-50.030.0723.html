to my grandfather’s house, her – which would have been her father.</span> <span id="s62">And that – that’s the only contact I ever had with my parents, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Well that’s – that sounds pretty – that sounds kind of strange, when most kids do grow up with – with both parents, or at least know them at some – in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, yeah, well yeah, I didn’t – I lived in Hanover as – as well as my father and my – my uncle had a – a large factory here where he made leather heels and soles, and my father was superintendent there.</span> <span id="s65">But growing up, I never saw him at all, never in my life, I never saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So the people who really – who raised you were your grandparents.</span></p>

yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Were you closer to one or the other of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Neither one.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Neither one?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Would you say you were kind of lonely as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Not really, no, I was quite active.</span> <span id="s87">When – when my grandfather was a foreman in a – a wood factory, a mill, and I would take his lunch to him as a child, and I would go up into the drafting room above the office of the mill where all the drawings were made, all contractual drawings were made, and I got interested in – in architecture when I was 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And then I – after I – while going to school I would be in the architect’s office after school and Saturdays, and then of course in su – in the summertime, and that went on for a number of years, a-and then I met Mrs. Coulson in 1936.</span> <span id="s90">I started 1935 with the architect, and went on from there, and then I worked in a number of offices in Baltimore and New York, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: As an architect?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: As an ar – as an architectural draftsman, that’s right, and with Rowan(ph) Park company in Baltimore, which was a large real estate firm.</span> <span id="s93">[indecipherable] Mrs. Coulson, and we were married in – in – now I forget the name [indecipherable] any more, but anyway, we were na – we were married in 1941, and I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You were kind of young to get married, 21 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Oh, I was 20 – 21, yeah, but my wife – Mrs. Coulson was only 19, but she was – she wanted to get married when she was younger, but her parents weren’t too much in favor of that.</span> <span id="s96">But – they said she had to wait til she was 19, which was fine and dandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How – what wa – what’s Mrs. Coulson’s first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Betty J.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Betty J.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Her last name was Fahs, f-a-h-s.</span> <span id="s103">So yeah, yeah, we were married, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Excuse me, I want to go back a little bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: To your – to th – your earlier years.</span> <span id="s107">So, you went to high school – to grade school and high school here in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s109">But my – my senior year, my – I had a – an architectural – I mean, a shop instructor, who felt I had an opportunity to be in architecture.</span> <span id="s110">And anyway, he said, why don’t you try to get more drafting time in, as a senior in high school.</span> <span id="s111">So I went to see the principal of the high school, and he said, I never heard of such a thing.</span> <span id="s112">So anyway, I got upset about this thing and I quit school, which was a big mistake.</span> <span id="s113">Anyway, I guess it was a mistake, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s114">But I – I didn’t finish my senior year.</span> <span id="s115">So I got a job with the other people, other offices and so on, til I was 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Did you live at home with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Oh no, no, we lived with a few – a few years we lived as – it wa – oh no, only a few months with – with my the father-in-law and mother-in-law in York, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s118">And then I went into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And that would have been – what year did you go into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: You were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yep, sure was.</span> <span id="s123">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Well, tell me, where was the first place you were stationed after you were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Fort Mead, Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: And I – I was in –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Excuse me, I – I have to go back, I’m so sorry, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s130">That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: – but I – you were kind of skipping over the early years, and I want to find out a little bit more about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Here in Hanover in Pennsylvania, when it’s 50,000 people now you told me, live in Hanover; when you were growing up, about how big was the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I’d say around 15,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: About 15,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Mm-hm, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And were – were almost all of the people in town Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s139">More – yeah ri – they were – yes, yes.</span> <span id="s140">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And would have they been Catholic as well as Protestant, or – or was this – how –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: They were –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: – how – yeah, who made up the town, who were the townspeople that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Well, most people were – were Protestant, Catholic.</span> <span id="s145">There was a – a small synagogue here, about 50 people I think it was.</span> <span id="s146">As – as a youngster I remember the synagogue, but there were mostly Protestant people, or Christians here.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s148">Did you know any Jewish people when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Oh yes, sure, yeah, quite a few.</span> <span id="s150">But I didn’t – I – I really hadn't much contact with local – as a – as – growing up, after I – I got my experience as an architect, my – my time was spent oth – in other cities, like York and Lancaster, Baltimore and other cities.</span> <span id="s151">So I really didn’t spend that much time in Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Until I – and then I went in the service, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: But in the 1930s – in the 1930s when you’re still going to school, I mean, that decade spans the time from when you’re a young – still a young boy, to the time when you’re already a young man, you know, the adolescent and teenage years.</span> <span id="s155">Was – did y – was there much in your memory – do you remember about international events, and national events being part of – of something that you heard about, that – that people talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s157">I – I was always interested in foreign countries, and I used – I loved to go to the – to the library in the aftern – day after school, and – and read all the city newspapers about what was happening.</span> <span id="s158">So we – we knew that –</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: You knew about Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: – Germany and Japan were – were – had the intentions for a war, and knew it was coming on to us, but at the time I di – it didn’t matter too much, until I was really married, which would have been in the – in the early 40s.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s162">So that’s still before the US goes into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: It’s still before the US declares war on Japan, if you –</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: – it was – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We knew about it, but there weren’t that much information really available, as far as that was concerned, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s169">So let’s go to Fort Mead.</span> <span id="s170">What kind of – what was your experience at Fort Mead?</span> <span id="s171">What did – what was that place for?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, that was – that would have been an army camp, and I was – I was inducted from York, and I was standing in the barracks one day and saw all these fellows coming in from Hanover, and I thought, boy wouldn’t I like to be with them.</span> <span id="s173">So – so we – a few days later, I – after being on KP for a while, and I was cleaning one of the big pots one day, and somebody lifted my feet up, and I went right down into this big cauldron of – of tapioca pudding.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s175">Tapioca pudding?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s177">I had to clean it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, somebody – I was standing on a little ladder and I was cleaning this thing out.</span> <span id="s180">It was a gra – a very big [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: And somebody picked my feet up, lifted up, and I’m down in this thing and I’m screaming and hollering, and – and can’t get out.</span> <span id="s183">And somebody dumped it over, I got out of this – out of this thing, but anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Have you ever had any tapioca pudding after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yeah, oh yes, I loved it, especially with raisins.</span> <span id="s186">But yeah.</span> <span id="s187">But ar –</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So you – you were able to join your – the – the fellows who came from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s190">I was able to join those people with – in the – from Hanover, and somebody, about two o’clock in the morning woke me up and said, get your things together, you’re go – you’re gonna be moving out.</span> <span id="s191">[indecipherable] I just happened to get on the train with the fellows from Hanover, and we went to Camp Edward, Massachusetts, and I went up – I slept in the barracks that night.</span> <span id="s192">The next morning I walked down the stairs, and here is my ba – my brother-in-law [indecipherable] the next barracks.</span> <span id="s193">Fifty million people in the – in the service, and I end up with my brother-in-law right next door.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Well tell me, what – what camp was this in Massachusetts?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well, that was Camp Edwards, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Edwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Oh, Camp Edwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s200">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And what di – you know, so – so how long were yo – how long were you in Fort Mead, do you think?</span> <span id="s202">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: How long where?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You were in Fort Mead.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Oh, only a couple days, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Oh, I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So in Camp Edwards, what was the purpose of – of that camp?</span> <span id="s209">What was – what were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh, it’s really just an induction camp, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: They – they – they – they brought people in there from all over the area, and they – they put them elsewhere, wherever they felt they were – could use them, that’s all.</span> <span id="s213">And I ended up in a – an aircraft, nine millimeter aircraft outfit.</span> <span id="s214">I send – we were in the country for about a year, I guess, and then we were shipped over to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And so you stayed at Camp Edwards the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: You stayed at Camp Edwards for that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Oh yeah – well, no, we – we we moved down to Long Island, and from there we moved to Sen(ph) Island, Georgia, to – I forget the name of the camp down there any more, but anyway, it wa – it was Georgia, and we moved –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: And what kind of – yeah, and what kind of training were you getting?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Only with – I was – I – I was a meteorologist.</span> <span id="s221">So there was four of us, as a meter – what we do is make gas, and we blew up large balloons to send up so that the radar could track the – the balloon, and we put an aluminum kite on the bottom of the balloon, and that would rise up, and then the – the radar could track that, so that the guns would track wherever the radar would take them.</span> <span id="s222">Then the – the radar would pick up the – an airplane and then that would – the guns could shoot at it, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Oh, I see, so this was what your job was, is to be able to – be able to read radar –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Oh yeah, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: – in order for the radar to be able to locate where of – an enemy airplane could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: [indecipherable] the – the – the balloons would rise, and then the radar would pick that up, and the radar would tell the guns where to – where to move.</span> <span id="s227">They were very large guns, they were je – 90 millimeter guns, which were a very big shell.</span> <span id="s228">And there wa – wa – that’s what – we used that for – so we went overseas as – as a – an anti-aircraft</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Anti-aircraft, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s231">So we trained in England and – and for a few months.</span> <span id="s232">And there I met a number of architects who were there designing buildings already, and highways for after the war, and I met people there from the – the British architects’ board, and we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s233">So a – I got –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Where di – where in England were you stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Where in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Where in England, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Oh gee.</span> <span id="s238">I kn – I know the [indecipherable] there.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Was it north?</span> <span id="s240">Was it up north?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No, it was – it was the more – more sa – we were close to Manchester –</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: You were close to Manchester, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: – England, yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s244">We weren’t too far from London.</span> <span id="s245">Never got to London though.</span> <span id="s246">I got into Manchester already.</span> <span id="s247">We were there only a couple of months, and then, of course, we went to Europe, and I got seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Were you part of D-Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span> <span id="s250">No, we landed at Cherbourg, and went from there to about seven different countries, I guess.</span> <span id="s251">We were – we were hunting the Germans down, but we had something to shoot at for a while, but there’s a [indecipherable] we didn’t have any more airplanes, German airplanes to shoot at, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Tell me, when you landed in Cherbourg, what – do you remember when you landed?</span> <span id="s253">Was that after D-Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: That was about the same time as D-Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s258">So would have been June, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: That’s correct, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s262">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: And from Cherbourg – I’d like to go into some detail here, if you – if you remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: From Cherbourg you were – you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Oh, we went across France and we were stationed right outside of the Battle of the Bulge because they were going to use our guns as field artillery.</span> <span id="s267">They found out that they were good – they were good guns for field artillery instead of – we had no gu – no German airplanes to shoot at.</span> <span id="s268">So then we – I never got to Paris, oh – even though it was only a few miles from there, went into Belgium –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were you part of a particular division, a unit, or – or larger military presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yeah – no, I – yeah, we were in the – in the Eighth Army, about – yeah, it was only for a short time, eventually got into the Seventh Army for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s271">And after the – well, we were – we were stationed just outside of the Bulge there, and went for there to oh, a number of positions and then we moved south, just 50 miles from – from Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So you went first towards Belgium, a – you went through France –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: – up to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did you get into The Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, we were in The Netherlands –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you see battle at that point?</span> <span id="s279">I mean, were you involved in battles, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s281">We w – we were just really moving around and looking for some – for airplanes to shoot at.</span> <span id="s282">That’s – but there – there weren’t anything to shoot at.</span> <span id="s283">So we – so we had gra – some great times together.</span> <span id="s284">One day somebody – one of the – some Germans told us that one of the banks had some – some – a lot of the cash in it, so they wanted some money, and so on, so we – these shells were like, oh, very large, and so we – one of the fellows took one of the guns and put it right outside the door of the bank, it shot right through the door, and through the – through the safe door, blew the safe all apart, and we got a lot of money, but it wa – it wasn’t – it was all German marks or – that didn’t mean much to us.</span> <span id="s285">We gave it to all the people, the neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s287">What town was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Oh, I – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I – I have a pi – I have a picture of it somewhere as a – but anyways, we – we decided we’re gonna get – but we – we – every terri – country we got into, we had – had to exchange our money for – for marks or liras, or whatever it was, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So when you were in this German town, the war was still going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh sure, you bet it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And this was simply a town that was occupied within th-the territory that was being occupied by the allied forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah, ri –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s299">But it wa – the war was moving pretty fast there for a while.</span> <span id="s300">Near the end, til I got involved with it, we were stationed like – as I said, about 50 miles from Dachau.</span> <span id="s301">And then I saw in, one morning I saw a – I noticed on the board, the bulletin board that somebody wa – was needed somewhere, ha-ha-had an architectural experience, and I volunteered.</span> <span id="s302">I had no idea where I was going.</span> <span id="s303">So somebody told me to pack my bags, and a guy – I jumped in a – in a Jeep with a driver, and lo and behold, he takes me to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Okay, before we get there –</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: – before we get there, from – you said you were in seven countries with the anti-aircraft?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Just about that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s309">So we’re talking France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah, germ –</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: That’s four.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Where would the other –</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s317">Northern Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Northern Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: But this was – this was later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I mentioned Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: No, you didn’t mention – so did you go to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah, yeah, right, down the mountains, yeah, over –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And is that still during war time, or after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No, that was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Okay, so, bef –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: When we were at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Okay, so when – by the time you got to Dachau, it had been – you’d only been to four countries –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: – of the seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And do you remember where you were when the war ended?</span> <span id="s333">The day of lib –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah, well, I was at Dachau when –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Oh, so you got to Dachau before the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s337">I – I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: The [indecipherable] got into Dachau the 29th of April, and I got there the 30th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: First – I’m sorry, the first of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s344">So it was only about three days after the first Americans got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And what did you fi – when you first got there, what did you see, and did you understand what you were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: All I saw was a lot of dead people.</span> <span id="s349">At Dachau, anyway.</span> <span id="s350">I-I was told to go to this office building, which was really one of the ca – the gates where the architectural engineering office was.</span> <span id="s351">That was for doing my job, and that’s where I met Alfons Kamyczek(ph), who was a – who worked in the office for the German SS shir – the SS troopers, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Who was this Alfred Kamyczek(ph) – Alfons Kamyczek(ph), who was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: He was – he was a prisoner of – from Poland, he was a prisoner for four years, he – he had picked them up when he was 18 years old, and he – they took him to Dachau, why I don’t know, and while he was there, he learned to speak German and English.</span> <span id="s354">And he was in the architectural office, or the engineering office, where all the records were.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And what was your job supposed to be?</span> <span id="s356">You know, when they asked for someone with architectural background, what do they want him for?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, the funny – funny part about it was, that nobody ever told me what to do.</span> <span id="s358">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Really, yeah.</span> <span id="s361">Well, things were moving so fast, you know.</span> <span id="s362">People were being shot, and it was – all kinds of things were going on, and – and at the time I was just happy to be in this office, and I would get things to eat that people – Americans were – half the Americans were already there, so their rations and so on were re – being brought in by the American army.</span> <span id="s363">And we were trying to get rid of all the SS people over there, and the war was still moving on.</span> <span id="s364">Th-Th-The –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: It was the final days, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yeah, it was, yeah, it’s exactly right, yeah.</span> <span id="s367">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So – okay, so I’d like, again, I want to back up a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: When we get to Dachau, and this guy – yo-you’re told to pack your bags, you’re not told where to go, where you’re going to be going –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: – and you get – and you get to this place –</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Sure, sa –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: – do you remember what it is that you saw, right at the gates?</span> <span id="s375">Did you remember any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Oh, well, I – I saw the – the – there was a disarray.</span> <span id="s377">Nobody re – nobody really knew what they were doing, or what they were supposed to do, other than shoot the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Okay, but did you – did you – did you understand where you were heading?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Oh yeah, well I didn’t – no, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s380">When – when I was told – I mean, I saw the – the bul – on the bulletin board, the notice that somebody was needed, I had no idea where I was going, or anything else.</span> <span id="s381">I didn’t know who – where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did you know that there were such things as concentration camps before –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s384">No, I never – I never even knew that – I never even heard of Dachau before.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Sa – so, that’s why I’m say it – it was kind of crazy, because I – I didn’t – I haven’t – I was foolish really for – in the service you don’t volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: But I – I volunteered to do whatever they said, because it – I thought well, somebody needs an architect, or a mar – somebody with architectural experience.</span> <span id="s389">So when I get there, I meet this man, Alfons Kamyczek(ph), he’s in the office as – as – he’s just there.</span> <span id="s390">In fact, he lived there, as well, in the – in the – in the – it was in the building.</span> <span id="s391">So anyway, he told me what happens there, we ha – we were in charge of the – the water and sewer and – and then I ended up being the director to – to pick up all these bodies.</span> <span id="s392">And I said well, what are we go – what are we going to use, and anyway – and we ended up with an old tractor, a – and a – a trailer to pull behind the tractor.</span> <span id="s393">So we had to go over to the barracks where these people were di – if – if you –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Were there still prisoners in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Oh, my heavens, yes, there was 30,000 there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: When you walked in there were still 30,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Oh sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s398">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s399">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did anybody come up to you, of these – of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh – oh, yeah, why, sure, I talked to a – in fact, I have pictures of some of them, and yeah, I got to know quite a few of them, but those – there was a lot of people in the barracks that were dead, that we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s402">If you didn’t move, you didn’t move your anything, you were considered dead.</span> <span id="s403">We had a – a dentist as a – as a doctor, so what could he do for us?</span> <span id="s404">And so nobody really knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Well, did anyone give you an explanation of what you had come across?</span> <span id="s406">If you didn’t know that there even had been such a place as Dachau, who – who explained to you why they were there, and who these people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Well, as I say, a pa – the – the – the – the American army was coming through, they were – they were getting all the guards together, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s408">In fact, I have some pictures of them shoo – shooting them.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you see these executions?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, I took a picture of them, in fact, while they were going there.</span> <span id="s411">These poor guys were standing there with their hands up, and the Americans shot them anyway, it didn’t make any difference; they were guards.</span> <span id="s412">But th-the German SS guarded the things, but when these people were – were dead, and they were either gassed, or whatever, into the crematory, they were – th-the – the Germans didn’t – they didn’t handle these people that were passed away or put into the crematory.</span> <span id="s413">They would get prisoners of theirs from the – from the barracks to come in and do all this work in the crematory.</span> <span id="s414">So they would move the bodies around with their bare hands and so on, and put them in the furnaces, or whatever.</span> <span id="s415">And – but they – the – the SS didn’t do the – they didn’t actually do any of the work, they just did the orders, it’s – in other words, they directed the people what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: By the time you got to that camp, were there any SS still there, or they’d all been either arrested, or escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh, there ba – there were a lot of SS there, there were loads of SS there.</span> <span id="s418">We had si – 30,000 prisoners in the camp when I got there, from 31 different countries.</span> <span id="s419">And so, they were – they were told that they could leave.</span> <span id="s420">Well, they wanted something to eat, so they were eating American rations, and so on, and – but – but the thing is, a lot of those people couldn’t even walk, they didn’t know where they were from, they didn’t know what they were gonna see when they got home, and the – this – the roads were just fi-filled with people all over the place, and the ro – other ca – other prisoners in other camps, they were also let go.</span> <span id="s421">And they were all, everybody was out in the street, walking, just walking, they didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s422">So – and there was no transportation provided for them, so – so you just – they – I don’t know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s423">I was just there in the camp, just happy to be – be there.</span> <span id="s424">And I remember one day some bird colonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it’s good to see you here, he said, I’ll see you when you leave.</span> <span id="s425">And that was my orders.</span> <span id="s426">So I – I had been da – a couple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca – to his house, which was located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and so on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that’s the only – that’s the only orders I had, and I was there for a year.</span> <span id="s427">And then eventually the – the war crimes trials came in t-to the camp, and they – and they tried the – the people that were still living.</span> <span id="s428">And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners, poor souls, and they’re treated like animals.</span> <span id="s429">Animals are better treated than these people were.</span> <span id="s430">And I met a lot of people.</span> <span id="s431">I met people from Austria and so on.</span> <span id="s432">I met a count there, and I met the other – the officers’ mess – the American officers’ mess had a – a German chef, who I had him – I don’t know, and he and I became friends.</span> <span id="s433">So – so he wanted me to – to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains.</span> <span id="s434">So one day he took me down to see the ski lodge, it was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s435">Anyway, he said – I said, well, what are – what do I have to put into it to buy this?</span> <span id="s436">He said, well, do you ha – for half of it you’re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars, with real, actual cash.</span> <span id="s437">And we said – I said, I’m not allowed to have American cash here.</span> <span id="s438">So he said, well, can you get it?</span> <span id="s439">And I se – I wrote to my wife and said, just send me 300 American dollars, which she did.</span> <span id="s440">And anyway, I said to this – this German chef that – but which was going to be my partner for the – the chateau.</span> <span id="s441">And – and I said, how am I gonna get my money out of it when I leave here, how can – how can I get my money?</span> <span id="s442">Cause there was no – no di – no transfer of money funds or anything else between the countries at that time.</span> <span id="s443">And anyway, he said I don’t know.</span> <span id="s444">So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well with that.</span> <span id="s445">But so – my 300 dollar – I don’t know what these poor souls did with the American money.</span> <span id="s446">Most cases I sold it to the – the Germans, they bought most of the money, because Americans weren’t allowed to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Well, tell me, for how mu – do you remember what the black market rate was for an American dollar?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Oh, I have no idea, I have no i –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s451">I sold cigarettes, which we’d get a carton of cigarettes every week, and I used to sell them.</span> <span id="s452">And I sent the money back, and after a while they were catching up to us sending all this money back home, so – so I – anyway, they decided that evwa – everybody would have to have a – the – a book that when you got your pay, which I got five dollars a month, and then they’d write down in that book, and – that you had – that you got five dollars in pay, so you couldn’t send any more money back any more.</span> <span id="s453">We weren’t allowed to send – send it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So, I want to understand a few things about what you just told me, because some of it is clear, and some of it is confusing to me.</span> <span id="s455">You get to – you get to Dachau –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: – you go into a building –</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: – and this is, I don’t know what kind of building.</span> <span id="s460">Was this an office building within the campground?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yes, some of the buildings are very nice, as there – some buildings were three and four stories, and well-built for the – the SS had used as a training camp, and then they switched over to just as a – as a se – a concentration camp, where they brought people in from all the – all over Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Yeah, but the building that you went into, that you found Alfons Kamarek(ph) there –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Right, that was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: – what was – what was that building for?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Okay, that – oh, that’s a large – that was several stories.</span> <span id="s466">That was – it was really one of the gates.</span> <span id="s467">The gate.</span> <span id="s468">In fact, there’s a picture in my – in my book there.</span> <span id="s469">And we had about, let’s see, one, two, three, four d – rooms, and I had an apartment on the – the third floor, where I slept.</span> <span id="s470">And – well, it wasn’t an apartment, it was just a bedroom, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And who – would a – who would have slept there before you did?</span> <span id="s472">Jur –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh, I – I would think it was – I think it was just empty space, as far as that was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s476">The – the first floor was all office area, and – and the American sold – soldier used to – was like a big eagle over the gate, right next door to us, and I used to hear this popping sound, and the Americans were – used to try to shoot the eyes out of the big eagle that were a-a-above the gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: So this was an iron gate, not a real – not a real bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh no – oh no, it was a big bird, the German eagle, or whatever it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: – above the gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: And then – and the gate was down below.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: But it was – it was – it was a metal eagle.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Oh yeah, right, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: It was a metal eagle.</span> <span id="s486">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: – oh yes, yeah, sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s488">Didn’t know about plastic then.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Or not much about them, anyway.</span> <span id="s491">So yeah, was a big –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: – big metal – yes, th-the eagle.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: – you – you got to know this – this Polish prisoner of war, whose name was Alfons.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: And did he tell you anything of what had been going on in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh yeah, oh sure, he told me quite a bit about what was happening there, what had happened, and how he was treated, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: What did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: If – well, if someone tried to escape somewhere – I don’t know how they ever get out, I don’t think the – I think there was a big wall around the whole round – the whole camp, so – cause the people in Dachau, which was only about a half a mile away –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: – said that they didn’t know what was going on in the camp.</span> <span id="s502">They had all these – the commandants and the – the – the German officials and so on, lived in nice houses just outside the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: So, I don’t know, I guess the people in Dachau – I mean in – in the – yeah, the town of Dachau thought that was just a training camp for the SS there.</span> <span id="s505">That’s was there from 1933, so up to – until the 40s, then it became a concentration camp, and the SS operated it.</span> <span id="s506">So Alfons told me almost what I had to do, what he was doing for years, was making drawings, and so on for buildings and things like this.</span> <span id="s507">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: What kind of – excuse me, I’m going to go into some detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: What kind of buildings was he making drawings for?</span> <span id="s511">Within the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Oh yeah, oh, everything was i – was in the camp, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s513">Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s515">And what kind of drawings – what kind of buildings was he making the drawings for?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Well, there – there were – well, most of them were to house the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I see, barracks and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: And – yeah, right, yeah, the barracks and so on, things like that.</span> <span id="s519">Or service buildings, and so on, maybe it’s a place of – to house th-the vicious dogs and so on.</span> <span id="s520">So it – if somebody tried to escape, they’d send the dogs after them, or whatever, and then when they caught them down there, they’d shoot them, so – so there’s not much chance to get away.</span> <span id="s521">But Alfons would tell me, many days, if somebody tried to escape or work – coming back from their work, outside the barracks, they all had to line up there, and they had to stand there until they caught this guy, and then, no matter what the weather was, if it was snowing or raining, or whatever it was, or heat or whatever, they had to stand out there in the street until they found them.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: And that was days [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Here’s another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: – many hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: When you met Alfons, he was a prisoner, or he had been a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: He had been a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: And then you saw people who were in the barracks, who were still alive, but barely.</span> <span id="s529">Did Alfons look any different from them?</span> <span id="s530">Did – he was – was he just as skeletal and as mal –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: No, was – the odd thing about it was that he – h-he was fairly dressed.</span> <span id="s532">I mean, he had shirt and trousers on.</span> <span id="s533">Where he got them, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t know where he got them.</span> <span id="s535">But the – the prisoners, the-they – they’re – they’re – they’re [indecipherable] next to rags when th – when they came in there, and they were always brought in on trains, closed boxcars and so on.</span> <span id="s536">Most – some of them were open, but most of them are closed, that way nobody outside, the civilians wouldn’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: – who was coming in there on the trains.</span> <span id="s539">And so that’s where the death train was parked, somewhere outside our office.</span> <span id="s540">Everybody smelled this thing one day, and wondered what was going on.</span> <span id="s541">And when somebody opened the doors on, and that’s where we saw these two guys that – two out of 400 that lived.</span> <span id="s542">So a friend of mine went down to – into the – in Dachau and got the mayor and I don’t know who all, all – some of the officials, and brought them out to – to – to take these people off the cars that were there, the dead people that were there.</span> <span id="s543">And they had them – th-there was no gloves or anything else, they had to use their bare hands, he insisted on that, that d – that day, taking these people out.</span> <span id="s544">So what they did is they hauled them to the crematory and they were disposed of there, the bodies –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So the mayor and other officials from Dachau were told –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: From Dachau they br – he – he – he went in, collect all these people up and brought them out to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh yeah, sure, because th-the train was just a short distance from where our office was.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And how did the mayor of Dachau behave when he was told to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Well, he wasn’t too happy about it, let me tell you, none of them were, cause they said they didn’t know that this was happening.</span> <span id="s551">So – so anyhow, there’s these 400 people, they’re almost all dead, and – and it was just a horrible mess, and so they had to pick these people up and take them to the crematory.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Was that far from the place where the train was?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Oh, it was maybe a block or two away.</span> <span id="s554">So th-they had to dispose of them, and they – they cleaned the cars up somewhat, and they just wipe them out, or whatever.</span> <span id="s555">They had [indecipherable] brooms or something that they had, and cleaned up the – the freight cars, but [interruption, coughing] Pardon, I’m talking too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s557">We’ll hold on just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Pardon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: We can hold on just a minute.</span> <span id="s560">We can hold on.</span> <span id="s561">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: – at the – cleaning out the de – the death train.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: So when we’re cleaning out the death train, you have all these sort of town officials from Dachau there –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: – having to do this with their hands, saying that they didn’t know what was going on –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: – before, and not happy that they have to get themselves in –</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: And th-they had to clean these cars out there –</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: – and – and dispose of these – the deceased people that were on the train.</span> <span id="s573">I have no idea where they were from.</span> <span id="s574">They were probably brought in from other camps.</span> <span id="s575">But, as the war was moving on real fast, the SS didn’t want the Americans to talk to any of these people, but they were bringing people in from other camps, hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s576">They were probably bringing in from other ca – other areas, into Dachau, and then, of course, you try to get rid of them and you – and they were trying to take them to other camps from there.</span> <span id="s577">And the the Americans caught them because they were moving so fast.</span> <span id="s578">The war –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: So in other words, they – they were – they – the – the peop – the SS, which was in charge of the concentration camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: – was trying to get – to keep them separate from their –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: From the Americans talking to anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: – from the Americans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: – or seeing – seeing what they were really doing there.</span> <span id="s585">But these people were lying in the – in the barracks and so on.</span> <span id="s586">Most of them were dead anyway, so the – like I say, if you didn’t move, you were considered dead.</span> <span id="s587">So, we just pile them up and put them on the gurney, or whatever it was that we had there, and either took them to a – a – we – we got a bulldozer to dig a big hole, and you just pushed these dead people in the – the – you know, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And who was – who was manning the bulldozer?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Oh, I had one of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: American?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: – that was American –</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: American.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: – that was American, oh yeah, it was American.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: But it was – yeah, the Americans brought the – the engineers brought a bulldozer from some other camp somewhere, and we just dug a big hole and pushed them in.</span> <span id="s596">Was a sad day, but nobody knew who these people were.</span> <span id="s597">No had – nobody had any idea who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: I can imagine that everybody was shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Oh, well, it was just – that was the – the thing that I’d been doing the day, and that never happened, nobody di – they didn’t really think anything about it.</span> <span id="s600">Everybody was upset about it, I’m sure, because I know people tell me that when they saw these things that – that they couldn’t believe that this was happening to anybody, any human being, how they were treated.</span> <span id="s601">At Dachau they – they did many tests there.</span> <span id="s602">The doctors would try different inoculations on the people.</span> <span id="s603">They put them in – they were testing a palette of – of uniforms there, and they – they put them in cold water, because if the power came down over the – the – the ocean between England and – and France, they would be in cold water.</span> <span id="s604">They wanted to know what – what kind of uniforms you should make for them.</span> <span id="s605">These tests were all done before we got there, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Did somebody show you the places where these were done?</span> <span id="s607">I mean, is this – did you go to those places where –</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure we went there, but that was all part of the camp, there were special rooms, and so forth, these tests were done.</span> <span id="s609">And – and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I’m interested to find out what it is that you saw.</span> <span id="s611">In other words, did – did someone bring you around from room to room to explain, this is what –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Oh no, we just walked on our own.</span> <span id="s613">You just went wherever you wanted to go, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Was there any place that you went, that looked kind of confusing, you know, what was this for, or what was that for?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s616">Well th – one of the experimental buildings, you had to – where – where these tests were done, and so on, one of the tests I know they – they put these people in ice – in ice water, like in the – which would have been the ocean, and they put them in – they took these guys out, and put them in bed with two girls.</span> <span id="s617">They wanted to see if body heat was going to revive them.</span> <span id="s618">And I don’t know why, because they wouldn’t have them out in the airplane, it didn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s619">But anyway, that’s what they were doing.</span> <span id="s620">They were trying all kinds of tests there, different kind of – of diseases and so on.</span> <span id="s621">And of course you end up hanging the – the doctor who was in charge of all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Oh yeah, I saw him, yeah, before their – I remember they took him to the war crimes trials, that’s where I saw him, but I never went to the war cri – I didn’t really care about what was happening at the – at the war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s624">They had all the – the German SS people over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Were you – when you’re telling me these things, what I’m not sure is, is this – this something you learned afterwards, when you were out of the camp, or di – someone told you when you were in the camp?</span> <span id="s626">H-How –</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, I was – I was in the office most of the time.</span> <span id="s628">We were –</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s630">And what was your – what were you doing in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Well, we were – we were making drawings [indecipherable] instructed over what to do and so on.</span> <span id="s632">You gotta remember, I was only 23 years old, I didn’t have that much experience myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: I got that.</span> <span id="s634">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: But I’m trying to get a sense of what your experience – not that you had to know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: But, for example, when you were making drawings in the office, since it was no longer a concentration camp, and people were being let go, what were you making drawings of?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Well, the thing was, what we were doing renovations, because they were – they were getting ready to have the war crimes trials there, just for those people that were in the camp.</span> <span id="s640">And there was a like a couple hundred people that were there, that were prisoners, SS officers and so on.</span> <span id="s641">And that’s where they had the war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s642">And the doctor was there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Within Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: In Dachau, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So they didn’t go to Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Oh no, no, not these people.</span> <span id="s647">These people were considered low class people.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: And they have – they held the – the – the – the hearings right there, and if the guy was guilty, we took him – or they took him out and hung him, and that was it.</span> <span id="s650">It didn’t make much difference.</span> <span id="s651">So one day –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So you – excu – okay, one day, mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Some – some officer walked in, I don’t know what he was any more, and he said they wanted a new gallows because when they hung these people, these newspapers were there and so on, and they would see these guys hanging there, down below the – the ba – the floorboards, they’d come through, and they’d take pictures of them.</span> <span id="s654">And so these peop – the American officers didn’t want that any more, so they asked me to design a new gallows for them, which we did, and then all we did was put some canvas around it, so that the – the newspaper people who were there couldn’t see or take pictures of these people that were hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: So, it was – it was pretty crude when you really think about it.</span> <span id="s657">There was the – there was really no order.</span> <span id="s658">The object was just to get rid of these people who were running the camp, that was it, really.</span> <span id="s659">It was – it didn’t make any difference – we had – some people would – would talk about other – they’d get information about their fellow workers and so on.</span> <span id="s660">So that’s how people knew what their jobs were, because the Germans didn’t want – and I don’t know what I want to say here – they didn’t want to – they didn’t want their – their buddies to n – to know what they were – what they were doing when these pe – when the pri – the prisoners were there.</span> <span id="s661">So that’s really what the war crimes trials were all about, you know, just – actually it was just a ha – it was really a farce when you really think about it, because they just wanted to get rid of these people that were guards there, of the – of the inmates, th-the pri – the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Okay, I’m a – I’m a little confused here.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: When you’re in the camp, you have – you come in and there’s still lots and lots of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: And some of them are the former guards and – and those who were, you know, in charge, whether they were highest level or not –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: – but they were in charge.</span> <span id="s669">And now they are prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: And the – and then you have thousands upon thousands of former prisoners, who they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s674">And during the time you were there, did those former prisoners leave, or did they ste –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: They were told to – they were told to leave, yeah, because we didn’t want them there.</span> <span id="s676">We had to feed them, we had to take care of them and so on.</span> <span id="s677">We didn’t – we didn’t want them there any more because they’d just leave, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Well, did they, or did they stay cause they had nowhere to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, some of them stayed there because they had nowhere to go, and I would – whe-when I needed help in the office, I would get drafts-people – I – in fact, I had two people, I have pictures of them, two drafts-people from Berlin, and they didn’t want to go back to Berlin because the Russians were there, and the russ – and the Russians and the Germans hated each other.</span> <span id="s680">So these people stayed on there, I – I told the guys the fact that there was a front door right in our office that walked out on the street, that – which bypassed the gate.</span> <span id="s681">And I told them to go ahead and leave, and they said they didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s682">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: These were former prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No, these were – yeah, these were German prisoner of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Okay, no, they weren’t former prisoners of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, no, they were – they were wi – I would get [indecipherable] we brought – we brought 4,000 German prisoners in to live in the camp after all the other people left.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: They were prisoners of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: So anyway, I got two drafts-people out – out of the cage.</span> <span id="s691">If we wanted a plumber, or somebody to fix the plumbing, we got somebody out of the cage that was a prisoner of ours then, because we had prisoners br-brought in.</span> <span id="s692">And we had nowhere to take them, so we had to put them in there, some of them were a big – some people lived at the – the – oh, the racetrack, and they lived in the barns there, they had prisoners there.</span> <span id="s693">We didn’t know what to do with them, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: So these prisoners, the German prisoners now –</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: That’s right, all ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: – were coming in – of yours – of the American –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: A-After these – after we got – we got some of the people out from other countries –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: – that were prisoner of th – of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Okay, did they live in the same barracks that the other prisoners have lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: No, they had – they had some – they had nicer buildings to live in, they didn’t – they didn’t stay in these – in these shacks that they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: No, they had better buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: So the Americans – Americans housed them in better facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: That’s right, yeah, that’s what they had to do.</span> <span id="s708">We had about 4,000 there.</span> <span id="s709">They were from Hungary and Italy and from all counties.</span> <span id="s710">They – they were – they were fighting against us.</span> <span id="s711">In other words, they were our prisoners –</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: – and we took over them, and – and then – then we let them go, after a while, you know, if they weren’t too important.</span> <span id="s714">They were from all countries, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So – so, were you designing anything else, besides gallows?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Oh yeah, well other buildings for remodeling mostly, it was – was.</span> <span id="s717">Course a lot of the buildings were already there, they were good buildings, some of them were three and four stories of brick construction, in fact.</span> <span id="s718">There were some very good buildings there.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Did Alfons Kanarek(ph) stay with you the whole time, or did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Oh yeah, he was – no, he was there the whole time.</span> <span id="s721">Fact, he was there when I left, and I don’t know why he didn’t go back to Poland, but he said he didn’t have any way to get there, so he wasn’t going to walk.</span> <span id="s722">So – and there was no trains, there were trains, but – but they didn’t want to leave there.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Did he ever –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: – because I would – I would get him food, and cigarettes and all that sort of thing, and some – and tobacco, and he loved that.</span> <span id="s725">So – so – and then we had other people there who knew where the sewers were, an-and the water, and supplies like that, who had been bordering as well.</span> <span id="s726">Fact, I have pictures of them there in the kitchen, and they were – they came – became workers for us.</span> <span id="s727">In other words, they worked – they were working for me.</span> <span id="s728">But they didn’t – they didn’t get a salary or anything, they just got the goodies that we could give them, that’s all, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And they got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: That’s exactly right, yeah.</span> <span id="s731">And wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Now, did you – a – a lot of people say that in those first days when – when the US forces came in, and – and the starving prisoners of the Germans, that is the – the victims –</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: – of the concentration camp who were still alive, would ask for food, and they would eat it so fast that they would die from –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Oh yeah, yeah but –</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Yeah, did you – did you have those types of things happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I – I didn’t really know.</span> <span id="s738">I – I – I was never involved with the people that were there.</span> <span id="s739">I don’t know, I saw them, that’s all.</span> <span id="s740">Because my work was really just in the office, in there with Alfons and some of the other people that were prisoners of the Germans, who worked on the water and sewer lines and things like that.</span> <span id="s741">So we kept them on because they knew where these things were.</span> <span id="s742">Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known where anything was.</span> <span id="s743">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: – so we kept them on, and like I said too, the people that I had from Berlin, they wouldn’t leave because they – they again were – were scared of the Germans.</span> <span id="s746">They – I mean, they – the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: They – they didn’t get along at all, not one bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Did Alfons ever tell you his personal story of what happened to him, and how he happened to come into that office?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No, I don’t know how he did it, I have no idea how they selected him, or anything else.</span> <span id="s751">He was just there when I got there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s753">Because it sounds – because it sounds from what you’re telling me, he was in a rather privileged position for a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yeah, he was – he was a prisoner of si – of the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: And as – like I say, they picked him up when he was 18 years old, and he was there for four years, so he was about my same as – age as I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Ah, it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: And we became good friends.</span> <span id="s759">But he was just there.</span> <span id="s760">But he was there when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s762">And so your job was, if I can summarize it, if I can understand it, your job was to – was to provide the drawings for whatever renovations had to be done in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: [indecipherable] renovations are – of new buildings, or things of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: But we didn’t have that much to do really.</span> <span id="s766">There was a lot of playtime.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Well, that’s – wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s769">But I – I really wasn’t interested – pardon me – I wasn’t inter – really interested in what was going on, the pla – in the – the war crimes trials, I really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s770">All I knew was that they had gathered them all up in these buildings and so on, the SS people, and they had their war crimes trials there.</span> <span id="s771">And whoever was there, most of them were hung.</span> <span id="s772">I don’t think –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Tell me, why do you call it a farce?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Why did you call it a farce?</span> <span id="s776">I mean, you said that these trials were a bit of a farce.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s779">Why – what made it that way di – for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, the thing is that nobody wanted – wanted to talk about their buddies and so on, so that they didn’t really have too much information.</span> <span id="s781">They knew that they were already there, they knew they were guards, because they got them out of the guard – the guard buildings.</span> <span id="s782">So th-they would – one prisoner might tell about what the other guy did, or something like that.</span> <span id="s783">But it really didn’t make any difference; if they were guards, they were shot, and that was it.</span> <span id="s784">A lot of them were shot even before the war crimes trials came there, and – the Americans were so upset about what they saw there, cause they couldn’t understand that these kind of things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: And they just got the guards out of the building, right, so one day, the – they let the prisoners out of the – out of the camp, out of – they cut the wire, and so on, or the gates, and let them out.</span> <span id="s787">And they went up in the towers, and threw these guards right out the window, which are like three stories high, or something like that.</span> <span id="s788">And so the – some of them were – they ga – the inmates killed them.</span> <span id="s789">The-There was some that I – that I never saw many women that were there, there were some that I ti – I took a picture of one day and – but th – I don’t know where they brought the women from, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s790">That really wasn’t a women’s camp, it was mostly for men.</span> <span id="s791">I think they were brought in right before the end of the war, and the people – a lot of the women went into Dachau and smashed the – the windows.</span> <span id="s792">They had women’s clothing hanging may – in there, you know, on a – some sort of a form or some such thing in the window.</span> <span id="s793">And they just take the – their clothes off, standing right there in the window and – and put these new clothes on that they got out of the – out of Dachau stores.</span> <span id="s794">So it was pretty –</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: I wa – I don’t understand this part.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So, former – former female prisoners –</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: – in Dachau –</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: – were let go out of the camp, so they went into Dachau, which is only like a half a mile away.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Oh, the town, okay, they went into the Dachau town.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: The stores, that’s right, the town, and they just smashed the windows if they couldn’t get in the store, if the door was locked, they just smashed the windows, and standing in there, take all their clothes off, the rags that they had on, and put the new clothes on that they found, you know, in the windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: But anyway, I – I saw one of the girls was mistreated by someone of the SS officer, or some such thing.</span> <span id="s805">And she got a knife from a friend of mine and cut his testicles off, right there in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s806">So, they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s807">That’s what I’m saying, i-it was just a madhouse.</span> <span id="s808">Nobody – nobody knew – we knew that the Americans were in control, and the Germans had to listen to whatever they did.</span> <span id="s809">If they didn’t listen, they got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: It didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s812">You know, Americans can be cruel, you know, I – I’ve seen things that – that Americans have done that are just as cruel as any German ever did, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Oh yeah, they did – they – they were bad news too, some of them.</span> <span id="s815">Especially the paratroopers.</span> <span id="s816">They were just young kids and they were – they were gung-ho, they would kill anybody that they can shoot.</span> <span id="s817">It didn’t matter a – a bit.</span> <span id="s818">But anyway, Dachau was a – a mess.</span> <span id="s819">We got it cleaned up pretty well in the year I was there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: You were there for a whole year?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Oh yeah, I – yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s822">Yeah, I left –</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: So you saw a lot in that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Oh yeah, oh goodness yeah.</span> <span id="s825">But then a lot of things I didn’t really want to see, you know, I – like I say, I didn’t go to the trials.</span> <span id="s826">I never went to hangings.</span> <span id="s827">I – I just wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s828">You know, I was married and I wanted to – I was just a young kid, really, and – and this was all new to me.</span> <span id="s829">I could never imagine these things happening; how they treated other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Tell me about – you know, you had your camera with you, what kind of camera was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Oh, I don’t know, it’s – well, the Germans weren’t allowed to have cameras, knives, anything that could hurt an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: And – but Alfons had his own camera, and that was one of our biggest problems.</span> <span id="s834">The fil – the film we got might have been old, and we traded it for cigarettes, or candy, or chocolate bars, or something like that.</span> <span id="s835">You couldn’t walk to the grocery store, or – or a – a drugstore and buy film there, there wasn’t a such thing.</span> <span id="s836">In other words, we get – we get film from people who already had it, and some of it was good, and some of it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s837">Sometimes you’d give them a – a chocolate bar for a – a box of film, and it was no good, it was already exposed, as – so we got any kind of film at all that – that you could get your hands on.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: So you had a camera, and he had a camera?</span> <span id="s839">Both of you had – two ki –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we both had, yeah, we were – well, we were allowed to have cameras, but – and of course, Alfons, I don’t know where he got his camera, I have no idea, cause I – he could speak German, so he could go out and talk to these people in Dachau and get things, and he was able to bring things back from the stores in Dachau [indecipherable] there, or steal or whatever he could do, you know, he’d just take it, you know, cause that – the Germans would give up anything because they – they just didn’t want to be executed right there on the spot, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: – yeah, that was a bad year, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s844">I – I was glad to get out of there [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Well tell me – I know, but we’re gonna dwell on it still a little bit, I’m sorry to say, because there are more questions.</span> <span id="s846">When you tell me things, that – more questions about it –</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s848">I don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s850">So you would get ou – you would get the film, but not everybody would want to take pictures.</span> <span id="s851">What made you want to take pictures of what you were seeing?</span> <span id="s852">Cause in the photo album you’re donating to us –</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Well, what it actually – well, everybody – Alfons did the same thing, you know, we’d pi – take a picture of the gate, or – or the – or people lining the – in the – th-the – the cadavers were lying in the – the – the – the pick-up trucks.</span> <span id="s854">We were – maybe we thought it was going to be evidence sometime, y-you know, that maybe somebody would want it, that’s all.</span> <span id="s855">There was really no reason to – to take pictures, it was just that we wanted to do it, I guess for our own use later on.</span> <span id="s856">And – but I had those pictures laying at home for years, and never looked at them anyway.</span> <span id="s857">I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Tell me, how did you develop them there?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh, Alfons, for some reason or other, he was able to do this in his office.</span> <span id="s860">I don’t know how he did it, where he got the film.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, he had a little closet like where he would develop these film for me, and for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: And that’s the only two cameras that were in the office, you know, just his and mine.</span> <span id="s864">And then we’d get film all different sizes.</span> <span id="s865">A lot of times you couldn’t use it anyway, because it was – you know, it was exposed, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Were there any pictures that you took that didn’t get developed because the films –</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Oh my heavens, yeah, loads of them.</span> <span id="s868">Oh, the film wasn’t any good, a lot of it, you know, and – and so how would we know?</span> <span id="s869">We didn’t know, you put it in the camera and then it came out black, or whatever [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Cause there was no color, it was all black and white, and you know, th – the film.</span> <span id="s872">we’d – we’d borrow the film, you know, we – if we – we’d go into Dachau and talk to these people who we heard maybe had film.</span> <span id="s873">And then we’d say, well, we’ll – we’ll give you maybe – I couldn’t speak German because Alfons could, so he was always the interpreter.</span> <span id="s874">So anyway, he would get [indecipherable] these people who had film, and then we’d give them whatever we had to give them, maybe C-rations, or whatever it was, just for the film, because they wanted to sell it.</span> <span id="s875">They wanted our – our things.</span> <span id="s876">They – they considered our bread as – as cake, and I liked their bread better, because it was dark bread.</span> <span id="s877">But our – all the fellows that I had in the office, they le – really liked our bread.</span> <span id="s878">They thought it was cake at times, cause it was white.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: And theirs is dark.</span> <span id="s881">But I liked the dark bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Well, people do say it’s healthier than – than white bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: People say that dark bread is healthier than white bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Oh, I – that’s what I understand so, yeah.</span> <span id="s886">Oh, I – I used to – I loved that stuff, yeah.</span> <span id="s887">We – we’d gallons of – of peanut butter and grape jelly, and I’d put that peanut butter and grape jelly on this dark bread; that was really good, you know.</span> <span id="s888">But if you didn’t have anything else to eat, I guess that was all right.</span> <span id="s889">But – but we had – we had [indecipherable] rations.</span> <span id="s890">Then after the Americans came in, they opened up the kitchen, and then we had good food that we knew – that was there.</span> <span id="s891">Well, I remember the – the Thanksgiving that we were there, I went over to the – where the other Americans were, where they were eating in the dining room, and it was Thanksgiving day, and somebody – one of the cooks in – American cooks told one of the German assistants to go get the salt.</span> <span id="s892">Anyway, he got the – the soapsud – the soap powder, and put that in the mashed potatoes.</span> <span id="s893">And – and everybo – everybody was standing out in the hall, they gotta get in the toilet [indecipherable] down – down the aisle there, you know, and fortunately I didn’t eat any of the mashed potatoes.</span> <span id="s894">I – I – I was really glad I didn’t after that, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s895">But these guys were standing out there – somebody had gone in their pants, and everything else, you know.</span> <span id="s896">I didn’t – they were eating soap in their mashed potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Aw, it was – but I – I say, you know, it was a rat race.</span> <span id="s901">It was just th – it was n – everything was turmoil, you know, for months, because there was really not that much instruction on what to do.</span> <span id="s902">All we wanted to do was get rid of the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: And they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: You know, get rid of the offi – get rid of the officers, get rid of the people who mistreated all these people for years, and just get rid of them, you know, and that was it.</span> <span id="s905">And I guess we each had our own little places to be, and that’s where we stayed, and we didn’t – we didn’t make it – any noise anywhere, because if you did, you – you’d get into the trouble.</span> <span id="s906">So we – we didn’t really –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: So you felt – you felt that, you know, gi – if I can summarize this in the way I understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Is that – that – when we’re talking about those war crime trials, and what you mean is trials that took place within the camp of Dachau, for the camp of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: That’s correct, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: That’s all it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: – it never went to Nuremberg or anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Oh no, no, no, these – this was just to handle the people that were – that were officers or guards there in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: – the little people, not – no-no-nothing outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: And these German former guards and – and camp managers and so on –</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: – were not talking – were not telling on one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Oh, that’s correct, that wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: In other words, they wouldn’t provide any evidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: No, nad – no information about somebody else.</span> <span id="s923">Maybe one time, maybe that somebody didn’t like the other guy, or something like that, he would say, well, he did this or that, or he – he mistreated somebody, or something like that.</span> <span id="s924">Well, that was only recorded, and that was it.</span> <span id="s925">So it ended up mostly everybody was either hung or shot or whatever anyway, it didn’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Were these executions taking place on a daily basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Oh sure, yeah, after – after the thing got started right, yeah, because there was like – there were dozens of – of guards there, and the commandant and so on.</span> <span id="s928">And – and all these people, they had a lot of officers there, from the SS, and they were all tried there, right there at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Did any of the prisoners though, that they had mistreated, stay around to give testimony, or were they gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No, they – most of them were try to get out of the place.</span> <span id="s931">They didn’t – they – they might have said some things about maybe certain ones that they were – they were mishandled by, but – but they ne – they are – there was – wasn’t much – there were – there really wasn’t much discussion about the prisoners.</span> <span id="s932">They were just glad to get out of that fence, and get out of them barracks.</span> <span id="s933">They would sleep anywhere in the buildings, or wherever they could, you know, summer – was warm at the time, cause we got there in May, and then we got summer, but then in wintertime it got cold, and but bo – most of the people were gone a – after I left – I mean, they were gone before I left, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: I was going to ask you that, I was gonna –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yeah, yeah, most of them – well, the ones that had someplace to go, or the ones that could walk, they would go.</span> <span id="s936">Otherwise, you couldn’t go, they just had to stay there, and we fed them, whatever we could do with them, til they finally did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: But they may have had friends or somebody, maybe they knew somebody, or they – they’d just walk into houses and throw the people out, you know, take over the house, you know, they were – pardon me, prisoners for – of the Germans for a while, and they just wanted to get out of the camp, just get out of there quickly as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: So, in the local town of Dachau, they would – there were former prisoner who would go and –</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Oh yeah, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: – empty out from –</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Oh sure, that’s right, they – you bet they did.</span> <span id="s943">And I – I understand now though, that a lot of of those people who were the – most of them are gone, they wouldn’t – there was no discussion about what happened with any of these people.</span> <span id="s944">But the-they were going to Dachau and they’d steal food, or whatever, they – they’d just knock people down and take whatever they had.</span> <span id="s945">They – yo-you walk into the houses, hey, they were prisoners there, so why – they were glad to get out.</span> <span id="s946">So – so they had no idea what – what was going to be happening to them or anything else.</span> <span id="s947">So they – I – I could understand, if you were in Dachau and you were from Poland, you had a long way to go to get back to where – another country.</span> <span id="s948">And we had people there from 31 different countries.</span> <span id="s949">So, lord, they came from all around, Austria [indecipherable] you know, and who knows where.</span> <span id="s950">There were no Americans there that I know of, none at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: You – you – did you ever have any personal interaction with any of the prisoners, aside from Alfons?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Not really, other than what walked into my office, that’s all, I had – I had no other contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: But I meant –</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: I couldn’t speak German anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: I’m not talking about the German prisoners of the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: I’m talking about the prisoners of the Germans.</span> <span id="s958">That is, when you s – the – the people who had been in Dachau for four or five years as prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did you have any contact with those, with the victims of the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Not really, no, because I couldn’t speak their languages, and I didn’t know what they were saying anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: You know, si – if somebody was Poland, I didn’t know what they were saying.</span> <span id="s964">We had some Polish fellows working there, and they ended up – they – they started to speak some English.</span> <span id="s965">Or Alfons – most of those were – were friends of his, and he – they were all from – from Poland, so they knew how to get along with each other, and then Alfons would translate what they said to me, i-in – in English.</span> <span id="s966">So that was a big help to me, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s967">I w – I wouldn’t – I don’t know how I could have ever operated there without him being there.</span> <span id="s968">I cou – I couldn’t have done it, no how.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: And – and his name, if I want to say it again, is Kanarek, k-a-n-a-r-e-k, something like that?</span> <span id="s970">His last name?</span> <span id="s971">Alfons’?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s973">I – I know it started with a K, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s974">It was Kamyczek(ph).</span> <span id="s975">Alfons Kamyczek(ph), I’ll never forget his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Kamyczek.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: And I never had any contact with him after we left there.</span> <span id="s978">Like I say, he was still there when I left.</span> <span id="s979">So I – I have no idea, I don’t know his address.</span> <span id="s980">I used to hear from – from others – pardon me, Erkar(ph), from Hungary, who was a prisoner of ours who would come in and clean up my – my bedroom, and clean the office, and he would – if any cigarettes were – cigarette butts were around, he’d tear them apart and save the tobacco.</span> <span id="s981">He’d put them in a bag, and – to take back to – to Hungary.</span> <span id="s982">And he did write me, Erkar(ph), he had my address, and how he did it, I don’t know, but he had my address –</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And he wrote to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: – and he used to write he – to me, to send him silk stockings.</span> <span id="s985">Well, that was just when all women’s s-stockings, what were they called?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Well, stockings, sil – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yeah, right, yeah simo – they weren’t silk, wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Nylon.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Nylon.</span> <span id="s990">Nylons were just coming out after the war, and he would write and tell me – he’d send me stamps and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s991">He was a postman in Hungary, where, I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s992">And my wife and I used to get a kick out of it, she’d say, well, here’s a – another letter for – for silk stockings or nylon stockings.</span> <span id="s993">And I’d send him a – we sent them a couple of times, and that was it, then he didn’t write me any more.</span> <span id="s994">So I did all – I don’t know whatever happened to any of these people, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s995">I just left.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Well, tell me – yeah.</span> <span id="s997">Tell me about when you were writing, since you bring that up.</span> <span id="s998">You were writing to your wife and sending her pictures –</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: – of what you saw.</span> <span id="s1001">Did you explain in your letters what it was, where you were, and what kind of a place it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1003">She just knew where I was.</span> <span id="s1004">It was an APO number, so she didn’t really know where I was, she’d only see these pictures, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did she ask you about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: – and I told her – I told her I was in Dachau, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1007">I re – I really didn’t want to upset her, beca – tell her where I was, because she didn’t know if I was a prisoner or not, or what I was, you know, I was just there.</span> <span id="s1008">But yeah, I wrote to her.</span> <span id="s1009">You know, sometimes you get a whole stack of letters at a time.</span> <span id="s1010">It might have been a whole month, you know, that you didn’t get any mail, because everything had to travel by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And so you – you didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Well there – in that photo album – go ahead, have a – have a sip – in that photo album you have quite a few very sad and disturbing, grisly pictures –</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: – of – of bodies.</span> <span id="s1016">Were those the – did you send those home as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Oh yeah, some of them were, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Some of them – so she saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: She saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh yeah, sure, oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So, by – by the time she got them, she must have understood where they were from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Oh yeah, oh, I’m sure she did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1024">I – I told her I was in Dachau, but that really didn’t – you know, Americans didn’t know where these places were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: – you know, and there were – there were hundreds of camps.</span> <span id="s1027">And so that was – that was just another place that I was.</span> <span id="s1028">Like I – I wasn’t supposed to keep a diary, and I kept a diary the whole time I was in the service.</span> <span id="s1029">And again, those things were stolen, and so I had no – no – I would have known every time where I moved, and so on, but I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1030">Oh gee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So you – you kept a diary, and that was stolen from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Oh yeah, they [indecipherable] all three years were stolen that were all – that were all my time in the service.</span> <span id="s1033">I had them all there together, laying on the bed, on my cot, and somebody stole everything I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1035">And that was still when you were in Dachau, or out of Dachau?</span> <span id="s1036">That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, that was in – I was in Bremerhaven then, to get on a boat.</span> <span id="s1038">I was in dur – I was going from Dachau, which is in southern Germany, up to – up to – up to Bremerhaven, which is north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: On the North Sea, and that’s where we got a boat to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: So – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Let’s pause just for a second [break] A2: – they – they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: He was one of the fortunate people that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A2: But he – he was smart, and he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Okay, in that case, let me turn this on again, and tell me about the women who were prisoners of the Germans in the camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: – who let others escape.</span> <span id="s1050">You had mi – where was this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, they were – they all wanted to get out of it, out of the camp as quickly as they could, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Okay, so what about these particular women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Well, they’re – they were really – they were from – from different countries, and so on.</span> <span id="s1054">Like, I only saw about maybe 20 or something like that, who were prisoners of the Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: – of the SS, brought in there from other camps.</span> <span id="s1057">And – but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1058">They – they – they couldn’t do very much, they were – they were the same as everybody else, you know.</span> <span id="s1059">They – they all wanted to get out, and I don’t blame them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1061">Hang on just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yeah, I gotta say they were – they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1064">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah, we’d – I don’t know – I don’t know where these women came from.</span> <span id="s1066">I know they were brought in there from other camps, a-and – and but the – the SS would try to move them, whenever they could, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Well, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I got – I gotta say, it was – it was somewhat turmoil, you know.</span> <span id="s1069">Nobody – nobody knew who did what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Why is it – I mean, I know that in some ways it sounds like it – it should be obvious, but why is it that you wanted to get out of there so badly, out of that – out of that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Why did I want to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Because I was just married, and one – yeah, I mean, I wanted to just get home, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1074">I saw enough, you know, and knowing – I didn’t mind too much the travel, or wherever barracks, and so on, or the buzz bombs and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn’t – that didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1076">After I got to the camp – and I didn’t dr – I didn’t have bad conditions there, I had a real nice bedroom and – and I could get food whenever I wanted it, because Americans were in charge.</span> <span id="s1077">I didn’t – it – it really wasn’t a hardship for me.</span> <span id="s1078">In other words, I knew I had to stay there, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1079">So nobody ever – nobody ever said anything about what I should do, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: You had no commanding officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No.</span> <span id="s1082">And I was a lowly sergeant, yeah, yeah, ye-yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Who was the American who was in charge of the entire Dachau camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Oh, they brought a couple different people in, different times over that year.</span> <span id="s1085">Things were moving so fast.</span> <span id="s1086">The war – the wa – when – when the Americans got to Dachau, and they had been to Munich, they were then moving on to southern Germany.</span> <span id="s1087">In other words, they were trying to get down where Hitler was, down in the – in the Alps mountains.</span> <span id="s1088">There – that’s where they were trying to get him.</span> <span id="s1089">So, after they moved – they left only a certain amount of – maybe it was only a hundred Americans there, for that year that I was there.</span> <span id="s1090">The rest of them were already in battle, they were go-going, trying to get to southern Germany, get the war over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: So they thought – so they thought that Hitler was in southern Germany, but in truth, he was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yeah, but he was – no, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Hitler was in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1094">That’s where he committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yeah, but – but his – they were trying to get there where his house [indecipherable] was down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1097">That’s right, Berchtesgaden was right there, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1099">They didn’t – they were trying to get down there, and – the Americans were, to finish the war off, because they knew that the – Austria was right beyond that.</span> <span id="s1100">We didn’t want to – we didn’t care about Austria, we just wanted to get Germany, and get everybody killed out there we could kill, you know, that was it.</span> <span id="s1101">We wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s1102">Everybody wanted out, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: So tell me – tell me this, I asked this earlier.</span> <span id="s1104">The end of the war was May eighth, I believe, or May ninth, one of those two days, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yeah, ’45, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1107">So you had been in Dachau nine, 10 days by that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did the end of the – do you remember when you – how – where you were when the war ended, when you learned that the war was really over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yeah, but – but it really didn’t di – yeah, wi – I was still there in th – in the office at Dachau, you know, it wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: It didn’t matter to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: No, no, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s1113">It was just over, you know.</span> <span id="s1114">Everybody was happy about it, but we had to get rid of all these people, we had to get into the war crimes trials, a-and all these things were going on there.</span> <span id="s1115">So – and to me, I didn’t really care what was going on, I just wanted out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Tell me, did you ever – ever have R and R?</span> <span id="s1117">That is, an opportunity to go away from Dachau for days at a time to have a bit of vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s1121">I was always there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I remember when I went down there one day for that guy to look at that – that chateau in the mountains, that ski run.</span> <span id="s1124">Sir – he says 300 dollars, and look at all this space.</span> <span id="s1125">Oh my God, I thought, oh jeez.</span> <span id="s1126">The guy can’t possibly alo – believe this is worth 600 dollars, but yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1127">Well, 300 dollars would have been thousands to them, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: And after – right after the war, that’s a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1130">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1131">But see, I – I – I was smart enough to know – I was just – just a kid, but I was smart enough to know, how’m I gonna get my money back?</span> <span id="s1132">I’m not going to sit here and watch this guy.</span> <span id="s1133">I’m married.</span> <span id="s1134">My wife’s back in – in York, Pennsylvania for goodness sake.</span> <span id="s1135">What am I gonna do here, how’m I gonna get my money out of this place?</span> <span id="s1136">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: He hadn't counted on you being that smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Yeah, right, I di – I di – I was smart enough to know I – I’m not gonna get – I could have bought the place, I could have give him my money and so on, I might have owned it, maybe.</span> <span id="s1139">However, I wouldn’t have known what was going on anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s1140">That wa – that was too far-fetched for me, that – that was way over my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Tell me now, when – when you finally did leave Dachau, was that April 1946 or May 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yeah, it was – I got – I got out in April of – of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: And did you go to Italy then, and Switzerland then, cause you mentioned –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1145">Yeah, wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: – those were two other places – what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Well, we – we just took little tours.</span> <span id="s1148">One of my – one of my American friends was supposed to collect food for the prisoners over there, which was a farce.</span> <span id="s1149">And anyway, somehow he finagled a German command car, one of them big, open jobs that th – that the Germans had.</span> <span id="s1150">And we had a – an SS officer and a Wehrmacht soldier.</span> <span id="s1151">And the four of us used to take trips, and we were looking for food.</span> <span id="s1152">So anyway, these two guys there, the – the German SS offer – and the funny thing was that he was from Hanover, Germany.</span> <span id="s1153">His family had owned a – a – a – wheat mills and so on, they were grinders, they grind up for – for food, and so on.</span> <span id="s1154">And I asked him one day how he – he could speak English, and he said – I asked him how he – he got into the service, and the SS.</span> <span id="s1155">And he said, well, Hitler said, like the Boy Scouts were – had to go in this type of service, and – and the Girl Scouts were over here, and – and these groups were over, but a – he put them in important positions, but he ended up in the SS.</span> <span id="s1156">And anyway, we used to take these trips down to the mountain – in the mountains, in the Alps, the four of us.</span> <span id="s1157">The – the werman – German Wehrmacht guy, he would – he would drive, and sometimes I’d sit in the back with this SS officer, who we got out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1158">We were able to take him out wi – you know, get in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So, he wasn’t tried?</span> <span id="s1160">He wasn’t somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Oh no, no, he wasn’t – I don’t know how he got out, but he did.</span> <span id="s1162">The both of them got out.</span> <span id="s1163">Maybe I helped them, I don’t know, but anyway, wa – but we can – we used to take trips any time down the mountains.</span> <span id="s1164">And this one guy, the SS officer, he knew some German general’s wife that lived down there, I forget what the town was, but it was occupied by the French.</span> <span id="s1165">And they brought all these French Moroccans out of Africa, up there to the occupation army.</span> <span id="s1166">And the – and I remember we were standing up there high in the window, we were looking down at these people, and these guys in their robes, and so on.</span> <span id="s1167">And the – the Americans used to bring meat out there, big legs of lamb and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1168">And they have in the truck – there was no – there was no cooling –</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: – and no – and no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: No refrigeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No refrigera – they just brought it in trucks, they throw it on the ground, and no – these guys would pick it up, they’d take it away and they just ate it, and so on.</span> <span id="s1173">But we’d stand up in this wom – this woman’s house, and we’d look down, see this stuff going on.</span> <span id="s1174">But yeah, they – they a – they had hardly finagled that car – I – I still don’t know how they ever got that car, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1175">But my friend Davros(ph) asked me along.</span> <span id="s1176">We went to a – a funny part, we went to a Kraft cheese factory one day, and got cheese.</span> <span id="s1177">Another place this guy knew, whoever, could get eggs.</span> <span id="s1178">Why we did it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1179">I don’t know what we ever did with this stuff anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A2: This is after that happened, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Is this after Dachau, or is this while you’re in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Oh yeah, we tha – while we were in Dachau, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t know where they got the car from, I guess it was from one of the officers had this car there.</span> <span id="s1185">It was a big [indecipherable] job that was really nice.</span> <span id="s1186">Big convertible.</span> <span id="s1187">We’d ride around in that thing, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Well, tell me about something else, cause you alluded to it before.</span> <span id="s1189">It sounds like there was a pretty thriving black market going on after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: If you had – if you had money that you could exchange and get – what did you exchange it for, for stuff, or for local currency, whatever that local currency would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Well [indecipherable] local.</span> <span id="s1193">Well, we used to call – the Americans had their own money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: So, we used to call them cigar coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Cause back in those days, when you go here to – to a cigar store or something like that, they give you coupons there if you bought certain products.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: So we used to call the cigar coupons, the American money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: But it wasn’t our usual dollar currency?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Oh no, no, no, every ca – every country and America had different.</span> <span id="s1202">In France they had French money, American money.</span> <span id="s1203">In Germany they had American money, but it wasn’t real money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: It was just printed stuff that they had.</span> <span id="s1206">Whatever country it was that was occupied, the Americans brought their money in, but it wasn’t real money.</span> <span id="s1207">It wasn’t – wasn’t cur – American currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: It was just printed stuff that they brought.</span> <span id="s1210">That’s why I call – we call them cigar coupons.</span> <span id="s1211">But we could buy stuff with this.</span> <span id="s1212">In other words, we could go to, maybe not a PX, but place where you could buy stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: A commissary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Yeah, right – well, it was – wa – it was – it really wasn’t – that headquarters, they just had it like a little room, with stuff in it, you know, no store or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1215">They may have had cigars, or pipes, or you know, things [indecipherable] guys smoke with or – or whatever.</span> <span id="s1216">They might –</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So was it worth anything, this – this printed money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Oh yeah, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: I mean, worth anything that you could buy that was wor – that was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Oh yeah, you could buy a million things with it.</span> <span id="s1221">The Germans would like to get their hands on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: – because they could u-use the money too.</span> <span id="s1224">Actually, the me – the German money wasn’t worth anything, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: You mean – talking about the old Reichsmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I – like we – when we [indecipherable] that money wasn’t any good to anybody really.</span> <span id="s1227">It was just a souvenir.</span> <span id="s1228">I se – I – I used to send money back, I had some million dollar bills and so on from – from the bank, and I’d send them to my wife home, cause her uncle used to save the stuff from different countries.</span> <span id="s1229">He’d save this money that – you know, if guys would send him, cause he had a restaurant and – and – and they’d – they’d send him money back.</span> <span id="s1230">So I sent him a million dollar bill one day.</span> <span id="s1231">That was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: You mean a million Reichsmark bill, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: No, real ri – yeah, but it wasn’t – it wasn’t anything anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: It was just a souvenir really.</span> <span id="s1236">Just a piece of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, well, it was useless really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Well, about – so the – so you were able to exchange real dollars for this sort of printed American –</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Oh yeah, I could take my money, American money, and I could deposit.</span> <span id="s1241">I could send it back, we had like a post office that we could go to.</span> <span id="s1242">It wasn’t really a post office, but you could take your stuff there.</span> <span id="s1243">And we could exchange that money, we could put it in the book, and then we get that, I could send that home.</span> <span id="s1244">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1245">But like I say, they only – I only got five dollars, my wife got the rest of it.</span> <span id="s1246">I guess [indecipherable] we had 30 dollars a month, a dollar a day we got, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: And so you would keep five for yourself and send 25 home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yeah, well, she was – yeah, she was working, so she worked in my – her uncle’s restaurant, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: And – and going back to other stuff, what kind of activities were some of the soldiers, US soldiers involved in in the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Really nothing, they just – they would gamble money.</span> <span id="s1251">They’d gamble it to get the money, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1252">That’s how they got the money, you know, was mostly gambling.</span> <span id="s1253">Oh, some of them used to go to – to Switzerland and buy cheap watches, and sell them to the Russians for a high price.</span> <span id="s1254">And – and anyway – and they all – the Russian money wasn’t worth anything, I don’t know why they ever –</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Did you meet any Russians when you were in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Did you meet any Russians when you were in Dachau that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I saw some, but I – I saw them, but I wouldn’t have known that I – I met them – we were in a – before we – I got to Dachau, we were in a – ake – a training camp where they – they tested all their guns, and so on.</span> <span id="s1259">And their – the Russians were coming in to take over, and I met some there.</span> <span id="s1260">But nobody liked – even the Americans didn’t like the Russians, even though they were on our side, that we di – we didn’t care for them.</span> <span id="s1261">They were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: In fact, I – my neighbor down the street here, he met some Russians, and he didn’t – they didn’t like them either.</span> <span id="s1264">They – I don’t know, they had their lifestyle, I guess, and us – and we – we couldn’t – we couldn’t get along with them at all.</span> <span id="s1265">But I knew the Germans and the – and the Russians didn’t like each other at all.</span> <span id="s1266">They were – like these two guys I said were draftsmen, they didn’t want to go back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Did you ever get to Berlin, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1269">Never got to [indecipherable] always seven miles away.</span> <span id="s1270">You know, the thing was, I always – when we were at Dachau, there was – I always wanted to get out, you know, and I didn’t take any trips that I could have gone out in – down the mountains, there were these guys, cause I knew the other American was with me.</span> <span id="s1271">But we – I never took any – I could – I couldn’t go on – I went to Munich a couple of times, and I liked the city.</span> <span id="s1272">But that was mostly all gone anyway.</span> <span id="s1273">The buildings were di – just ruined, everything was ruined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Tell me this: you arrive in Dachau in the last day of April in 1945.</span> <span id="s1275">You leave the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: We got in in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Or in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: The first day of May.</span> <span id="s1280">You leave in April 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: The Dachau you arrived in, and the Dachau you left from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Let me see – wait a minute here.</span> <span id="s1284">We got four – yeah, ’40 – wi – May of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Oh, May of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah, 40 – ’46.</span> <span id="s1287">Trying to get my mind here together.</span> <span id="s1288">I got – no, I got out in April.</span> <span id="s1289">That wouldn’t be right.</span> <span id="s1290">I was still there in April, I got May – out in May of ’46, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1292">So that means you were really there over a year, just over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: How had the camp changed in that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s1296">I think it’s after – after the war crimes people got out, a lot of it was torn down, like I said about this man telling me a lot of – a lot of buildings were disposed of.</span> <span id="s1297">They took all the – they took all the barracks down, I understand, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: That’s after you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: When you left, were th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Oh, that was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Everything was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Were all the prisoners still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Oh no, a lot of them left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Was it an empty camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Oh yeah, pretty well, yeah, pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Were there – were there still –</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Only the people didn’t know where to go, they were the only ones that stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: And were there still German prisoners of the Americans there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Well, there were some un – some German prisoners there yet, but not many, they were gone, they knew where to go.</span> <span id="s1312">They – they knew where they lived, and so on.</span> <span id="s1313">But these prisoners, the poor souls, they didn’t know where they were from.</span> <span id="s1314">They knew where they were from, but they – how they were gonna get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: So there still were prisoners from the concentration camp years –</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: – when you left in – in May ’46, who were still in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1319">There were still some there because they didn’t – well, a lot of them didn’t know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Th-They were confused, a lot of them were – well, they has spent a lot of time there maybe, and they – they were too confused, they didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s1322">And they couldn’t walk, a lot of them couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1323">So I think eventually they took these people back.</span> <span id="s1324">They just put them on American trucks and took them wherever they wanted to go, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1325">That’s what I understood, anyway, but I wasn’t there when they did that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1326">They had to get rid of them somehow, you had 30,000 people, that’s a lot of people, let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: And they had to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s1329">So, the Americans didn’t want them there, you know, they just wanted to close the camp up and get out.</span> <span id="s1330">They wanted to get out as quickly as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Did you see any of the physical artifacts of the medical experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yeah, I saw some – some lampshades that the commandant’s wife made out – out of human skin in the – in the house [indecipherable] that stuff was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Was it in the house, or was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Oh, it was in the house, yeah.</span> <span id="s1335">The – the commandant’s house was about in the center of camp, so we Americans took it over.</span> <span id="s1336">I don’t know who was in charge, I have no idea, but I know I was told to come there a couple of times, and I saw this stuff.</span> <span id="s1337">There was still the – the – the furnishings were still there.</span> <span id="s1338">Maybe they were gonna use it for evidence, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1339">I had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: What did – what did a lampshade made out of human skin look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Something similar to this, except it was darker, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1342">She has it stretched out, you know.</span> <span id="s1343">Was more just straight things here, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: But it was like in a regularly furnished room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Oh yeah, sure, like your living room, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1346">I remember some of the furniture and stuff they – they had – all that stuff was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: How come the comma –</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: I guess he must have used it for evidence, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: How come the commandant’s house was in the center of the camp, but most of the SS officers live right outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1351">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: But I know I was there three times, I was there.</span> <span id="s1354">Maybe – I don’t know, maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Was it awful –</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: I think his wife was there, too.</span> <span id="s1357">I think he had some children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Why – was it a place that was off limits to you during the time you were there, that you’d only have three times you’d have been there?</span> <span id="s1359">Or was there just special occasions as to why you went to that commandant’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: No.</span> <span id="s1361">All the Americans are in charge of it see, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: – I was just told to come there one day for a meeting or something like that.</span> <span id="s1364">That’s all it was.</span> <span id="s1365">People gotta do this or that, or somebody’s this – was there.</span> <span id="s1366">You know, there’s a couple of American officers there, and – but I was just one of maybe 10 people that were there, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1367">All Americans were there, only – only Americans were invited.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: But, yeah, we were just still there.</span> <span id="s1370">We were gonna do this or that, or we’re gonna – we’re gonna move here, or we’re gonna open this kind of a building or something like that.</span> <span id="s1371">There was no really big instructions.</span> <span id="s1372">I think it was more of a – a ti-time to drink wine.</span> <span id="s1373">That’s about all, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: So tell me how – who gave you the order that you could actually leave Dachau?</span> <span id="s1375">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: You know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1377">Somebody – there was some there – well, the American officers were there, and some guy came in to – on the office one day and told me that I could leave.</span> <span id="s1378">I was the only American there, of course.</span> <span id="s1379">So, he said, get your things and – and come down to headquarters.</span> <span id="s1380">And then we got on a truck, and went to Munich and got on a train, and went to – to Bremerhaven, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1381">They gave us a ca – a quart of Four Roses whiskey when we got on the train.</span> <span id="s1382">And the train was real cold because it’s – it’s three guys sit here, and three people over here, it’s like – well, you know how they are, the coaches with, I think there’s six people or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Sort of like separate compartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1385">And I drank all my booze, I’m taking all my clothes off, I’m getting hot.</span> <span id="s1386">These here guys are all sitting there freezing.</span> <span id="s1387">Oh God, you know, I – I guess these were – this whiskey warmed me up, because that’s the first I ever had any whi – any booze.</span> <span id="s1388">But you know, I ha – the other people, they used to tell me, in the Pacific, they’d give them beer out there, Americans dis-distribute beer and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1389">I never got any of that stuff.</span> <span id="s1390">We got – when we got on the train, somebody handed me a bottle of whiskey, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1391">That’s the only thing I ever got from anybody.</span> <span id="s1392">We got a – a pack of cigar – I mean, a carton of cigarettes a week, that’s why everybody used to smoke.</span> <span id="s1393">But we got tobacco for a pipe or something like that, once in a while.</span> <span id="s1394">But I never got anything that was given to me, other than that whiskey [indecipherable] on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: So – so tell me this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Let me tell you, by the time I got to mid-Germany, that booze was gone.</span> <span id="s1397">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: So at Bremerhaven, where you on a military ship coming home, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: We were on – we were on a troop ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: On a troop ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: What happened, it was a freighter, really.</span> <span id="s1402">The – the Americans would take German prisoners, and bring them back to the USA to work over here, on farms, in factories and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1403">They were really the fortunate ones, that when that ship came back, they’d bring these prisoners back, the German prisoners back.</span> <span id="s1404">It was all painted, it was really – everything was nice and clean for us.</span> <span id="s1405">So, we came back on ji – on – got on the ship, and, in fact I have a picture in that book, of me standing on the boat.</span> <span id="s1406">And it took about 10 days to get home, I think we hit a storm or something coming back.</span> <span id="s1407">But it was on a troop ship, but it was nice and clean, cause the Germans had painted everything, and it was, you know, it was neat.</span> <span id="s1408">So they were using [indecipherable] in the States.</span> <span id="s1409">But then I heard a lot of stories about prisoners back here that – German prisoners that were pretty well treated some – back here, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1410">They had good – they didn’t have to work on farms and factories and stuff.</span> <span id="s1411">In fact two guys over here the other day, they were telling me about some of the prisoners that were – they knew people here who had taken care of them, you know, and brought them back.</span> <span id="s1412">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: And where did you sail in to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: New York.</span> <span id="s1415">We left from New York on the Queen Elizabeth, that took us five days to get there.</span> <span id="s1416">It was really fast.</span> <span id="s1417">That ship traveled alone, it didn’t go in a convoy like all the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: The Queen Elizabeth was the ship you came back on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: That’s the ship –</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: – we came back on a troop ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Oh a – that’s what I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah, right, a freighter.</span> <span id="s1424">But we went over on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: On the Queen Eliz –</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: – there were 21,000 G.I.s on there, and – and 4,000 crew and 4,000 civilians were on that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: On Queen Elizabeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1429">Going over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Going to – uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Going over.</span> <span id="s1432">I never saw such a big ship in my life before we saw it.</span> <span id="s1433">Well, I never saw a ship before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: But anyway, we got on there, and boy if a – a torpedo had ever hit that thing, they’d a lost a lot of people, let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: But it would zigzag like this, it – it goes like that across the ocean, because every six minutes the ship would change course, because it took seven minutes for a German submarine to get on target.</span> <span id="s1438">And that’s why they – they’d zigzag.</span> <span id="s1439">And the last night out, before we came up the Firth of Clyde, that ship was really bouncing back and forth, because they said they had a – a – a notice that maybe there was a submarine close by, so there was – that was really a bounce around, but it was a nice ride.</span> <span id="s1440">We went over in August, it was beautiful weather.</span> <span id="s1441">And then we – we stayed up on deck most of the time.</span> <span id="s1442">I slept on deck almost every night, because I knew I was down in D deck, so I – I never – I’d never get out of there.</span> <span id="s1443">That was a – that was a full ship, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1444">All them big dining rooms were filled up with del – double decker c-cots.</span> <span id="s1445">Some of them were three and – three high, you had to climb up there to get to them.</span> <span id="s1446">I was fortunate, I had a nice cot down in – somebody was above me, I think, in – in one the state rooms.</span> <span id="s1447">A nice ship, a big ship, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1448">A big boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: And when you got into New York harbor, having come back, did your wife meet you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Oh no, oh no, no.</span> <span id="s1451">I had to go down to New Jersey to a – a de-depot there, an army camp, where some guy was – he’d – he was gonna sign us out.</span> <span id="s1452">And he had only been the – in the service about two months, I think it was, and he said, don’t you want to join the – the National Guard or – or the reserves?</span> <span id="s1453">I said hell no, if you want to join, you go ahead and join.</span> <span id="s1454">Let me tell you right now, I’ve had all the army I want.</span> <span id="s1455">Yeah, he – he – he wanted me to sign up, I said no way.</span> <span id="s1456">I’m not signing up for nothing, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1457">Nope.</span> <span id="s1458">I ca – I came back on – then we got a train out of somewhere in New Jersey – no, I got a bus to Philadelphia, and then we got a train from Philadelphia to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1459">And – and the – the car, th-the car had a potbellied stove right in the middle, that’s how he heated the car.</span> <span id="s1460">Oh jeez.</span> <span id="s1461">Really antiquated.</span> <span id="s1462">Oh God, I can’t believe that something like that happened.</span> <span id="s1463">But that’s the way it was, you know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: And so your wife met you in Lancaster?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: No.</span> <span id="s1468">We had [indecipherable] on the third floor apartment, and I got a – a taxi to go home.</span> <span id="s1469">Nobody there [indecipherable] me, no, nobody.</span> <span id="s1470">Hell, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1471">I came home alone, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Was she surprised to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Sure was.</span> <span id="s1474">She sure was surprised.</span> <span id="s1475">I told her I was going to come home sometime, you know.</span> <span id="s1476">Hell, we didn’t have a telephone, and I – nobody had telephones, nobody – I didn’t buy a c – I gotta borrow a car.</span> <span id="s1477">Some guy was there with me.</span> <span id="s1478">He worked in a ga – in a Chrysler garage in York, so he told me to buy a ca – a used car, cause cars weren’t made during the war, and they – they only had the cars before the war, and they started making them after the war, but wa – there was – there was all used cars.</span> <span id="s1479">And I had a big Chrysler, some beer magnate from York, he owned the car, and he traded in for something else.</span> <span id="s1480">And I could actually lay out in the trunk of the car, was a one-seater.</span> <span id="s1481">I could lay out this way, not sideways, I could la –</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: But lengthwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: – that’s how – how big the trunk was, I could stretch out like that, that’s how big.</span> <span id="s1484">Beth(ph) said, what in the world do you want with this kind of big car?</span> <span id="s1485">I said, it’s just a car, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1486">Just something to drive around, you didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1487">We sold our – we had a new Nash that we bought right before – about two – when I w – I worked in Baltimore and – and we had this Nash, and we sold it a couple hours before, cause she couldn’t drive, so we sold it a couple of hours right before I went in the service.</span> <span id="s1488">S-So, we had that money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: So tell me about your post-war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Tell me a little bit about the post-war years.</span> <span id="s1492">Where did you start working when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: When I came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1496">I went back to my old buddy.</span> <span id="s1497">We built a house here in Hanover, and I went back with my old architect friend here downtown, who I had known before that – before I got in.</span> <span id="s1498">And I went with him for a couple of years, I guess it was.</span> <span id="s1499">Then I got my license in 1950, and I – I was registered in five states: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Are – license for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: As an architect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: As an architect, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: And I have a license as a structural engineer just in – in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1504">I dropped that years ago, I didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s1505">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: And so, did you go out on your own then, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Oh yeah, I always had my own office, always.</span> <span id="s1508">I did work for other people, then I did work for a Baltimore firm when they were doing the Baltimore City Hall.</span> <span id="s1509">Things like that, that sort of nice projects, yeah.</span> <span id="s1510">And then I started getting into – into – into medical buildings, hospitals, [indecipherable] homes, retirement homes, that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: So mostly it was commercial buildings rather than residential?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Oh yeah, right, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1513">Well, things were busy then, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Everybody was doing something, you know, and they were building all kinds of thing – I – I designed every fa – house in this town, and a lot of the buildings and so on.</span> <span id="s1516">But in the last 20 years, my work has been from Lancaster east, in the New York or New Jersey and Delaware, and that sort of thing, I – I didn’t do – I didn’t do anything in Hanover for 20 years, at least, you know.</span> <span id="s1517">But I came back here, I still had my contacts elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1518">So I was still working – I worked up until a couple months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1520">Until a couple of months ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Oh yeah, right, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: And you’re 93 now, or 94?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Ninety-three.</span> <span id="s1524">Don’t – don’t push it too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Okay, okay, okay, I won’t put more on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yeah, yeah, but no, I had – I did work for this Amish contractor in Lancaster County, who we did work in new y – we built – all we built was foreign buildings; big riding arenas, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1527">He didn’t want to build houses, always just – and I was quite busy with – just with him, doing these farm buildings, because everybody used to have a – had had a bar – a – a horse farm or something like that, a riding arena.</span> <span id="s1528">I did for a psychiatrist over in New Jersey, I did all her farm buildings, and then she had a big riding arena, and she never – in the wintertime – but she never had to take the horse outside.</span> <span id="s1529">In other words, they could go from the stalls – from the horse barn into maybe the – the – where they wash them down and so on, into the riding arena, and in fact I – we had a candy box in there for years, that she sent me with – with good candy in it.</span> <span id="s1530">Yeah, we had a good ti – I liked her, she was a nice lady.</span> <span id="s1531">Never saw her.</span> <span id="s1532">Never sa – I never saw most of my clients, this Amish contractor handled everything.</span> <span id="s1533">He’d just tell me what he wanted, and then I’d make the drawings, and send it to him, and he – he’d building the building, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1534">So I – it was a nice arrangement where I tried – I wi – like I said, I was still working.</span> <span id="s1535">In fact, she was in Montana, and I had a project here, some girls were here [indecipherable] and yeah, it – I didn’t do the drafting, I had somebody else do the drafting.</span> <span id="s1536">I’m one of them guys, I just [indecipherable] and check it out.</span> <span id="s1537">Put my name on it, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1538">Make some money on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1541">I ba – yeah, people say, why you still working, you’re 92 years old.</span> <span id="s1542">I said, well, what difference it makes?</span> <span id="s1543">That doesn’t matter how, I gotta kick out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Yeah, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1546">I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Did you ever go back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: No, I’d like to have gone back, you know.</span> <span id="s1551">I would a – I would have re – yeah, I talked to people, you know, with, like this guy here some weeks ago or days ago, had been back to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1552">[indecipherable] he went in the 50s, I think, and 60s, and just he’s – he gave me a list of what – what years he was there, and one of them was just this past summer, and I was surprised.</span> <span id="s1553">And – but he said it – they’re – they’re all changed, they tear a lot of buildings down.</span> <span id="s1554">It’s not like it was at all, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Did you ever talk to your wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: It was bare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: – when you got home, did you ever talk to your wife about that year in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: In fact, a friend here ca – came in to see me, who I’ve known for 50 years, and he said, you never said you were in – in Dachau, til he read in the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: And that paper – that newspaper article was this year, right?</span> <span id="s1562">In June 2013?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Yeah, yeah, just recently, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: How did they find out that you were in Dachau?</span> <span id="s1565">How did the newspaper people find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Yeah, right, yeah, I saw – I saw – and they called me, and he said, let’s get together.</span> <span id="s1567">And one day he called me from some mall out here.</span> <span id="s1568">He said, how do I get to your house?</span> <span id="s1569">And I went out to the garage to do something, and lord here he was.</span> <span id="s1570">Yeah, I hadn't seen him for years, but I knew him for 50 years or so.</span> <span id="s1571">1954, I met him, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: So, how did the newspaper people know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1574">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: This girl called me one day, and she said, I think you would have a story for us.</span> <span id="s1577">And I’m all, what do you – what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1578">And she said, well somebody told me that you had been in Dachau or Germany.</span> <span id="s1579">And I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1580">So, just a young girl, I don’t think she was more than 22 years old, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1581">She came here with a photographer, and – you weren’t here then, I guess.</span> <span id="s1582">No, you were still out in Montana.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A2: I was in Montana.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A2: I had just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s1587">And she came out here one day and we sat here and talked for a while at the kitchen table, and she looked in the pa – and the photographer was standing there, he had his camera standing right there at the table, and I had no idea that he was taking pictures, and he was taking pictures of the – the – the book, and other pictures that I had there.</span> <span id="s1588">And lo and behold, one Sunday – somebody called me one morning, one Sunday morning, and he said, I’d like you to talk to some veterans about your experiences in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1589">I’m, what are you talking about, you know?</span> <span id="s1590">Here the newspapers was laying out there on the driveway, and I hadn't seen it yet, and so I didn’t know what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s1591">And I said oh, I don’t – I don’t make speeches.</span> <span id="s1592">Then some woman called me one day to talk to – to a – a blue-head group.</span> <span id="s1593">That’s what my brother used to call them, it’s like a – blue-heads.</span> <span id="s1594">These women used to have their hair dyed blue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A2: It’s gray.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yeah, right, yeah, well, it was blue.</span> <span id="s1597">In fact, we talked about it the other day, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A2: It’s some kind of rinse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1601">Yeah, right, it was a rinse they put over, sort of blue.</span> <span id="s1602">Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1603">And my brother used – when he worked for Armstrong, he used to look out the office window, look down there at the Brunswick hotel, right downtown Lancaster, he called them blue-heads.</span> <span id="s1604">He said, the blue-heads are out today, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A2: We – that article was very well written.</span> <span id="s1606">And we called her a couple of times to try to maybe – maybe she would want to coordinate something with you and come here, and she never called back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1609">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Well, I’m very glad that that young lady at the newspaper place did call you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah, I’m ri – I don’t know how she knew, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1612">I don’t know where she got her information from.</span> <span id="s1613">I wanted to tell her what a good job she did, and in fact I wanted to tell her that you folks were going to come and see me, and – but she never called back.</span> <span id="s1614">It’s owned by another outfit, another newspaper in York, so maybe she works there as well, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Could be, but this was the local Hanover newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Oh yeah, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: What’s it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: “The Evening Sun.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: “The Evening Sun.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yeah, you’ll see it over that – that copy I have there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Was there something I haven’t asked you about that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Not really, no, uh-huh, no.</span> <span id="s1625">After the war, it didn’t – wasn’t no longer part of it, I just wanted to get out of there, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1626">I thought – to me it was a hellhole, you know.</span> <span id="s1627">It was – it smelled so badly, the – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Did the smell linger, even after it was cleaned up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Oh, not too long, you – after tha – after that ra – you see, hell, people would – they’d be out there walking around, and hell, they’d just drop over dead, you know.</span> <span id="s1630">They were half dead to st-start with, and you had to pick them up.</span> <span id="s1631">Or there were these – these barracks, you have pictures of those – those beds that were woo – made of wood.</span> <span id="s1632">There was no pads or nothing on them, you know, and if they were – if they were there, and they didn’t move, they were considered dead.</span> <span id="s1633">Cause we didn’t have anybody that could know.</span> <span id="s1634">We didn’t have any instruments, or anything to do.</span> <span id="s1635">You just picked them up and threw them out.</span> <span id="s1636">Put them in the big – like a – what do they use, a – a tractor like thing to pull a – a trailer they’d put them on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: We saw pictures of them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1640">Well, I appreciate it, Mr. Coulson, that you’ve taken the time to go into such detail with me today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Well, I’m glad, you know – you know, I – it’s – I felt all along – my doctor used – in fact, I gave him the – those pictures, and he had them in his safe for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: And I thought well, nobody wanted them.</span> <span id="s1644">And then my niece comes along and say – well she – she’s a schoolteacher, and she’s been to – to dak – I mean, to the museum a couple of times, and she said, oh, Uncle Norm, I’d like to have those photographs if you can.</span> <span id="s1645">And I said well, I don’t know what I’m gonna do with them, but the doctor already had them.</span> <span id="s1646">So I got them back from him, you know, some months ago – weeks ago, really, and put them all – made sure they’re all back in that book.</span> <span id="s1647">I have a lot of other, but they’re just of me in the service, not Dachau.</span> <span id="s1648">And – but I’m glad that my wife saved that, and put them in that book, because otherwise I’d a – wouldn’t have had anything.</span> <span id="s1649">And we – it – I been carrying them around for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Well, we really appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Never even looked at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: We very much appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yeah, but it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Very much appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: But then I thought like, well Barb(ph) said today, they really should be in a museum or something like that, an-and – and then [indecipherable] the newspaper article came out, and that’s how your –</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: The photography director called you.</span> <span id="s1657">Ginny(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yeah, right, yeah, well she – some – somehow she learned about it, I think somebody must have sent her some information about it, and then that’s how – and then of course she wrote me, and – and I – and we thought well, let’s gi – get them to somebody, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A2: I thought it was so much more valuable coming from a soldier.</span> <span id="s1661">He’s not Jewish, and he was there, you know, so it’s not like you can say, oh, they made it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A2: You know?</span> <span id="s1664">It really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1666">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: It really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A2: And so many people like to think it never happened, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: One of the neighbors here the other day, I – in fact, another veteran, who’s in the 80s, he used to be – live in [indecipherable] he lives in Maryland now, and he came in, and wa – he took that article in the newspaper and framed it, it’s hanging in here on the wall.</span> <span id="s1670">He did a nice job on it, he really did.</span> <span id="s1671">And – and he was such a poor soul, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1672">And his son was in Vietnam, and he came in – and how he got a license I’ll never know – he came in, he didn’t – he was here for a half hour, he didn’t say one word, he sat there with us.</span> <span id="s1673">How he could drive I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1674">And he brought this man back the other day, and he had pictures, mostly of damaged buildings in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A2: He had a picture of the bunker where Hitler and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: You know, and he said, well, they should be in a museum, but – but everybody has damaged buildings from Berlin, you know, it – it’s not really a – a story to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A2: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: You know, it’s not like this death camp.</span> <span id="s1680">Dachau is an entirely different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1682">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: So, that’s wa – that’s the story kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Yo-You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Thank you for sharing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Good seeing you, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q:
