No, there were rabbis all along the line almost, going even six and seven generations back there were rabbis in the family.</span> <span id="s19">So, my father finished his studies in Germany at the time when there were no vacancies in the rabbinate in Denmark.</span> <span id="s20">Therefore, he was not employed by the Jewish community until very late.</span> <span id="s21">But since German became the second language, he found some vacancies in the German rabbinate but obviously in 1933 when Hitler came to power, we returned to Denmark.</span> <span id="s22">We were then Danish citizens and Danish was our mother tongue.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">My father worked in different fields among others in lecturing around the country and telling the Danes a little bit about what the Nazi regime actually meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q. Let me just go back a minute and ask you about the formation of the Copenhagen Jewish community and the establishment of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A. Well, the Jewish community of Copenhagen was officially established in 1684 when the first permission to hold religious services was given by the king of the time.</span> <span id="s26">But it took some years to say the least before we were allowed to build a synagogue.</span> <span id="s27">The present synagogue which is one of the oldest, at least in this area, was built in 1833, to me a magnificent building, a place which has survived many attacks and also the Nazi period.</span> <span id="s28">A place where King Christian the Tenth as the first sovereign attended a service in 1933 at the 100th anniversary and since then his son Frederick the Ninth and his granddaughter Queen Margaretta our present Queen have visited the synagogue on quite a few occasions, the last of them was commemoration of the rescue operation fifty years after it took place, in 1993.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">So, we have seen in that synagogue also the President of the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s30">We have seen David BenGurion and Golda Meir and many other leaders of Israel and of the Jewish people around the world.</span> <span id="s31">We have been laughing and crying together in that building which also in 1985 was attacked by an Arab extremist with a bomb which destroyed the whole entrance part which we could repair but happily enough they did not really damage the important parts of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q.</span> <span id="s33">In the 19th century was the Danish community, the Jewish community in Copenhagen a large one, a well to do one, was it very mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A.</span> <span id="s35">The Danish Jewish community has never been big in numbers.</span> <span id="s36">It's always been a comparatively small community, but very well organized and since 1814, fully recognized as equal to the official religious community of Denmark which is the Lutheran Church, together with catholics and Baptists and other Christian groups, the Jewish community has equal rights in all the 01:07:00 respects, all the rights of religious communities such as rights as conducting weddings with official validity and we also until this day keep the official register of birth and death on behalf of the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">We have since 1814 produced quite a good number of people who have participated in public life in this country, have contributed to science, to art, to industry, to trade and to political life in a degree far beyond the number we are until today we have perhaps eight or nine thousand Jews in Denmark and it has never been much more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q. To go then to the matters of the occupation by the Germans in 1940, how did that occupation affect the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A. Well, to begin with, we shared the history of all other Danes.</span> <span id="s40">Obviously we were more shocked, perhaps more afraid than the rest of the population because we didn't know what would be the outcome but since the Danish government worked out some kind of a coexistence with the occupation in power, one of the conditions of that coexistence was that no measures should be taken against the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q. Where did that stand derive from?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A.</span> <span id="s43">It was obvious that if the Germans wanted somehow a quiet area in Denmark, this was a precondition.</span> <span id="s44">In Denmark it was unthinkable that people should be persecuted because of their religious beliefs or even if they don't have any religious beliefs then of the fact that they were born of Jewish parents.</span> <span id="s45">This could not happen in Denmark and no Danish government could survive to accept and to be passive to such a decision.</span> <span id="s46">The story goes that it was the king, Christian the Tenth who personally interviewed and as a famous legend that the king when he went out to town as he did every morning on his horse without any guards or any military or anything like that, he just was on his horse going through the city of Copenhagen and the story says that he was wearing the yellow star which the Germans used as the sign of disgrace to the Jews.</span> <span id="s47">Well the truth is that he was never wearing that star because if he had taken it on his uniform he would have been the only one to wear it but he might have threatened to do so and by this it prevented any degradation was ever made to that end.</span> <span id="s48">So, we lived as Danish citizens with the problems of an occupation power, of the problems of having Germans enemies of democracy, enemies of all decency to have the real power in this country, but we were not suffering more than any other Dane had to suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q.</span> <span id="s50">Did members of the Jewish community participate in discussions concerning the understanding with the Germans about the Jews in 1940 or in preparation for the -- I know the occupation was a surprise, but there must have been some preparation?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A.</span> <span id="s52">The Jewish community of 1940 was a community I would say like the Jewish world almost in the 1930s.</span> <span id="s53">Subdued, although until the occupation quite secure never the less low profile.</span> <span id="s54">Don't let them hear that you are here.</span> <span id="s55">Be quiet.</span> <span id="s56">My father was by the official Jewish community several times told off that he was speaking in strong terms against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s57">Again it was an attempt that nobody should look at you.</span> <span id="s58">They might get the wrong idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">So, during the years of occupation, this tendency became even stronger.</span> <span id="s60">We stopped the magazine of the Jewish community that nobody should say that we could vote the Germans to start anything with the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s61">We were, of course, in contact with the official authorities, the government, to get information but we just were the receivers of that information we were not creating the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">That was quite typical of the times I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q.</span> <span id="s64">There are those who refer to the occupation as a benign occupation or even as a time of passive collaboration with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A. I would say that it was a problem especially if we compare to what happened in Norway where the Norwegians stood up against the Germans and fought them militarily.</span> <span id="s66">At the same time I would say no collaboration and if we continue the comparison to Norway, the end to Norway was that they got a Quisling government which means a government that was collaborating with Germans whereas in Denmark we kept the democratic government which was certainly hostile to the Germans.</span> <span id="s67">Things were hostile to the Germans we have had borders with Germany all through history and we have fought many wars with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">So, to begin with there was no chance of any love affair.</span> <span id="s69">There was no question that we tried to show our national feelings, the birthdays of the king became demonstrations with hundreds of thousands of people in the streets.</span> <span id="s70">We were wearing small signs in our clothes even going with the Royal Airforce signs around.</span> <span id="s71">There was no question where we were but we were passive for a long time, and Danes did not like the sound of a bomb exploding.</span> <span id="s72">So, when the underground movement started to become active, and bombing factories that were producing something called the Germans railway lines or similar then there were different opinions about that in the population.</span> <span id="s73">It took a very special action from the underground, which was a typical Danish action because it was carried out at 12:00 noon and nobody got hurt and there was even involved the box for beer in that operation and it exploded in a big place which the Germans had just taken over.</span> <span id="s74">That created suddenly an interest of a very positive nature, but that came at a time when the Danish government actually had resigned because the Germans demanded a stronger action against the Freedom Fighters, a type of action which again no Danish government could accept and therefore they resigned.</span> <span id="s75">There was never formed any other government.</span> <span id="s76">A Nazi government like the Quisling government in Norway could never take office in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q.</span> <span id="s78">During the late 30s there was a great number of Jewish refugees from other countries that tried to enter Denmark and not all of them were accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A.</span> <span id="s80">That is to put it mildly.</span> <span id="s81">Well, the whole western world did not respond to the tremendous need of giving to refugees at the time.</span> <span id="s82">Again, Denmark is a neighbor to Germany and therefore obviously there were people who tried to get over the border and Denmark did not give refuge to more people than other countries.</span> <span id="s83">Our biggest effort was, in fact, to allow young people to come to Denmark from Germany, young Jews, and to train them as farmers in Denmark and after a year or at the most two years they could continue to then Palestine and work then in the kibbutz in Palestine in a very positive way.</span> <span id="s84">That worked very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Also, the so called youth aliyah or Jugend Aliyah, had many hundreds of youngsters coming to Denmark but most of them intransient and quite few were allowed to stay permanently.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q. Was this a source of tension or controversy within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A.</span> <span id="s88">The Jewish community tried to convince the government to open up at least a little bit more and from time to time we succeeded but in most cases we have to admit that the government was afraid of creating a problem in Denmark.</span> <span id="s89">They were afraid because all other countries were hesitant.</span> <span id="s90">So, had one country suddenly opened up they could have had so many that they couldn't handle the whole thing.</span> <span id="s91">The conferences that were held at the time, international conferences, never gave a positive result.</span> <span id="s92">So, this is a dark chapter in our history as it is for the whole western world.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q. Can you give me the chronology of the rescue.</span> <span id="s94">When did it become clear that the Jewish community was imperiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A. Well, on August 29, the Danish government resigned and curfew was declared by the Germans and a number of strong measureas, a prohibition to assemble in the streets and many kinds of demonstrations and many other specific measures were taken with the German tanks were going through the streets of Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">At the time that the governments resigned the Jewish community was fully aware that the protection they had until that point was gone.</span> <span id="s97">Then rumors started and every day you had rumors in the morning and other rumors in the evening and I remember my father was very strong in his reaction to those rumors, being afraid that the various reactions would create panic.</span> <span id="s98">At the day of the 29th of August, leaders of the Danish society were arrested and among those leaders were also the then chief rabbi Dr. Freidiger, the president of the Jewish community and other Jews that held leading positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q.</span> <span id="s100">Why were these leaders arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A. Well, that was the way the Germans wanted to prevent any possible creation of a movement that was directed against them.</span> <span id="s102">They thought by taking all these personalities those that could be thought of as leaders of such movements, they were taken away from public life.</span> <span id="s103">Among them also a great number of officers of the Danish army and they were held in custody and didn't suffer very much, but they were taken out of society.</span> <span id="s104">The Germans didn't realize that others could take the places of those that they held.</span> <span id="s105">But, that was the purpose of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q.</span> <span id="s107">They were put in prison in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A. Yes, in a camp here in Denmark but under comparatively good circumstances and nobody thought really that it should last for very long.</span> <span id="s109">But, still we realize that the Jewish community was not treated differently from the rest of the population because if they had not taken the leaders of the Jewish community we would have said well, why didn't you take all the others and not our leaders, so we would almost have been insulted.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">But, that was the situation during the month of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q.</span> <span id="s112">What was your father's position at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A. Well, my father was a rabbi and had been a strong spokesman against the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s114">He was not officially employed as a rabbi.</span> <span id="s115">He had some teaching functions at the time and some lecturing functions but not actually serving in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Nevertheless he certainly was the one to whom people would look for advice in such a situation.</span> <span id="s117">That was probably then the reason that when the news really came to us about the plans of deporting the Jews of Denmark to the camps in eastern Europe, that there was sent two messengers.</span> <span id="s118">Well, let me first tell you that one member of the German staff, a naval attache at the German embassy in Copenhagen, he decided to reveal the plans.</span> <span id="s119">A certain Georg Duckwitz(?)</span> <span id="s120">and he had close relations to some leaders of the Danish Social Democrat party and went to them and told them.</span> <span id="s121">It was on a Tuesday and the message was that the coming Friday night the Germans would go out and arrest the Jews of Denmark, put them on two boats that were already on the way to Copenhagen harbor and bring them to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Now, the social democrats went to the president of the Jewish community who had been released by that time and told him he would believe it and at the same time they sent the secretary to our home, to my father and gave him the news and at that point my father convinced that it was true and again it was a problem how to react without panic.</span> <span id="s123">The message was the Jews shall not stay at home on Friday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Whether it will be possible later to return, we don't know.</span> <span id="s125">The Germans here in Denmark are in fact against this decision, but it is an order from Berlin and we can do nothing about it and it has to be done and the Gestapo will be here to arrest the Jews.</span> <span id="s126">So, for God's sake, don't stay at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Now the question was how do you spread the news.</span> <span id="s128">Although you had three days to begin with the news came at a time when the curfew operated a few minutes later and you couldn't go out into the streets.</span> <span id="s129">You couldn't very well use the phone.</span> <span id="s130">So, the first chance to spread the news was on the Wednesday morning.</span> <span id="s131">Now, that Wednesday was the eve of Rosh Hashanna, the Jewish New Year and there is a very early service in synagogues and orthodox synagogues where you say special prayers and where there are a little bit more people than on a usual normal week day.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">So, my father stopped those services in the synagogue of Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q.</span> <span id="s134">In the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A.</span> <span id="s136">In the middle of the service and went to the Bimah and told the people what he had been told the night before.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q. Were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A. No, I was not there.</span> <span id="s139">I was still supposed to be not part of it.</span> <span id="s140">But he told them that the problem was to spread the news.</span> <span id="s141">Everybody would have to think of people especially the lonely(?)</span> <span id="s142">people but every person he could think of should have the message and better that the person should have the message from five or eight different sources than no source.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">So, there would be no services in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s144">This of course alone would make it clear to everybody who would come to the services that there was something wrong.</span> <span id="s145">And so we started finding out, I was running to people who lived not too far away and knock on their doors and telling them what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">We were all sent around town.</span> <span id="s147">We also tried to phone some people telling them that we didn't have any summer vacation that year so we would go to the country and people knew that if the rabbi goes into the country on Rosh Hashanah it is like Father Christmas leaving before December and that was some of the ways we used to get the message around.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Then really everybody had to find his own solution.</span> <span id="s149">There was absolutely nothing prepared whatsoever.</span> <span id="s150">Looking back one wonders whether that was good or bad for the Jews.</span> <span id="s151">If we had prepared things would it have been found out and stopped.</span> <span id="s152">Now everything was an improvisation.</span> <span id="s153">You did what you did.</span> <span id="s154">Your friends reacted as they reacted.</span> <span id="s155">Your next door neighbor, your shoemaker or your green grocer who whoever with whom you were in contact and the wonderful thing was that it didn't really matter who you chose at that point to be your helper.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q.</span> <span id="s157">Did you chose your helper or did the helper chose you?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s160">02:01:00 Q.</span> <span id="s161">Did you seek out help from others or did others seek to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A. Well, the others did not yet know about what was going to happen and my father had been a frequent guest at the various Danish folk high schools since we were a family at that point six people, my eldest brother went on his own and actually went very soon to Sweden but still we were six persons and we just couldn't go to the next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s163">So, my father thought such a school would be a good place to go they would have room enough for a big number of people.</span> <span id="s164">So, he phoned actually a place and the headmaster of the school immediately understood what it was all about but he had to answer that there were so many frogs in the area and thereby pointing to the green color of the soldiers which in this connection were German soldiers, so the Germans had taken his school and that would not be exactly the best place to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">So we took a chance.</span> <span id="s166">Another former headmaster of such a school had become priest at a small village about 100 kilometers away from Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s167">So, we went by train on the Wednesday and from the station of that little village my father phoned the priest who again immediately understood what it was about and the priest insisted that all of us stay in his house although my father's idea was that he could put one here and one there.</span> <span id="s168">He knew people of his parish and he would know -- but no we should stay there and this was some of the old fashioned parish priest's houses where there was room and even a big garden.</span> <span id="s169">I remember the apple trees of that garden.</span> <span id="s170">They were just giving the most wonderful apples out at that season.</span> <span id="s171">I was then a boy of 14 and perhaps I didn't fully appreciate what was happening apart from the fact that we had to sneak away from our home with almost nothing in our hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q.</span> <span id="s173">Did people call your father and say what should we do, how do we do it, or was it each man for himself?</span> <span id="s174">Is that really the way it worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A.</span> <span id="s176">It was more or less each man according to his connections to the right to the left, some used to go in the summer period to some place in the country so they would try to contact that 01:04:00 place.</span> <span id="s177">Others actually just went into the next door neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q.</span> <span id="s179">So it wasn't Jew going to Jew, a Jewish family going to another Jewish family and saying we're in the same situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q.</span> <span id="s182">It was Jews turning to Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A. Exactly, all the way through.</span> <span id="s184">I would say, all according to their situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q. And you had that confidence that the Gentile population would help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A. I don't think that anybody realized that there was a danger.</span> <span id="s187">I don't think that they had time to reflect too much, but to say where could we go, who do we know.</span> <span id="s188">Of course if you had closer relations you would choose such relations but many people came and asked for help from strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q.</span> <span id="s190">How?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A.</span> <span id="s192">We also left our own apartment.</span> <span id="s193">We told the host of the house, we paid some rent in advance and said look after our place while we are away.</span> <span id="s194">We told the milkman not to put any milk there and you know, very soon there was no question.</span> <span id="s195">Of course, little by little the rumor went around in town so that the non-Jews also learned about it and you could see places where teachers and schools would tell Jewish pupils to go home to their parents.</span> <span id="s196">The teachers would perhaps put their personal things to the disposal of such a family or at working places.</span> <span id="s197">So, you perhaps had colleagues at work that would help you.</span> <span id="s198">Or you went to your doctor and doctors and nurses were very active in those days in hospitals in Copenhagen took in patients under other names just to hide people.</span> <span id="s199">All kinds of good ideas were taken into use and as I said it was improvised, all of it.</span> <span id="s200">That perhaps was the strength of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q. Were there people who came to synagogue for the holiday not knowing --?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A.</span> <span id="s203">That we never found out.</span> <span id="s204">I never heard anybody saying to me that they went there so I doubt it.</span> <span id="s205">I think that already during the first day the news had come around.</span> <span id="s206">There were Jews still at the time I think for history it should be mentioned, who said it is not true.</span> <span id="s207">This cannot happen here.</span> <span id="s208">We are under the protection of the king.</span> <span id="s209">The poor king who at the time was very ill had fallen from his horse probably after some provocation and had not many chances to protect anybody.</span> <span id="s210">But I know of families, parents and children who sat home on that fatal Friday night and more or less waited for the Gestapo because they didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q.</span> <span id="s212">What was the German reaction?</span> <span id="s213">This obviously is in retrospect when on Rosh Hashanah there was no Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">They must have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A.</span> <span id="s216">They were absolutely surprised.</span> <span id="s217">No question about it.</span> <span id="s218">They would not admit it and one of the leaders of the German occupation forces here sent a telegram to Berlin.</span> <span id="s219">It doesn't matter that we didn't get so many of them, the main thing is that Denmark is Judenrein.</span> <span id="s220">That was their attempt to cover up the failure which it obviously was.</span> <span id="s221">They had tried still to find out some of the routes that were established because that of course was our next step.</span> <span id="s222">We couldn't stay in these places for very long.</span> <span id="s223">Although we could trust the population, there still could be the odd one out and there was the odd one out that would be informer to the Germans and therefore we had to think of what is now going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">The dream we still had when we closed the door that we might within a few weeks when things calm down, that we might return.</span> <span id="s225">That we realized we dreamed.</span> <span id="s226">So, already actually before the raids had started, certain routes to Sweden existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q. Were these prepared by resistance people?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A. Yes, and they were already prepared before the whole situation around the Jewish population, but they were few and long in between but we had a their line to the free world via Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">This would then be the natural thing and actually the same Duckwitz(?)</span> <span id="s230">who gave us the information, had gone to Stockholm and had with the Swedish government discussed the situation.</span> <span id="s231">When it became clear on the Saturday morning when it was published that the Germans had arrested as they said the Jewish population, or rather that they had removed the Jews from Danish society, so now they could release the officers of the Danish army.</span> <span id="s232">Then the Swedish government issued a statement that they were prepared to take over the Jews of Denmark.</span> <span id="s233">The Germans did not accept that proposal but thereby we could say that every Jew knew that could he reach Sweden, he would be safe there.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">That was of course of great importance.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q.</span> <span id="s236">How did that news come to the Jewish community, which is no longer a community?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A.</span> <span id="s238">It was no longer a community, although the community in a funny way continued to exist.</span> <span id="s239">There were people of the community leadership that made some important decisions in the financial field, how to dispose of the Jewish property here and other things.</span> <span id="s240">But we listened to radio.</span> <span id="s241">We didn't have to concentrate only on Danish radio obviously.</span> <span id="s242">It was not on the Danish radio, but Swedish radio and also the BBC programs.</span> <span id="s243">So, that was known to us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">02:13:00 Q.</span> <span id="s245">In terms of your own specific experience, your father knew a priest, somebody who had been in school, was a priest.</span> <span id="s246">You went to that small town.</span> <span id="s247">Your father called.</span> <span id="s248">He welcomed you.</span> <span id="s249">Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A. Well this priest had a son who started law at the Copenhagen University and as the father so the son -- the son was very active in the student organization to help Jews and to find out how to organize routes to Sweden.</span> <span id="s251">So, there was already established a contact.</span> <span id="s252">The priest said you stay here as long as you want, until the end of the war, but after a number of days, we realized that it was too dangerous, not only for us but for the priest.</span> <span id="s253">After all they were living normally two people in that house.</span> <span id="s254">Suddenly there were eight and already when he went down to the supermarket, which did not exist in those days, but his grocer suddenly products were sold in quite a different amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">So, it could not work.</span> <span id="s256">Then my elder brother went back to Copenhagen in order to try to raise the amount of money necessary to go to Sweden because that was not free of charge and it was not the normal prices for tickets to Sweden.</span> <span id="s257">It did cost quite a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q.</span> <span id="s259">How did he raise the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A. Well, we tried to find people who we knew had some money and who were willing to give us some loans at the time.</span> <span id="s261">So, that was possible, although the sum which we needed was an enormous sum compared to the prices of those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q.</span> <span id="s263">How much was it and who gave you the price?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A.</span> <span id="s265">It was different prices, but it could vary around at the time 1,500 to 2,000 Danish Kroner which wouldn't sound much of today, not terrible much.</span> <span id="s266">I would say 2,000 Danish Kroner at the time was something like 300 American Dollars but if you multiplied it by six you already had a bigger sum and that was a terrific amount.</span> <span id="s267">And compared to what my father's earnings were in those days, it was beyond reach of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">But my brother managed to raise that money --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q. From Gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A. No, partly from Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q.</span> <span id="s272">Who were still in Copenhagen or had contacts to their offices in Copenhagen and were willing to do this, but there were big collections of money among Gentiles.</span> <span id="s273">Again, I remember that the Danish society of medical doctors gave a big lump sum.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q. To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">02:17:00 A. To the resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q. Which then gave it --?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. Which then, so when they had the people -- there was nobody who did not go to Sweden because they didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s278">So, although there was a price, the resistance movement saw to it that nobody was kept back because he couldn't pay the price.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q. So, if your brother had not been able to raise the money, you could have gone anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s281">That would have been the outcome yes.</span> <span id="s282">But it was a question of trying and of honor and of self respect that the money was raised.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q.</span> <span id="s284">How did you get in touch with the resistance people?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A. Well, through that son of the priest there were other contacts at the time we decided to go.</span> <span id="s286">The routes that were easiest, the sea is very narrow between Denmark and Sweden, in Northen Sealand, had become very dangerous.</span> <span id="s287">The biggest mishap of the operation was in a small fisherman town in northern Sealand called Gilleleia(?)</span> <span id="s288">_ where almost a hundred refugees were caught in the church of this place and therefore the advice was don't go out there.</span> <span id="s289">It's true that it takes not much more than a half an hour and you are already in Swedish waters, whereas going south it would take you six to eight hours to go over the Baltics.</span> <span id="s290">They said it was much safer to go south.</span> <span id="s291">And that is how it worked and we got an address in a city down south and at that address we paid our money and we were advised to go to the Bishop's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q.</span> <span id="s293">How did you get to where you were to --?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A. That's a good question.</span> <span id="s295">We actually went by train and that was not one of the happiest or easiest trips I made by train in my life because that very same train going south of course also carried quite a good number of Germans and German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">So my mother and my youngest brother who at the time was only five years old were put in a special compartment in first class.</span> <span id="s297">Perhaps the boy would start asking funny questions.</span> <span id="s298">Then we found out that the only woman that was in the same compartment as my mother, took out a German newspaper.</span> <span id="s299">So, when she left the train on the way, we were rather frightened that she would go and tell anything, but it worked out very well and we arrived safely to this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Again, walking through the streets of that place, you could here people say oh there are many Jews in town today.</span> <span id="s301">So, the whole population was involved and at the Bishop's place there was almost sixty refugees.</span> <span id="s302">The whole town had to know about it because in the evening the cabs of the town came to take us to the various places where we should live.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">So, it was a people's action and not only the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s304">At the same time, as many people in the resistance movement would tell you that the biggest recruitment for the resistance movement came thanks to the rescue operation because then already so many people had become active who were never part of the resistance movement before and they continued to work for the resistance also after the rescue operation had ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q.</span> <span id="s306">Did you meet with other Jewish families who were fleeing before you went to the place where you were going to get the 02:27:00 boat, before you went to the Bishop's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A. No.</span> <span id="s308">After we left Copenhagen, no we did not.</span> <span id="s309">My brother had, as I said, had some contact in Copenhagen, but apart from that no.</span> <span id="s310">We were in a place where nobody else would ever dream of going and by coincidence had that contact there.</span> <span id="s311">So, there was no real contact after we had tried to spread the news as far as possible.</span> <span id="s312">Then it was a break from one to another and I think that was necessary to have that break because had somebody been caught and pressured to tell, we would have had huge problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q.</span> <span id="s314">What day did you leave the first place that you went to, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A.</span> <span id="s316">We went on the eve of Rosh Hashanah on a Wednesday, and we stayed there actually untill the following Friday.</span> <span id="s317">The raid was on Friday night at the end of Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s318">We came to this place and left there on the same day on the eve of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s319">So, it was the hour of Kol Nidrei when we entered the fishing boat in order to go out there and we had a rather more dramatic trip but that has nothing to do with the general situation because our fisherman was not a very good navigator and he should have never undertaken the responsibility that he did for nineteen people in this small boat.</span> <span id="s320">He didn't know where he was going and when we actually saw land as was planned after about eight hours, it turned out to be Denmark and not Sweden and for a short moment we thought that he was on the wrong side, but he was as scared as we were and we then found a route according to where the sun was on the horizon and miraculously we reached Swedish coast before the fuel was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q. On Yom Kippur?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A.</span> <span id="s323">That was Yom Kippur and we were seventeen hours on the Baltics so that was one of the Yom Kippurs I shall not forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q. Was there any observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A. Well, we didn't have any food in any case so at least for seventeen hours we all fasted.</span> <span id="s326">But there was no service and there was no chance of --.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A.</span> <span id="s330">In fact, when we arrived to the Bishop's yard, the Bishop was aware that it was a special day in the Jewish calendar coming up, but he was not aware of the laws of Yom Kippur so when he saw my father and recognized him, and they embraced, the Bishop put to him the question, is there anything special Jews are eating on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s331">Of course, the first reaction was that the Bishop was ignorant, but the very important part of this is that the Bishop in this desperate situation where he was open to just one person in that town giving him away, with sixty Jews at his house, his main thought was that the Jews even under those circumstances should be given the opportunity to follow the laws of the Torah, the traditional Jewish law.</span> <span id="s332">That shows a little bit how the Danish church reacted.</span> <span id="s333">That they did not do what some other churches had done over history.</span> <span id="s334">That the rescue would be conditioned by giving up your religious ideas.</span> <span id="s335">On the contrary they were willing to help us and they wanted the Jews to be Jews and they were among the sixty people there Jews who would not know that it was Yom Kippur that day, but the Bishop would tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">So, I have taken that as an example of how the church reacted that the Jews were helped as Jews and not as possible converts.</span> <span id="s337">This is part of the picture that should be heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">I remember at the point that some of the church 03:04:00 organizations in America issued public statements and asking for forgiveness for being passive during the Holocaust and I was asked did I expect a similar statement from the Danish church and I said the Danish church doesn't have to make such a statement.</span> <span id="s339">They made a statement on the third of October 1943 which was read in all churches all over Denmark, a very strong protest.</span> <span id="s340">Nobody could at the time know whether it was dangerous to read that statement in church, and they did it all over the country.</span> <span id="s341">That was the strongest way of assuring the Jewish people of the support of the church of the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q.</span> <span id="s343">Did you know that there were Jews that were captured?</span> <span id="s344">Did you know about that or did you learn in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A.</span> <span id="s346">In Sweden we soon learned about it because those that were captured had relatives that succeeded to get into Sweden.</span> <span id="s347">Among those we knew of course were deported was the chief rabbi who had already been in German custody since that day at the end of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q.</span> <span id="s349">He had never been released?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A.</span> <span id="s351">He had never been released nor had his son by the way nor had the chairman of the board of the Synagogue, but little by little we heard about the successes and the failures and that was soon established a contact through the Danish Red Cross to those that were deported.</span> <span id="s352">So, we also heard about those who had died.</span> <span id="s353">We also found out possibilities to send passes that was soon after being well organized by the Danish Red Cross so that the biggest number of death actually was during the first six months until about March.</span> <span id="s354">I have a register here that my predecessor Dr. Friediger(?)</span> <span id="s355">who was among the deportees, he kept as if he were still having the full register power of registration of deaths and births etc., he kept a register according to the guidelines for the official register so I can see when actually the people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q.</span> <span id="s357">He kept this in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A.</span> <span id="s359">In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s360">You can see there that at the moment when the food parcels started getting through people survived.</span> <span id="s361">Incredibly, even in the concentration camps, the Jews of Denmark had special treatment.</span> <span id="s362">I cannot understand.</span> <span id="s363">Nobody has tried to explain that to this day.</span> <span id="s364">Theresienstadt was supposed to be one of the better places to come.</span> <span id="s365">One of the better places to come meant that out of 140,000 captives, 33,000 died there in Theresienstadt and 83,000 were deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s366">So, the number of survivors was small, but the Danish Jews were not sent, none of them, sent on to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s367">And during the last month of the war in April 1945, the famous white busses that were originally organized by the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte arrived in Theresienstadt on the thirteenth of April and they left Theresienstadt and went through Denmark, taken to Sweden.</span> <span id="s368">So, that was a great day for my father who in Sweden was working officially in the capacity as rabbi for Danish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q. Your father then became the titular, head of the Jewish community in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A.</span> <span id="s371">The Danish embassy in Stockholm, in fact engaged him, I think it was the only time that the Danish embassy engaged a non-Lutheran priest, engaged my father as officially the rabbi and he went and visited the Danish refugees who were spread all over Sweden.</span> <span id="s372">Some of them got jobs in towns.</span> <span id="s373">Others had to stay in some camps throughout the period.</span> <span id="s374">So my father went around.</span> <span id="s375">He organized services for them.</span> <span id="s376">He especially tried to encourage them and give them hope.</span> <span id="s377">He spoke to those who had relatives in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s378">There were many problems for rabbis to take care of and he worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s379">He was away almost all the time.03:10:00 So, he even had to go back before we were allowed to go back because the Danes in Sweden organized a military unit in case there would be war over Denmark then they could have gone over and participated.</span> <span id="s380">Now, they went over on the day the Germans capitulated.</span> <span id="s381">They went over to do police work more or less and one of them got killed by a German bullet and my father went over for the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">But we were back in Denmark three weeks after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q.</span> <span id="s384">What was it like when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A.</span> <span id="s386">That was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s387">We were one of the first to come back and people were so awfully nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q.</span> <span id="s389">Did you come back in a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A.</span> <span id="s391">It was very well organized in Sweden.</span> <span id="s392">There was a limit how many people could go at the same time on the boats back.</span> <span id="s393">The official nice ferry boats and it only took an hour and a quarter.</span> <span id="s394">It was a safe trip.</span> <span id="s395">So everybody had a note from the authorities what day would be theirs and we were among the first.</span> <span id="s396">I think we were actually on the very first day.</span> <span id="s397">When we came home to our own street and met the places, the people and I met those that I used to play with the twenty months that we'd been away had been making a difference to all of us.</span> <span id="s398">But the way we were received were extraordinary.</span> <span id="s399">I can say in the provincial towns where there were not so many Jews the Jews that came back were received as heroes with flags all over town.</span> <span id="s400">Enthusiasm and my father used to say that this was even more important than the rescue operation because after all the rescue operation had as it's ultimate goal to help Jews leaving the countries.</span> <span id="s401">Jewish history knows of many cases where nations have helped Jews to leave their country, but we might not have another example of a nation welcoming the Jews back to the country and that was done here I would say even from people who might have thought it would be nice if they had not come back because perhaps they had got an apartment or they were looking after a shop.</span> <span id="s402">What I do know, it was almost a unanimous feeling of a warm welcome back to the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Then we had to try to settle everybody and regain according this situation and situations were not alike.</span> <span id="s404">Some people had just closed the door and then nothing had been touched.</span> <span id="s405">Their flats, their houses or whatever they had were exactly the same position, a little bit of dust and that was it.</span> <span id="s406">In some cases, even the Copenhagen municipality had paid their rent fer the period they had been away.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Others had said how can we leave a flat and not being able to pay so they had told the landlords they would give up the flat and suddenly they were without a place to live.</span> <span id="s408">It was not so easy at the time.</span> <span id="s409">There was a shortage of apartments.</span> <span id="s410">Some people had sold their business and came back to nothing.</span> <span id="s411">So, it was different again from person to person.</span> <span id="s412">But there was established an office and special ministry to assist people in that situation.</span> <span id="s413">But in the end it was up to each individual to find out how to deal with it.</span> <span id="s414">It took some time.</span> <span id="s415">A few people had stayed in Sweden if they got good work there, why should they leave it.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">So, we went through another quite difficult period.</span> <span id="s417">But the day when we could reopen the synagogue was of course a very happy day.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q.</span> <span id="s419">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A.</span> <span id="s421">That was a few months after we had returned.</span> <span id="s422">We had returned at the end of May, the beginning of June.</span> <span id="s423">I can't remember the exact date when we reopened but the synagogue was ready for the high holidays of Autumn of '45.</span> <span id="s424">The old chief rabbi had returned from Theresienstadt and was back for the service in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">In certain ways you could say we were back in business as usual, but it would never be the same and it could never be the same.</span> <span id="s426">The community had changed some differences inside the community between the so called Viking Jews.</span> <span id="s427">Those Jews who had been here for centuries and Jews that had come in the beginning of the century from eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s428">Jews that had come from Germany in the thirties and you had a feeling that they had difficulties in getting together.</span> <span id="s429">This was forgotten.</span> <span id="s430">These differences could no longer exist.</span> <span id="s431">And there were many other things where we had to realize a responsibility.</span> <span id="s432">We heard about the full truths of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s433">How could a Jewish community not react.</span> <span id="s434">We tried to take in, since we were better off than most other communities, also materially better off, we tried to invite children from countries where they had suffered much more than we had suffered.</span> <span id="s435">We realized that we were part of the Jewish world.</span> <span id="s436">With all our gratitude to Denmark and confirmation that we were part of the Danish nation, this we never doubted, but perhaps we had in our attempt that nobody should have suspicion about our Danishness perhaps we had forgotten our obligations to the outside Jewish world.</span> <span id="s437">That had changed.</span> <span id="s438">That could never go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q.</span> <span id="s440">One hears about this occurrence of the guilt of the survivor, the individual Jew who lived while the others died.</span> <span id="s441">Is there any such thing as the guilt of the survivor community?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A. No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s443">I feel that people ask themselves why did I survive, and that question has no answer.</span> <span id="s444">Who could claim that he was a better person, that he was wiser, that any quality gave 03:19:00 justification to the fact that he or she was saved and the others were not.</span> <span id="s445">That to many people created an obligation, an obligation to be more involved.</span> <span id="s446">That we were saved gave an obligation to try to save others who would be endangered and there was enough to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">But I don't think we in Denmark had any feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s448">Our disaster would not have helped others so since we did not survive so that others paid the price, I don't think we had this feeling of guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q. It's an irrational feeling, it's a feeling that comes out of trauma?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A. Sure, and we asked the question, but as I said nobody has an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q. Was it a traumatized community, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A.</span> <span id="s453">The trauma came when we saw the realities of what we actually escaped.</span> <span id="s454">But again, I have a feeling that you see there a generation gap.</span> <span id="s455">A generation that was already adults and responsible people in their thirties and forties and then a generation that grew up and became adults after the creation of the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s456">You see there is a completely new Jewish world.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">I remember when I started work for a jewelry(??)</span> <span id="s458">Jewry(?)</span> <span id="s459">here in Denmark and I joined the international Jewish forces on behalf of Soviet Jews, the generation that were just a few years older than I am were not too happy about this to begin with.</span> <span id="s460">They felt, again be quiet, don't let others pay attention to the fact that we are here.</span> <span id="s461">We can live without that attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Then the younger generation said we are responsible to a much higher degree and I might generalize a little bit but I would say it was quite typical and I think that was also the result of the rescue.</span> <span id="s463">Others didn't do it for us, we had to do it for us.</span> <span id="s464">We are in this situation together.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">03:23:00 Q.</span> <span id="s466">What were one or two extraordinary stories about the rescue that you've learned about?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A. Well, I would say that you are now in a situation where historians move in and I have no specific animosity against historians but I feel historians like in other fields, I could take my own field of theology, you have here a very clear picture of what happened.</span> <span id="s468">All right, you still have questions here and there, but generally speaking it is very open.</span> <span id="s469">We have had so many thousands of witnesses to express what they actually experienced, so what is an historian going to do about that.</span> <span id="s470">Since everybody for a number of years has been praising the rescue operation if you want to make a new thesis, a new doctorate of what happened, you have to go against that what is generally accepted.</span> <span id="s471">So, suddenly you find historians who try to say this is nothing and actually the Germans closed their eyes and it was not dangerous to help them.</span> <span id="s472">I can get quite furious at these stories.</span> <span id="s473">I feel first of all they don't know what they're talking about.</span> <span id="s474">There were people who died in that operation and nobody at the time could know how dangerous it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">It is true that if the Germans had put their navy fully into the waters between Denmark and Sweden, they could have stopped the rescue operation, but the Germans had some other things to do with their navy so it was limited how much they could prevent it.</span> <span id="s476">And they did in fact at a number of points stop the transports from Denmark to Sweden.</span> <span id="s477">So, it was not a really closed eye, but 03:26:00 one of the stories I learned about much later.</span> <span id="s478">In fact with connection with our celebrations in '93 was a story of a woman, a blind woman who had hired a cab and although she was blind on the first part of the tour she directed the driver, right here, left here, straight, until they reached a certain corner where she asked the driver to stop and she pointed to a house across the street and she asked the driver to describe what he saw there.</span> <span id="s479">He described the place, whether it needed some painting, what it looked like and she sat and listened, said nothing, then after a few minutes of silence she said to the driver well now you can go on to the address I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">So, the driver got curious and wanted to know why should he tell about this house.</span> <span id="s481">Why should he stop there.</span> <span id="s482">So, the woman tells him that during the second world war when we reached October of '43 she lived in that house with her husband and her children and the idea was that every day the resistance movement brought a number of refugees that were more or less parked in the house until the evening when they tried to find chances of transport.</span> <span id="s483">Some evenings they couldn't find any transport so the refugees stayed over the night until the following evening and this went on for a number of days and she was a little bit afraid.</span> <span id="s484">Perhaps the children would talk at school, but it all went very well until a night when they had a number of refugees in the house, a big caravan of German military cars stopped outside the house and they were sure that the last moment had come.</span> <span id="s485">She herself, this woman got terribly excited.</span> <span id="s486">Everybody was sitting in complete silence.</span> <span id="s487">Her excitement was so strong that the blood veins in her eyes bursted and she was blinded.</span> <span id="s488">That was the situation when she got blind.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">After some minutes of her and everybody else there as if it was hours, all the German cars started.</span> <span id="s490">Not one soldier had left the cars, nobody had knocked on the door and why they had stopped there nobody can tell you.</span> <span id="s491">The only lasting effect of it was that this woman was blinded.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">So, the taxi driver asked the woman I can understand that you wanted to save people, but it was it not a terribly high price to pay for your humanitarian ideas?</span> <span id="s493">So the woman said if you ask me whether I am sorry that I was blinded I can tell you it has been terrible.</span> <span id="s494">Could I wish for anything, I wish for my eyesight back.</span> <span id="s495">But if you ask me if you could live your life again, would you have done the same thing, I could tell you yes, I would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s496">You see, this fact is so strong that that tells about the approach, about the ideas of our rescuers that they knew there was a risk and even with that risk they would do it.</span> <span id="s497">Later for most of our good friends, it came out that they survived as well and that is very easy to see after this.</span> <span id="s498">But at the time it was a risk and some of them paid a high price and even then they would say they would do it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">This is to me a much stronger proof against those so called historians who try to belittle what happened in those days.</span> <span id="s500">Again, we have to understand that the rescue did not just happen.</span> <span id="s501">It was a result of a long relationship between the Jewish and Christian populations.</span> <span id="s502">If there had not been any relationship I doubt whether it would have happened.</span> <span id="s503">But there was a relationship and that relationship proved itself to be as strong as it was when it was necessary to prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">I believe that this perhaps is also a lesson of the whole rescue operation that this open door policy of a community towards the majority community in the country and that is a necessary step if we want good relationship it means we must be open.</span> <span id="s505">Not that we shall forget who we are.</span> <span id="s506">Not that we shall forget our roots, but at the same time the positive to the community among who we are living.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q. Wouldn't you say that the German Jewish community was plausible?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q. Let me ask you about the German Jewish community which made great openings to the community at large in comparison to the Danish Jewish community in Denmark that was received with a welcome that sustained itself when the Jewish community was threatened but in Germany that was not the case.</span> <span id="s511">How would you account for the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A.</span> <span id="s513">There were many contacts between German Jews and German Christians.</span> <span id="s514">They were more on the professional level.</span> <span id="s515">The German Christians would have a Jewish doctor or a Jewish lawyer but it remained more or less a mystery what is Judaism.</span> <span id="s516">So beyond that general human relationship it is very important for a Jewish community not to hide its specific customs because if you will fight the prejudice that exist among various nations and various religions you can only do so by being open by explain to people what does it mean, why am I doing this why am I doing that.</span> <span id="s517">I remember a funny example perhaps, I was in my younger days responsible for the summer holiday camp of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s518">The neighbors of our place there went out to have a quiet good 04:02:00 time in the summer they were a little bit disturbed that here was a group of youngsters that made noise in various ways at various times of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">So, I decided to invite all the neighbors.</span> <span id="s520">I made an open day at this place where all the neighbors came in and I told them about our program and when they heard this noise it meant that there was this activity going on and that noise was another activity, etc.</span> <span id="s521">Suddenly we were wonderful friends and the people thought it was exciting that they have got this camp as their next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s522">This is where I say if we as Jews invite people into the synagogue, not with any missionary ideas at all but they should know what are we doing there, and what does it mean to us and if we at the same time pay interest in what are they doing in their churches or their mosques and what does it mean to them, that is the way I try to point out is important in a relationship to find these ideas that even when they think they are nice people but they are crazy, there is very soon some mystery coming around.</span> <span id="s523">Traditions that are not so mystical.</span> <span id="s524">If we only get an opportunity to explain what a symbol means, then the symbol is beautiful.</span> <span id="s525">If they just see the symbol and don't know what it is they become afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q. Was the community then from the turn of the century on the Jewish community actively making itself evident too?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A. Little by little.</span> <span id="s528">I must say that perhaps my father's biggest contribution to the Jewish community was that he was able of explaining these things, but there had been others before him, and I would like to add that this is happening today also in Germany.</span> <span id="s529">You have many countries in Europe where you find councils of Christians and Jews and there perhaps I could add that one of the countries where you don't have a council of Christians and Jews is Denmark.</span> <span id="s530">Because the mere fact that you need a council is already showing a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">I have been serving together with three bishops of the Lutheran Church in Copenhagen and I have to every one of them put the question should we establish a council of Christians and Jews and after having discussed it with them, we came to the same results what should that council do?</span> <span id="s532">If we should have problems and we might have problems so either you phone me or I phone me and we discuss the problem and we solve it if we need.</span> <span id="s533">We don't have to formalize it.</span> <span id="s534">But you find such councils in Germany and England and Sweden and in other countries.</span> <span id="s535">This is a very important step forward and if we would have had that 100 years ago, I think that it would have been much more difficult for the Nazis to work because you cannot if you have sufficient information you can not go around telling stories of cruelty and what they tried to put into their propaganda if people know better and therefore it was a big job and an important job between all groups in this society to be open and to give that amount of confidence from one to another that is necessary.</span> <span id="s536">War, persecutions, are very often based on fear and it's very often a groundless fear.</span> <span id="s537">That is where we could do better.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q. Danish tolerance that was built up before the war towards the Jews, did you ever think it was unique?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A. I didn't think of it like that in those days, and I want to say when you use the expression "Danish tolerance", the Danes are not born more tolerant than anybody else.</span> <span id="s540">We feel it nowadays where we have got a problem with the Muslims, but you see the Jews are that many steps ahead of the Muslims because the Danes know they have nothing to fear from the Jews.</span> <span id="s541">They haven't got the same feelings of security when you speak about Muslims.</span> <span id="s542">They don't know anything about the Muslims.</span> <span id="s543">They might know something about the old testament even if they don't understand it, they know absolutely nothing about the Koran and therefore there is a fear and where there is a fear you see intolerance growing and that is the problem of today.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">04:08:00 So, this proves the point that Danish tolerance is not something which you inherit from somewhere(?)</span> <span id="s545">; Danes are normal people.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q. And yet during the second world war they behaved differently from any other group?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A. Yes, but that is based partly in any case on the more open relationship.</span> <span id="s548">Partly of course also because we had the common enemy.</span> <span id="s549">Partly because we had the opportunity, but you're right when it comes to all that it amounted to a situation where, I would say they were brave people.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0399 PAGE 2 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
