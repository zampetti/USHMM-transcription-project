Zaidenweber for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project by Steven S. Foldes at Mr. Zaidenweber’s home, 3308 Idaho Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota on 21 June, 1982.</span> <span id="s5">Please tell me your complete name and your Jewish name if it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Well the Jewish name is the middle name -- the initial that I have -- Israel.</span> <span id="s7">My name -- the formal name -- Micah, is Jewish for Jules.</span> <span id="s8">Jules I. Zaidenweber</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born January 8, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: In what town and country were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: In the town of Lublin in the country of Poland.</span> <span id="s13">I grew up, however, in the city of Radom.</span> <span id="s14">Which is about, roughly, 60, 65 miles southwest of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s15">I considered myself a Radomer, because I grew up there from a little kid going to school, graduating high school there, and my parents lived there, and my family -- on one side, my father’s side -- and the friends, actually, I had -- those were all from Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Please tell me about your family.</span> <span id="s17">What were your parents’ names and where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My father was from Radom.</span> <span id="s19">Born in Radom.</span> <span id="s20">His name was Israel Gedaliah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Can we spell that for the transcriber?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My spelling was changed a little bit when I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s23">Zajdenweber.</span> <span id="s24">I changed the “j” to an “i” The pronunciation is the same, you know, “j” and “i”, but it was mispronounced: ‘Zaj-den-weber” they called it.</span> <span id="s25">So that was the reason for changing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My mother’s name was Ita Justina.</span> <span id="s28">She was known usually as Justina.</span> <span id="s29">Her maiden name was Frydmacher.</span> <span id="s30">And she was born in the city of Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Were their families from those two places?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: That’s correct, yes.</span> <span id="s33">Of course, my mother’s father, if I remember, was from a small town near Lublin, but it’s basically the same location.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And what did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My father -- he was a salesman in the textile store or distributing place.</span> <span id="s36">The place was both wholesale and retail.</span> <span id="s37">My mother had acquired, in her later years, a profession, after we kids grew up.</span> <span id="s38">She was a corset maker.</span> <span id="s39">She had a shop and that’s what she had done.</span> <span id="s40">And that probably saved her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Who lived in your household, actually, while you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Four of us.</span> <span id="s43">My father, my mother, my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s44">I had a sister, a younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How old was your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: My sister was four years younger than I. And she did not survive the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, with us kids, basically Polish.</span> <span id="s49">My parents spoke Yiddish and I learned Yiddish.</span> <span id="s50">My sister could converse in Yiddish, probably not as well as I could.</span> <span id="s51">The language amongst the adults was basically Yiddish -- in the house.</span> <span id="s52">I went to a state school -- boys school.</span> <span id="s53">That’s not a reform school, as you well know.</span> <span id="s54">It’s a “gymnasium” that you are familiar with, and that was strictly a Polish school.</span> <span id="s55">Knowing the Polish language -- a good knowledge -- was a prerequisite, so I knew Polish very well.</span> <span id="s56">As a matter of fact, I was fairly good in Polish, better than some of the native Poles!</span> <span id="s57">That quite often happened, that the Jewish kids were better in the Polish language than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Was your family secular or religious in practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Well, they were sort of half in half.</span> <span id="s60">My father was not an orthodox person.</span> <span id="s61">He didn’t have a beard, which was being very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s62">I’ll show you some pictures.</span> <span id="s63">He looked very secular and behaved secular.</span> <span id="s64">He did not work on Shabbat -- unless he had to.</span> <span id="s65">He attended synagogue services -- not every Shabbat, but all the holidays.</span> <span id="s66">Very strict there.</span> <span id="s67">My mother -- she was, as was usual for women, less practicing .</span> <span id="s68">She was lighting candles.</span> <span id="s69">She would not go to the synagogues as often, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: But your household maintained kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s72">My household maintained kosher.</span> <span id="s73">And being Jewish was a natural thing for us, so there was no question of being assimilated in any way.</span> <span id="s74">We had a Zionist background.</span> <span id="s75">My father, as a youth, belonged to a Zionist youth group, and I think he transmitted that to us, too.</span> <span id="s76">When I became a teenager, I joined a group also.</span> <span id="s77">It was not permitted in school, but the school looked through their fingers.</span> <span id="s78">All Jewish kids from my school and girls from other schools belonged, because this was the thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did your family participate in the Jewish community in Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, the set-up on Radom was not as it is in the United States.</span> <span id="s81">You did not have to belong to a synagogue to be a member and to be active in something.</span> <span id="s82">You did not have to belong to a JCC, because there was no JCC.</span> <span id="s83">There were Zionist youth groups if you are a youth.</span> <span id="s84">There were Zionist organizations if you are an adult.</span> <span id="s85">There were non-Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s86">Jewish life in Radom was very active.</span> <span id="s87">There was a Yiddish paper.</span> <span id="s88">There were many, many groups, as I said, Zionist, non-Zionist, and even anti-Zionists.</span> <span id="s89">So anybody who was leaning to one thing or another had a way of expressing himself and joining with a group that he felt comfortable with.</span> <span id="s90">These groups were both social, and they were very much political, as you probably know from Jewish life.</span> <span id="s91">Some of ‘em were religious and some of ‘em were anti-religious.</span> <span id="s92">So the set-up was such that if a meeting had some importance or interest for either my mother or my father, they would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">They were very much interested, for example, in Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s94">If any troupes will come from the outside and present a play, they will make a point of going, because it’s a cultural occurrence that they were interested in.</span> <span id="s95">They would certainly go whenever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">As I mentioned before, as far as going to synagogues, there were hundreds of ‘em probably -- small synagogues.</span> <span id="s97">My father started to go to one, and I remember as a youth I went with him.</span> <span id="s98">This was a private synagogue.</span> <span id="s99">The synagogue -- or the “shtibel” as they called it -- was a small synagogue, usually in a private building, not a very fancy thing.</span> <span id="s100">It could consist of maybe two or more rooms.</span> <span id="s101">Usually it was pretty well attended on a Saturday, but it was very much attended on a holiday, and even more so on the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s102">And so, my father would go to a certain one located not very far from our home.</span> <span id="s103">Once you started going, you were well known then, and they considered you sort of a member, although there was no formal membership.</span> <span id="s104">You will support by giving a “naider” -- meaning a donation.</span> <span id="s105">You will give a voluntary donation and that’s how this was supported.</span> <span id="s106">On the High Holidays, however, we would go to our own family synagogue.</span> <span id="s107">My great grandfather -- who happened to have an apartment building -- donated one of the apartments for a synagogue.</span> <span id="s108">It was a regular apartment, with a kitchen, and all of it became the synagogue.</span> <span id="s109">And basically, it was only meant for men!</span> <span id="s110">Women would never come.</span> <span id="s111">Those women who were interested in going to a synagogue, they would go to the city-wide synagogue, and there were some other small synagogues who had a room or so especially dedicated for women.</span> <span id="s112">In the family shtibel, there was no room for women at all during the year.</span> <span id="s113">However, during the High Holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my grandmother’s apartment became the portion that women would come to, because it was an adjacent apartment, you see, and they would open the door and hang a white sheet between, so that the women who were close to it could hear, and what was going on farther on I don’t even need to tell you!</span> <span id="s114">It was maybe a sentimental thing to go to your own family synagogue, although it was quite a ways farther away, and might have been even an economic reason, too, because you had to buy tickets, which sometimes were expensive.</span> <span id="s115">And here we had privilege to come to our own.</span> <span id="s116">My great-grandfather, as I said, donated it, and his sons and my grandmother -- his daughter -- they continued it.</span> <span id="s117">That was a very nice tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: It’s clear that you had a formal Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, the formal Jewish education, again, was different in Poland than it is here, in a way.</span> <span id="s120">Going to a Polish school meant going six days a week, Saturday also.</span> <span id="s121">I’m not talking about after the war, under the Communist regime, but that was the normal thing, six days.</span> <span id="s122">So I would go to school on Saturday, then.</span> <span id="s123">It was important even to my family for me to go to a high school like this, even though it meant desecrating the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s124">But, I did go to a cheder when I was smaller.</span> <span id="s125">And then when I couldn’t go to cheder any more.</span> <span id="s126">I would have a rabbi come to my home and teach me.</span> <span id="s127">Then when that kind of stopped, I went in the evenings with a group of other kids to a Hebrew school in the evening.</span> <span id="s128">Not the rabbis who just learned how to pray, or chumash, but this was more to learn Hebrew and learn history.</span> <span id="s129">Besides, our religion was an important element in Polish schools.</span> <span id="s130">Poland being a Catholic country, they had “religion” two or three times a week in this school, taught by a priest, but we had release time, an hour or so, maybe two hours, once a week.</span> <span id="s131">And the Jewish boys had a teacher come and he taught us what was called “religion,” basically history.</span> <span id="s132">Prophets and whatever.</span> <span id="s133">So that was the Jewish education.</span> <span id="s134">But again, being a Jew in Poland was not only the basic religious education, but it was the environment -- the total environment of being Jewish in a Jewish population that was very much Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: I would like to shift now to talk a little bit more about the specific events leading to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s136">What major events were you most aware of from the mid-1930s until about 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: The war started for us in ’39.</span> <span id="s138">The division was right there, September, ’39, rather than going to ’41.</span> <span id="s139">In 1933, I was 13 years old, and that was exactly the time when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s140">I read the papers, obviously, and it was talked about, and it was heard about, and we knew what Hitler meant to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What did you think Hitler meant to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well, at that time, of course, we did not foresee everything -- “we” being the kids or the parents or even politicians and professional analysts -- we made many mistakes in both analyzing and in judging Hitler at that time, but we knew that Hitler brought anti-Semitism to Germany.</span> <span id="s143">Now to us it was just like somebody coming close to Poland and reinforcing those anti-Semitic feelings, because it didn’t take very long, you know.</span> <span id="s144">Going back a second, I went to a Polish school where the Jews were a very small minority.</span> <span id="s145">It was more-or-less a quota system, so everything around me was Polish, and we were very much aware of it -- both as far as teachers were concerned and the administration was concerned, and even more so as far as our fellow pupils were concerned.</span> <span id="s146">Coming back to the general environment, the anti-Semitism in the streets, anti-Semitism in the businesses, and everywhere, it was very much alive and visible.</span> <span id="s147">A Jew could not get certain jobs that he wanted to -- even if he might have had a better education than the Pole had.</span> <span id="s148">A Jew could not become a judge, for example -- ever.</span> <span id="s149">A Jew could not become a -- well, a notary public was a more advanced position than it is in this country, because you had to be either a lawyer or at least have a partial education -- but you could not become a notary public.</span> <span id="s150">A Jew wanted a license, Let’s say, for liquor or something like that, well, it would have been difficult.</span> <span id="s151">Cigarettes was a state monopoly.</span> <span id="s152">Jews were in the businesses, but still the police would harass.</span> <span id="s153">And there were so many things.</span> <span id="s154">So the anti-Semitism was around us, and we felt it.</span> <span id="s155">We knew it.</span> <span id="s156">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s157">We fought it -- if not with physical and external means -- with moral and cultural means.</span> <span id="s158">Now Hitler came to power, and this is like somebody coming around and reinforcing our own anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s159">It really didn’t take very long when you could start sensing the increase of anti-Semitic feelings, excesses -- I mention a few in a minute -- even in the Polish Parliament.</span> <span id="s160">One example I remember now is the Shechetah.</span> <span id="s161">You know Shechetah is the ritual slaughtering.</span> <span id="s162">For a while it was a problem.</span> <span id="s163">There were Jewish representatives in the Polish Parliament and there were Zionists and Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s164">People may not remember those things or be aware of it, but before the war Poland wss an autocratic country.</span> <span id="s165">You hear about Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Pilsudski was the liberator, the Washington of Poland.</span> <span id="s168">He was the liberator in 1918, but he was also a general.</span> <span id="s169">So he put this military character, you might say, in the Polish government -- not right away, but eventually he took over the government, he and his clique of generals were actually the governing body of Poland.</span> <span id="s170">And so that was when Poland became independent.</span> <span id="s171">For 150 years before that Poland was not there.</span> <span id="s172">He was not an outright anti-Semite, and he never opposed Jews having representatives in the Polish government.</span> <span id="s173">And there were Jews!</span> <span id="s174">And some of them had positions of importance, if not power.</span> <span id="s175">These Jews -- the representatives -- represented a Jewish population which was quite significant.</span> <span id="s176">The Jewish population was about 10% in Poland, it was between three and three and a half million Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s177">So there was an array of Jewish representatives, from the far right -- I mean the religious -- up to not quite the left, because Pilsudski would not let them.</span> <span id="s178">But there were socialists.</span> <span id="s179">Now in the mid-‘30s, this problem of whether or not to forbid the ritual slaughtering came up.</span> <span id="s180">It was a fight!</span> <span id="s181">The Jews were fighting, as much as was possible, because when Hitler came to power, you could sense that all of those generals, the population, and the representatives -- all of them -- were more and more against the Jews.</span> <span id="s182">There were also pogroms on a small scale, not far from our town.</span> <span id="s183">It was a town by the name of Przytyk.</span> <span id="s184">My wife’s family came from there.</span> <span id="s185">The Polish peasants attacked the Jews and the Jews fought back, they were prepared, and they were tried in Radom, because there was a circuit court.</span> <span id="s186">They were in other places in Poland as well.</span> <span id="s187">So anti-Semitism got a shot in the arm, if you will, by the fact that anti-Semitism came into a country like Germany.</span> <span id="s188">So this was, of course the immediate effect of Hitler’s coming to power.</span> <span id="s189">This happened in 1933.</span> <span id="s190">Well, I needn’t go through history -- ’33, ’34, ’35 -- Nuremberg laws, and all kinds of anti-Semitic laws.</span> <span id="s191">And then in ’38 -- I think it was -- might have been in ’37 already -- they came out with an order in Germany to get rid of all the Jews who had lived in Germany -- no matter how long -- that never became German citizens.</span> <span id="s192">They considered them still, let’s say, Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s193">The Polish Jews went to Germany, and they could not acquire German citizenship, but they were allowed to live in Germany, and they considered themselves German citizens.</span> <span id="s194">It turned out that they were never German citizens -- at least not according to the book.</span> <span id="s195">In ’37, definitely by ’38, they pushed them over the border -- and I mean almost literally.</span> <span id="s196">They brought them to the German-Polish border and they just pushed them, “Here!</span> <span id="s197">Go back to your country!”</span> <span id="s198">And many came to Radom.</span> <span id="s199">It was a shock for them, it was a shock for us.</span> <span id="s200">But we still didn’t grasp the enormity of what was coming -- of what was going on then, and also coming -- but the sad part of it all was the whole world wasn’t doing anything!</span> <span id="s201">So I was also aware, there’s no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did you know some of these Jews who were expelled into…</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: My wife, they took in some people.</span> <span id="s204">Many people took in either family or children -- there were young children.</span> <span id="s205">When they came and settled in Radom, I got to know some.</span> <span id="s206">I was still a youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Were there other major developments of which you were aware before the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well this was anti-Semitism that I encountered in my own school.</span> <span id="s209">The people who went to the same class with me, same grade -- and personally, I did not suffer because of them -- they joined anti-Semitic groups.</span> <span id="s210">I mentioned to you before, it was officially not permitted while you were in the gymnasium, in high school, to belong to external groups.</span> <span id="s211">You could belong, of course, to youth groups in school, but they would look through -- pretending that they didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s212">The group that these Polish boys joined was almost like an anti-government group, because they were so extreme right and anti-Semitic and anti-everything.</span> <span id="s213">I remember, they could not come out officially while we were still in school, but the minute we graduated…it was May, ’38, and we had to come and register for the military draft for officers’ school.</span> <span id="s214">Jews were not admitted, but they were required to come and register.</span> <span id="s215">Those boys who joined these groups, they had the crossed swords, the symbol of this anti-Semitic organization.</span> <span id="s216">Some of them came out openly anti-Semitic in my class.</span> <span id="s217">It so happened that the teacher -- the home teacher -- was a very fine person.</span> <span id="s218">He ran them down, and he came out on our side, but nevertheless, this was the anti-Semitism that we lived with, within our own class, within our own school, day-in and day-out.</span> <span id="s219">I learned German in school and I read German papers, too, any time I could get hold of one.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: So you were quite well informed?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah, I was very well informed.</span> <span id="s222">I was always interested in reading the newspapers and whatever information I could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: And what were the major sources of your information?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Basically, there was a Jewish paper in Polish – a very good paper called Nasz Przegld.</span> <span id="s225">So that was a good source.</span> <span id="s226">And we had discussions in the youth group I belonged to, whose name was Masada.</span> <span id="s227">We talked about these things.</span> <span id="s228">We had what we called a “live paper” every second Saturday, people would read either informational stories or compilations or summary writings that they themselves would prepare, so it was always lively, and the information was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: It was not as popular as it was later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And did you hear some things indirectly by word of mouth from people who had actual experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s233">We knew for example that we would not dare to go into certain areas of the city where Jews did not live -- not by choice, but because they were not permitted to.</span> <span id="s234">Walking into those areas was something dangerous, because if a Jew was caught, he could be beaten up.</span> <span id="s235">So those were our own personal experiences.</span> <span id="s236">You would walk down the street -- even before Hitler -- and you would be insulted, verbally or otherwise.</span> <span id="s237">We did not realize what was coming in the future, but we could see what was going on in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Aside from the Polish school that you attended, did you have contact with Gentiles in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Only neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did your family do business with Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Sure, they did.</span> <span id="s242">As customers.</span> <span id="s243">There was very little social contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: You never had Gentiles in your home, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I could have had some from my school.</span> <span id="s246">Some friends.</span> <span id="s247">The friendship was very shallow.</span> <span id="s248">I couldn’t say that we were friends, but I got along with the Polish colleagues very well, and as a matter of fact, I have some good memories about two of them, who even helped me on occasions during the war.</span> <span id="s249">Those who were anti-Semites, I had nothing to do with, because I didn’t want to or because they didn’t want to, but those who were more-or-less friendly, we all -- the Jewish boys were only a small number -- would get along with quite well.</span> <span id="s250">But as far as my parents or my sister, she had probably more Gentile friends from school than we had.</span> <span id="s251">But certainly we had Polish neighbors in the same apartment building, and we got along fairly well.</span> <span id="s252">Again, “getting along” was not “close,” because the religious and ethnic differences didn’t allow us to become very, very close.</span> <span id="s253">We were friendly, in that sense, but not really close.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did you have relatives who lived outside of Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, I mentioned before, Lublin, my mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: In other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: They lived in Lublin.</span> <span id="s258">I would go to Lublin quite often -- at least twice a year -- during my winter vacation, summer vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Is that the only place where you had relatives that you were fairly close to?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: That’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: To your knowledge, what happened to them, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well that’s a long story.</span> <span id="s263">Lublin was probably one of the first cities that was affected by the German extermination plan.</span> <span id="s264">During the war, you could not travel.</span> <span id="s265">The last time I was in Lublin -- I don’t know if we can get to this point about traveling when the war started, but the last time I was in Lublin was in 1939.</span> <span id="s266">I had four uncles there, my mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s267">I had my grandparents -- my grandfather actually died in ’38, so my grandmother was still alive -- and then cousins, my uncles’ and aunts’ children.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: How many children were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Six cousins.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother’s sister, the only sister, she emigrated from Poland in 1937, I believe, and went to Argentina.</span> <span id="s271">So she survived the war in Argentina.</span> <span id="s272">But those four uncles and my grandmother were still in Lublin.</span> <span id="s273">And I saw them in ’39.</span> <span id="s274">As the German army was coming close to Radom, I escaped with many, many young Jews who were going east, hoping that the Germans would be stopped and we would be coming back.</span> <span id="s275">But back to your question about the relatives.</span> <span id="s276">Those were the closest relatives on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s277">I did not see them after that, except one uncle who came to Radom.</span> <span id="s278">And he came sort of disguised, because we were already in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s279">He had a very Aryan look, like a German.</span> <span id="s280">He was married to a woman from Radom, so he came, saw us, and saw also his in-laws, but by himself -- he left his wife and his child in Lublin.</span> <span id="s281">He didn’t bring them in; that would have been too dangerous.</span> <span id="s282">I don’t remember how he managed to come the relatively long distance from Lublin to Radom.</span> <span id="s283">It must have been in the summer of ’41.</span> <span id="s284">And then I saw one cousin who escaped from Lublin -- later -- and who was caught in Radom, recognized as a Jew at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s285">He was shot.</span> <span id="s286">It was in ’43, or at the end of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Now in Lublin, at that time, was also a ghetto, and they were liquidating, and they built a camp in Lublin.</span> <span id="s288">It was called Majdanek.</span> <span id="s289">As I found out later, three of my uncles were killed there with their families, except this one cousin who came to Radom, but unfortunately he was caught at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s290">He, too, had a very Aryan look, but the Poles had some kind of sixth sense.</span> <span id="s291">They could tell.</span> <span id="s292">No matter how you looked, no matter what your appearance -- the Germans wouldn’t recognize us.</span> <span id="s293">The Germans could see a Jew and they couldn’t see the difference, whether he’s a Jew or he was a native Christian Pole or whatever.</span> <span id="s294">But a little Pole -- a little ten-year-old Pole -- could point out, “Hey, German, this is a Jew.”</span> <span id="s295">That’s how they were.</span> <span id="s296">And he was pointed out, apparently.</span> <span id="s297">Or else it was such a tight inspection at the railroad station that somehow he was caught.</span> <span id="s298">I never found out how.</span> <span id="s299">But I know because his body was brought in.</span> <span id="s300">At this time it was what we called the “snow” ghetto.</span> <span id="s301">We were already liquidated.</span> <span id="s302">We were just a tiny band left over.</span> <span id="s303">This was the end of ’42, because I remember quite well when he came -- so it’s 40 years ago, in 1942.</span> <span id="s304">I didn’t realize how many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did you have any relatives who served in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: When?</span> <span id="s307">During when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s308">No.</span> <span id="s309">Not this time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Now I’d like to talk much more directly about you and your personal experience.</span> <span id="s311">How did you receive news of the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: You didn’t ask anything about the relatives in Radom, but this is later, because this was on my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: We’ll get to those relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Okay, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s315">The question, “How did I receive the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: How did you receive news of the actual outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, actually, prior to the war breakout itself, we saw what was coming.</span> <span id="s318">It so happened we were in the resort area about thirty or so miles from home called Garbatka.</span> <span id="s319">Jews would go for a summer and rent a house and stay there.</span> <span id="s320">So we were there at Garbatka, and they started calling up reservists -- that was the last two weeks of August in 1939, and we were just almost ready to go back, because my sister had to go back to school.</span> <span id="s321">And besides, this was the end of the season.</span> <span id="s322">So we were getting ready to go back to Radom, and we could see the trains filled with young people.</span> <span id="s323">We knew that young people were being called up and the trains were going.</span> <span id="s324">So, obviously, we could see that tension, and we could understand this, and the government was getting prepared.</span> <span id="s325">Now this was the end of August.</span> <span id="s326">We went home fast.</span> <span id="s327">It was very, very tense.</span> <span id="s328">I can remember on a Friday morning, we heard some sirens.</span> <span id="s329">We didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s330">And all of a sudden we heard rumors that the Germans crossed the borders at eight or ten o’clock in the morning that day.</span> <span id="s331">We thought that these were just false rumors, because with all this tension going on -- people were ripe for rumors.</span> <span id="s332">Anything somebody would come up with, you know, was taken seriously – or else people would disqualify it as another rumor.</span> <span id="s333">Well, it so happened that it was the truth.</span> <span id="s334">And I know, because we listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s335">We tried to confirm it, and sure enough, we found out that this was the truth.</span> <span id="s336">The Germans started to march -- and they never stopped.</span> <span id="s337">So that was Friday the first of September in ’39.</span> <span id="s338">And then, the next day -- Saturday -- everybody was very tense and we were very apprehensive, because are coming the Germans, and what was going to happen to us Jews, especially -- what was going to happen from the Poles, and what was going to happen from the Germans -- we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s339">And we were not prepared, you know.</span> <span id="s340">The young generation didn’t know what the war meant.</span> <span id="s341">The older generation -- the parents -- remembered World War I, and they knew that that was terrible.</span> <span id="s342">It was terrible, but yet they think, “They lived.”</span> <span id="s343">They lived through it.</span> <span id="s344">The areas where they lived changed hands, you know.</span> <span id="s345">First there were the Prussians, then there were the Russians, then they were back to the Prussians -- back and forth -- and if they lived in southern Poland, the Austrians --like in Austria-Hungary, you know -- but even though they were exposed to very difficult conditions, most of the people survived them.</span> <span id="s346">There was none of the official hatred as this was in Germany.</span> <span id="s347">Now here the Germans were coming, and knowing what we knew by then, what they were able to do, we were very scared, but still we hoped that here are the English and the French, and they are so strong, and they are certainly going to be stopping the Germans.</span> <span id="s348">That was the first of September.</span> <span id="s349">September 2nd, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s350">It was Saturday and we were obviously very apprehensive and the mood was very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s351">I can remember -- both in our family and in all Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You were still away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s354">We came back from Garbatka.</span> <span id="s355">Since we saw what was going on, we cut short a few days of our stay and came back.</span> <span id="s356">Anyhow, when the war started, we were home.</span> <span id="s357">And to repeat again, Saturday was a very sad day, too.</span> <span id="s358">And then Sunday morning -- all of a sudden, without any warning, we didn’t know what was going on, again rumors were flying all over the place -- we heard those bombs falling, not far from us, and being curious and being probably unaware of what could happen, I heard that a bomb fell on the viaduct not far from my home, and I ran to see what happened.</span> <span id="s359">And, sure enough, I came upon injured people -- you know, a viaduct goes up like this over the railroad tracks, and there were steps there, and glass was broken, and I can still see it before my eyes - people’s limbs were all torn, and when I saw this, I turned around and ran back home to tell my family to just go down wherever -- there was some basements, dark basements, dirt floors, you probably remember that, that was the cellar, actually -- to go down and everybody, of course went down there, because the bombs fell very, very close from us.</span> <span id="s360">There was just a few of them, and that was the end of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">This was the first real sign to us -- and to me personally.</span> <span id="s362">I saw what it could mean.</span> <span id="s363">Because here is the bomb, here is an injured person, here’s the broken glass and damaged building.</span> <span id="s364">Well that scared me very much.</span> <span id="s365">I had probably very, very strong feelings at that time, but there was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s366">We expected -- I was nineteen -- that the Polish military would call up the young people.</span> <span id="s367">But nothing had happened so far.</span> <span id="s368">Even though I was eligible for that officers’ school and had graduated from high school, they never called me up.</span> <span id="s369">It turned out I was ineligible -- they found ways to make me ineligible, first of all, because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s370">They never called any of the Jews into officers’ school.</span> <span id="s371">Very, very few did in past years, but not in the late ‘30s.</span> <span id="s372">But there’s nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s373">People started buying food as much as they could afford, as much as they could find.</span> <span id="s374">And we were trying to find out from newspapers, from radio, what was going on on the front.</span> <span id="s375">We knew the Germans were marching.</span> <span id="s376">Very soon people started talking again rumors that the Germans would arrest all the young Jews -- not the older, mind you --but the young people who were my age, of military age, because that’s of course the element that could fight them.</span> <span id="s377">They would arrest them and take them away.</span> <span id="s378">So what do you do?</span> <span id="s379">So we start talking -- to your friends, to parents of your friends, my parents, to other friends, and so on and so forth -- and pretty soon you find out what the others intend to do.</span> <span id="s380">We decided to go east -- go ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s381">And by the time we prepared ourselves, it was Wednesday.</span> <span id="s382">Wednesday night, believe it or not, by the late afternoon or evening, we left home, kissing our families and saying “Good-bye” and “Oh, we’ll come back, probably next week.</span> <span id="s383">We’ll come back in two weeks, because the war will stop by that time.”</span> <span id="s384">By the way, the third of September, the very same day when the Germans bombed the place near my home, France and England had declared war on Germany, and they gave the ultimatum for Germans to stop and leave Poland.</span> <span id="s385">Well, I needn’t tell you what Germany thought of this ultimatum.</span> <span id="s386">But we thought that it meant something, and besides, the English and France has got to be stronger than Germany.</span> <span id="s387">And everybody else -- the whole world -- is against Germany, so obviously Germany is going to lose the war and our strong Polish army is so strong that they would, they said, “We won’t give up a button to the Germans.”</span> <span id="s388">It’s funny now, but believe me, in those days, it was very…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: That’s how it seemed.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Certainly.</span> <span id="s391">And we trusted them.</span> <span id="s392">The cavalry -- the horses -- were going to fight the tanks, mind you.</span> <span id="s393">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s394">Interestingly enough, they fought in Warsaw for 26 or 27 days -- longer than any French and any Western Europeans.</span> <span id="s395">If you know the history, that’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s396">Warsaw survived, even though they bombed it to pieces, four weeks, longer than any of the other countries that the Germans invaded.</span> <span id="s397">But we were not taking chances, mind you, and I left home that Wednesday night and we started marching east.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Who were the group of young men like you…</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Young men like me -- and anybody.</span> <span id="s400">Basically we were a group of Jews, because we really didn’t care what the Poles were doing, although a lot of them were going, too -- it was interesting -- those who were not called up -- and few were, ‘cause the Poles were so disorganized, they didn’t know what was going on, and they were so completely confused and probably shocked that I don’t think they called up very many people to begin with.</span> <span id="s401">They had hardly any equipment, and so much sabotage.</span> <span id="s402">You know what a Volksdeutcher is?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Volksdeutcher is the ethnic German.</span> <span id="s405">And every country in Europe had ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s406">And they were the fifth column, a very easy fifth column for Hitler.</span> <span id="s407">They were Poles, and with Polish, Slavic names, but all of a sudden they discovered that they had some German blood, the father was German or the mother was German or somebody, and they declared themselves as being German.</span> <span id="s408">And some of them were really German -- and they were probably spies before.</span> <span id="s409">And they would probably help with signals or any other way.</span> <span id="s410">Later we found out some of them were very beastly pro-Nazis -- but that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So how did this group of people get organized to keep close together?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: There was no organizing.</span> <span id="s413">All they’d say is “I’m going tonight.</span> <span id="s414">Are you going, too?”</span> <span id="s415">“Yes, I am going, too.”</span> <span id="s416">That was the organizing.</span> <span id="s417">There was no leader.</span> <span id="s418">There was no plan.</span> <span id="s419">There was no theme -- there was nothing!</span> <span id="s420">You can’t say it was organized.</span> <span id="s421">Was actually, a disorganized band of people.</span> <span id="s422">And I say “band” because you try to get together with people that you knew, at least walk with them.</span> <span id="s423">You could just shlep along and go.</span> <span id="s424">We didn’t have any hiking boots, any particular equipment or anything.</span> <span id="s425">All they had to do was just say, “Let’s go,” and whoever wanted to join, joined.</span> <span id="s426">There was no leader.</span> <span id="s427">I couldn’t tell you what to do or not to do.</span> <span id="s428">You couldn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s429">We just happened to be comrades in that disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">So where did we go?</span> <span id="s431">We went to country roads -- Poland didn’t have those great highways, you know, in those days -- and it didn’t take us very long to find out the Germans would come down with their airplanes and shoot at us, so we had to lie down in the fields.</span> <span id="s432">By that time -- Friday, I remember, or even Thursday -- we could see planes coming down.</span> <span id="s433">We didn’t have enough Polish planes.</span> <span id="s434">We walked for three and a half days, almost.</span> <span id="s435">It was such a huge mass.</span> <span id="s436">People who had horses and buggies went.</span> <span id="s437">People who had cars, and there weren’t very many, they got stalled, they’d run out of gas.</span> <span id="s438">The cars couldn’t move, because everybody was going on these roads that were supposed to be for the cars and the horses.</span> <span id="s439">It was just unbelievable, and indescribable!</span> <span id="s440">They were honking, they were screaming, “Get out of the way!”</span> <span id="s441">But eventually, as a group, we got to Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">By that time, I hoped we would get there, because at least I knew where I could stay overnight -- and not one night.</span> <span id="s443">So we did get to Lublin, I remember, on Saturday night.</span> <span id="s444">Saturday night was the ninth of September.</span> <span id="s445">It was almost the middle of the night, and part of Lublin was in flames!</span> <span id="s446">I can still see it!</span> <span id="s447">It was burning!</span> <span id="s448">The Germans must have dropped some incendiary bombs.</span> <span id="s449">And by that time, they were very close.</span> <span id="s450">They were eight days, already, away from their border, and nobody stopped them -- until then, anyway.</span> <span id="s451">It so happened that that was the Friday they took Radom, so I escaped two days ahead.</span> <span id="s452">Friday the eighth, they marched into Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Your family was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: My family was still there.</span> <span id="s455">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You were the only one from your family…</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s458">Because this was the idea, that young men should escape, because those are the ones who are most liable to be taken prisoners and put in camps, and prisons, and God knows.</span> <span id="s459">So the parents, with tears in their eyes, and with pain, they said, “Go!</span> <span id="s460">Save yourself!”</span> <span id="s461">So we got to Lublin, and I knew the city, so I had no problem finding my family.</span> <span id="s462">I got a good bed to sleep in and food and everything, and they were, too, anticipating.</span> <span id="s463">I went to my youngest uncle, with whom my grandmother lived -- or he lived with her.</span> <span id="s464">He was married and had a little girl.</span> <span id="s465">This is the one who looked so much Aryan -- he’s the one who came to Radom -- and it so happens that his wife was from Radom, too.</span> <span id="s466">So I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">The Germans came to Lublin a few days later, and I was out in the main street.</span> <span id="s468">By that time, they put out the fires, and things sort of calmed down.</span> <span id="s469">The Germans came to Lublin and I said, “There is no point of running any further, but at least I will stay here and see what happens.”</span> <span id="s470">At first nothing happened.</span> <span id="s471">It’s sort of quiet.</span> <span id="s472">As a matter of fact, I was standing with many people and watching their soldiers marching with their band going down the main street -- the victors, the herenvolk.</span> <span id="s473">You know German?</span> <span id="s474">“Herenvolk is the “Master Race” -- loosely translated.</span> <span id="s475">So nothing happened yet.</span> <span id="s476">Now this was the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, maybe of September.</span> <span id="s477">It so happened that the High holidays were coming upon us, so I stayed over the High Holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and I even went to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s478">At that time the Germans started looking for Jews, and we almost had to hide</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did you have any contact with your family at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No.</span> <span id="s481">There was no contact, no telephone.</span> <span id="s482">We never had a telephone, and besides the telephones -- I don’t think they were in operation to begin with.</span> <span id="s483">The Germans took care of that, so that people would be isolated, so you wouldn’t know what was going on in back of you or in front of you.</span> <span id="s484">As I said, I stayed over the High Holidays, and then I remember being in the city, where I saw a group of Russian officers come to the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Now let me back up a little.</span> <span id="s486">I stayed there maybe two weeks -- I don’t know exactly -- but you know, from history, that the Russians and the Germans made a pact just shortly before the war broke out, and they agreed that the Russians would march into eastern Poland and stop on the river Bug, and the Germans would march to that place and this would be their new border.</span> <span id="s487">And indeed, that’s what they actually did.</span> <span id="s488">I think the sixteenth or so of September and they came over -- it was very easy for them, it was close from the old Russian border -- and they stopped.</span> <span id="s489">But somehow I don’t know why, a Russian officer group came to Lublin, and I saw them there.</span> <span id="s490">And the ironic part was, that people were kissing them, and grabbing them, and lifting them up, and they were happy with them -- the Jewish people were.</span> <span id="s491">They thought, “Boy, the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s492">Maybe the Russians will save us.</span> <span id="s493">Maybe they will chase the Germans out, maybe they’ll make a pact with the Germans and do something.”</span> <span id="s494">People were catching onto anything possible/impossible, hoping that things will be better, although it wasn’t bad yet, because it was just the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">I don’t remember the details, as I said; so many years, it’s what 43 years later?</span> <span id="s496">I must have told my friends that I went with where I was going to be, and we got together again, and we found out that the Russians are already on the Bug and it’s safer to go to the Russian side and escape from the German sector.</span> <span id="s497">Somehow we got out of Lublin.</span> <span id="s498">We again marched, and somehow got on -- I don’t remember how it was -- on a train, or somehow we got to the border and we bumped into the Russians.</span> <span id="s499">It was so fluid.</span> <span id="s500">There was no border yet, because things were going back and forth, so there was no big problem getting to their side at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">: Yom Kippur I was still in Lublin, but on Sukkot I was already in the city of Chelm.</span> <span id="s502">That’s where we wound up, and we even wound up in a home of a Jewish family there!</span> <span id="s503">They fed us.</span> <span id="s504">They gave us fish.</span> <span id="s505">It was just amazing.</span> <span id="s506">We were refugees and they took us in, two or three of us, and the others went to other families.</span> <span id="s507">Again we sort of tried to keep together.</span> <span id="s508">We had to stand in line to get some bread, because at that time the bread lines started building up at the bakeries, and you ate bread just freshly baked -- actually half- baked.</span> <span id="s509">You started feeling the crunch of the war days.</span> <span id="s510">But we were on the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What town was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Chelm.</span> <span id="s513">This was Poland, but the Russians were there, right?</span> <span id="s514">I remember, too, that on the railroad trestle, we encountered a Jew -- an officer in uniform -- and he spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s515">And we spoke to him.</span> <span id="s516">And he told us that the Russians are moving back -- this is just a temporary location for them – and he really praised Russia, and he praised the Moscow subway, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s517">He told how good, really, the Jews have it, and all the good things that the Russians have done, because they remembered under the Czar!</span> <span id="s518">This was in ’39 and the Russian revolution took place in ’17, only twenty-two years before, and he was a young man, and he remembered just like you remember twenty-two years ago in Hungary, and I remember war, years ago in Poland, so naturally the comparison was positive for him!</span> <span id="s519">So he encouraged us to go towards the Russian side.</span> <span id="s520">“Besides,” he said, “The Russians are going to move back and the Germans will come here.”</span> <span id="s521">And he was right, because the river Bug was east of where we were, so we didn’t think twice, and we -- I mean we intended anyway -- and we went further down to a city named Kowel.</span> <span id="s522">And this was already under the Russians, and they were there maybe a week or two weeks already when we got there.</span> <span id="s523">It was a town where there were at least half Jewish and half non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s524">It’s a small town in the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s525">Now it’s part of Russia, like the whole eastern part of Poland is Russia.</span> <span id="s526">The further I got away, the less chances I had to know about my family, and the less chances they had to hear from me.</span> <span id="s527">And besides, it didn’t really matter how close I was, there was no communication, there was no letter writing, there was no post office, there was no telephone, there was no any way to just communicate with them.</span> <span id="s528">This was the end of my going east – Kowel.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Now there I started appearing that I was a real refugee, because being a small town, and then the town filled up with people -- and where do you put up those people?</span> <span id="s530">They started putting up food kitchens, and there was no place to stay overnight!</span> <span id="s531">It was really bad.</span> <span id="s532">Eventually I left the place.</span> <span id="s533">I found a friend of mine who lives in Israel now -- he had some relatives there -- and we decided to go to the big city!</span> <span id="s534">Lemberg.</span> <span id="s535">Today it’s Lvov.</span> <span id="s536">It’s in southeastern Poland.</span> <span id="s537">Today it’s not Poland anymore.</span> <span id="s538">It’s the Ukraine, and Lvov is the main city in the Ukraine -- a big, beautiful city.</span> <span id="s539">Well, the conditions in Lvov were not very good either, but at least it was a big city.</span> <span id="s540">But if you didn’t have any money, you were just really out of luck.</span> <span id="s541">You had to find how to get along, you know.</span> <span id="s542">I found my uncle -- my father’s brother – there.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: You just bumped into them?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Somehow I found them.</span> <span id="s545">Frankly I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s546">The only way you could find out -- by the grapevine.</span> <span id="s547">Somebody from Radom saw you, and you start asking questions, “Who did you see?</span> <span id="s548">Who came?</span> <span id="s549">Who’s gone?”</span> <span id="s550">And little by little, you find out from one to the next, and somehow I must have found out about my relatives -- my father’s brother and two or three of his cousins.</span> <span id="s551">I moved in with them, in a cold room, I remember.</span> <span id="s552">My aim was to register -- to try to get into the Institute of Technology in Lvov.</span> <span id="s553">I wanted to go either there, or to some university -- there was a famous university in Lvov, too.</span> <span id="s554">Poland has two I.T.’s only, one in Lvov and one in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s555">And it was always my desire to go to an I.T. if I could get in.</span> <span id="s556">I tried and I did manage to get into a dormitory.</span> <span id="s557">It was a part of the I.T. in Lvov.</span> <span id="s558">Now this is ironic, because the dormitory was the hotbed of anti-Semitism in Lvov before the war.</span> <span id="s559">As I mentioned to you before, for a Jew to walk in a certain area of Radom was like taking his life in his hands, and this was worse!</span> <span id="s560">Much worse!</span> <span id="s561">Because students who were part of the anti-Semitic group -- they were the worst.</span> <span id="s562">This very dorm was one of the worst known in Poland.</span> <span id="s563">Under the Russians, of course, all of a sudden, things turned around, and a lot, not me only -- but a lot of people who had credentials moved in to prepare themselves to take a test to be admitted to the Institute of Technology.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So things in Lvov, they were still fairly calm.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: They were calm, and we were calm, because by that time the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s566">You didn’t have to be afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s567">The only problem was that you didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s568">You didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s569">You didn’t have any clothing, really, because when I ran away from home, you know how much you could carry, and besides, you thought you went for three days, and you will come back, so there’s no point in carrying anything.</span> <span id="s570">So in that respect, you were just a real refugee with nothing on you.</span> <span id="s571">And so we did all kinds of things -- little jobs, or, I remember, one of the things I did -- and not only I, but many people did -- there was a liqueur factory in Lvov, and you would stand in line, early in the morning, and they will sell you a bottle or two -- or maybe just one per person.</span> <span id="s572">And what would you do?</span> <span id="s573">You would go out and sell the bottle and make a few zlotys.</span> <span id="s574">That was how you kept going.</span> <span id="s575">So it was tough.</span> <span id="s576">This was the end of October and the beginning of November, and all of a sudden I heard that there is a train going from Bug to the German side.</span> <span id="s577">That was a free day.</span> <span id="s578">They were going to allow people to go back.</span> <span id="s579">There were a lot of refugees that went back -- women and children -- not Jews only, because a lot of Poles run away, too, especially military personnel, government personnel.</span> <span id="s580">The government of Poland told them, “Go east.</span> <span id="s581">We will come back in a few days or in a week.”</span> <span id="s582">It didn’t work out that way, so all these people wanted to go back home .</span> <span id="s583">To them the Germans were also an unknown, but they were not afraid that they will do something with them!</span> <span id="s584">So, anyhow, a few friends came over and say, “What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s585">Here we can go back officially, legally, back home.”</span> <span id="s586">And just like I -- the others were all separated from the families -- we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s587">Here I was, sort of debating to go to school, but you never knew what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s588">We didn’t trust that the situation between the Germans and the Russians was going to be stabilized.</span> <span id="s589">Somehow, we had some kind of feeling this was not the end, you know, even though the Germans and the Russians took over Poland.</span> <span id="s590">And then later on we found out the Russians didn’t want these refugees.</span> <span id="s591">They started sending people away into Russia, and that is what scared us -- I won’t say even more, but scared us just as much.</span> <span id="s592">We didn’t know where we were going to be sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">So, when this opportunity came, a few of us decided to go back and say, “if we can, maybe we can come back, somehow, smuggle ourselves back.”</span> <span id="s594">Well, it was maybe the right thing, or the wrong -- I don’t know -- but we did get on that train.</span> <span id="s595">That train took us all the way from Lvov to Lublin.</span> <span id="s596">I saw my relatives -- that was the last time I saw them -- and then from Lublin, I had to go back to Radom.</span> <span id="s597">In order to get from Lublin to Radom, you had to go to a place on the Vistula and cross and then take another train, but the Vistula bridges were all bombed out, so there was no connection.</span> <span id="s598">You had to go on the pontoon.</span> <span id="s599">And sitting in this railroad station called Denbrey -- am I telling you too many details?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I was sitting in a corner, and a little Polish boy came with a German.</span> <span id="s602">He was looking at all the faces, so we split up -- the three or four of us -- so we would not be obviously visible, you know, all together.</span> <span id="s603">So I was sitting by myself and that little kid came over and pointed to the German that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s604">And through more guts and gall, I pulled out an I.D. from my high school.</span> <span id="s605">First I pretended I didn’t know what he was talking.</span> <span id="s606">I knew German, but I pretended complete ignorance.</span> <span id="s607">I showed him the I.D. I said, “Here!”</span> <span id="s608">And he saw on my I.D. “Israel.”</span> <span id="s609">He didn’t even look -- just walked away.</span> <span id="s610">He would have beaten me up and God knows what he could have done with me directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So he saw that your name was Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: He didn’t look at it.</span> <span id="s613">Just the fact that -- through sort of chutzpah, you know, he just let me be.</span> <span id="s614">I came home, finally.</span> <span id="s615">My parents were glad to see me.</span> <span id="s616">They said, “You came at the wrong time, because they are arresting people.”</span> <span id="s617">I came the ninth of November, and the eleventh of November was a Polish holiday.</span> <span id="s618">It’s an Independence Day -- just like in this county Armistice Day.</span> <span id="s619">World War I ended on November 11th, so that’s the Polish Independence Day, believe it or not!</span> <span id="s620">He said, “They are arresting people.</span> <span id="s621">They are looking again.</span> <span id="s622">God knows what things happen!</span> <span id="s623">You should have stayed where you were!”</span> <span id="s624">I said, “How did I know?</span> <span id="s625">So okay, maybe I’ll go back.”</span> <span id="s626">Well, I stayed a short time.</span> <span id="s627">We had to hide!</span> <span id="s628">By that time they started…</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Where did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Well we would not go out of the house, okay?</span> <span id="s631">We were locking the doors.</span> <span id="s632">The Germans would go to houses -- not every house -- and knock on the door and scream and call people out, say, “Come out!</span> <span id="s633">Get out!”</span> <span id="s634">Or sometimes they’ll break down the doors.</span> <span id="s635">Well this was the beginning.</span> <span id="s636">They would grab people on the street, “Who are you?</span> <span id="s637">Are you a Jew?</span> <span id="s638">Come to some work.</span> <span id="s639">We need --“ They’d clean out latrines -- or any kind of things like that.</span> <span id="s640">But it was not a general thing -- just a little bit yet.</span> <span id="s641">Well, I stayed over the eleventh at home.</span> <span id="s642">And one day my father came home and said such-and-such -- whatever his name was -- “He wants to get out of here.</span> <span id="s643">He’s ready to hire a taxi and he made some arrangement with somebody that he wants to go over the river Bug -- to a city, Berdyachev, and he thought maybe you want to go with him, because you are there already.</span> <span id="s644">Maybe you can be helpful.”</span> <span id="s645">“I can be helpful?</span> <span id="s646">I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s647">“You want me to go?”</span> <span id="s648">So I said, “Okay, you don’t want me to be here because it’s dangerous, so I’ll leave.”</span> <span id="s649">And I did.</span> <span id="s650">And it was kind of a risky enterprise, really, but we made it.</span> <span id="s651">We made it across and it didn’t take very long and I was again on the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Who was this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: He was a man who was a store owner of some kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Oh, yeah, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s656">He was willing to pay for a few people to just go with him.</span> <span id="s657">It was not a matter that he paid, but he already had made the arrangements, and he took me.</span> <span id="s658">My parents were glad to see me go again, because they were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Was there food in this…</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: There was still food, yeah.</span> <span id="s661">Pretty soon after, they came out with the ration cards, and the Jewish ration cards were shown with a Mogen David, and the rations were smaller than the general rations.</span> <span id="s662">But when I got back in November the food was still available.</span> <span id="s663">People were hoarding, it was hard to get certain items, but it was still possible.</span> <span id="s664">And it was only September, October, November -- only the third month, and not quite -- maybe two months only, and so people had some supplies of their own from before, and they were buying all during this time, so it was not terrible yet, you know, it became later, but at this time, it wasn’t so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So you were back on the other side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: I didn’t stay home very long.</span> <span id="s667">Maybe a week, and then I was gone again.</span> <span id="s668">And again I had no contact with my family.</span> <span id="s669">I eventually wound up much north of Lvov, in Brest Litovsk.</span> <span id="s670">It means “Lithuanian Breast.”</span> <span id="s671">But actually in Poland it was a little different name: Brest Litevski -- Brest Libuggen.</span> <span id="s672">Again it’s in Russia now, the Russian side.</span> <span id="s673">It so happened that I had been in this place before the war, but that’s beside the point.</span> <span id="s674">So I went south to Lvov.</span> <span id="s675">I couldn’t get back into this dorm anymore.</span> <span id="s676">The term was over with the tests and all that, so it was too late.</span> <span id="s677">So I enlisted in something else.</span> <span id="s678">Well, then, I couldn’t find an apartment until I found my uncle.</span> <span id="s679">See, when I came home they said that Uncle Henry and the two cousins -- they left, too.</span> <span id="s680">And then I started looking for them -- I think that’s probably what happened -- and I found them!</span> <span id="s681">That time we found an apartment up high in some building.</span> <span id="s682">Then December came -- it was a terribly cold winter -- and January.</span> <span id="s683">You would leave a cup of water on the table, and you would wake up in the morning and it was solid ice!</span> <span id="s684">That’s how bad it was!</span> <span id="s685">Things were getting worse and worse and then we heard a lot of people being sent deep into Russia!</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: By the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: By the Russians!</span> <span id="s688">They’d send them to coal mines!</span> <span id="s689">Into the Donets Basin.</span> <span id="s690">There were a lot of coal mines there, and other hard work.</span> <span id="s691">And gee, what’s going to happen?</span> <span id="s692">Again, our parents will never hear from us!</span> <span id="s693">So again, a group of us started talking, “What are we going to do!</span> <span id="s694">Maybe we should go back!</span> <span id="s695">When we were there it wasn’t so bad.”</span> <span id="s696">Now this was the bad part -- “bad” in a sense -- very uncomfortable and very uncertain.</span> <span id="s697">But nobody realized that things were going to get worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s698">So, seeing what we did, it didn’t look so terrible!</span> <span id="s699">So we said, “Here we don’t have a place to stay, we don’t have any food, we don’t have any money, we may end up in a coal mine, we may end up in Siberia, who knows?”</span> <span id="s700">It would have been a salvation in a way, you know, but then again, you are without your family.</span> <span id="s701">So we decided to go back.</span> <span id="s702">But this time, we did not have an open border where we could just go get on a train, and the Germans let you go.</span> <span id="s703">We started looking for a way to go back, and we found somebody -- and again I don’t remember the details because it’s so long ago.</span> <span id="s704">You had to go to a border place on the river, and some local person who knows the area will tell you how to get across and not be caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s705">Now this was January, 1940.</span> <span id="s706">It was one of the most horrible winters, a lot of snow and very, very cold, just like the Minnesota winters.</span> <span id="s707">When there’s a war, maybe you know -- everything is bad!</span> <span id="s708">And that includes the weather!</span> <span id="s709">No kidding!</span> <span id="s710">It seems like every winter during the six years of war was bad.</span> <span id="s711">So anyhow, we had to pay this so-called “guide.”</span> <span id="s712">We met him in a bar on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s713">It turned out he was not a Jew, he was a Ukrainian!</span> <span id="s714">He could have lead us right to the Germans!</span> <span id="s715">He probably knew that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s716">So here he tells us to cross, three or four of us.</span> <span id="s717">He described how to get across, how to go this way, to the right, and to the left, and we had to be on the opposite side before eight o’clock, because this was the curfew hour.</span> <span id="s718">If they catch you a minute after, they shoot.</span> <span id="s719">They don’t ask you who you are -- regardless of whether you are running across the border or not!</span> <span id="s720">This was one of the really bad experiences during my life.</span> <span id="s721">We had to cross with snow this high!</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: To your chest!</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: To my chest!</span> <span id="s724">And I had two little packages.</span> <span id="s725">I tried to carry my things back with me wrapped in some green paper, I remember.</span> <span id="s726">And I tried to carry that warm coat, too.</span> <span id="s727">I was sweating -- I was hot -- I had to pull out my leg from snow, just step by step!</span> <span id="s728">Finally all of us came across the river, and as we got there, “Halt!</span> <span id="s729">Halt!</span> <span id="s730">Halt!”</span> <span id="s731">A German soldier!</span> <span id="s732">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s733">He didn’t notice us crossing, but somehow he came along from some little town.</span> <span id="s734">We pretended we didn’t understand what he was saying, so he showed us the watch, and we said, “Yes, yes.”</span> <span id="s735">And we ran.</span> <span id="s736">A woman was looking out the windows, and she saw us coming -- it was a fairly bright night -- and she opened the door.</span> <span id="s737">Would you believe, I knocked on the door, she let us in -- let us sleep in the barn -- even gave us milk?</span> <span id="s738">She didn’t know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s739">The next day we rented a horse and buggy and we got away from the border, so it would not be suspicious, because we were strangers in this place.</span> <span id="s740">And little by little we finally made it back to Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: How did you manage?</span> <span id="s742">You had enough money to hire a carriage or…</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: A carriage, rather than the trains, because that was more obvious.</span> <span id="s744">On the train we’d have been more recognized, but we were going in a small group, in - you say “carriage”, but it’s a horse and buggy, really -- from place to place.</span> <span id="s745">And we finally made it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: What did you see as you crossed?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well, the bridges were still in ruins -- broken up, you know.</span> <span id="s748">The Poles did that when they were retreating.</span> <span id="s749">Life in the rural areas -- it probably wasn’t any different.</span> <span id="s750">Everything was at a standstill, so you couldn’t see much.</span> <span id="s751">We didn’t go to any stores.</span> <span id="s752">Basically we kept to ourselves, and we did not want to get involved with anybody.</span> <span id="s753">And once we got back home, well, again, there was the question of what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s754">Now we’re not “we” anymore, we’re “I”, you see, because everybody went to his own family…</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Your family was still living in their house?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: This was the beginning of 1940, and we were living in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s757">There was no problem of moving out yet -- that came a little later.</span> <span id="s758">So the question was getting another job.</span> <span id="s759">But things were getting tougher -- as far as food was concerned, as far as safety and security were concerned.</span> <span id="s760">And the worse part again, as far as I was concerned, is that people of my age were required to report to work.</span> <span id="s761">And what happened then, too, is that the Germans ordered the Jewish community to organize.</span> <span id="s762">Well, the community was organized, in a way.</span> <span id="s763">But they told the leaders to organize for a certain purpose!</span> <span id="s764">Like delivering a number of workers every morning for the Germans, for their purposes – let’s say 200, and then 300, 500.</span> <span id="s765">I don’t know the numbers exactly, but obviously, somebody had to be in charge.</span> <span id="s766">And pretty soon, they organized what they called the Eldestenrat.</span> <span id="s767">The English word for it is the Council of Elders.</span> <span id="s768">Not that they had to be older people, but the seniors.</span> <span id="s769">And so those people had to organize, and they organized into different departments.</span> <span id="s770">Now the Jewish community was organized already.</span> <span id="s771">They had a Rabbinate, and they had a welfare department, and they had a lot of different departments, but those were not what the Germans were after, but the Jews were wanting those departments, so those departments and a few that the Germans ordered were put together – probably in a different framework -- and that’s how it started to function.</span> <span id="s772">Now, as I said before, my age group -- let’s say from sixteen to maybe fifty, and even sixty later -- was always an endangered species (especially the younger ones, because they wanted the young ones to come and work.</span> <span id="s773">And the Jewish community was required to make them available.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Were you recruited as part of the labor group?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I was recruited, but fortunately, I also found some jobs.</span> <span id="s776">I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s777">Eventually I was working in the community.</span> <span id="s778">I was more -- well, let’s say intelligent, bright.</span> <span id="s779">I could be a good clerk, so I did find a job.</span> <span id="s780">They had to organize for different purposes, so the need for people like this also increased.</span> <span id="s781">I worked in different places.</span> <span id="s782">I remember, eventually, I did get a clerical job there.</span> <span id="s783">I worked in what they called the “labor department”.</span> <span id="s784">I worked in the “housing department” because Jews, even though we were still living in our former apartments, houses, there were certain areas where the Germans would come in and tell the Jews to get out!</span> <span id="s785">They liked their apartments, or they wanted to live in that particular area, and for a Jew who owned this apartment or lived in that apartment, there was no recourse.</span> <span id="s786">The Germans would take it and that was it.</span> <span id="s787">But if he was “nice enough” not to take it right away -- they’d say.</span> <span id="s788">“I want this apartment tomorrow,” or “I want this apartment in three days,’ and “a week” was very nice -- that family had to go and live someplace else, so somebody had to assign an apartment.</span> <span id="s789">Now you would not go and rent another apartment, because there was a lot of Polish refugees who came from the western parts of Poland to Radom, and they had priority.</span> <span id="s790">The Polish administration gave them apartments, and they would take even the Jewish apartments, too.</span> <span id="s791">So there were more and more Jews who needed apartments.</span> <span id="s792">And you couldn’t just say, “I want a three room apartment,” or a “five room apartment,” or “two room apartment.”</span> <span id="s793">You were assigned.</span> <span id="s794">You were assigned a room, you were assigned two rooms, depending on the number of people, so things were getting really tough!</span> <span id="s795">Crowded!</span> <span id="s796">You were lucky if you were not kicked out of the apartment.</span> <span id="s797">And if you were, you were lucky if you could find something that was half suitable!</span> <span id="s798">We were still in ours; we didn’t have the biggest apartment, but it was ours and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Now, as long as we are speaking about apartments, this was February, March of 1940.</span> <span id="s800">The end of ’40, the beginning of ’14, there came a decree that Jews have to move out of all areas of Radom and move into a particular area which would become the ghetto.</span> <span id="s801">Now it so happened that Radom was a peculiar city in the respect that Radom had gotten not one ghetto, but two.</span> <span id="s802">For the simple reason that the area that they wanted to assign to the ghetto was not large enough to accommodate everybody -- perhaps because Jews lived all over the city -- what the Germans decided to do is to make what was known later as the Large Ghetto and the Small Ghetto.</span> <span id="s803">The Large Ghetto was around the Jewish institutions -- the two large synagogues, huge synagogues, where the majority of Jews lived.</span> <span id="s804">Unfortunately, some of these areas were very dilapidated, and naturally they added all dilapidated areas and said, “You have to live there.”</span> <span id="s805">Now the Small Ghetto was in a completely different area.</span> <span id="s806">It was closer to the area where I lived, where the bombing took place.</span> <span id="s807">It was probably more of a Polish area.</span> <span id="s808">So we wound up in April of 1941, living in two ghettos.</span> <span id="s809">My family had to move out of their apartment, and we moved to a place, we called it an apartment -- in the Large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s810">At that time I was working for the community and that was where I wanted to be, because my place of work was there.</span> <span id="s811">Later I wound up working in the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s812">I had to take the bike back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: This was in February or March?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No, this was in April ’41.</span> <span id="s815">15 of February, everybody had to be in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s816">Anybody caught outside the ghetto will be shot and that was as explicit as you could get.</span> <span id="s817">“Will be shot” was their way of…</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: How did the actual movement of the ghetto take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Well, it obviously took months.</span> <span id="s820">They gave us a fairly good amount of time, and said, “Here” -- let’s say January 1st -- by April 15th.”</span> <span id="s821">You have three and a half months.</span> <span id="s822">So this department of housing -- the Jewish department -- had to assign certain places, and it was a tremendous job, you understand.</span> <span id="s823">People were moving out from all over the city and they had to move into this area.</span> <span id="s824">The Poles moved out from there and they were getting a good deal, because they were getting good apartments -- either it was an exchange with a Jewish apartment or they moved wherever they wanted.</span> <span id="s825">So we had to move now.</span> <span id="s826">Needless to say, the ghetto was so small, and they tried to get in a large number of people.</span> <span id="s827">Just an intelligent guess, the Large ghetto had probably about -- with people who came in from other places, too -- maybe 25,000 people, the Small Ghetto perhaps about 10,000, 11,000 people.</span> <span id="s828">The available room was, by far, for less people than that, so they assigned a room for a family.</span> <span id="s829">So you had three families living in one apartment, because this family had a room, and this family had a room, this one had a room -- or single people, whatever.</span> <span id="s830">It was just indescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Before you arrived in the ghetto, what were your and your families’ expectations about the meaning of this deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: There was no deportation yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: I meant the movement into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: In addition to the ghetto there were arrests.</span> <span id="s835">It was not just a simple thing that “Here we all are in God’s Paradise now that we’re inside the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s836">The Germans came in September first, and then I saw them in November, and I said, “It wasn’t so bad.”</span> <span id="s837">From November till January when I came back in ’41 things got gradually worse.</span> <span id="s838">People were arrested, people were beaten, people were kicked, people were put away someplace -- nobody knew where -- and they showed up beaten up, without hair.</span> <span id="s839">All kinds of things happened.</span> <span id="s840">Stores were taken away and given to Poles.</span> <span id="s841">Jewish stores -- my father’s store or others -- they were unsafe!</span> <span id="s842">If a German would come in and say, “I want this material!</span> <span id="s843">You couldn’t say, “Pay me for it.”</span> <span id="s844">He would take it and go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Now, this was relatively easy and not dangerous, but more and more things were happening.</span> <span id="s846">There was never a standstill, say, “Okay.</span> <span id="s847">Now we reached a plateau and nothing is going to be any worse.”</span> <span id="s848">There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s849">Every day, every week, things were worse, worse and worse.</span> <span id="s850">We thought, “Oh!</span> <span id="s851">It can’t be any worse!”</span> <span id="s852">It got worse, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s853">In between were stages where there was no food, there were other difficulties.</span> <span id="s854">People lost jobs.</span> <span id="s855">You had no jobs, you had no money.</span> <span id="s856">So when we got to the ghetto we said, “This is going to be the worst, probably.</span> <span id="s857">Nothing worse will happen.”</span> <span id="s858">Okay.</span> <span id="s859">So what is the ghetto?</span> <span id="s860">The ghetto is that we move, first of all, from a fairly comfortable place to a very uncomfortable place!</span> <span id="s861">Even if you have a family of wife and children and lived at your parents, things don’t always get along -- so you can imagine with strangers how things go!</span> <span id="s862">You use the same kitchen.</span> <span id="s863">They cook something, or else you -- I mean, I don’t need to tell you!</span> <span id="s864">Those are the difficulties.</span> <span id="s865">And everybody is high strung, obviously because there is no food, maybe there is no heat.</span> <span id="s866">All these things are obviously going on your nerves and on your entire behavior!</span> <span id="s867">You considered yourself lucky if you found yourself a good room together with nice people that you could get along, so that was the good thing!</span> <span id="s868">The bad thing?</span> <span id="s869">We lived in a ghetto!</span> <span id="s870">You know what a ghetto is?</span> <span id="s871">You could not leave the place!</span> <span id="s872">Alright?</span> <span id="s873">The only time you could leave, the only reason you could leave, is to go to work.</span> <span id="s874">You went through a gate or a certain place, lined up at six o’clock in the morning, or five-thirty with a column of workers, Jewish policemen around you and sometimes SS policemen, sometimes Polish policemen, and you marched to your place of work.</span> <span id="s875">You couldn’t get out of line.</span> <span id="s876">And at six o’clock in the evening you marched back!</span> <span id="s877">Alright?</span> <span id="s878">During the day they’ll bring you some watery soup and something -- a piece of bread or else, at that time maybe, you’ll take your own piece of bread along -- and that was the day.</span> <span id="s879">Then you come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s880">And in the ghetto, the curfew was nine o’clock or eight o’clock and you had to stay inside.</span> <span id="s881">Okay.</span> <span id="s882">All of a sudden you hear shots in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s883">You are scared to death because you know where the shots are coming from.</span> <span id="s884">You get sick.</span> <span id="s885">You need to go to a doctor, the doctors can’t help you very much.</span> <span id="s886">It so happened in the Large Ghetto there was a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s887">My mother had appendicitis.</span> <span id="s888">She was taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s889">I remember she was operated on the very same day the Germans invaded Russia.</span> <span id="s890">When I say “Russia,” they crossed the Bug borders; that border was never really stable, and the Germans marched right through there, and they started the war with Russia.</span> <span id="s891">22nd, I think, of June!</span> <span id="s892">That’s tomorrow!</span> <span id="s893">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s894">It was ’41.</span> <span id="s895">So tomorrow is the anniversary, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: So your mother was operated on?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: She was operated on at the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s898">They had the Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s899">It was the only place they could do it, because they wouldn’t let them out of the ghetto, either.</span> <span id="s900">You could get out of the ghetto if you had a special pass.</span> <span id="s901">You could go from one ghetto to the other if you had a pass.</span> <span id="s902">I did!</span> <span id="s903">I had a pass.</span> <span id="s904">I had a bike!</span> <span id="s905">I could bike back and forth.</span> <span id="s906">If somebody stopped you, you had a pass, then you were safe.</span> <span id="s907">That doesn’t mean that somebody couldn’t stop you, a German, and ask for a pass and knock your teeth out!</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: What happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Well, she was operated on, she came through all right.</span> <span id="s910">She was the only person from my family who survived the war, by the way.</span> <span id="s911">But that’s a later story.</span> <span id="s912">So you see, when you said before about deportations, there was no deportation yet.</span> <span id="s913">The only deportations were from the ghetto later on, and they started arresting, not individuals, but groups of people.</span> <span id="s914">Once we were concentrated in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s915">The Germans had the idea too -- they had all of us together.</span> <span id="s916">Anything they wanted to do, they could do -- all wholesale!</span> <span id="s917">Anything they wanted to take away from us, they could take wholesale!</span> <span id="s918">All they had to do was say, “if you are caught outside the ghetto you are shot!”</span> <span id="s919">Well, people don’t want to get shot, so, obviously you stick in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s920">One day they came out and said, “Anybody who has fur coats or any kind of furs has to deliver them to such-and-such a place.</span> <span id="s921">Anybody who after this date is caught hoarding the fur coats” --that was your own, you paid for it --“will be shot!”</span> <span id="s922">On location.</span> <span id="s923">Anything they did, anything they wanted, the threat was, “will be shot.”</span> <span id="s924">And then they did!</span> <span id="s925">It was not an empty threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Another time they said, “Anybody who has bikes has to deliver the bikes to such-and-such a place.’</span> <span id="s927">Well what do you think I had to do with the bike?</span> <span id="s928">I had to go, give it away.</span> <span id="s929">No more bike.</span> <span id="s930">Anybody had horses -- and there were some horses -- had to give the horses.</span> <span id="s931">No more horses in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s932">Those were the things going on, day-in, day-out.</span> <span id="s933">In addition, the sanitary conditions in the ghetto were so bad -- so horrible -- that typhoid reigned in certain areas at some times, and people were sick, like a plague.</span> <span id="s934">You couldn’t do much about it.</span> <span id="s935">Even the doctors, they couldn’t really cope.</span> <span id="s936">The Germans are basically a clean people, and they would not come close to us.</span> <span id="s937">They would come to the ghetto, but they put signs outside the ghetto --“krankheitgefar” -- that means “the threat of a plague” or a disease.</span> <span id="s938">There were signs all around so that nobody, supposedly would come in.</span> <span id="s939">On the other hand, the Jews always found some contacts -- I shouldn’t say “always” -- that Poles will come through ghetto.</span> <span id="s940">Now let me just describe the ghetto.</span> <span id="s941">The ghetto was boarded up and a fence was put, but on the other side of the fence were living people -- non-Jews - so there was some connection.</span> <span id="s942">Others took a risk and came because they wanted the Jewish money.</span> <span id="s943">So they would bring a bread, and the bread that they paid, let’s say a dollar, they’ll take two dollars.</span> <span id="s944">The Jews didn’t have zlotys to pay for things, they would pay in jewelry, other things, to buy food.</span> <span id="s945">Or some of the were trying to buy passes, for example -- not passes to get out, but I.D.’s that a Jew needed to escape out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s946">Some managed, and some did not.</span> <span id="s947">Some smuggling was into the ghettos -- even coffee, and certain luxury items could come in -- but this was the rarity.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Well, what happened to you after this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: That period led eventually to what they called deportation.</span> <span id="s950">Now, we lived in the ghetto -- two ghettos -- from April 15, 1941 till August, 1942.</span> <span id="s951">There are two dates in August where events are meaningful.</span> <span id="s952">The first one was, I think, August 4th and 5th, in the middle of the night, where the first big deportation took place.</span> <span id="s953">What they did, they surrounded the two ghettos with SS troopers, Polish police, with Ukrainians -- I don’t know if you know this, but Ukrainians were very good helpers to the Germans.</span> <span id="s954">They were very good executioners.</span> <span id="s955">They were volunteers.</span> <span id="s956">They were getting probably good food, and maybe Jewish money, and they always loved Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s957">Nothing new to them, so they very gladly were helping the Germans to do their dirty work.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">They surrounded the two ghettos.</span> <span id="s959">Now, what they did first is, they went to the Small Ghetto, and they emptied it completely.</span> <span id="s960">Right?</span> <span id="s961">Now I was called in as a work detail.</span> <span id="s962">And working in administration, I went out with a group of about eighty, a hundred, maybe, young people.</span> <span id="s963">We were taken at the early morning hours, like four o’clock.</span> <span id="s964">I was dragged out of bed and taken with a whole group of people, with Jewish policemen, marching toward the Small Ghetto to clean out, to drag out the stuff.</span> <span id="s965">To carry bodies, you know.</span> <span id="s966">They did a lot of shooting.</span> <span id="s967">Ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the people were taken by trains, put on the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s968">And five percent, maybe, were shot right there.</span> <span id="s969">They had to put the bodies on buggies.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: This was part of your job.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: That was the job.</span> <span id="s972">We carried out things -- I was trying to stay away from bodies if I could -- and put the bodies on those carriages and then pushed the carriages.</span> <span id="s973">And they were buried in a mass grave.</span> <span id="s974">I was taken to that mass grave, and we were standing there.</span> <span id="s975">And other people - I was not in the group -- who were burying were people from the very same ghetto.</span> <span id="s976">The younger people were left there to help bury.</span> <span id="s977">There were lots of people.</span> <span id="s978">Two huge trenches were dug out, as I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s979">And they put layer and layer of dead bodies, they had to be undressed -- man and woman, it didn’t make any difference -- they undressed them.</span> <span id="s980">They filled up the bottom of the trench.</span> <span id="s981">They poured calcium on top of it.</span> <span id="s982">So when they decomposed, you know, to prevent disease and the smell and God knows what.</span> <span id="s983">And they put another layer on it, and they covered up with dirt.</span> <span id="s984">That time, I managed somehow to get away.</span> <span id="s985">I walked back with the bad news.</span> <span id="s986">Well people knew what happened, and my parents didn’t know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s987">I was worried about them, and they were worried about me, because they took a group of young people to do something -- they never told us what -- you never knew whether these people may come back or not.</span> <span id="s988">That was the situation.</span> <span id="s989">So, naturally, parents worried.</span> <span id="s990">They could take us to another city even.</span> <span id="s991">You never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">I’m jumping ahead.</span> <span id="s993">There were cases where people were taken away.</span> <span id="s994">You heard about “Zonderkommando?’</span> <span id="s995">Zonderkommando means a commando of a zone or something special -- special tasks to perform.</span> <span id="s996">They didn’t want you to tell anybody else, so they finished that group, too.</span> <span id="s997">That’s how it worked, okay?</span> <span id="s998">Well, anyhow I managed to get away from it -- from that grave - and I saw some Germans shooting right there.</span> <span id="s999">So I came back to my ghetto -- from the Small Ghetto to the Big Ghetto -- in the night.</span> <span id="s1000">While our column was marching up to this other ghetto, the people who were selected to remain -- not to be shipped away, to be deported -- came to the Large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1001">Those were young people who were capable of performing work, and those people remained.</span> <span id="s1002">You heard about the selections?</span> <span id="s1003">They selected.</span> <span id="s1004">In this case they elected.</span> <span id="s1005">“You are strong, you are young, you go to the left.</span> <span id="s1006">You, go to the right.’</span> <span id="s1007">And so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">They brought down maybe a thousand people out of the ten thousand or so, and the rest of the ghetto was deported, and some of them were killed, as I just mentioned.</span> <span id="s1009">So that was my experience with that.</span> <span id="s1010">The next day, we thought, “That was it.</span> <span id="s1011">Not for today.”</span> <span id="s1012">But it wasn’t because when they had put the people on the train, the train was not filled up, really.</span> <span id="s1013">So they came back to the Big Ghetto, and they grabbed more people without practically any selection, and they took them away and filled up the trains.</span> <span id="s1014">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s1015">Because they didn’t have the quota!</span> <span id="s1016">That was August 4th or 5th deportation.</span> <span id="s1017">So the Small Ghetto was no more.</span> <span id="s1018">There was only the Big Ghetto, and part of the people from there were taken away, too.</span> <span id="s1019">Two weeks later, the 16th, the 17th, the 18th -- I say the three dates because they always did it at night -- it was a Sunday night to Monday, Monday night to Tuesday, and they did the same thing with the Large Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1020">That was the time when my family went, because you see, by that time, my uncle, whom I saw in Lvov, he came back and he went.</span> <span id="s1021">His wife, my aunts and my own father and my own sister.</span> <span id="s1022">And again I was spared at that time, and my mother who worked -- they had shops for the Germans, and she was one of the people who worked in these shops -- they didn’t select them.</span> <span id="s1023">They left them in the shops and they were spared, because the Germans still needed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: So who did they take from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: My father was taken and my sister.</span> <span id="s1026">And my sister, there was a sad story, because she was with a group of people who worked for the German administration.</span> <span id="s1027">They administered Jewish real estate.</span> <span id="s1028">You see, the Germans had taken away all the real estate.</span> <span id="s1029">If you had an apartment building, they came and said, “This is not yours anymore.</span> <span id="s1030">You have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1031">We’ll administer it, and we’ll take care of it.”</span> <span id="s1032">But somebody lived in it.</span> <span id="s1033">And it was most likely not in the ghetto, because if it was ghetto, they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s1034">But if it was outside the ghetto and people were paying rent into your purse, it wasn’t yours.</span> <span id="s1035">So there was an administration, and they hired Jews to do that, but the money went to them, you see.</span> <span id="s1036">So, my sister worked in that office.</span> <span id="s1037">The leader of this office tried to save his Jews.</span> <span id="s1038">He put them in the office and he put a German seal outside the door -- “This office is sealed by the German authority.’</span> <span id="s1039">People knew that the workers were there, and we thought that they were safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What was his motivation in saving them?</span> <span id="s1041">Because they were all good workers, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: They worked for him.</span> <span id="s1043">He got to like them.</span> <span id="s1044">Had some relationships, you know.</span> <span id="s1045">This probably is what happened.</span> <span id="s1046">But either somebody pointed a finger, or he got cold feet.</span> <span id="s1047">He brought in the Germans -- the ones who were in charge of the deportations --- or he brought all the Jews out himself, and that’s when all the people there were deported.</span> <span id="s1048">And my sister was one of them.</span> <span id="s1049">And one of my aunts worked there.</span> <span id="s1050">She had a high position, and her sister, so the whole family went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Where were they taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: They were taken!</span> <span id="s1053">So, that’s the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: You really had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: You heard about Treblinka, okay?</span> <span id="s1056">We didn’t know at that time where they were taken.</span> <span id="s1057">We were at night.</span> <span id="s1058">There were thousands of people in this big area.</span> <span id="s1059">It was inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1060">The Germans put in huge lamps, so was like daylight in the middle of night.</span> <span id="s1061">And there were hundreds and hundreds of SS troopers, and they were shooting and killing.</span> <span id="s1062">Just right there and there.</span> <span id="s1063">With babies.</span> <span id="s1064">And with…just something horrible.</span> <span id="s1065">I can’t tell you the details of that…the people were sitting in columns.</span> <span id="s1066">They were playing God, you see.</span> <span id="s1067">“You go to the right and you go to the left.”</span> <span id="s1068">Those who were going to the right were going to stay and those who went to the left, they were going to be deported.</span> <span id="s1069">And after the night was over, about three thousand people were probably left out of, by that time, about twenty thousand.</span> <span id="s1070">We were now decimated.</span> <span id="s1071">Literally.</span> <span id="s1072">About ninety percent or more of the people were going, so there was only a small remnant left.</span> <span id="s1073">The Small Ghetto, as I mentioned, was gone.</span> <span id="s1074">The Large Ghetto was decimated now in population, and they took out about three, four little streets -- the worst area, you know -- and said, “This is where you are going to be.”</span> <span id="s1075">So we came into a small little area, and that’s where we stayed until that was liquidated again, the end of ’43.</span> <span id="s1076">So then only a small remnant was left.</span> <span id="s1077">The Jewish hospital was outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1078">They took over an old building and they said, “This is your hospital now.”</span> <span id="s1079">And this was not the end, mind you.</span> <span id="s1080">You’d think that that would be the worst, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Is that what you always thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: We always thought was going to be the worst and that’s it, you know.</span> <span id="s1083">It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1084">When I describe it to you, maybe it’s hard to imagine and understand, and then -- you know -- an outside person says, “Gee, that’s terrible.</span> <span id="s1085">Nothing worse can happen.”</span> <span id="s1086">But it did.</span> <span id="s1087">Because again they had another deportation, in January of ’43.</span> <span id="s1088">And in the meantime they also had killings.</span> <span id="s1089">They would check the houses and see whether the people were out to work on a particular day, and if they caught somebody at home -- not out to work -- they’d line up sixteen people at one time, another time ten people -- and just with machine guns.</span> <span id="s1090">And again, Ukrainians did a lot of this, too.</span> <span id="s1091">My wife and I got out of this place to a gun factory which was located in Radom before the war.</span> <span id="s1092">Radom was an industrial place and it also had a government factory that was making rifles --guns and so forth.</span> <span id="s1093">And naturally the Germans had taken over this place.</span> <span id="s1094">There was called a “Defense Triangle” in Poland with two other towns that had also ammunition plant and some other things.</span> <span id="s1095">The Germans had in all these factories, Jews working, slave labor.</span> <span id="s1096">They didn’t have to pay us.</span> <span id="s1097">All you do is to get a little watery soup and a piece of dark bread and that was it.</span> <span id="s1098">So it was very cheap and very convenient.</span> <span id="s1099">If we die, so what.</span> <span id="s1100">So they have some other slaves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">So we felt that if we could get out of this place and go to this factory earlier, maybe we could get some little better jobs and we would not be under the pressure.</span> <span id="s1102">As long as we could work in the factory, we could preserve ourselves.</span> <span id="s1103">I had a friend, I mentioned to you, who went to school with me.</span> <span id="s1104">We graduated from high school together.</span> <span id="s1105">So I made contact with him.</span> <span id="s1106">I went over to see him.</span> <span id="s1107">He was a medical student, but he couldn’t study during the war, either.</span> <span id="s1108">The universities were shut down.</span> <span id="s1109">But he worked as a medic for the plant doctor there, and his father had worked there for years before, so he had connections, and he arranged for me to get a job that was much more appealing to me.</span> <span id="s1110">I worked in the electrical department there.</span> <span id="s1111">It was a day job, and my wife, he arranged that, too.</span> <span id="s1112">But you had to, to grease.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: You mentioned your wife.</span> <span id="s1114">Were you married at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Well, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1116">I didn’t mention that before, but when we wound up in what’s called the “Remnant Ghetto”-- when the Germans liquidated the Large Ghetto and the Small Ghetto and we remained in this little area of the Large Ghetto, they stopped calling it “ghetto” and officially they renamed it “Yiddish Zwangsarbeitlager’ -- Jewish forced labor camp”.</span> <span id="s1117">And in July of ’45 we got married, in the camp.</span> <span id="s1118">And that’s an interesting document, our marriage certificate in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: May I ask you a little bit about your wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1121">There were some people who were getting married, and there was some reason for it, too, even though the times and the circumstances were very peculiar.</span> <span id="s1122">It’s a long story, but maybe I should mention, because it’s for the records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: How did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Oh, we lived in ghetto, not far from one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Did you know each other before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: No.</span> <span id="s1127">She was younger than I, and you know how it is, you don’t look at younger girls unless you get up to a certain age.</span> <span id="s1128">But then we met, and then we started going with each other, and eventually circumstances were such that we felt were appropriate for us to get married, because we wanted to be together.</span> <span id="s1129">The chances of staying together were much better if we were married, and there were other reasons, too.</span> <span id="s1130">There were chances -- and again rumors, and some indications -- that the remnant that remained, some people at least might have a chance to be exchanged for Germans in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1131">Very few people heard about it, but it really happened in one or two instances.</span> <span id="s1132">And that was the basis for the belief and hope that maybe more people could get out.</span> <span id="s1133">I don’t know if I should go into a long story, because it’s kind of a fantastic story, in a way.</span> <span id="s1134">You might have heard about the Israeli Ambassador to Egypt, the first one?</span> <span id="s1135">He was from our hometown.</span> <span id="s1136">He was a little child at that time, he got out, the family, and wound up in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1137">So that was one possibility.</span> <span id="s1138">And then some other people got out, but they never made it to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1139">They were interned at Bergen-Belsen, in the civilian camp, not prisoners.</span> <span id="s1140">My wife happened to see them.</span> <span id="s1141">They were from Radom, too.</span> <span id="s1142">So there were some possibilities.</span> <span id="s1143">That was the reason that some people married sooner than they would have otherwise, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1145">So you were married.</span> <span id="s1146">Were you married by a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: No.</span> <span id="s1148">There was no rabbi.</span> <span id="s1149">No more rabbis at all.</span> <span id="s1150">But you didn’t have to be married by a rabbi in Jewish law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1152">Who did marry you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Well, we’ll call him the president or chairman of the community, of this little remnant that was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Did you move in together into a place?</span> <span id="s1155">Was this possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Well, in a way, as much as was possible.</span> <span id="s1157">It wasn’t that much possible.</span> <span id="s1158">And then, see, we moved away from this little labor camp.</span> <span id="s1159">A few months later, we moved to this gun plant, factory.</span> <span id="s1160">There, men were in one barrack and women were in another barrack, so there was no -- what’s the word -- to live together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Cohabitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Cohabitation!</span> <span id="s1163">Right.</span> <span id="s1164">But at least you hoped, you know, that you’re saving the lives of the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Was your wife’s family already taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Her father was taken, at that time, but her mother and her brother were still around, and they, too survived the war.</span> <span id="s1167">It’s a long story, a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So tell me, then, what happened eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Well, eventually, we did wind up in this factory.</span> <span id="s1170">The rest of the people that remained after us in this little, little ghetto, they eventually all came.</span> <span id="s1171">They were transferred to the camp adjacent to us -- not right away to our camp.</span> <span id="s1172">We were in the camp that was under the auspices of the Germans, but eventually the rest of the people came to a camp that was right adjacent to ours.</span> <span id="s1173">It’s called “Szkolna” camp.</span> <span id="s1174">Then the Germans changed the name again, that we became a branch of the concentration camp Lublin.</span> <span id="s1175">They converted the names for administrative reasons, and for their diabolic reasons, who knows.</span> <span id="s1176">They changed the names, they changed probably the administration, they changed whatever --philosophy.</span> <span id="s1177">Now we were part of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1178">The headquarters was Lublin, but we were the branch in Radom.</span> <span id="s1179">Okay?</span> <span id="s1180">And they opened up the two camps together, the one that we were in as workers of the gun factory, and the other people who were a part, basically, of the shops -- the trade shops.</span> <span id="s1181">So now we are all in one camp.</span> <span id="s1182">Then they took people to a camp near Cracow.</span> <span id="s1183">I don’t think they took to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1184">It’s in a famous camp there.</span> <span id="s1185">So there’s never a dull moment.</span> <span id="s1186">We were there till July of 1944, the end of July.</span> <span id="s1187">And the Russians had started their big offensive after Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1188">They started pushing the Germans, and they were pushing them, pushing them west.</span> <span id="s1189">And they came as close to us as maybe twenty-five miles on the river Vistula, which runs not far from Radom -- and they stopped.</span> <span id="s1190">The Germans were retreating west, and we were so important to them, that they didn’t want to leave us!</span> <span id="s1191">So they shlepped us along, and we went on a march, called a “death march.’</span> <span id="s1192">All these workers, men and women, we started out the 26th of July on a march towards a place called “Tomaszowmazvoretski,” We marched over one hundred kilometers in three days and a lot of people were falling down, and a lot of them were shot!</span> <span id="s1193">They couldn’t walk any more, so the Germans put them on a horse and buggy, and they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: What season was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: That was July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So it was in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: It was very hot.</span> <span id="s1198">And so they killed off quite a few, but again we made it to a place in Tomaszow, where they separated the women from the men, and again we were in some kind of a chemical factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: You were still with your wife at…</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: No.</span> <span id="s1201">At that time, they separated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: But you made the march together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: The march we made together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: And then you were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: My mother was with us and her mother was with us -- Rivka’s – too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: And they survived the march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1208">And her brother, yeah.</span> <span id="s1209">They all survived.</span> <span id="s1210">Her uncle was shot on the march and a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s1211">People just couldn’t make it!</span> <span id="s1212">It was very hot and hardly any water.</span> <span id="s1213">It was real bad.</span> <span id="s1214">And then once we got to Tomaszow, they separated the women.</span> <span id="s1215">There were about 500 women.</span> <span id="s1216">And they took them to the jail for a few days, and the men, about 1,500, maybe 2,000 00 were in this huge chemical factory, and we stayed there for a week.</span> <span id="s1217">Dysentery was just horrible!</span> <span id="s1218">Just indescribable!</span> <span id="s1219">And finally, maybe the 5th of August, Saturday night, they put us on a train and they took us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1220">And we got to Auschwitz Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: “We” meaning…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: By “we” meaning everybody.</span> <span id="s1223">Everybody.</span> <span id="s1224">Because they picked the men up from here and the women from wherever they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: How were you transported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: In cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Oh, sure!</span> <span id="s1229">All night, and we finally made it to Auschwitz in the morning.</span> <span id="s1230">So they took us off the train, and again the women were separate, and then they took off some older men and the sickly off that train and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Before you go on, will you tell me something about the traveling conditions?</span> <span id="s1232">What were the conditions on the train like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: They were very, very bad!</span> <span id="s1234">Obviously.</span> <span id="s1235">Again, they didn’t feed us!</span> <span id="s1236">They didn’t give us any water, but when we arrived in Auschwitz, I think we did get some water and some piece of bread, maybe the next morning.</span> <span id="s1237">But this was a relatively short ride, only during the night.</span> <span id="s1238">We traveled in separate cars, the men in some cars, and then the women in separate cars, and we could only wave at each other.</span> <span id="s1239">And we got off the train in Auschwitz, that was the end.</span> <span id="s1240">They were taken off and put in a camp there and some of them were taken to the gas chambers, including those older men and some children.</span> <span id="s1241">We remained on the trestle and they didn’t take us into the camp proper.</span> <span id="s1242">We were still on the railroad duct, and at the end of the day, they put us on the train again, back into the cattle cars again -- because the train waited for us all day, and they started shlepping us to southwestern Germany to another camp.</span> <span id="s1243">And that’s where I arrived the 9th, I think of August, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: What about your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: She remained at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1246">My mother remained at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1247">Her mother remained at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: So you went to this other camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I went on to the other camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Vaihingen.</span> <span id="s1252">And I have to add the word Enz, which means Vaihingen on the river Enz.</span> <span id="s1253">That’s in German, okay?</span> <span id="s1254">And that was, as I said, in southwestern Germany, roughly about thirty, thirty-five kilometers southwest or south of Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Who were the people who accompanied you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: SS.</span> <span id="s1257">You mean guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1259">I mean other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: People who were in camp with me all along in Radom.</span> <span id="s1261">Now in Radom, they were not all my friends!</span> <span id="s1262">They were all different kind of people.</span> <span id="s1263">As a matter of fact, some people were not even from Radom proper, because Radom had these two ghettos, and they swelled up, these ghettos, with people brought in from small towns.</span> <span id="s1264">The Germans didn’t want to monkey around with small ghettos in every little shtetl!</span> <span id="s1265">They made the ghettos in the big cities.</span> <span id="s1266">And Lublin was a big city, and Radom was a big city, and Warsaw of course, and Cracow.</span> <span id="s1267">So they emptied out the Jews from all the small towns and villages, wherever they were, and brought them into the ghettos, and they had them all under good surveillance and supervision.</span> <span id="s1268">And that was true of Radom, too.</span> <span id="s1269">So some people who were in my transport might have been young people from small towns, from other places.</span> <span id="s1270">As a matter of fact, they even brought in a group of supervisors from the Warsaw ghetto, who participated in the uprising.</span> <span id="s1271">For some unexplained reason, they brought to Radom -- in that small, small ghetto, mind you -- they brought these people in.</span> <span id="s1272">And some of them survived in Radom -- and then they became part of our Radomer transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: What happened when you arrived at the camp/?</span> <span id="s1274">How were you processed or registered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: We were new.</span> <span id="s1276">There was nobody else in that camp.</span> <span id="s1277">And right away, administration was set up and there were several blocks and what they called the German “Blakeldester” -- means leader of the block, or the senior, or the elder of the clock.</span> <span id="s1278">They became the bosses of the blocks.</span> <span id="s1279">Then they also had people who were supervising the portion that they had to send people out to work.</span> <span id="s1280">And they had the medical staff.</span> <span id="s1281">There were a few Jewish doctors, still.</span> <span id="s1282">Not that they had much to help with -- medicines, medications -- but they were doctors, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s1283">They were under the supervision of some German orderly who became their boss.</span> <span id="s1284">Some of them survived -- one just died, a friend of ours, was in upstate New York.</span> <span id="s1285">And then we started going out to work!</span> <span id="s1286">The Germans assigned us certain numbers to go to certain types of work.</span> <span id="s1287">I went out to work in a metallurgical factory -- a big factory -- at first.</span> <span id="s1288">By the way, I don’t know if I mentioned to you or not, once we came to this camp, we got the striped suits.</span> <span id="s1289">I have a picture, I’ll show you.</span> <span id="s1290">This happens to be my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1291">And that’s what we had, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Can we talk about this in a moment?</span> <span id="s1293">After we’ve finished here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: So we would go out to work every morning -- we were of course guarded by the SS troopers -- and come back to the camp in the evening.</span> <span id="s1295">Other prisoners would go out and bring us food.</span> <span id="s1296">And that was day-in, day-out.</span> <span id="s1297">Towards the end, in the spring of ’45, they were building an underground factory.</span> <span id="s1298">They never finished it, but it was kind of a long-range project the Germans hoped to build by the slave labor, but the Americans kind of superceded that.</span> <span id="s1299">We were shot up by Americans in April -- all the month of April.</span> <span id="s1300">American planes would come down and shoot with machine guns.</span> <span id="s1301">And we also were killed, us in stripes.</span> <span id="s1302">And then from there, the end of April, the 7th, I believe, we were taken to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Before we get into that, how long were you in Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A; Nine months.</span> <span id="s1305">I got from August, ’44 till April, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Can you say something about the living conditions, if that’s all right?</span> <span id="s1307">What were they like?</span> <span id="s1308">What was the routine of the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: The routine of the day I mentioned already.</span> <span id="s1310">You had to get up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: About how early?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: 5:30, because we had to leave for work about 6, 6:30.</span> <span id="s1313">And the we had to be lined up, what they called an “Apell,” the counting.</span> <span id="s1314">The mustering, right?</span> <span id="s1315">I say counting, because we had to count!</span> <span id="s1316">And they would check how many people are in the barrack, okay?</span> <span id="s1317">Each barrack separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: How many people were there in your barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: God knows.</span> <span id="s1320">There were several hundred, and then if somebody was missing, they would start counting from one again.</span> <span id="s1321">And if somebody made a mistake, would get hit in his face.</span> <span id="s1322">And if the number did not match, nobody would move, and they would go out and check the barrack.</span> <span id="s1323">And all of a sudden somebody remembered that somebody’s in the sickroom.</span> <span id="s1324">Somebody was responsible, from the administration, would get hit on his head if he forgot to tell the SS men that somebody was out.</span> <span id="s1325">So that went on every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">We were mustered in the morning, we were mustered in the evening when we came back.</span> <span id="s1327">And then after that, we were allowed to eat breakfast.</span> <span id="s1328">What was the breakfast?</span> <span id="s1329">It was a little hot water mixed with some rutabaga -- maybe.</span> <span id="s1330">And then a piece of bread ration.</span> <span id="s1331">And so-called coffee -- it was sort of black water.</span> <span id="s1332">We went out to work and then they would bring lunch, rutabaga water or some other water or some so-called soup -- which was hot, fortunately -- and that would help.</span> <span id="s1333">And in the evening we would come back and eat in the camp again, and then again get our ration of bread.</span> <span id="s1334">And sometimes the ration would be given in the evening for the 24-hour period, and you had to manage your own bread.</span> <span id="s1335">If you ate it all in the evening, you were out of luck the next day, right?</span> <span id="s1336">So you had to be sure to divide it up.</span> <span id="s1337">And sometimes they only give you half the portion, and then give you the next half tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1338">And Sunday we will get special food.</span> <span id="s1339">We will get a piece of marmalade, we’d get a piece of so-called sausage.</span> <span id="s1340">So that was great!</span> <span id="s1341">A regular blood sausage they would give us, you know, just a piece of junk.</span> <span id="s1342">And if things were good, they’d give us a piece of horsemeat.</span> <span id="s1343">Real nice.</span> <span id="s1344">In your soup!</span> <span id="s1345">It was the horse died of some sickness.</span> <span id="s1346">They would cut up the horse and put the meat in the soup.</span> <span id="s1347">Usually they didn’t have any salt, except if they found some smelly herring -- there was salt, you know!</span> <span id="s1348">They would use that herring juice and put it in the soup to make it salty, so that was terrific, too.</span> <span id="s1349">In other words, we had just a perfect diet!</span> <span id="s1350">You never got fat though!</span> <span id="s1351">It kept our weight down.</span> <span id="s1352">Was perfect!</span> <span id="s1353">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: What were the sleeping conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: The sleeping conditions?</span> <span id="s1356">They were horrible!</span> <span id="s1357">Straw, you know.</span> <span id="s1358">And there were bunks, three bunks, one-two-three high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: On top of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: On top of each other, right.</span> <span id="s1361">And dirty!</span> <span id="s1362">We tried to keep it as clean as it was possible.</span> <span id="s1363">It was not very possible.</span> <span id="s1364">It was cold water, and the soap they would give us was -- I don’t know if you have ever seen that raw soap -- that was the soap that we would get, and we tried to save that and wash ourselves, to keep ourselves as clean as possible.</span> <span id="s1365">Take off the shirt.</span> <span id="s1366">Wash it.</span> <span id="s1367">Dry it.</span> <span id="s1368">And put it on again.</span> <span id="s1369">We would get a change of underwear, maybe, once in several weeks.</span> <span id="s1370">There were outhouses, latrines.</span> <span id="s1371">The bad part was that we were supposed to keep them clean.</span> <span id="s1372">We had to wash it and keep it clean, but again, with hundreds and hundreds of people, you know, it was almost impossible!</span> <span id="s1373">And they were all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1374">Some people couldn’t make it, because dysentery was just prevalent!</span> <span id="s1375">It’s all over the place.</span> <span id="s1376">People were running -- the “runs,” you know -- they just could hardly make it.</span> <span id="s1377">And there were in a place like this, where you have people of all kinds of levels, culture levels, intellectual level, all kinds of -- you know – hygienic levels, you were against all kinds of situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">The fact is that a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s1379">And this was an interesting camp, because it was not a ruthless camp.</span> <span id="s1380">I myself got beat up because the SS officer finds a bulge in my suit -- I made a pocket inside, and the pocket was bulging -- and he said, “What do you have here?”</span> <span id="s1381">So I pulled out photographs -- that I mentioned to you -- and he said, “Show ‘em.”</span> <span id="s1382">They were wrapped up in something, and he unfolded it and he slapped me on my face, and threw them away.</span> <span id="s1383">I was fortunate that he didn’t tear them up, out of spite.</span> <span id="s1384">Just the fact that I dared to make a pocket, and I dared to have the photographs in it, that was enough reason for him to just give me big punches.</span> <span id="s1385">They could catch you for whatever reasons.</span> <span id="s1386">You didn’t take off your hat, you were slapped.</span> <span id="s1387">If you did take off your hat, they say, “Are you my friend, that you are greeting me?”</span> <span id="s1388">This kind of a deal.</span> <span id="s1389">It was a no win situation.</span> <span id="s1390">And yet, there was no mass murdering us.</span> <span id="s1391">No killing.</span> <span id="s1392">No nothing, you know, of the sort that they would take the whole group and gas them.</span> <span id="s1393">There was no gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1394">There was no crematorium there.</span> <span id="s1395">People were just dying!</span> <span id="s1396">Somebody would die because he just couldn’t make it!</span> <span id="s1397">Whether it was dysentery, whether it was typhoid, whether it was any other sickness -- just a weakness, or mentally, a breakdown, that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Were you sick, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: I was sick.</span> <span id="s1400">I did not catch the typhoid which was prevalent, maybe ninety percent of the people.</span> <span id="s1401">I got friendly with the lice, and they just treated me well, see?</span> <span id="s1402">(Laughs) So I was nice to them, they were nice to me, and they did not infect me with the typhoid.</span> <span id="s1403">Maybe I got immunities from them!</span> <span id="s1404">However, in December, I remember quite well, of ’44, I was sick.</span> <span id="s1405">I don’t know what I had, some kind of virus.</span> <span id="s1406">Headaches, terrible headaches, and I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s1407">I went to the doctor and said, “Can you help me?’</span> <span id="s1408">And he gave me maybe two aspirin.</span> <span id="s1409">That’s all they could give me, and they said, “Don’t come here.”</span> <span id="s1410">They didn’t want people to stay in the sickroom because you never knew what may happen.</span> <span id="s1411">You know, they could take you for an experiment, they could feel that maybe you are not strong enough to work, so they give you maybe a needle.</span> <span id="s1412">Who knows the Germans?</span> <span id="s1413">So it was better not to be in the sickroom -- even though you were sick -- unless you just couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s1414">So I was sick, and yet I did not admit to it, so I got by with my sickness, and I got through it.</span> <span id="s1415">My wife almost got killed by the typhoid.</span> <span id="s1416">She was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1417">When she got through, she weighed, towards the end of the war, maybe forty pounds.</span> <span id="s1418">Just something horrible, you know!</span> <span id="s1419">So in that respect, I was fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Did you encounter any non-Jews in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1422">I mentioned to you before, that we came from Radom and there were all Jews.</span> <span id="s1423">Then they started taking out groups of these people to other camps, and they emptied some of these barracks, and they started bringing in non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1424">Interesting enough, they brought in many different nationalities.</span> <span id="s1425">They brought in French, Poles, Ukrainians, even Dutch, Danish and Norwegians.</span> <span id="s1426">Some of them were very high officials.</span> <span id="s1427">In Norway, for example.</span> <span id="s1428">Now the way we were taught, is that they tried to make this camp, from a strictly Jewish camp and a kind of strictly labor-oriented camp, they made it into some kind of recovery camp, because those were probably sick people.</span> <span id="s1429">There was not work for them.</span> <span id="s1430">Only those who were fairly healthy went out in columns to work -- and those Norwegians and French hardly went out.</span> <span id="s1431">So the Jews kept on working, and very few, very few of the non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Were there gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Homosexuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: No.</span> <span id="s1436">Not in our camp.</span> <span id="s1437">It was interesting, because some of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Were there Jehovah’s Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: No.</span> <span id="s1440">There were only, I told you, Norwegian and Danish intellectuals, a judge and lawyers and some people who were apparently caught up in the underground there, or the resistance, and they arrested them, and eventually they wound up in our camp.</span> <span id="s1441">But we were still the majority and the administration, of course, the original one, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Was there a means of communicating throughout the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: What do you mean throughout the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: With other prisoners, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1446">I said, this was not a camp, as I’ll tell you in a minute about Dachau.</span> <span id="s1447">You were free to move about from one barrack to another.</span> <span id="s1448">I was in Barrack Two and if my friend or somebody that I wanted to see was in Barrack Six, I could go over and see him, and he could come over and see me.</span> <span id="s1449">People were even meeting in some area of the barrack to pray -- mind you -- on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1450">They would put some people outside -- guards -- to watch if the SS were coming.</span> <span id="s1451">And the religious would pray.</span> <span id="s1452">I fasted on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1453">I worked, and I don’t think I prayed much, but I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1454">Was very easy to do.</span> <span id="s1455">You can survive - you are filled up and eating for a whole year, but then you have one day - but if you don’t eat ten days before, the eleventh day might be kind of rough -- but anyway, that was it.</span> <span id="s1456">On Passover, there were people in our camp who would not eat bread, even though bread was all you could get, bread and this watery soup.</span> <span id="s1457">They didn’t want to break the Passover, so they would trade.</span> <span id="s1458">They would give their piece of bread to whoever wanted it, and they would take a piece of rutabaga.</span> <span id="s1459">They would take some raw potato.</span> <span id="s1460">Something they sustained themselves with, practically nothing.</span> <span id="s1461">So as far as communicating and moving about, this camp was not a strict regime camp, in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Were you aware at all of the ongoing war effort during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Good question!</span> <span id="s1464">You asked me a terrific question.</span> <span id="s1465">We were going out to work, and where we worked in this metallurgical factory, there were Germans, and you could talk -- if they wanted to talk to you, that is.</span> <span id="s1466">If they wanted to give you something, they could have done this.</span> <span id="s1467">If they wanted to push a piece of paper very innocently, you could get it, okay?</span> <span id="s1468">In addition, there was a shop -- the shoemakers and tailors and barbers -- who worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1469">They took them out and they put them in a certain place and when the Germans needed to repair something, they would come into the shop and say, “Here.</span> <span id="s1470">Repair it for me.”</span> <span id="s1471">Those were the guards, you know.</span> <span id="s1472">Now if the guard wanted to bring you, say, a piece of bread, he will wrap it in yesterday’s paper, see, and leave it with you.</span> <span id="s1473">Or he would supposedly come in, read the paper and just forget, supposedly, and leave the paper.</span> <span id="s1474">That paper would come into camp.</span> <span id="s1475">And we read the paper -- the local paper.</span> <span id="s1476">Now the Germans were giving information.</span> <span id="s1477">When they were retreating, it was a “victorious retreat.”</span> <span id="s1478">Obviously we know if they are retreating, it’s not very victorious, and you would read between lines -- where they were yesterday, and they were today.</span> <span id="s1479">We pretty much knew that the war was going against them, and we could sense that the war was going to be ended, hopefully, soon.</span> <span id="s1480">Whether we would survive the war -- whether they would let us survive the war -- that was a different story, but we could see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1481">As a matter of fact, let me tell you two stories.</span> <span id="s1482">I don’t remember which came first, but the one that I’ll start with is this: On Christmas Eve the lights went out in the camp.</span> <span id="s1483">It was a total darkness and blackout.</span> <span id="s1484">Okay, what happened?</span> <span id="s1485">American planes were flying overhead, over us.</span> <span id="s1486">And they were flying to their bombing mission.</span> <span id="s1487">We found out later, and again we probably read it in the paper.</span> <span id="s1488">Some of the Germans were not true SS guards -- it was towards the end, and in this particular place they converted old army officers or men, put them into SS uniforms, and they were the guards.</span> <span id="s1489">They were not as indoctrinated and brainwashed as the real SS men were.</span> <span id="s1490">They were a little more humane and more human, and sometimes they might have even been against the regime, okay?</span> <span id="s1491">so they could tell you something -- or they were even sympathetic, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1492">So, sometimes you might get in the shops, where they had personal contact -- maybe they took a liking to some tailor or somebody -- they’d bring them paper.</span> <span id="s1493">But that particular night, we could hear wave after wave after wave of planes (oo-oo-o-o-o engine sound) going over our head, and we are very glad to hear that.</span> <span id="s1494">And then we saw flares coming down.</span> <span id="s1495">Blue and red and yellow flares they were dropping.</span> <span id="s1496">Now we found out, next day, that they were bombing not very far from our place, a city where apparently the Germans established some war industries, and apparently the Americans and the British got word of it and they bombed it, right on Christmas Eve, the American planes were flying overhead almost always, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">One time the workers were sent home from their place of work because--and again these were rumors -- because they were chasing English spies.</span> <span id="s1498">Spies were dropped down by parachutes or somehow, and they were in the area, and they were afraid maybe they’ll get into the camp or whatever.</span> <span id="s1499">They were chasing them and they wanted as few people around as possible, so they would not repeat it.</span> <span id="s1500">When we got to Dachau, after this camp.</span> <span id="s1501">The beginning of April -- I read - I saw it myself -- Somebody, I don’t know how, brought in the Nazi party paper, into our barrack, after Roosevelt died, and it said, with big letters, Roosevelt was dead.</span> <span id="s1502">And I saw it in Dachau!</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Do you recall any of the names of the major German personnel?</span> <span id="s1504">Like the commander or the officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Well some of them accompanied us all the way from Radom.</span> <span id="s1506">I remember one guy whose name is Schippers.</span> <span id="s1507">I could probably look up in the book of Radom, because I gave a deposition about some of these guys, too, officials in Radom, not only camp, but in the German military government in Radom.</span> <span id="s1508">Radom was a district city.</span> <span id="s1509">Why is it important to have names?</span> <span id="s1510">You think that’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Just to get a sense of the concrete reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Well, another guy, his name was Hacker, or Hecker.</span> <span id="s1513">I don’t remember, it’s so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Were there any specific units of the German army, or the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Well, in Vaihingen, as I said before, not anticipating the question, some of these guards were not actual SS men.</span> <span id="s1516">They were sort of converted army people, or even old retired army people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Now tell me about the circumstances leading to your transfer from Vaihingen to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1518">Why were you transferred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: That’s the good question.</span> <span id="s1520">Because the Germans never left us alone.</span> <span id="s1521">We were so precious to them that where they ran, we ran with them.</span> <span id="s1522">They took us along.</span> <span id="s1523">They didn’t leave us in Radom.</span> <span id="s1524">All their options were closing, and they could have saved their own skins, but they brought us to Auschwitz, and then, of course to Vaihingen.</span> <span id="s1525">At Vaihingen, the French army was pursuing them, so the German guards had to escape, to leave the area, right?</span> <span id="s1526">They did leave maybe two-thirds of the camp intact, but they took out about a third, about ninety percent Jews and ten percent non-Jews, roughly five hundred people or so, and they left about maybe fifteen hundred people.</span> <span id="s1527">The numbers are not certain; they never told us the numbers.</span> <span id="s1528">Just a plain guess.</span> <span id="s1529">Anyhow, beginning the 7th or so of April, 1945, we marched out of this camp.</span> <span id="s1530">They left the rest of them because they were typhoid stricken, and were not healthy enough to walk thirteen, fourteen kilometers to the station.</span> <span id="s1531">They put us on trains, again cattle trains.</span> <span id="s1532">And they shlepped us to Dachau via Munich.</span> <span id="s1533">And I remember the train going in Munich, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, all night, almost.</span> <span id="s1534">We finally made it into Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: How long was that?</span> <span id="s1536">How long was the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1538">We left probably late afternoon or evening, and we got in the middle of the night, maybe, in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1539">So we went through this procedure, registering names and so forth.</span> <span id="s1540">Then we had to take off all the clothing we had, throw it away into the pile.</span> <span id="s1541">The only thing we could carry with us were our shoes.</span> <span id="s1542">Many people didn’t have good shoes.</span> <span id="s1543">It so happens, my shoes were pretty good, and I wanted to keep them.</span> <span id="s1544">I also had in them those pictures that I saved all these years, and I was watching, because in front of me were people, and they were making them spread their legs, and then lift up their feet to see that they didn’t have anything between their legs, and then lift up their feet to see that they didn’t have anything stuck.</span> <span id="s1545">They made them go into a little water pool with their feet, so if there’s anything stuck to their feet, between their toes or what-have-you, that will come off.</span> <span id="s1546">Well, while they were doing this, I was watching, and they were taking away everything.</span> <span id="s1547">They put hands in the shoes, and put the shoes in the water, so the pictures would have been all damaged.</span> <span id="s1548">I sneaked by, and never got through the actual hand check.</span> <span id="s1549">Now these checkers were prisoners themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s1550">That was their function.</span> <span id="s1551">They were not very sympathetic, and they did what they were supposed to do very -- sometimes very roughly.</span> <span id="s1552">But I did get by and carried my pictures through, and I had my shoes, and then they gave me a big suit.</span> <span id="s1553">And the guy with a big size probably got a small suit!</span> <span id="s1554">And so we were through and now we were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1555">They assign us to a barrack .</span> <span id="s1556">It was barrack 22, I believe.</span> <span id="s1557">I don’t remember that, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Did they do anything else to you before you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Well, we probably had to take a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Did hey shave your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: They might have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Did they tattoo you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: No.</span> <span id="s1564">They didn’t tattoo.</span> <span id="s1565">The only place where they tattooed was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1566">My wife has a tattoo.</span> <span id="s1567">And those who were tattooed were the lucky ones, because those who were not, were temporary.</span> <span id="s1568">That means that they could go to gas chamber any time.</span> <span id="s1569">Those who were put on tattoo, they had a better chance of surviving, at least for the time being.</span> <span id="s1570">Since we did not stay in Auschwitz, it did not apply to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: What were the conditions like when you got there?</span> <span id="s1572">How many other prisoners were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: I don’t know how many, but we know the barracks was full.</span> <span id="s1574">The whole camp in Dachau was full.</span> <span id="s1575">You didn’t see the next barrack, you were just in one barrack, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1576">That was your, what we called, “lebensraum”, your area of living.</span> <span id="s1577">Or existing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Were the conditions much, much worse than at Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: I can’t say that they can be compared.</span> <span id="s1580">See, in Vaihingen you went out to work!</span> <span id="s1581">In Dachau there was no work.</span> <span id="s1582">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1583">You didn’t do anything except some might have volunteered to push the cart with the dead bodies that was piled up every morning.</span> <span id="s1584">People would die of diarrhea, die of exertion, they gave up -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1585">And every morning we would see a pile of skeletons, you know, dead people, fifteen, twelve, whatever.</span> <span id="s1586">And the people who were pulling the cart, pile up those skeletons on the cart, and then pull out the cart to the crematorium and get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1587">Maybe they got an extra piece of bread and maybe not.</span> <span id="s1588">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1589">I didn’t volunteer for it, and that didn’t concern me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Did the condition of the people at Dachau seem worse to you than the people in Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: No, I don’t think so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: There wasn’t much difference, except that there was no work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: There was no work.</span> <span id="s1594">Nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1595">And obviously the war was coming to an end, and that’s what happened a few weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Were you glad there was no work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Well, I suppose, because, after all, you didn’t have to expend any energy.</span> <span id="s1598">Whatever food you got, you know, that sustained you.</span> <span id="s1599">And you didn’t go any place!</span> <span id="s1600">They said, “If anything would happen to you, it was right here.”</span> <span id="s1601">You didn’t have any foreman to contend with, you didn’t have any German guards to contend with, you were right inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1602">The only people we had to contend with were the prisoners who were in charge of the barrack.</span> <span id="s1603">And if you stayed out of the way, you hoped they wouldn’t touch you, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1604">The kapos, I think they called them kapos, in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: How did you know that the war was almost coming to an end?</span> <span id="s1606">Because of the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: The newspapers in Vaihingen.</span> <span id="s1608">I mean it was not getting any better for the Germans, obviously.</span> <span id="s1609">The Americans were marching on.</span> <span id="s1610">The stories of the spies in the planes, and the paper.</span> <span id="s1611">The German paper, even though they tried to avoid telling anything to the Germans, we could read between lines, and we knew very well what was going on.</span> <span id="s1612">We somehow got this paper in Dachau even, which was very peculiar, and very interesting to see it.</span> <span id="s1613">I told you I read German, so there was no problem with it.</span> <span id="s1614">And other people did, too.</span> <span id="s1615">And in this barrack, again to repeat, there was a mixed multitude, all kinds of people, not only from my own camp.</span> <span id="s1616">They probably put them in different barracks and we wound up with being, maybe, a minority.</span> <span id="s1617">I slept with my shoes on, because, remember, I told you maybe the story that my shoes were very good, and I was afraid, being in a place like this where there were all kinds of people, you were exposed to theft and assault.</span> <span id="s1618">And in the shoes I had my pictures.</span> <span id="s1619">I walked on them.</span> <span id="s1620">From the day when, I mentioned before, the SS man stopped me and beat me up for having something in my pocket and I wrapped the pictures in heavy drafting paper, cloth, and I walked on it.</span> <span id="s1621">Needless to say, they got damaged a little bit, but I saved them, and in Dachau I slept with the shoes on, to protect it.</span> <span id="s1622">People thought I was crazy, so this one night I said, alright, I’ll put my shoes under my head, like a pillow, and I’ll go to sleep like this.</span> <span id="s1623">Lo and behold, somebody was watching me.</span> <span id="s1624">They turned off the lights, and everybody was asleep, and all of a sudden I felt somebody trying to pull them out from under my head, and I screamed out, and they turned on the light, and we caught what was a Ukrainian who came from Vaihingen with me.</span> <span id="s1625">Oh, he didn’t get the shoes, but I didn’t get the pictures either.</span> <span id="s1626">The pictures fell out of the shoe apparently, and somebody grabbed them.</span> <span id="s1627">And I was just beside myself!</span> <span id="s1628">I would have given the shoes and ten years of my life to get the pictures, because those were the only pictures I had of my family, my parents, and of my wife.</span> <span id="s1629">I didn’t know whether she was alive, you know.</span> <span id="s1630">And I was just completely sick because of it.</span> <span id="s1631">So walking back and forth in this courtyard, first that day and the next day, and maybe the day after, and I -- well I had given up.</span> <span id="s1632">What could I do?</span> <span id="s1633">But I just couldn’t get over it.</span> <span id="s1634">All of a sudden --now this sounds like a made-up story -- all of a sudden, somebody in the barrack parallel to ours looking through the iron bars -- he couldn’t get out, and I don’t know who it was, because he never showed his face -- he just yelled out, “Hey, did you lose something?’</span> <span id="s1635">At first I didn’t know whether he was yelling at me, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1636">I said, “Yes, I lost something.’</span> <span id="s1637">And all of a sudden, this packet -- the package and the paper with the pictures flies out of there.</span> <span id="s1638">God is my witness, I don’t know who it was.</span> <span id="s1639">I never found out.</span> <span id="s1640">The guy was afraid, apparently.</span> <span id="s1641">I don’t know how he recognized me, because this is important, too.</span> <span id="s1642">If you see a picture, somebody looking like this -- (shows photo from camp) -- now this was not the picture he found.</span> <span id="s1643">The pictures he found, I look like a man -- like somebody.</span> <span id="s1644">This was a picture from 1938!</span> <span id="s1645">So he must have known me.</span> <span id="s1646">I never found out who it was, but I got my pictures back!</span> <span id="s1647">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s1648">I considered it a miracle!</span> <span id="s1649">It was “beshert” for me to get the pictures back.</span> <span id="s1650">And by that time, the days were going, you know, the 15th, the 16th, 17th, April, until the 27th of April, I think, they said, “You Jews are getting out of here.”</span> <span id="s1651">Just Jews.</span> <span id="s1652">You see, they didn’t want to leave us.</span> <span id="s1653">The Americans were coming close, and they told us to get out.</span> <span id="s1654">They took out about 2,000 Jews, I don’t know exactly how many, from the entire camp.</span> <span id="s1655">They marched us to a railroad trestle again, and before we went there, they gave us coats, which apparently turned out to be Russian uniform coats, or somebody’ else’s army, olive green coats, plus a little package -- kind of a paper package wrapped up with a string, but very nice, neat package, a box, a Red Cross box (like a shoe box) and they took us to a train which was not a cattle train, but it was a passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">And we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1657">We just couldn’t figure it out.</span> <span id="s1658">Naturally, rumors start flying.</span> <span id="s1659">“Well, why would they give us the coats?”</span> <span id="s1660">They didn’t give us other suits.</span> <span id="s1661">They left us with the striped suits, but they gave us the coat to keep us warm.</span> <span id="s1662">Before we came to Dachau we had coats like these made of the striped material -- in Vaihingen, for example -- all winter.</span> <span id="s1663">We were freezing to death.</span> <span id="s1664">There was no lining or anything.</span> <span id="s1665">But here they gave us those warm coats -- fairly warm.</span> <span id="s1666">They gave us a Red Cross package they never gave us throughout the war.</span> <span id="s1667">And they gave us something, we didn’t know what it was, but it turned out it was a paper sleeping bag, a Finnish bag with many layers of paper, that if we had to sleep someplace, we can just crawl in and keep warm in it.</span> <span id="s1668">And we’d never been on a train like this.</span> <span id="s1669">So, what’s the rumor?</span> <span id="s1670">They are going to Switzerland, and they are going to exchange us.</span> <span id="s1671">The war is at an end and they are trying to be nice and let us go to a neutral country.</span> <span id="s1672">Well it was not true, needless to say.</span> <span id="s1673">But they took us out of Dachau, and they “shlepped” us -- Dachau, if you know the German geography is not far from Munich, in the southern part of Germany -- they took us south of Munich to the Alps, right into the mountains to a place called Scharnitz, if I remember it right.</span> <span id="s1674">We came there, was a Saturday, the 28th.</span> <span id="s1675">This was in Austria, incidentally -- Austria was of course, a part of Germany -- so it was a different Gauleiter, a not-so-official governor, of this part of Austria that we were going into.</span> <span id="s1676">And he apparently didn’t want us to come in.</span> <span id="s1677">He said, keep these guys yourself.</span> <span id="s1678">But we stayed in Scharnitz, and the 28th, on a Saturday, here we stand in the rain, cats and dogs, and again a rumor.</span> <span id="s1679">The radio announced that the war was over and we are going to be free and the Germans are giving up.</span> <span id="s1680">Well, the people went crazy!</span> <span id="s1681">They started jumping –of-joy!</span> <span id="s1682">And they were jumping -- even the Germans -- and kissing them!</span> <span id="s1683">It was unbelievable!</span> <span id="s1684">I just stood there and looked, and my group, we were not that enthusiastic.</span> <span id="s1685">We said,” That can’t be true.”</span> <span id="s1686">Didn’t make sense, you know.</span> <span id="s1687">And the Germans were confused.</span> <span id="s1688">They didn’t know what was happening either.</span> <span id="s1689">There was a radio message that indeed said the war was over and the Germans had given up, but as it turned out, it was a false message.</span> <span id="s1690">It was the underground, apparently.</span> <span id="s1691">And these SS troopers, bastards, they found out it wasn’t true, and they started beating on us with their rifle buts and anything else, and the joy was short lived.</span> <span id="s1692">So then they started walking us into the mountain area, to some barns, and they left us there for the night.</span> <span id="s1693">And some people escaped.</span> <span id="s1694">Some of them were lucky, they really got away, because in some areas, the troopers were shooting.</span> <span id="s1695">But we stayed.</span> <span id="s1696">The next day, Sunday…</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Why did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Well, they told us to stay.</span> <span id="s1699">They said they would come and pick us up the next morning.</span> <span id="s1700">Here they treated us so nicely, put us on nice train, dress us up, give us a Red Cross package.</span> <span id="s1701">We didn’t know that they would do some harm to us, as here they were treating us fairly.</span> <span id="s1702">So, they said, “You stay here, and tomorrow we get together and us on the train again.”</span> <span id="s1703">Well as it happened, they really did, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s1704">They put us on a mountain car and they were carting us in smaller groups, because there was only one car, back and forth, to another place in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1705">You see mountains all around in the Alps, mind you.</span> <span id="s1706">Beautiful Alps.</span> <span id="s1707">In front of us are the mountains, in back of us is the road, on the side of us is some kind of a mountain stream, and the guards are on the side, so we were wedged in, right in that area.</span> <span id="s1708">And they say,” We’re all going to sleep here overnight.</span> <span id="s1709">Stay right here.”</span> <span id="s1710">So here we have this nice paper bag -- sleeping bag --now, that we didn’t know what it was for, but now we said, “Maybe it will come in handy.”</span> <span id="s1711">And it started to snow.</span> <span id="s1712">This was the 29th of April, you know, it’s in the mountains, and it could get pretty cold, and as I said, it was snowing.</span> <span id="s1713">And the time, who knows?</span> <span id="s1714">We didn’t have watches -- naturally they took those away long ago -- so we figured out it must be maybe ten or eleven o’clock or so, it’s dark, so we laid down.</span> <span id="s1715">I pushed my feet into the sleeping bag and laid down on the ground and all of a sudden, I hear a commotion.</span> <span id="s1716">We wake up and say, “What’s the matter, what’s going on?”</span> <span id="s1717">Somebody said, “The guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s1718">No guards.”</span> <span id="s1719">“No guards!”</span> <span id="s1720">I woke up right away, no?</span> <span id="s1721">What happened to the guards?</span> <span id="s1722">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1723">They just left us and went.</span> <span id="s1724">Well, in that case, if they went, then we have to go in the opposite direction -- in other words, in the direction where we came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Now, at that time, we organized a group of Radomer -- about thirty of us.</span> <span id="s1726">And we decided that we are going to be an organized group, fairly organized, meaning, in a nice column we will set up ourselves, and start marching north.</span> <span id="s1727">We came from the north, we’ll go back north, back on top of the highway.</span> <span id="s1728">We’re right off the highway, which is very close, and then we will march north and see what happens.</span> <span id="s1729">If they ran away, that means the Americans are close, right?</span> <span id="s1730">That was logical answer.</span> <span id="s1731">So we would go toward the Americans.</span> <span id="s1732">Well we did.</span> <span id="s1733">We really put ourselves into a nice column and went up the highway, and it didn’t take us very long and we were stopped by an SS officer and an army officer, who said, “Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1734">This is the front line.</span> <span id="s1735">And who are you?”</span> <span id="s1736">Now they see us with these big green coats, you know, and they could see, obviously the pants and the jackets -- we had the stripes – so they should have known who we were.</span> <span id="s1737">But apparently they had nothing to do with it, so they were not sure who we were.</span> <span id="s1738">So we told them a story that they accepted.</span> <span id="s1739">“Oh,” we said, “We were guarded by these people, they left us, they told us to go back north.”</span> <span id="s1740">It wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s1741">But it was a good story to tell them, you see.</span> <span id="s1742">So, “You can’t go.</span> <span id="s1743">This is the front line.</span> <span id="s1744">We are right here on the front.</span> <span id="s1745">You are disturbing us.</span> <span id="s1746">So, stand here, we’ll tell you in a few minutes what to do.”</span> <span id="s1747">Now the SS officer and the army officer went on the side.</span> <span id="s1748">They went away maybe twenty minute, and they came back.</span> <span id="s1749">Now from what I remember and what all of us figured, the army officer must have been of higher rank.</span> <span id="s1750">Or prevailed somehow.</span> <span id="s1751">And apparently he was the spokesman.</span> <span id="s1752">He said, “Get out of the way, this is the front line.</span> <span id="s1753">Get all of you guys up into the mountains and get out of the road.</span> <span id="s1754">We don’t want you here.”</span> <span id="s1755">They didn’t do any harm to us!</span> <span id="s1756">And he said, “We’ll see later what we will do.</span> <span id="s1757">Just get out of here.”</span> <span id="s1758">Which was one way of saving all our lives, so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">So we did.</span> <span id="s1760">We started walking a path into the mountain.</span> <span id="s1761">We didn’t know where we were going, we just tried to get away -- perpendicular from the road.</span> <span id="s1762">We finally found a place -- if you’ve ever been in the Alps, or seen any pictures --those shepherds’ huts.</span> <span id="s1763">They have walls from the ground up about half-ways, and from here to the top it’s open.</span> <span id="s1764">It’s a good protection for animals, even, too, for humans, for shepherds.</span> <span id="s1765">So this whole group got into one of those huts, and we had still the food boxes that we received -- the Red Cross boxes -- and we ate just a little bit of it, a little sugar, and a little bit of marmalade, what we hadn’t seen through the entire war.</span> <span id="s1766">And we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Now this was Monday, the 30th of April.</span> <span id="s1768">Now during that day, somebody was shooting cannons – just terrible.</span> <span id="s1769">All day long the cannon balls were flying over our heads and we were shaking, we were scared.</span> <span id="s1770">We were afraid that just any minute, something was going to hit us, but where were we going to go?</span> <span id="s1771">We had no way to go.</span> <span id="s1772">The Germans were there, and they will catch us, they’d probably shoot us with machine guns, so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1773">Now that was not bad enough, every so often a German straggler would walk along and look in the hut.</span> <span id="s1774">They were loaded with ammunition, and with grenades.</span> <span id="s1775">A lot of grenades around, and we were afraid that any minute one of these bastards was going to drop a grenade right in the middle of us.</span> <span id="s1776">They didn’t, obviously, otherwise I wouldn’t be sitting here.</span> <span id="s1777">And that’s how the day went.</span> <span id="s1778">That was the end of the day.</span> <span id="s1779">When it got dark, they started to stop shooting.</span> <span id="s1780">You know we were sitting and leaning against the wall, lying on the ground, and some of us fell asleep, and during the night we could hear heavy vehicles going on the highway.</span> <span id="s1781">We’re not very far from the highway, so we were wondering what vehicles were there.</span> <span id="s1782">Obviously, they must have been German, because we saw the Germans the night before, so we didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1783">We stayed there, scared.</span> <span id="s1784">Finally it started to dawn.</span> <span id="s1785">Tuesday morning, first of May, we still heard the cars, the trucks and heavy vehicles, and said, “We have to find out.</span> <span id="s1786">Maybe it’s not the Germans any more.’</span> <span id="s1787">Well, we sent down a scouting group -- two, three people.</span> <span id="s1788">They crawled on all fours down to the road, so they wouldn’t be heard, they wouldn’t be seen.</span> <span id="s1789">They came to the road.</span> <span id="s1790">Guess what?</span> <span id="s1791">American vehicles!</span> <span id="s1792">They came back – running!</span> <span id="s1793">Even though we were all weak, they found the strength, and they came back and started screaming, “Americans!</span> <span id="s1794">Americans!”</span> <span id="s1795">And we, too, picked ourselves up and ran down to the road, and when the Americans saw us, they started throwing candy, and chocolate and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1796">They knew who we were, obviously.</span> <span id="s1797">And we were screaming, “American, American!</span> <span id="s1798">Long Live America!”</span> <span id="s1799">And we thought we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1800">Now you think this is the end.</span> <span id="s1801">By that time we were between a place called Mittenwald and Garmisch Partenkirchen.</span> <span id="s1802">Garmisch is very famous.</span> <span id="s1803">The Olympic Games took place there, the winter Olympics in ’36, with Hitler sitting there.</span> <span id="s1804">It’s really a very pretty mountain town.</span> <span id="s1805">So in spite of our weaknesses -- and we are weak, and we didn’t have enough to eat -- but the strength came to us because we felt we were free.</span> <span id="s1806">So we finally made it, We…</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: You had to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Yes, there was no other way.</span> <span id="s1809">We walked, I don’t know, maybe eight kilometers or so, because Mittenwald and Garmisch must be about fourteen or twelve miles, so we were more than half way.</span> <span id="s1810">So we got to Garmisch.</span> <span id="s1811">It was raining, and the Americans were standing, and believe it or not, they had a Hungarian military group surrounded.</span> <span id="s1812">They were on the German side.</span> <span id="s1813">And the Hungarians with those big moustaches, they had to put all their belongings on the ground, and the Americans say, “Take anything you want!”</span> <span id="s1814">-- to us.</span> <span id="s1815">That’s right.</span> <span id="s1816">In one of those backpacks, I find a chocolate I hadn’t seen for five, six years, and a shirt and other things I could use.</span> <span id="s1817">We couldn’t carry all this.</span> <span id="s1818">And besides, who was interested?</span> <span id="s1819">The Americans said, “Take it!</span> <span id="s1820">Take it!</span> <span id="s1821">Have anything you want!”</span> <span id="s1822">Then they told us to go to a camp -- to a collection point -- so that they would put us up someplace, in some barracks, again.</span> <span id="s1823">And we said “Oh, no!</span> <span id="s1824">No more barracks for us!”</span> <span id="s1825">We’re not going to any camp and barrack.</span> <span id="s1826">They would lock us up there and keep us.”</span> <span id="s1827">So we found a place.</span> <span id="s1828">We found a place first in the back of some laundry, and then we split up into smaller groups, because we couldn’t be all together, and at that time, we didn’t care, you know.</span> <span id="s1829">We just keep close to our closest friends.</span> <span id="s1830">My brother-in-law and I and some other people -- about four or six of us -- we found a place behind a laundry.</span> <span id="s1831">We slept on the floor, but this was probably the sweetest floor that I have ever slept on.</span> <span id="s1832">It was the first day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: What I’d like to know is finally, in the end, who among your family survived and who did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Well, I mentioned before, my father did not survive, my sister did not survive.</span> <span id="s1835">My mother survived, and she wound up in camps in eastern Germany, and she was in Auschwitz, and then she was taken out and transferred from Auschwitz and she was taken to eastern Germany, and she eventually wound up in Thereienstadt.</span> <span id="s1836">And that’s where she survived.</span> <span id="s1837">She was very sick.</span> <span id="s1838">And she was taken to Poland -- back to Radom -- and then, somehow she found out that I was alive and she came to Stuutgart.</span> <span id="s1839">I’m not telling you the details that I heard about her, but when I was on the way to Poland, to bring her, I met somebody who said that she’s on her way which was not necessarily true, but at least saved me from going to Poland, and maybe saved my life, too, who knows, because I had to smuggle through Czechoslovakia and Poland, and that would have been quite difficult.</span> <span id="s1840">So I turned back and she did not come for another six or eight weeks.</span> <span id="s1841">It turned out she was not on her way, but that’s how it turned out.</span> <span id="s1842">So she survived, and she’s not alive any more.</span> <span id="s1843">My wife is one of the few lucky ones.</span> <span id="s1844">Her parents survived, even though her father spent in Auschwitz, one of the longest times of anybody I know.</span> <span id="s1845">He’s not alive any more, either.</span> <span id="s1846">So, my wife’s brother and I were in camp together and we are both here.</span> <span id="s1847">He lives in Minneapolis, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: After the liberation, what did you and the other people in your family who survived, do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: We didn’t know that we were alive -- that we survived, you see.</span> <span id="s1850">I didn’t know anything about my wife.</span> <span id="s1851">I didn’t know anything about my mother.</span> <span id="s1852">The only one I knew was my wife’s brother -- because we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Did you try to go back to Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: That one time, I told you, that I tried to go -- this was when I heard that my mother was alive.</span> <span id="s1855">There was no communication in Germany.</span> <span id="s1856">The post office didn’t function.</span> <span id="s1857">The telephones were not there.</span> <span id="s1858">Who were you going to call, and who were you going to write to, and so on.</span> <span id="s1859">And you didn’t know what happened to these people, right?</span> <span id="s1860">Now the one nice thing happened, and really it’s something that these people deserve a tremendous amount of credit and thanks, are the chaplains -- Jewish chaplains in the American army and maybe British army, too, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1861">One rabbi Klausner in the American army, Chaplain Klausner, he organized, plus all the other chaplains, an enterprise whereby all the survivors were registered.</span> <span id="s1862">And the registry lists were sent out to all the places in the American zone and British zone, and French zone and when the list came, I was naturally looking for my family, and sure enough we found my wife’s mother’s name and my wife’s name on one of the lists.</span> <span id="s1863">And the list also told us where they were, okay?</span> <span id="s1864">Now when I was liberated from the Alps, remember I told you before, about two-thirds or so of the people who were in camp at Vaihingen did not leave Vaihingen, and they were liberated a few days later by the French.</span> <span id="s1865">Now they were free, but I was still in camp for almost three weeks.</span> <span id="s1866">And these people were taken out of this camp, and then the Americans and the French started to organize these camps, and putting them in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s1869">And then they put the Jews in with Jews, and they put Poles and the Ukrainians and Lithuanians and others in.</span> <span id="s1870">So that group of Jews who were in Vaihingen were transported to another place, and eventually they wound up in a place called “Schloss Lagenzlef.”</span> <span id="s1871">It’s a castle not far from Heidelberg in Germany.</span> <span id="s1872">But nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1873">This was already the middle of May.</span> <span id="s1874">But once people started to recover, and everybody had, obviously, lost relatives, or friends, they started, if they could, to travel - by any means.</span> <span id="s1875">There was no order.</span> <span id="s1876">There was a terrible situation, you know.</span> <span id="s1877">The bridges in Germany were all in pieces; the Germans did it, you know, because they tried to prevent the Americans and British on one side, and Russians on the other side from moving.</span> <span id="s1878">There was terrible confusion.</span> <span id="s1879">The trains, obviously were not running on time and they were not running on schedule.</span> <span id="s1880">There was no schedules, really!</span> <span id="s1881">And there was no food to be had, except they had their food rations.</span> <span id="s1882">But yet people traveled!</span> <span id="s1883">They looked!</span> <span id="s1884">They went and maybe went to Poland!</span> <span id="s1885">And they went throughout Germany!</span> <span id="s1886">They went back to camps!</span> <span id="s1887">And little by little, the people who remained in this Vaihingen and eventually wound up in Schloss Lagenzlef, they traveled, too.</span> <span id="s1888">Some of them came to Garmisch, and brought news from Schloss Legenzlef, and said who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Now some people from the British zone maybe found out through word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1890">It was amazing how I found out!</span> <span id="s1891">We found out that the people who were on the list, including my wife and her mother, were in one camp.</span> <span id="s1892">And then somebody said that they might not be in one camp.</span> <span id="s1893">And then somebody said that they might not be in this camp any more, because the camp was liquidated, and they were combined, and they were taken here, and then some people were taken to Sweden -- you know.</span> <span id="s1894">It was amazing how these rumors, and facts were really flying all over the place.</span> <span id="s1895">So they said, “If you really want to find out where to go, how to go, then you go to Schloss Lagenzlef first.</span> <span id="s1896">You’ll get the latest information,” because this became sort of the hub for Radomer.</span> <span id="s1897">So that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1898">I was working by that time for an American military outfit in the officers’ mess -- in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1899">And I got fatigues.</span> <span id="s1900">I got a letter of recommendation saying, “To Whom It May Concern.”</span> <span id="s1901">To give me transportation and food, so by hook and by crook and somehow, I finally made it!</span> <span id="s1902">I came here and I found out, that indeed, the two women were not in the camp that the list said they were, because, after all, the list was old, you see, and things were just so fluid, so they told me they were in a place called Diepholz, and it’s not far from Hanover or Hamburg, in that area.</span> <span id="s1903">I took off again, on coal trains, stopped army trucks, and I couldn’t even speak English.</span> <span id="s1904">I showed the letter, and I found it -- this was finally, by the way, in the British zone, not in the American zone -- so I had to somehow make it there, and I did.</span> <span id="s1905">Took me maybe six days to make the six hundred miles, but I got there.</span> <span id="s1906">And I walk into this place, a dusty place.</span> <span id="s1907">I had to walk maybe a mile from the road to the camp, and here I see from afar, two young women marching toward the road, and as I walk close, my heart starts to pound.</span> <span id="s1908">I said, “My God, that can’t be!</span> <span id="s1909">That can’t be!</span> <span id="s1910">Maybe it is!</span> <span id="s1911">Maybe it isn’t!”</span> <span id="s1912">And sure enough, it was my wife, walking just by pure coincidence, you know, that she was walking on that road.</span> <span id="s1913">However, because of the people traveling back and forth, she already heard a few days before, from somebody who visited Garmisch, that we were alive, you see?</span> <span id="s1914">So she hoped and expected maybe we will get together, but she didn’t know that I was coming -- or maybe somebody did tell her that hey, I was on the way.</span> <span id="s1915">And, can you imagine our meeting?</span> <span id="s1916">They were scheduled to leave a few days before for Sweden -- you see, Sweden had invited some of the survivors, especially women, to come and recover there.</span> <span id="s1917">They had facilities and doctors -- everything possible.</span> <span id="s1918">They were neutral, and before they couldn’t help, but now they wanted to repair their good name, and they let maybe several thousand survivors come, recover, and say good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Anyway, my wife and her mother were scheduled, and I said “scheduled.’</span> <span id="s1920">Because they almost forced them to go, and they said, “No, we are not going, we hope somebody will come here and look for us, so we don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s1921">And they didn’t, and indeed, that’s how I found them.</span> <span id="s1922">So that was the end of the story in so far as looking for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">I also heard about my mother being alive, and she heard about me being alive, and I didn’t know that she knew, and she didn’t know that I knew, yet I went on the road in September, ’45 -- that was around Rosh Hashanah -- and I came to a small town on the Czech border, and just pure coincidence, I see somebody from Radom, and he says to me, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s1924">And I said, “What do you mean, ‘Where am I going?’</span> <span id="s1925">I’m going to my mother.</span> <span id="s1926">I heard my mother’s alive and I’m going to take her to Germany.”</span> <span id="s1927">“You’d be crazy if you went, because she’s on the way.</span> <span id="s1928">She heard about you.”</span> <span id="s1929">I don’t know how he knew, and I don’t even remember who it was, but he meant well.</span> <span id="s1930">He said, “If you go to Radom, you’ll miss her, because she’ll be on the way, so why go?”</span> <span id="s1931">Well, again, I was with two other guys, and so we all talked each other out of going, you know, because the situation was very uncertain.</span> <span id="s1932">Maybe you heard about the pogrom in Chelmno, which is not very far from Radom.</span> <span id="s1933">In spite of the fact that there were very, very few Jews, very, very few survivors, the Poles, the murderous anti-Semites, were still the same anti-Semites as before, so it was not very safe to go.</span> <span id="s1934">So I turned around and went back to Stuttgart, and it took several weeks before my mother made it.</span> <span id="s1935">In that respect, it worked out all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: I have only a couple of questions that I want to ask you very quickly.</span> <span id="s1937">After you did manage, eventually, to find each other, was there any question about where you would go?</span> <span id="s1938">Did you think, for example, about going to Palestine, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Yes, there was a time when we were thinking of going to Palestine, and there was still Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s1940">Well, in order to answer a question, I have to give you again, some background.</span> <span id="s1941">The Radomer group was eventually transferred to a D.P. camp in Stuttgart, all right?</span> <span id="s1942">It so happened, just by pure coincidence, that it was closer to the Vaihingen camp, the “bad” camp.</span> <span id="s1943">They cleared a block of apartment buildings in a certain area, moved the Germans out and moved the D.P.’s in, and that became the camp.</span> <span id="s1944">It was not a closed camp.</span> <span id="s1945">It was an open camp, in nice apartment buildings, and very modern and everything, and eventually we moved there, too, okay?</span> <span id="s1946">When I left, my brother-in-law stayed in Garmisch.</span> <span id="s1947">We couldn’t both go, in case somebody would come and they would start looking for each other.</span> <span id="s1948">So we settled in Stuttgart, and of course the people were talking about going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1949">First of all, we waited for my mother to come.</span> <span id="s1950">And the situation was difficult, because only the single, unattached people they wanted to get.</span> <span id="s1951">They needed to probably build up the Haganah, and get the people to the kibbutzim and different places, so the pressure wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s1952">And then, while we were there, I wanted to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1953">Even though Germany was not my favorite place to go, I figured, I have an opportunity, and I didn’t want to waste any more time.</span> <span id="s1954">I waited six years.</span> <span id="s1955">Was plenty.</span> <span id="s1956">So I applied in Stuttgart in the I.T. and they said it will be quite a while to open.</span> <span id="s1957">So I went to Munich, and they said, yeah, they are opening at a certain time.</span> <span id="s1958">So I said, “Fine.</span> <span id="s1959">I’ll sign up in Munich!”</span> <span id="s1960">And I did.</span> <span id="s1961">My wife was in Stuttgart, we already had an apartment in Stuttgart -- and I found out that Stuttgart was going to open up just maybe two months later, so I registered in Stuttgart, and, indeed in February of ’46 they started classes.</span> <span id="s1962">Now here I started classes, mind you, in a foreign language because German was not my native tongue.</span> <span id="s1963">High school I had graduated in ’38, so that was six years later -- more than that.</span> <span id="s1964">My brain power and everything was, naturally, affected during that time, and, you know, a lot of things happened with my family, with myself, so it was kind of a peculiar time.</span> <span id="s1965">I had to start, basically, from scratch, which I did.</span> <span id="s1966">I signed up for electrical engineering and started working.</span> <span id="s1967">Little by little I got into it and I could handle it.</span> <span id="s1968">(Laughs) I could hack it.</span> <span id="s1969">So then one semester was done, and two semesters, I had a year already done, and then I already had half of the course done.</span> <span id="s1970">Then Israel came into being in ’48.</span> <span id="s1971">My mother remarried in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1972">She found a friend, also from Radom, who lost his wife, and in ’48 they left for -- not Palestine --– it was Israel, okay?</span> <span id="s1973">Israel came into being in May, and they left the end of August, I think.</span> <span id="s1974">So that was, again, separation from my mother, but my wife’s father remained in Germany, yet.</span> <span id="s1975">Okay?</span> <span id="s1976">In the meantime, her mother died.</span> <span id="s1977">And my wife started school, so we wanted to finish school.</span> <span id="s1978">We didn’t have to pay for the school, see, that was one thing that we got the benefit, because we were the survivors.</span> <span id="s1979">That was part, sort of, of the German reparation.</span> <span id="s1980">So we didn’t want to leave and go -- especially as I already have half.</span> <span id="s1981">Now that time, the pressure became a little stronger.</span> <span id="s1982">And they (Israel) tried to really make everybody go, because they needed people.</span> <span id="s1983">I was a Zionist most of my life, and I felt like going, but yet, after wasting a good part of your life in the camps, here you have an opportunity, so they understood.</span> <span id="s1984">I talked to the man in charge, and he said, oh, he understood, and they needed qualified people, too.</span> <span id="s1985">But my wife’s father went to the United States and her brother came to Minneapolis, and my mother was in Israel at that time, and the situation in Israel was just horrible as far as housing and food and jobs -- everything was just very, very bad!</span> <span id="s1986">So I just kept going to school, and by the time I finished it was 1950.</span> <span id="s1987">We sort of signed up to come to the United States, too, and here we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: You followed your wife’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Well, her father.</span> <span id="s1990">Her father came here, too.</span> <span id="s1991">They both came in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: To Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Yeah, in Minnesota.</span> <span id="s1994">We came here a little over a year later.</span> <span id="s1995">We arrived in the United States in September, 1950, and we stayed in New York a few weeks and then came here in the beginning of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Do you maintain contact with other survivors or survivor organizations -- here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Oh yeah, we have friends who are also survivors.</span> <span id="s1998">We have friends in the east –</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Do you have contact with a survivor organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2001">You might want to see, we even have a periodical.</span> <span id="s2002">This is not the latest issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: This is The Voice of Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2005">You read Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: From Bayside, New York.</span> <span id="s2007">No, I’ve never seen these.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: As a matter of fact, it so happens the editor is a friend.</span> <span id="s2009">We just visited him, right in his home at Bayside, a few weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Just a final question.</span> <span id="s2011">Can you describe what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s2013">Personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Yes, personally.</span> <span id="s2015">To you!</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Well, obviously, it meant a lot.</span> <span id="s2017">I’m one of the very few who survived.</span> <span id="s2018">You hear about survivors, you speak about survivors.</span> <span id="s2019">It sounds as if there are thousands and thousands of them, but actually, there are not.</span> <span id="s2020">So I consider myself, on one hand, a lucky person that I survived.</span> <span id="s2021">On the other hand, I feel also a certain mission that we survivors have in telling the story.</span> <span id="s2022">My wife tells it, a very big job.</span> <span id="s2023">I don’t know if you know or not, but she’s one of the main speakers on the Holocaust in this area, and she travels to different universities and colleges and speaks in churches and schools.</span> <span id="s2024">She’s a very articulate person.</span> <span id="s2025">She really brings out the truth about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2026">I think all of us probably have some kind of a guilt feeling, too, because, here I am, I am alive.</span> <span id="s2027">I’m enjoying certain things of life and the benefits of a living person.</span> <span id="s2028">I eventually got my education, and live a fairly decent life.</span> <span id="s2029">I’m enjoying life, and my children.</span> <span id="s2030">But I think about what happened to my closest relatives, my parents, my father, my sister -- all my cousins, and my uncles and aunts -- and just plain strangers -- Jews.</span> <span id="s2031">So why was I destined to be alive and live, and why were they not?</span> <span id="s2032">And so in that respect it’s a very difficult problem to answer, and nobody really knows why.</span> <span id="s2033">It’s not because somebody was smart or clever.</span> <span id="s2034">Basically I think it was a matter of pure luck or just circumstances, coincidences, God knows.</span> <span id="s2035">Maybe the fact that I just met an acquaintance on the border of Czechoslovakia, and he told me my mother was on the way, and she wasn’t but I turned around anyway.</span> <span id="s2036">Maybe that saved my life.</span> <span id="s2037">Who knows?</span> <span id="s2038">Maybe in camp, certain things happened.</span> <span id="s2039">Nobody really knows.</span> <span id="s2040">There’s no explanation why the people who didn’t survive, or some at least, didn’t.</span> <span id="s2041">There were people who were stronger, physically, who probably you would have said that they would probably survive anything, and that those who were weaker and not as healthy would not, and yet just the opposite was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">And so those are nagging questions and probably have no answers.</span> <span id="s2043">What else does it mean?</span> <span id="s2044">It means that maybe we do have an obligation to tell people about it.</span> <span id="s2045">Many people have either no idea whatsoever or very, very limited idea of what happened.</span> <span id="s2046">If you tell people what happened is not only to find some pity or some sympathy or some kind of understanding, but more for the fact that they would be aware.</span> <span id="s2047">For many years, for many years after the war, people didn’t even want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2048">They didn’t want to listen to you if you wanted to talk, and obviously, if you have an audience that doesn’t want to listen, you don’t tell them anything.</span> <span id="s2049">But in the last few years, as you are probably well aware, people started listening, they started asking questions, even school children and students in colleges, and they established chairs and Holocaust lectures, and whole circuits, to the point where some of our Jewish intellectuals come out and are against it, which is, of course, just the other extreme.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Anytime that anybody will ask me to talk about it, I would certainly not turn them down.</span> <span id="s2051">It’s painful, but after so many years you can talk about it in a certain detached manner.</span> <span id="s2052">You can put your pain on the side and tell the story as it was.</span> <span id="s2053">And I feel it’s my obligation, for no other reason than it’s for information and for some kind of enlightenment, and maybe more and more people understand it, the better chance we’ll have that it will never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: How do you feel about the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: Well, I’m still ambivalent about it, because I lived there.</span> <span id="s2056">I can’t have any special love for them.</span> <span id="s2057">I cannot condemn, let’s say, the younger generation unless they are anti-Semitic, and unfortunately that’s what’s happening.</span> <span id="s2058">But there’s one thing that I cannot forgive them -- if they lie and say they -- especially the generation of yesteryear -- they tell you that they didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2059">And we encountered lots of them when we lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s2060">They were telling us, “Oh !</span> <span id="s2061">We didn’t know anything about it!”</span> <span id="s2062">“Just terrible!”</span> <span id="s2063">and “Oh!</span> <span id="s2064">What you went through.”</span> <span id="s2065">“We had no idea!”</span> <span id="s2066">It’s probably true to a certain extent, because they didn’t want to know!</span> <span id="s2067">And yet you can’t help but be very worried about people like this.</span> <span id="s2068">They unfortunately have the tendencies to look for a Fuhrer.</span> <span id="s2069">And if somebody would come probably today and tell them, “We can make you great!”</span> <span id="s2070">as Hitler did.</span> <span id="s2071">I’m not so sure that they wouldn’t go along with it.</span> <span id="s2072">So, maybe it’s a national character or maybe it’s just -- who knows.</span> <span id="s2073">I cannot say that I carry a hate in my heart, because I don’t -- it’s just that I would probably distrust the war generation.</span> <span id="s2074">You still don’t know if they talk to you nicely whether they didn’t have their hands bloodied in some camp or some place where the Jews didn’t mean anything to them.</span> <span id="s2075">So.</span> <span id="s2076">It’s kind of hard to erase it completely from your system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: This
