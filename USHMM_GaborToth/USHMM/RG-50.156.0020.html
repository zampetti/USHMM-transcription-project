HANSON</span></p> <p><span id="s2">BY MICHAEL GREENBERG</span></p> <p><span id="s3">APRIL 20, 1982 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Mr. Hanson, could you tell us a little bit about yourself: when and where you were born - and then could you say something about your family, your community, your early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: I was born in the vicinity of Montevideo, Minnesota, and I graduated from high school in Benson, Minnesota, and from there I went into the service in 1943, and joined the 42nd Rainbow Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about what your family did for a living, and what the community was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: My father was with the R.E.A., the Rural Electrification Association, and my mother worked in a J.C. Penney store.</span> <span id="s8">There’s nothing more I can add to that part of it.</span> <span id="s9">My parents moved from Benson to Granite Falls, which is their present address at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: What exactly was the R.E.A.?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Well, maintaining and constructing of rural electrical facilities.</span> <span id="s12">In other words, all the electrical systems out in the rural areas.</span> <span id="s13">From there my father went on to Granite Falls, and started with Northern States Power, and he retired from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What year did you graduate from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: In the mid to late ‘30s, do you remember how aware people were in your community or your family of what was going on in Europe?</span> <span id="s17">The rise of Nazi Germany, and Hitler, and how people might have viewed it?</span> <span id="s18">Did they view it as a threat to the United States, a danger, something that would affect this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: (Sigh) Every once in a while something would crop up that would be kind of alarming, but I’m afraid people just didn’t take it seriously.</span> <span id="s20">They just didn’t think that this sort of thing was really happening.</span> <span id="s21">They heard it and they dismissed it.</span> <span id="s22">I guess probably because it wasn’t at their back door or something.</span> <span id="s23">And I guess that’s exactly what I did, too.</span> <span id="s24">I just didn’t think that it was going to amount to what it did.</span> <span id="s25">That’s about the size of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: So, did you enlist or were you drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I enlisted.</span> <span id="s28">I was about to be drafted, so we supposedly were able to select - or have more of a selection - as a result of enlisting (Laughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: So you were 18 or 19 years old at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: 18 years old and right out of high school, and you enlisted in the Army.</span> <span id="s32">Do you remember what it was like when war broke out in Europe in 1939?</span> <span id="s33">Do you remember that time?</span> <span id="s34">Do you remember how your family felt, what their attitude was?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: There again, I think it was taken lightly, because it wasn’t really affecting us too much, and we thought it was a terrible thing that was happening, and too bad, the same usual comments.</span> <span id="s36">But nobody got particularly excited about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did people speculate that the United States might enter the war because Great Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: There was talk that, yes, it might be possible.</span> <span id="s39">But it just didn’t look like it was going to be a very strong possibility in the near future.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Do you think that people perceived Germany in 1939 at the outbreak of the war as a threat to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No I don’t.</span> <span id="s42">Nobody seemed to be very alarmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Can you tell me about your recollection of Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, Pearl Harbor was something that really put the American people to thinking and put ‘em into gear, into action.</span> <span id="s45">Everybody that was eligible to do so, they wanted to do their part, because they’d had their feathers ruffled, and they wanted to square things up.</span> <span id="s46">And as far as the war in Europe was concerned, I think by that time, when we committed our forces, we were very ready to do what we had to do in order to stop this fellow in Germany, because obviously, he was getting way out of hand, way out of line.</span> <span id="s47">His motives for what he was doing, there wasn’t any good reason for it.</span> <span id="s48">It was obvious that he had visions of delight as far as going after the world, and he needed to be stopped.</span> <span id="s49">And, as far as the Americans were concerned, they were ready to do it!</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Do you think even in late 1941, the people that you know saw Germany as a threat to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I think perhaps we were starting to consider that a possibility, because he was just spreading out too much, and the trouble that he was giving England.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: The years 1939, 1940, 1941, do you remember seeing anything in the newspapers or hearing anything over the radio about the nature of Germany’s occupation of France and the various countries they took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No.</span> <span id="s54">I don’t recall anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Again, if we could get back again to the time you entered the armed forces, do you remember the day that you were inducted?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I believe it was in June, 1943.</span> <span id="s57">I’m not sure of the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Could you tell me where you were inducted and where you went for basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I went to Minneapolis for the swearing in and so on, and from there we went to Camp Goobalah, Oklahoma and received our basic training, and stayed there until we were shipped overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And it was after basic training that you were assigned to the 42nd Rainbow Division?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No.</span> <span id="s62">We were in the 42nd Rainbow during our basic training, and what happened was that we had a lot of people that were shipped out, as replacements.</span> <span id="s63">And the 42nd didn’t move out as a unit until a later date.</span> <span id="s64">We were prepared to go, but they didn’t take everybody, they took like maybe, enlisted men who had a great deal of rank, and took cadres, so to speak, and so then they brought in some more people, and we trained them in turn.</span> <span id="s65">That happened a couple of times.</span> <span id="s66">Then, when we got to reserve strength, got everybody trained, we went as a unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What was your rank when you went overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I was a Staff Sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: This was in the infantry?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Right.</span> <span id="s71">Heavy weapons infantry, machine guns.</span> <span id="s72">In our company, there was two types of weapons.</span> <span id="s73">There was 81 mm mortars and there was a water-cooled 30-calibre heavy machine gun.</span> <span id="s74">I happened to be in the 2nd Platoon, which was a machine gun platoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Could you give me a little bit of what happened when you went overseas?</span> <span id="s76">Where you started, campaigns you were involved with, and if you could, try and give me some dates and places, like where did you first land, what time of the year was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I can remember (laughter) very well the first time we went up to the front.</span> <span id="s78">It was on Christmas Eve, 1944.</span> <span id="s79">(Laughter) It wasn’t a very good Christmas.</span> <span id="s80">On the 9th of December, we unloaded at Marseilles, France, and after spending a little time in a makeshift processing area, where we lived in tents on top of gravel, we proceeded to Strasbourg, which had been held by elements of the 36th Division.</span> <span id="s81">This was across the Rhine River from the German lines.</span> <span id="s82">We continued on about 10 miles further north to replace elements of the 79th Division, which had just withdrawn from the German border.</span> <span id="s83">Our first encounter with the Germans happened to be my section of machine guns.</span> <span id="s84">That was the 6th of January.</span> <span id="s85">We had withdrawn a short distance to stabilize our main line of resistance, and for our own safety, because we were kind of out on a point.</span> <span id="s86">We dug our gun positions, and right after we dug them, it seemed like fate was with us, because it snowed real hard, and so it covered up all our dirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Were the Germans at this time attacking?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: They were sending out patrols looking for us.</span> <span id="s89">It was a strong combat patrol of 20 Germans.</span> <span id="s90">They all had automatic weapons, they were in a half-track.</span> <span id="s91">This was early in the morning, and you couldn't see anything yet, but you could hear this clinking of the chains on the half-track, so I alerted my people and we watched and listened very carefully, trying to figure out what was going on.</span> <span id="s92">After a whole lot of noise and confusion and Germans talking and so on, we were able to make out forms coming our way, so I called the adjacent units and told them that they were proceeding right straight toward us, and that everybody should hold their fire until we opened up, because we could get ‘em in a crossfire and put ‘em out of commission.</span> <span id="s93">Which is what we did.</span> <span id="s94">All but two of them were dead.</span> <span id="s95">That was the first time we had encountered the Germans, so it worked out quite well for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: You were in charge of the platoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: That was a section.</span> <span id="s98">My section of machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: How many men was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: About 15, 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: We were down in Hagenow area and we had our gun positions in a heavy woods and General von Rustedt was in front of us.</span> <span id="s103">This was the attack that was coordinated with Bastogne.</span> <span id="s104">They shelled us for three days and three nights and they knocked the entire woods down.</span> <span id="s105">We lost a lot of people - not necessarily so many deaths as there were wounds from tree bursts.</span> <span id="s106">If you were in a hole, it didn’t help you any, which is a bad thing about being in the woods, because they just shoot into the trees and they get tree bursts, and the rounds are much more effective than if they hit the ground.</span> <span id="s107">So we had 85% casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were you wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Not there.</span> <span id="s110">At a later time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, my platoon leader, Lt. Janke, was killed, on account of a little rescue mission.</span> <span id="s113">He was a real good personal friend of mine.</span> <span id="s114">He was the first officer in the 42nd Rainbow Division to receive the Distinguished Service Cross, so we were quite proud in spite of the loss.</span> <span id="s115">He was an officer that was one of the men.</span> <span id="s116">He didn’t sit with the officers, and eat with the officers, he ate with the men.</span> <span id="s117">That was the kind of a guy he was.</span> <span id="s118">So he was real popular with the enlisted people, as you can understand.</span> <span id="s119">They all felt a real loss, when we lost him!</span></p> <p><span id="s120">The next thing of any importance was that Task Force Linden was organized.</span> <span id="s121">This was an Army mobile unit designed to move fast.</span> <span id="s122">It had a lot of fire power.</span> <span id="s123">We did a lot of spearheading.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: At this time you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Were there any other major battles that you could tell us a little bit about?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes, we were in the city of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s128">That was street fighting, and it was real difficult.</span> <span id="s129">They had cement pillboxes, a great deal of snipers, and tall buildings, so it was real difficult to finally get an area cleared out.</span> <span id="s130">You lost a lot of people in that type of fighting, and we did.</span> <span id="s131">The way you can get those snipers out was to bring up your tank destroyers and shoot ‘em out of there, just obliterate the buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: (Looking at photo) Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Schweinfurt, the ballbearing factory.</span> <span id="s134">We perched outside the city and we watched the Air Force totally annihilate the city.</span> <span id="s135">It was a sight to behold.</span> <span id="s136">(Laughter) All you could see was vapor trails from the planes.</span> <span id="s137">All of us were up on very high ground, and we looked down on this huge, sprawling city, and pretty soon everything turned to dust, and when the dust settled back down again, why it was gone!</span> <span id="s138">It was really weird!</span> <span id="s139">Those Air Force guys put those things jut practically right the way they wanted ‘em; they knew there was infantry dug in and around the city.</span> <span id="s140">Our next move was toward Nuremberg around the 18th of March.</span> <span id="s141">That was a coordinated attack with the 45th Division.</span> <span id="s142">The two Divisions had organized and set up a trap which allowed us to encircle the city and slowly clean it out at our own discretion.</span> <span id="s143">We took a lot of prisoners in there.</span> <span id="s144">Things were getting bad, and they were really coming out.</span> <span id="s145">But by the same token, there was always a certain amount of diehards and you could never feel free in moving around, because they just kept shooting until you killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Let me ask you some other kinds of questions now, if I may.</span> <span id="s147">You had this experience, eventually, of what was considered to be a concentration camp liberator, a part of the military that came upon the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s148">During the time that you were in the service, did you hear or read or see any material about Nazi arrests, mass arrests of people, about deportations?</span> <span id="s149">Did you hear anything about concentration camps, about the treatment of prisoners or about civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: We had gotten some information relating to that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you recall what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I think, probably, where most of our information came from at that time was the good old Stars and Stripes, the overseas paper and word of mouth from civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What civilians were those?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Your German nationals, and the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Do you recall what they talked about, or what they told you?</span> <span id="s156">Can you recall what you read in the Stars and Stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: The German people, when they were talking about the concentration camps, all they would ever say about it that we could understand was that “alles todt,” - “everybody’s dead.”</span> <span id="s158">I’m sure they said some things that if we could have understood, we’d have known a little bit more about what they were saying, but the only thing that we could ever make out about it is that nobody ever got out of there.</span> <span id="s159">Everybody died!</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did it seem incredible to you at the time?</span> <span id="s161">A place where nobody ever came out alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: This was getting to be more and more something that we almost feared!</span> <span id="s163">Because we just couldn’t believe that such a place existed!</span> <span id="s164">It was hard to comprehend, such a thing.</span> <span id="s165">As far as Stars and Stripes is concerned, I saw they had some pictures - this was in France - of some people that were hanging in a concentration camp, and they had sewn their eyelids open, so the people could never close their eyes, and left them that way.</span> <span id="s166">And we saw some pictures of people that they’d hung on meat hooks through the jaw, and left them to die like that, which of course took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did Stars and Stripes talk about this kind of treatment towards Jews or towards other groups like gypsies, like Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: The majority of the victims were the Jewish people, and there was a lot of Poles, and French.</span> <span id="s169">Some Russians.</span> <span id="s170">That constituted about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Let me ask you, what camp or camps did you come upon?</span> <span id="s172">What was your experience as a liberator?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: We were in this Task Force Linden, and on the 29th of April we entered the concentration camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s174">And of course the thing that comes to my mind first of all, the thing that I see right away when I think of this place, is the trainload of human bodies, going into the prison, which was sitting on the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: There was a trainload of people that were arriving?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: They had arrived there, yes.</span> <span id="s177">But they were all dead.</span> <span id="s178">Fifty-two cars of human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Was it that the cars were locked and they couldn’t get out?</span> <span id="s180">Did they die of starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: They died of starvation.</span> <span id="s182">Those that tried to get out were machine gunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Fifty-two cars of people.</span> <span id="s184">Do you know how many people were in each car?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: So that when they laid down, why the floor was entirely covered - and piled up little bit on top of each other - so of course there was much more than what there should have been in there, you know.</span> <span id="s186">On this entire train, this line of boxcars - fifty-two boxcars - going into the prison, there was one survivor I walked by.</span> <span id="s187">I couldn’t believe that I heard a noise, but I did hear a noise - I knew that later - I did hear a noise, and it was this survivor.</span> <span id="s188">It was this guy.</span> <span id="s189">Here he is.</span> <span id="s190">That’s him.</span> <span id="s191">(Picture) I walked by, because I didn’t believe there could be anybody alive, like this.</span> <span id="s192">This is the boxcars here, and there’s the bodies!</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: These were carloads of Jews, I can see.</span> <span id="s194">There’s a Star of David on the boxcars.</span> <span id="s195">What led up to your coming into the camp?</span> <span id="s196">Do you remember what that day was like, where you came from?</span> <span id="s197">Did you approach the camp on foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: This task force Linden was a mobile outfit.</span> <span id="s199">Our machine guns were mounted on vehicles, on jeeps, and that’s how we got there first.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So you were the first platoon to arrive a Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: As far as I know!</span> <span id="s202">There was nobody in front of us!</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: And, by the time you got there, the Germans had fled?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Some of them had.</span> <span id="s205">We had a little trouble with sporadic fire, but by that time, of course, some had even put on prison clothes!</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: What was the very first thing that you saw upon entering what was the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: That train.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did you know immediately - you could tell - that there was something wrong about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: You just couldn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s210">We just couldn’t believe what we were seeing!</span> <span id="s211">These people being alongside the boxcars, that had been shot and falling off, and those that had all died on the inside and were hanging out of the door openings.</span> <span id="s212">We couldn’t comprehend how bad these concentration camps were until we saw this thing!</span> <span id="s213">It’s impossible until you see this - until you smell it!</span> <span id="s214">The smell is something you never forget!</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: They say that the survivors feel the same way - that it’s the kind of experience that you can’t ever describe.</span> <span id="s216">This is an important part of the interview right now.</span> <span id="s217">If you can, describe the physical layout of the camp, the grounds, any buildings.</span> <span id="s218">Do you remember seeing any kind of quarters, barracks, other facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s220">We saw the barracks.</span> <span id="s221">And they’re like long warehouses, almost.</span> <span id="s222">We saw the crematoria.</span> <span id="s223">The ovens were warm yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did you find any bodies or skeletal remains in the ovens, or ashes?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: There was ashes in the ovens, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Can you remember how big the crematoria was?</span> <span id="s227">How many ovens you might have seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: It seems to me there was three ovens.</span> <span id="s229">When you’re in the infantry, particularly if you’re a spearhead, you secure the ground, the area, the territory, the real estate, whatever you want to call it, and move on!</span> <span id="s230">This, in fact, is what we really did do at this time.</span> <span id="s231">As much as we would like to have spent more time to witness all about this place, we just didn’t because we had to move out!</span> <span id="s232">We were there about an hour - that’s about all.</span> <span id="s233">And then of course, your other elements that come after you, they get to spend the time and take the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Do you recall seeing any survivors where you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s236">There were some survivors in the compound.</span> <span id="s237">And they kissed our feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Do you have any idea - I know you were there for a short time - how many survivors, approximately, do you recall seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: This particular compound that we were in, I supposed there must have been 250, 300 in there.</span> <span id="s240">But there were others.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Do you remember what their physical condition was?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Some of them were terrible.</span> <span id="s243">Some of them crawled!</span> <span id="s244">They were nothing but skin and bones!</span> <span id="s245">You wonder how a person could move, to make his body go.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: When you say “skin and bones” do you mean that literally?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: You bet!</span> <span id="s248">I mean just nothing left!</span> <span id="s249">Nothing left!</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Do you remember what their dress was?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Ragged prison garb.</span> <span id="s252">Just rags of any kind.</span> <span id="s253">Some of it looked like burlap.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You said that most of them crawled...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Crawled.</span> <span id="s256">And they helped each other.</span> <span id="s257">Some, who perhaps hadn’t been there as long, were able to walk.</span> <span id="s258">Very thin, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Were you able to communicate with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, no!</span> <span id="s261">We had one Polack in the group and what a time he had, because there was some Polacks in there.</span> <span id="s262">And he talked with ‘em in there, and that was a real moving thing, because they just cried and hugged him and kissed him, and it was just terrific.</span> <span id="s263">He, incidentally, had a nervous breakdown after this happened.</span> <span id="s264">This soldier, we had to send him to the rear, because he couldn't hack it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You talked about the boxcars.</span> <span id="s266">Were there other dead that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I should say!</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Do you have any idea how many dead?</span> <span id="s269">And where did you find them in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: (Sigh) This one particular building, it may have been a place like after they were gassed or something, that they put them in.</span> <span id="s271">They laid them in a pile like that.</span> <span id="s272">These bodies were waiting fro the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did you see the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: We maybe did, but I didn’t recognize them as being such.</span> <span id="s275">There again, the lack of time, and a chance to go over things like you’d like to - we weren’t able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Getting back to the boxcars.</span> <span id="s277">You said that there were 52.</span> <span id="s278">Do you have any idea, on the average, how many people were in a boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: (Sighing) What should I say ...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Were there 50?</span> <span id="s281">Were there 100?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I’d like to say 50.</span> <span id="s283">This European boxcar is smaller than ours.</span> <span id="s284">There they call ‘em the “40 &amp; 8.”</span> <span id="s285">So 50 people in there would be very crowded!</span> <span id="s286">They’d be just stuffed in there like animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Were there any guards, or any other personnel, in the camp when it was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: There was some, yes.</span> <span id="s289">I never could figure out exactly why they stuck around.</span> <span id="s290">But there were some of them that did.</span> <span id="s291">They gave us a little trouble, which we were able to overcome.</span> <span id="s292">The prisoners were real happy to “accommodate” them when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How many would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: This one particular group was about 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Were they guards?</span> <span id="s296">In German uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Some of them had prison garb on.</span> <span id="s298">They put it on in an attempt to get away with something, or to get out of the camp perhaps.</span> <span id="s299">We were never quite sure why they were there when we got there - but they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Can you describe them, and their behavior at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: They were real arrogant.</span> <span id="s302">Like we were doing something wrong and we were interfering at this camp!</span> <span id="s303">It didn’t appear to them like they had any kind of guilt at all!</span> <span id="s304">It’s like, everything was perfectly normal, and what were we doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did that seem incredible to you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh, it absolutely did!</span> <span id="s307">No way we could understand such a thing.</span> <span id="s308">We couldn’t figure what kind of people they were.</span> <span id="s309">We couldn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s310">The German people that we had come in contact with were very normal people.</span> <span id="s311">Exactly like us!</span> <span id="s312">With the exception of these.</span> <span id="s313">They weren’t people.</span> <span id="s314">(Pause) I don’t know how one man can become so calloused toward another man and have absolutely no compassion and regard for feelings!</span> <span id="s315">The punishment inflicted on these people was just absolutely (groans) indescribable!</span> <span id="s316">They had this sex doctor, too, in Dachau, and for all practical purposes guess he must have been nearly insane, because some of the terrible things that he performed...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Do you recall who that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I don’t remember the doctor’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: It wasn’t Mengele, was it?</span> <span id="s320">Mengele is a rather infamous doctor who performed all kinds of experiments...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I can’t be sure.</span> <span id="s322">I can’t give you a good answer, because like I say, if I’d had more time at the camp, I could have gotten acquainted with a little bit of what was happening there.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Again, when you got into the compound, aside from the boxcars, did you know that most of the inmates there were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s325">They were so emaciated, you couldn’t really tell what they were as far as their appearances, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Sometimes some of the prisoners wore the Star of David on their prison clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yes, that’s true.</span> <span id="s328">Yes, some of them did have them.</span> <span id="s329">But by the same token, a lot of them didn’t have them, too.</span> <span id="s330">It had gotten to the point in life to where even that wasn’t important anymore, you know, so many didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s331">But there was always a majority there, of course, of Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Again, you said that for the most part there wasn’t any communication; can you recall anybody in the unit that was able to communicate with any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s334">My commander of this unit that I was in, Captain Wolfert, was a full-blooded German, and spoke it very fluently, and he of course could converse.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: With the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s337">Now some of the survivors that were in there, of course, they had been in Germany enough, and around Germans and so on, so that they could handle the German language good enough to get by.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: By way of your commander, did you hear what any of the survivors said to you or to your commander about their experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: There again, we were unable to take the time for an interview.</span> <span id="s340">The only thing that may have been said was a simple thing like, “How long have you been here?”</span> <span id="s341">or “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s342">or so on.</span> <span id="s343">And they were so overjoyed in seeing somebody else that they were just beside themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: In the short time you were there, did you or any of your group come upon any records or documents or photographs or films or similar materials in the camp that might have been the property of the Germans, the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I understood that, yes, that they did get hold of some documents.</span> <span id="s346">We did not.</span> <span id="s347">It was not our job.</span> <span id="s348">We couldn’t understand why the documents hadn’t been burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Who are “they?”</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: The people in the rear echelon.</span> <span id="s351">Maybe your regimental headquarters, your division headquarters, units that can only operate in your rear areas because of the nature of their work.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: So, specifically, you wouldn’t be able to tell us exactly what these documents were or what was done with them or where they are now?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No, we didn’t handle them.</span> <span id="s354">I couldn’t tell you where they are at now.</span> <span id="s355">I did hear that there were some documents that had been uncovered by our people, and I don’t know the nature of them now, or where they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: What happened right after you left Dachau?</span> <span id="s357">You said you were there for about an hour, then you had to move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: We moved out.</span> <span id="s359">We moved outside of the city, and we stopped.</span> <span id="s360">Our reason for doing that sot of thing is if there’s a counterattack or something, we were there to stop that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s361">And then we proceeded down to Munich, and we were in Munich as a reserve force, so we had a little bit of a breather spell.</span> <span id="s362">It had been a long time since we had had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Let me just ask you, your war experience in general and certainly your experience in Dachau, do you think it had some kind of impact on your life?</span> <span id="s364">Do you think it changed your thinking, or do you think it changed your life in any kind of way?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I think, probably it allowed me to mistrust people a little bit more than I ever did before, after seeing how they can become to one another.</span> <span id="s366">I think I lost a lot of trust in people.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Was it difficult for you to contemplate going back to war when you were called back and went to Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Because I knew where I’d been!</span> <span id="s369">You bet!</span> <span id="s370">The worst time in my life was when I was on that ship, after we left California, and we went on to Korea.</span> <span id="s371">That was bad, because I knew!</span> <span id="s372">A lot of the young guys who were on there, they didn’t know where they were going, what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: People like you, though - people who have survived the war - in the sense that you were witness to man’s inhumanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: I’m happy to be alive so that I can shed any light on this material for these archives.</span> <span id="s375">I’m real happy to be able to be a part of it.</span></p></body></html>
