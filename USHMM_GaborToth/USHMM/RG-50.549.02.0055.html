ask is the full names of your parents and -- and siblings, and where they were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: O-Okay.</span> <span id="s17">My father -- My father’s name was Oscar von Halle.</span> <span id="s18">He was born in Rustock, Germany, moved to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s19">He was an architect.</span> <span id="s20">He -- He -- He di -- He left Germany with our family in 1933, as soon as Hitler came to power, and stayed in -- he left Germany and went to Amsterdam, Holland.</span> <span id="s21">We stayed in Amsterdam, Holland from 1933, throughout the war.</span> <span id="s22">He didn’t see the end of the war.</span> <span id="s23">He was arrested while we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s24">My mother and I escaped, and he stayed in a Dutch concentration camp for some time, and then was transported to Auschwitz, and died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s25">My mother ba -- she was born, her name was Henrietta von Halle, maiden name was Cohen, she was born in Berlin.</span> <span id="s26">She -- After marrying my father, she moved to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s27">Same thing, in 1933, with my father, and my brother and I, moved to Amsterdam, and she survived the war, after having been in hiding for several years, and came to the United States in 1946, and died here in the United States.</span> <span id="s28">She was a -- She was a nurse during World War One, treating German soldiers, and when she came to the United States, she became a baby nurse, took care of several important families, including Senator Javitz’ children, she -- she was the baby nurse for them, and died here.</span> <span id="s29">My brother, his name was Hans dash Yurgen von Halle.</span> <span id="s30">He was born in Hamburg in 1921, moved to, with my family obviously, moved to Amsterdam in 1933, went to s -- high school -- to primary school and high school there.</span> <span id="s31">And he was one of the very first Jews, together with me, who were arrested in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s32">The year was 1941, we were -- there were 250 young German Jews arrested, and underline the word German, only German Jews, between the ages of 16 and 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: May I ask you why do you think that it was only German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: At that time the Germans had a system.</span> <span id="s35">They felt if they could get first rid of German Jews, that wouldn’t disturb the Dutch Jews too much.</span> <span id="s36">The one thing they didn’t want is any kind of -- I don’t want to call it an uprising, but they didn’t want any trouble.</span> <span id="s37">And by taking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a group of Jews.</span> <span id="s38">They didn’t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the German Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another little group, then another little group.</span> <span id="s39">There was always a group, so that everybody else still felt, “Oh my God, thank goodness they didn’t take me.”</span> <span id="s40">And this was the German mode of operation, one group at a time.</span> <span id="s41">Then they took people who were not married.</span> <span id="s42">It was young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married.</span> <span id="s43">You know, it was always a group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: It makes me wonder, between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews, before that time, did you communicate with the other Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Oh yes, indeed, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Could you talk about that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well the -- the -- the Jews of Holland were very liberal in their -- in their -- in their life, at -- it -- they -- we had perfect communication, there was no difference between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s48">There was no anti-Semitism that I was aware of.</span> <span id="s49">I spoke fluently Dutch, so did my brother.</span> <span id="s50">And nobody ever asked, you know, where were you born.</span> <span id="s51">We were -- We were Jews, living in Holland.</span> <span id="s52">As fact, we were living next door to Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s53">Anne Frank and I grew up together, and our history is almost identical.</span> <span id="s54">Yo -- Which of course I have recorded previously, at the -- at the Holocaust Museum in -- in Washington and -- etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: The Frank family, were they distinctive in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s57">He was -- He was a businessman who started -- who was a successful businessman in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s58">He -- He came to Holland, and to Amsterdam, and started a new business, and it was in that business of his, on the princinkraft which -- where the family and some other people were hiding.</span> <span id="s59">It was in his business, and of course the story is well known, I’m not going to go through that story.</span> <span id="s60">He was -- He was an average businessman, and the girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And he was friends with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s63">I would not say they were -- we were friends.</span> <span id="s64">We were -- We knew each other, let’s put it that way, and that’s about -- don’t forget the girls -- Anne was six or seven years younger than I was, and when I came to Amsterdam, I was 11, and Anne was five.</span> <span id="s65">And as an 11 year old boy, you do not have too much connections with a five year old girl.</span> <span id="s66">And even though her sister was, I think, two years older, but she also was much younger.</span> <span id="s67">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: How about your pre-war recollection then, of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: None -- Well, except for the fact that Hitler came to power in 1933, in -- I believe it was January, and of course we had -- the Nazi movement was very active in Germany, and as far as that is concerned, we -- we were -- I wa -- I wouldn’t say suffering, it was 1933, we were very much aware of what the Nazi movement was all about.</span> <span id="s70">And my father decided -- he was a very successful architect in Hamburg, he decided he didn’t want his two sons to grow up under this regime, and therefore made the sacrifice of leaving his successful business, and went to Holland, where in Holland we were not allowed to work.</span> <span id="s71">Anyways, he was not allowed to work.</span> <span id="s72">You could live there, but you could not work there, that was the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How did you make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well, my father -- my father worked, you might call it illegally, for a Dutch bank, was a private ban -- it was a -- in -- in -- in Europe you have a lot of these private banks, it’s not like Chase-Manhattan here, or so, it was just a littl -- little private bank, it so happened it was owned by a member of the family, that bank.</span> <span id="s75">And my mother, she took in people to live with us, borders.</span> <span id="s76">She took in borders and so, between those two, we made a -- a -- just barely a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Do you remember feeling poor, or were you glad to be in Holland, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, we never felt poor.</span> <span id="s79">It is true that we did not have a lot of things that other people had, in other words, we didn’t own a car, or you know, we f-finally were able to get a bicycle, my brother and I, each.</span> <span id="s80">And -- But I never felt poor, even though I think we were poor, but we never felt poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And your experience in the Dutch schools was?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, was perfect.</span> <span id="s83">I -- I loved it, I was good at it.</span> <span id="s84">My -- My best subject was Dutch.</span> <span id="s85">I -- I -- I got the highest -- the highest numbers in -- in -- in Dutch language, and I -- and I spoke almost without an accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: As you do now, so -- now, in going into wartime and the connections, your connections with the underground, with the Dutch underground --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: I know at one time you mentioned that the underground found you and your mother hiding in a haystack?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, no, that -- yes, we were hiding in a haystack, but we were on a -- my father -- my father, my mother and I -- that was after my brother already had been killed.</span> <span id="s90">We’re taking about the year 1942, my father, my mother and I went to a farmhouse, in the southern part of Holland, a province of Limberg, and there was a problem there, there was another family that came, a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive young lady.</span> <span id="s91">Her husband was an accountant, and he looked -- I don’t know how those two ever got married, he was the opposite from her, and she started an affair with the farmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstances, and the wife of the farmer found out about it, and she -- they had children, and in her despair, and I can’t blame her, she went to the Gestapo and told them what the problem was, and so one day, while we were all sitting for ouch -- we were sitting down at dinner time, I look -- we looked out the window, and there were four or five Gestapo agents driving up and coming -- you know, running into the building.</span> <span id="s92">And Mr. Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out the back door.</span> <span id="s93">My father went up -- went up in the attic, and my mother went into the bedroom and I went into a bathroom.</span> <span id="s94">I mean, it’s -- it’s not a bathroom as we know it in America, it’s you know, it’s just a toilet, and there was a little ledge, and I was hiding behind the ledge.</span> <span id="s95">And they arrested my father, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my mother and I, we -- it’s a long story, really, but she was hiding in a closet, and they -- they opened up every closet in the house and finally they -- to make a very long story short, there’s much more to it, but during the night, I put up a ladder against the house and ma -- got my mother out of the window, and then we went into a haystack, and then after that, there was a young girl -- this was way past midnight -- a young girl of the Dutch -- of the Dutch underground, sh-she probably was no more than 16 or 17 years old, came on a bicycle to tell us that the -- th-the Germans were aware that they were -- that they had missed two more Jews, that’s my mother and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter, and so they were on their way back.</span> <span id="s96">So, we were in a haystack, yes, but only for about a couple of hours, until the young girl came, and we had to leave there.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I wanted to ask you what your experiences all together were, with the Dutch underground, and if you were aided by any other philanthropic agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No.</span> <span id="s99">I had no -- I did not have much experience with the Dutch underground, as a fact, I didn’t even know who that young girl was.</span> <span id="s100">I found out much later, that she was a member of the un -- I mean, a member of the underground, and the -- the person who had originally -- was helping us, and we were hiding in his apartment before we went down to the farmhouse, was a professor.</span> <span id="s101">I obm -- I went to college for one year, and he was one of the professors --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Where did you go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: In Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s104">It’s a engineering college, which I really wasn’t interested in engineering, but my father thought I should be in -- in architecture, which I didn’t want, and so I wound up in -- in engineering, which I didn’t want either, but that’s a long story.</span> <span id="s105">And so, I didn’t know, I had no idea until much, much later, that Mr. -- that my di -- professor, whose name was Mr. Initout, was a member of the Dutch underground.</span> <span id="s106">He never told me.</span> <span id="s107">It was much later, towards the end of the war, and it was when we -- when we fled the farmhouse, we -- we went back to Amsterdam, and back to Mr. Initout, where we were originally, in his small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Did he know you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I made a telephone call from that -- from the train station, and told them what had happened, that my father was arrested, and -- you know, and he was -- he -- he was absolutely great, without giving it a minute thought, he told us to come right over, which wasn’t so easy because, remember, we were Jews, and I -- I look pretty Jewish, and we -- every Jew was supposed to wear a yellow star, which -- which we wore, but not after we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s110">And so here we’re in Amsterdam without the Jewish star, and we were not allowed to be on a -- on a -- on a -- on a bus or -- or tram, as they call it in Amsterdam, so we had -- we walked all the way from Amsterdam central, to Amsterdam west.</span> <span id="s111">As fact, he lived only a few blocks from where Anne Frank was hiding.</span> <span id="s112">So actually, Anne Frank, after we went into hiding, we -- known -- unbeknown to each other, we were very, very close to each other, in -- in distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Is that when your mother and you began to live together silently in the one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: In one room.</span> <span id="s115">We lived in one room from 19 -- we lived in that room for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s116">Never saw the light, never saw -- I mean, I saw light, but never saw the sunshine coming, never ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: There was no window in this room?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: There was a -- There was a window, yeah, you -- you could see the light, but you were never exposed to the sunshine.</span> <span id="s119">In other words, as you know, in this country, or in most civilized countries, if you’re in prison, you’re allowed at least one hour a day of exercise, and -- and being exposed to sunlight and -- and -- and etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s120">We have not been out of that room for two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Wa -- Ya -- I -- I heard your story, and hearing it, I was so curious that there could be all these people coming to visit him, and him a member of the underground, and yet they -- are you sure they did not know, or did they just not tell that they knew that you and your mother were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, I can’t -- The only thing -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s123">I don’t know the answer to that.</span> <span id="s124">I know that his brother-in-law knew that we were there because -- and there -- I’m sure there were some other people that knew about it, who he felt he could trust.</span> <span id="s125">But the -- the sad part of the story is that four weeks, or approximately four weeks before the end of the war, he was caught by the Germans on one of his missions, he was on a mission, I don’t know wh-what his mission was, and he was caught and he was executed.</span> <span id="s126">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How did you and your mother find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: We -- There was, again, somebody from the underground who came to the house, t-to tell us that terrible news.</span> <span id="s129">His wife, incidentally, had died about a year before, but she died of natural causes.</span> <span id="s130">So I can’t -- So we were just informed of it, and we had to, again, in a big, big hurry, to leave -- leave the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And how was it arranged where you would go next?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: That was another -- Again, I can’t tell -- through the underground, now, I don’t know much about it, they had a -- a name and an address for us, it was another teacher and his wife, who I’d never met, never heard their name mentioned, and that’s where we spent the last four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And by that time, were the professor’s children teenagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yeah, they were -- they had a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s135">The girl was -- The boy was my age, and the girl was maybe two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: What was your relationship, if any, with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, was a very good relationship.</span> <span id="s138">Y-You -- You can imagine living in -- in -- you know, it was a small apartment.</span> <span id="s139">They had -- There were three bedrooms, I believe, and one was occupied by the -- by the parents, one was occupied by the brother and sister, who had separate bedrooms, but because of -- because of us coming there, they had to share the -- a bedroom, and then my mother and I shared the other bedroom, and so it’s been a --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So they knew you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s142">Oh yes, oh yes, they were -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did they bring you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Oh yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s145">Well, of course, food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire war experience was the last six - nine months, where we had no food.</span> <span id="s146">There was no food.</span> <span id="s147">Now, you might say, how do y -- how do you exist on no food?</span> <span id="s148">Well, we ate what is called pulp, which is stuff that is fed to the -- to the -- to the cows.</span> <span id="s149">And that’s what we ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: I’m curious to know more about your friendship with the teenage children, especially after their father died.</span> <span id="s151">Were you able to keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes, yes, as fact, th-the daughter got married pretty soon after.</span> <span id="s153">She married a -- a minister, a -- a Protestant minister.</span> <span id="s154">And somehow over the years, we -- we lost contact and the son, I had brought over here, fo-for a visit, I wanted him to see America.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: How did you -- How do you mean you brought him?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, I -- I wanted him to see America, and so we somehow got together here in the United States for just about a week or so.</span> <span id="s157">And just showing him around, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: My goodness.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t really remember, but it was probably, if I came in 1945, I would say probably in 19 -- early ‘50.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: And did you pay his way, or send him money, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: It so happened, no, I did not pay his way, he came here.</span> <span id="s163">He worked -- He worked for a company which had sent him over here, it’s just that he had quite a bit of time on his hand, and it was whatever he had to do for his company, it -- it did not take that long, and so I had a lot of time that I could show him -- I wouldn’t -- I didn’t show him America, but I did show him New York.</span> <span id="s164">That’s -- That’s as far as I could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: I -- It -- Is there anything else you want to add before we get to the liberation and after?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Well, you know, if I had to do that, I would have to start from -- from day one, and I don’t think, you know, and I’ve done that, an-and it’s on tape, and it’s in the Holocaust museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s167">No, I -- I -- I just would say, like I said before, that the last six - nine months were horrible, just horrible.</span> <span id="s168">I mean, again, you might say, compared to what?</span> <span id="s169">To the poor people who were in Auschwitz, it wasn’t horrible.</span> <span id="s170">But I am probably one of the few people that know what hunger is.</span> <span id="s171">And I s -- when I say hunger, I mean hunger.</span> <span id="s172">We talk about hunger, about poor people in -- in America.</span> <span id="s173">Yes, that may be so, but that’s not hunger.</span> <span id="s174">Hunger means you have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s175">You c -- You can eat grass, or you can eat, you know, you -- you just have nothing to eat, there was nothing, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s176">And -- And that was not just us, I mean, the Dutch people living in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s177">And one of the reasons was, because Holland was -- the southern part of Holland was liberated already in 1944.</span> <span id="s178">There was one little pocket of Holland, the province of north -- north Holland, which had Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, and The Hague in there, that little pocket, it’s a -- you know, it’s a -- Holland is a small country altogether, but that little pocket was not liberated.</span> <span id="s179">Hitler already had committed suicide, and we were still under occupation.</span> <span id="s180">The entire cun -- The entire continent of Europe was liberated, except -- I mean, I’m only talking about days now, that little part of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and ha -- and -- and -- and -- and The Hague, were still under German occupation for a couple of days after Hitler had committed suicide, So we were the very last one, and that’s why there was no food, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Because there was no transport allowed through?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I can’t tell you the reason why, all I know is we were absolutely starving, starving.</span> <span id="s183">And so, I know what hunger is.</span> <span id="s184">I would wake up in the middle of the night -- in the middle of the night, I would wake up and -- and -- and jump up in bed, because why?</span> <span id="s185">Because I saw a piece of bread in my dream, and that gave me a complete nightmare.</span> <span id="s186">So, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Well, I’m going to turn over to -- to side B --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Ok --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: -- to talk about liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So I’d -- I’d really -- I-I know that I was very touched by your words, “I didn’t cry for five years during the war, but when I saw Jewish boys, with Jewish stars on Canadian uniforms,” --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well let me -- we were -- we were liberated not by the American army, but by the Canadian army.</span> <span id="s193">Attached to the Canadian army, was a small de -- brigade, or whatever you want to call it, of the Jewish brigade.</span> <span id="s194">We were -- Now, after having been inside a room for two and a half years, and that does not include the time we spent on the farm, so we were finally liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: You knew it, you knew it.</span> <span id="s197">People were all of a sudden, you know, shouting and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- I mean, there was just joy all over, so you knew you could leave.</span> <span id="s198">And I would leave with my mother, and truthfully, we didn’t ba -- we really didn’t even know where to go.</span> <span id="s199">We were just walking, and -- and all of a sudden, we saw a Canadian soldier.</span> <span id="s200">And I can’t tell you the feeling that we had, after having been under German occupation, all you saw were Nazi soldiers, swastikas flying all over the place, and all of a sudden, for the first time in five years, we see an allied soldier in uniform.</span> <span id="s201">I -- I don’t think I can describe it, there is no way that I can describe the feeling.</span> <span id="s202">And as we got closer to this Canadian soldier, I happened to see -- so I -- I went over there, and wanted to shake hands with him, when I saw a -- on his sleeve, the word Jewish brigade, with the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s203">Now, if you think -- I mean, we were so enthralled by the fact that we saw a -- an allied soldier, but then, to see a Jewish soldier in a -- in a Canadian uniform with the -- with the Jewish star, after five years of swastikas, I -- it -- it -- it just -- you -- I can’t describe it.</span> <span id="s204">And as I -- as you just said before, after having lost my father, after having lost my brother, or it’s in -- in reverse order, I might say, in order to keep my mother, you know, I never cried.</span> <span id="s205">But when I saw that Jewish soldier, I just -- I -- I couldn’t -- I -- I just broke down.</span> <span id="s206">I was in tears, absolutely in tears.</span> <span id="s207">So that was the first day of liberation.</span> <span id="s208">And -- And then, we -- we had to look for a place to live.</span> <span id="s209">Now, we still -- we had a little money, which we didn’t have on us, but there was a -- one of our neighbors, a very lovely, elderly lady, she had some of our money, that we gave her the day then when we left our apartment in Amsterdam, in 1941.</span> <span id="s210">And -- And every penny that we gave her was still there, which in itself is unusual.</span> <span id="s211">And we finally rented a room, not an apartment, just a room, in the old neighborhood I might say.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Do you remember how much it cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I haven’t got the foggiest notion.</span> <span id="s214">And we -- we stayed there, my mother and I, in one room.</span> <span id="s215">Well, we were used to that by now, after two and a half years.</span> <span id="s216">And about four weeks later, there was a knock on the door, and Dutch police knocked on the door, are you, you know, at that time my first name was Gerd, not Gerald, or Gerry, as it is now.</span> <span id="s217">“Are you Gerd von Halle?”</span> <span id="s218">I said yes.</span> <span id="s219">“Is -- Are you Henrietta von Halle?”</span> <span id="s220">Yes.</span> <span id="s221">“You’re arrested.”</span> <span id="s222">We were arrested again four weeks, or six weeks -- four weeks I would say, after liberation.</span> <span id="s223">Why were we arrested?</span> <span id="s224">The Dutch police, after liberation, went back to the old files that they had, and when we came to Amsterdam in 1933, we were German citizens, and therefore, we were registered as Germans.</span> <span id="s225">And when the Dutch police after the war, wanted to round up all the Germans, they went back to their old files, and lo and behold, there are two more Germans, the von Halles.</span> <span id="s226">And so they arrested us, took us to a school where they had put all Nazis.</span> <span id="s227">And here, I can’t -- I mean, I don’t know whether you can picture that, but here we are in -- in -- in -- in the -- in a big room with all German Nazis.</span> <span id="s228">Well, thank goodness, after about six, eight, nine hours of telling -- you know, negotiating with -- with the police in -- or not negotiating, there was nothing to negotiate, I was just telling them who we were, and that we were not -- you know, we were Jews, and so they let us go.</span> <span id="s229">But that was just a --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you recognize any specific people --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: -- in the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did you have any kind of interchange or dialog conversation with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Darn -- Darn tootin’, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, I wouldn’t call it frightened, no.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t think we were frightened.</span> <span id="s239">We were -- It was a terrible, terrible feeling to be in room with basically, with your family’s ex-executioners.</span> <span id="s240">I mean, I -- I’m not saying that these people in that room were -- executed my father and my brother, but they were part of the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And how did you convince them you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, that’s a good question, I forgot.</span> <span id="s243">I did the -- I did the talking.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t -- I -- I -- I -- I really don’t know, it’s -- it’s more than 50 years ago, I don’t -- I don’t remember what I did, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: I’ve heard this story before, that happened to people on -- upon liberation, the Jews were taken in --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: -- you know, until they could prove --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: -- that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s250">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I don’t know how I proved it, but I don’t think it was that difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So you then -- How soon after -- What -- What was your life like between this point of the apartment, you returned back to the apartment with your mother, and the time that you went to America, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, I loved -- I loved Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s254">That was -- you know, I grew up there, and I -- I loved to spend time there, but I also realized that my future was lying in America.</span> <span id="s255">And we had, if the war, incidentally, had broken out maybe two months later, we would have been in America, because our -- our quota number was due.</span> <span id="s256">We just missed it by -- by -- by -- by a month or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So you had applied long before --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh yes, oh yes, except the German quota was -- was terribly over -- oversubscribed, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Did you apply when your father was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s261">That was -- We applied before the war, and -- but, you know, as I said, if -- if the war had broken out two months later, we would have been in America.</span> <span id="s262">It didn’t turn out that way.</span> <span id="s263">And what did I do?</span> <span id="s264">Well, my ambition -- I always wanted to be a dentist.</span> <span id="s265">Now, obviously, I didn’t have the educational background, because five years of ma -- you know, from age -- the war broke out in 40 -- from -- from age 18 to age 23, I was under German occupation.</span> <span id="s266">And so, those are the years when your education really -- where you get your education.</span> <span id="s267">And I only had one year that -- it was even under German occupation, I had one year of that college.</span> <span id="s268">Thank goodness, because that’s where I met my -- my savior, th-the -- the teacher who saved our lives.</span> <span id="s269">And so -- so what I did, because obviously I couldn’t go to dental college, I didn’t have the background, I didn’t have the -- the original background for -- for colle -- for dental college, I went to a dental laboratory, and although that took a few months til I got that lined up.</span> <span id="s270">And then when I came to America, well, then I came -- basically I came on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Wait -- What -- Now, how did you decide to go and your mother to stay, and how much time was there in between liberation and your --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: My leaving?</span> <span id="s273">The liberation took place in May of 1945, and I left for America in the end of October.</span> <span id="s274">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And how -- Did you have family in the United States that helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, helped me is -- is the wrong word to use.</span> <span id="s277">They -- I had two uncles here in the United States, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Mother’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: My mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s280">And they lived in -- in -- in the United States.</span> <span id="s281">So I came on a troop carrier.</span> <span id="s282">When I say a troop carrier, this was a tr -- a troop carrier of the Dutch Merchant Marine.</span> <span id="s283">The -- The d -- The Dutch Merchant Marine was just about wiped out during the war, and they -- the -- the Dutch government bought -- I don’t know whether they bought it or were given, liberty ships.</span> <span id="s284">And so these liberty ships wer-were supposed to be brought back to Holland, and so they had a troop carrier, with Dutch Merchant Marine sailors, who came to the United States, to pick up these ships, to take them back to Holland.</span> <span id="s285">And I was the only civilian on that -- on that troop carrier.</span> <span id="s286">And if you ask me how I got onto that troop carrier, I haven’t got the foggiest notion.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Was it difficult to say goodbye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, like -- Well, she -- I knew she would -- she would come, too, so it’s not a matter that I wasn’t going to see her.</span> <span id="s289">You know, I -- She came about six, seven months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Why did she wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Because this troop carrier was -- was only men, there was no room for women, and so she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s292">And she finally came on a -- on -- by plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: What were your expectations when you got on that carrier, of what America would be like, and what you might be able to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well, like every foreigner, America -- America’s the land that is -- where the streets are lined with gold.</span> <span id="s295">Now, the reality of course, is completely different.</span> <span id="s296">But everybody thought America is, you know, that’s the land where you want to be.</span> <span id="s297">I -- I had heard a great deal about America, and I -- I had made up my mind that when I came -- when I come to America, I wanted to be an American.</span> <span id="s298">I didn’t want for the rest of my life to be the refugee who can’t speak the language, or -- or who speaks it with a very heavy accent.</span> <span id="s299">The -- The one thing that I wanted more than anything else, I wanted to be American.</span> <span id="s300">I wanted to be looked upon as an American.</span> <span id="s301">I wanted to speak like an American, I wanted to act like an American, and that was -- so when I came to this country, I paid special attention to how people speak, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Before we go too much further into America, you first started out in a refugee center.</span> <span id="s303">And what was that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, no, this came here mo -- in other words, when I arrived in the United States, I arrived in Hoboken, the ship landed in Hoboken.</span> <span id="s305">And there was the Steven -- Steven Weiss, Rabbi Steven Weiss had a refugee ce -- had a -- had a Temple on the west side of -- on Central Park West, and he had a refugee center, I believe it was somewhere around 67th Street, or 69th Street, on -- near -- near Central Park West, in New York.</span> <span id="s306">And, so I went directly from the ship to the refugee center, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Was there someone to greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: At the refugee center?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: At the ship, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, at the ship, my -- one of my uncles picked me up and took me to the refugee center.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: He lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: He lived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: But he couldn’t put you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: That’s a hard question to answer.</span> <span id="s315">I -- I know he didn’t, whether he could have, that’s a different -- that’s a different question.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: But you don’t recollect any feelings about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s318">I was so -- I was so elated to be in America, that that never really entered my mind.</span> <span id="s319">So I -- So I arrived there, and -- and I -- and the f -- one of the first things -- there are two things that struck me when I arrived in the United States.</span> <span id="s320">The first thing was, when I arrived in Hoboken, oh my God, it was -- there was so much dirt on the street.</span> <span id="s321">And coming from Holland, where they -- where they -- where they wash the sidewalks -- not any more, not today, but I’m talking about in the -- in the 40’s, th-they -- they -- they washed the sidewalks, and here I come to America, and -- and -- and -- and the dirt is all over the place.</span> <span id="s322">I -- That struck me as strange.</span> <span id="s323">And the second thing, when I got to the refugee center, there was a radio, and I had never heard a commercial in my life.</span> <span id="s324">In -- In -- In Holland, you pay for the privilege of listening to radio, and there are no commercials, only in America.</span> <span id="s325">And here you hear that beautiful music, and then all of a sudden you hear about the -- the milk commercial, and the -- and the -- and the -- and -- and the McDonald’s, or maybe McDonald’s wasn’t around at that time, but whatever commercials they had.</span> <span id="s326">And that struck me as very strange.</span> <span id="s327">I had to get used to that, every -- every five minutes, a commercial.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: You mentioned music, do you remember what kind of music you listened to?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, we -- we were, as teenagers in Holland, we listened to jazz.</span> <span id="s330">That was my -- That was my thing.</span> <span id="s331">My parents listened to Beethoven, and we listened to Cab Calloway, and -- and -- and -- and -- and you know, all the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Big band?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Big band.</span> <span id="s334">Oh yes, oh yes, we, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you get -- There -- There was such a different feeling actually, in America, the stories of, you know, dancing, and big bands, live performances, and did you get any of that when you came over?</span> <span id="s336">Did you have an opportunity to go to any dances, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s338">I couldn’t afford it, but that doesn’t mean I -- I couldn’t listen to the radio, I -- I -- you know, one of the first things I got was a radio.</span> <span id="s339">Television, of course, came later.</span> <span id="s340">And so I listened -- I listened to the big bands, and I loved it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And who was president at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: President was Harry Truman.</span> <span id="s343">Harry Truman, the -- probably one of the greatest presidents this country ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Why do you feel that way about Harry Truman?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Harry Truman, because Harry Truman, I believe, if I am not mistaken, was -- was the president who had a -- a sign on his desk which said, the buck stops here.</span> <span id="s346">And that’s -- Harry Truman, if he saw it as -- as yellow, he called it yellow, and if it was black, he called it black, and if it was white, he called it white, and there was no fudging between black and white, it was just the way he saw it, and that’s the way he’s -- did it.</span> <span id="s347">I -- I -- Although, at the time, when he was president, I wasn’t that impressed with him, but each year that goes by, and that’s why I said, I think he was one of the greatest presidents this country has ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Because he was straightforward?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: He was straightforward, and he was just honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Now I know that in your interview at the museum, you said your first job was at Gimbel’s, and I -- and I hear you again today saying that you wanted to become a real American more than anything else.</span> <span id="s351">What do you mean, or did you mean by real American?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Well, America, to me, at that time, stood for everything that’s good in the world.</span> <span id="s353">I mean, here is a country that -- maybe too late for -- for my family, but came to the rescue of -- of Europe.</span> <span id="s354">They could have, if they had wanted to, they could have been -- stayed out of the war, and here they -- they -- they liberated Europe, they liber -- liberated the -- the Far East.</span> <span id="s355">There may have been some self interest in this, but the fact of the matter is, this was the country that stood for everything that I believed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Do you still feel this in retrospect, or in looking at -- to see -- have you ever been angry or worried about the fact that America waited as it did, to liberate?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No.</span> <span id="s358">I -- I’ll tell you what I was angry about with America, and -- you see, Mr. Roosevelt, I know he was a great friend of the Jews, the Jews thought he was -- he was next -- sitting next to God.</span> <span id="s359">I never felt that way, and the reason why I didn’t feel that way, is because Mr. Roosevelt could have, very easily, bombed the -- the -- the railroad tracks leading to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s360">He could have bombed the ovens and the gas chambers very easily.</span> <span id="s361">And I certainly don’t want anybody to tell me, “Yeah, but if he had done that, he might have killed innocent people in the camp.”</span> <span id="s362">That does not hold water with me, for good reasons, and I don't --</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: What is the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, the reason is, these people were on their way to the -- to -- to -- to a gas chamber, and if they could -- if Mr. Roosevelt could have bombed those gas chambers, and if he had to do it twice or three times, and over again if they rebuilt it, so be it.</span> <span id="s365">So, my anger, if I have any, is not -- is certainly not with America, but it’s with Mr. Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s366">And that’s why I -- wh-when Mr. Truman came along, he was such a breath of fresh air, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So, how was it that your mother came by plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well, there were -- I mean, this was not like today where -- where you have dozens and dozens of planes landing from -- from -- from -- from Holland, and then any other country, but there were some planes, and she was one of them -- she was on one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How did she get the money, or did she have it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Haven’t got the foggiest notion.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Maybe from the money that --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I don’t -- I don’t -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: -- the neighbor saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s375">My wife thinks that she got it from her brothers and then she paid it back to them.</span> <span id="s376">I -- That -- That may be so, and it may not be so.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Were you there to meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s379">Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you have any recollection of that moment, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, it’s really -- it wasn’t that dramatic.</span> <span id="s382">You know, it’s like -- like a -- a child going off to college and doesn’t see their parents for six months, so when they come back, they’re very happy to see their parents, but it’s not that, my goodness, you know, it’s not something that would have a lasting impression on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So, by the time she arrived, did you have a place to live and a job, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Well, let me t -- Would you like to hear the -- the day one, day one in America?</span> <span id="s385">So, here I arrived in the -- in Rabbi Weiss’s refugee center, and now I was told, before I came to hol -- before I came to America, that the thing you have to do, if you want to get a job in America, you have to buy the New York Times.</span> <span id="s386">And, so I arrived, I had five dollars in my pocket, and I arrived at that refugee center, went to sleep the -- that night, woke up the next morning, and now I needed a job, and I needed a job in a hurry.</span> <span id="s387">So, I remembered the New York Times, and I walked down from wherever it was, 67th Street, on Central Park West, I walked down Central Park West to 59th Street, and there was, and still is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a -- a newsstand.</span> <span id="s388">It’s still there.</span> <span id="s389">And I went to ask the man for the New York t -- oh, I saw the New York Times lying there, and it was a nickel.</span> <span id="s390">So I put down a nickel, and now I was down to four dollars and 95 cents.</span> <span id="s391">And I took the newspaper and I went into Central Park, and I want to sit on a bench, and first of all, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn’t believe it, the New York Times came in -- in four, five, six sections.</span> <span id="s392">When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the newspaper was one page.</span> <span id="s393">That was the newspaper.</span> <span id="s394">And here I come to New York, and -- and I mean it was two inches thick.</span> <span id="s395">And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a bench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New York Times, do I find the wanted ads, the employment ads.</span> <span id="s396">And -- And finally I -- I did find it.</span> <span id="s397">Now, of course, I spoke very, very little English, just a year or two what I had learned in school.</span> <span id="s398">And -- And I tried to read it, and I couldn’t find it because -- or I couldn’t read it because everything was abbreviated.</span> <span id="s399">APRX, now what does that stand for?</span> <span id="s400">Approximately?</span> <span id="s401">I mean, you know, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s402">And so I said to myself, let me go to the next bench, there was a man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I said, “I wonder whether you can help me?”</span> <span id="s403">And what do you think he said?</span> <span id="s404">He says, “I not speak English.”</span> <span id="s405">So -- So I was more or less forced to do it on my own, and I saw an ad by Gimbel’s on 34th Street, they are no longer there today, but in those days Gimbel’s was down on 34th Street.</span> <span id="s406">I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a real New York woman, a l -- I was going to say a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she was a woman who said, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s407">I said, “Well, I’m looking for a job.”</span> <span id="s408">“Well, we have -- we’re looking for ri,” -- this was just before Christmas, they were looking for Christmas help.</span> <span id="s409">“We have a -- We have -- We’re looking for wrappers.”</span> <span id="s410">I said, “Oh good, that’s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.”</span> <span id="s411">I wanted to be a wrapper in -- in America.</span> <span id="s412">So I got a job.</span> <span id="s413">So they took me and put me in the -- in the toy department, and I’m wrapping toys like crazy, and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I’m -- I’m handling a huge doll, which was made out of porcelain.</span> <span id="s414">In those days, plastic wasn’t that popular.</span> <span id="s415">And I dropped it on the floor in 5,000,000 pieces and the supervisor -- su-supervisor was coming -- running over, and he says, “You can’t work here.</span> <span id="s416">Go up to the 11th floor, the rug department.”</span> <span id="s417">So I was in the rug department, wrapping rugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Hold on, [inaudible].</span> <span id="s419">Let’s go to the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Gerry von Halle, conducted by Ginger Miles, on July 10th, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s422">This is a follow up interview of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum video interview, conducted in 1990.</span> <span id="s423">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: So, here I am in the toy department of Gimbel’s, and then I learned my first lesson in America.</span> <span id="s425">Christmas came and went, and I’m picking up my paycheck, and what is in the paycheck?</span> <span id="s426">A pink slip.</span> <span id="s427">It says, “Your services are no longer needed.</span> <span id="s428">Thank you very much, and here is your check.”</span> <span id="s429">Well, after -- after maybe a month or two in America, I’m unemployed, and I -- you know, I -- there was no Social Security af -- as far as I was concerned, and so I had to do some fast working, and I, by luck, my uncle had a dentist, and I wanted to go into the dental laboratory business, because that’s as close to being a dentist as you can get.</span> <span id="s430">And he got me a job on 41st Street, in the Herald-Tribune building, and there I got a job doing basically, at the bottom of the ladder, pouring casts.</span> <span id="s431">And I wanted to -- I really wanted to advance myself, and I was held back in that laboratory.</span> <span id="s432">And after about six months or so working in that lab, I -- I realized that I would never advance there, and I wanted to learn the business, and learn it in a hurry, so there was, again through connections, I found a laboratory, a one man lab, and I told him what I wanted, and he says, “I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s433">I’ll let you work for me, if you pay me.”</span> <span id="s434">Instead of him paying me, I had to pay him, and I was willing to do that.</span> <span id="s435">I had saved -- you know, I worked at Gimbel’s for two months, and -- and the -- and the dental laboratory for six months, and so I -- you know, I had saved a couple of dollars.</span> <span id="s436">So I was -- I actually paid him for the privilege of working for him.</span> <span id="s437">But I learned a great deal, and I then opened up my own dental lab, on --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: After how long in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I would say probably the whole -- the -- about a year and a half, or maybe two years, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Before we go into this career that you -- you managed so quickly, when your mother came to America, did you and she have an apartment together?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes, 236 East 82nd Street.</span> <span id="s442">We had -- Actually, we had a -- we had two rooms, tiny, tiny, tiny, little rooms, one was a bedroom that just was big enough to hold a b -- a -- a bed, and a living room which had a couch and a -- and -- and a table, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s443">And so my mother would sleep in the bed, and I would sleep on the couch, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did she work?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: She got a job almost immediately, through a pediatrician which my uncle knew, she got a job as a baby nurse.</span> <span id="s446">Her very first job was in Cedarhurst, Long Island, I remember, and people loved her.</span> <span id="s447">She ha -- She was a lovely, lovely person, and a fabulous, fabulous baby nurse.</span> <span id="s448">And so this doctor, who recommended her, this pediatrician who recommended her to these people, when she was finished with that job, he had jobs lined up for her, one after another.</span> <span id="s449">So she hardly ever was at -- in the house, because she lived, obviously, with the people where she was the baby nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: How did you communicate with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: By telephone.</span> <span id="s452">And, you know, I would, on -- on Sundays I would, if -- if I could get there, I didn’t have a car, obviously, you know, if I could get there by --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Would this have been 1946, this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I would say it probably was 1940 -- yeah, the end of ’46, probably, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Did you meet other people who -- other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes, yes, indeed I did.</span> <span id="s457">Some of my -- I made friends here.</span> <span id="s458">I met one couple who were neighbors of mine, next door neighbors from Hamburg, not from Amsterdam, from Hamburg, where I was born.</span> <span id="s459">And so I became friends with them, and through them, you know, and of course, all my friends were -- were -- were refugees, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Did you -- I know you -- you were first in a refugee center that was started by a rabbi.</span> <span id="s461">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah, Rabbi Weiss, Steven Weiss, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Did you -- Did you go to Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I, to be very honest with you, my mother came from a very religious home.</span> <span id="s465">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s466">She came from a -- you know, a home where they kept kosher and so on.</span> <span id="s467">My father didn’t know how to spell the word Jewish, although he w -- you know, h-he -- he was Jewish, and -- and -- and -- and been Jewish for -- you know, I have a family tree that goes back over 300 years, al -- all the von Halles, and -- and they were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s468">But he didn’t -- didn’t observe anything, and so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s469">I wasn’t trained in -- you know, even though I was Bar Mitzvahed, it was sort of by rote.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So when you came to America then, religious life, or community was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Was not important, not important to me at that time, not til -- until after I got married, which I’ll talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: So -- So then I -- I -- I formed my own dental laboratory, and I ru --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Where did you find the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Well, first of all, I did it with a -- I did it with a partner there, one of the people that I met in that first dental lab, where they wouldn’t let me advance, there was a man who, he was American, he -- he and I went in -- in business together.</span> <span id="s476">The -- The name of the dental lab was von Halle - Geiger Dental Lab, on Eighth Avenue.</span> <span id="s477">That building on Eighth Avenue is no longer there, there is a motel there now, or whatever.</span> <span id="s478">And so we -- we were -- we were operating that lab, mostly I was operating it, he -- he was a smart boy, he -- he kept his -- he kept his job and did this on the side.</span> <span id="s479">But it worked out all right.</span> <span id="s480">But I -- After a couple of years, I realized that I could always make a good living in a dental laboratory business, but the money is really on the side of the dentist.</span> <span id="s481">He makes the money and the laboratory is -- just makes a living.</span> <span id="s482">And so I realized that if I wanted to advance in America, and make, quote, money, that was the wrong business, at least the way I saw it.</span> <span id="s483">And so one day -- well, let me actually -- let me -- when I started the laboratory business, I was single, but then I -- these people -- these friends of mine that lived next to me in Hamburg, came up to me one day, and said to me, “Gerry, how would you like to have a blind date?”</span> <span id="s484">A blind date.</span> <span id="s485">And I thought about it for a minute, and I said to them, “I tell you quite frankly, I would prefer somebody who can see.”</span> <span id="s486">So -- So I -- So they -- So I went on that blind date, and I came home that night -- we went out -- I -- I think we went out to Yonkers, New York for -- for -- for a place to eat, and I came home that night and I said to myself, “I think I’m going to marry that girl.”</span> <span id="s487">I took her out a second time, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What did you do when you went out to --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: We went out, the four of us.</span> <span id="s490">W-We had dinner in Yonkers, and -- and -- and that was it, and -- and they had a car, I didn’t have a car.</span> <span id="s491">So they drove us back and forth and, you know, dropped me off.</span> <span id="s492">And second time I took her out, I called my mother after that, and I said, “I met a girl and I think I’m going to marry her.”</span> <span id="s493">And her comment was, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s494">I -- I have heard that before.”</span> <span id="s495">And I took her out seven times, and we got engaged, and that’s my wife of 47 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I don’t know how much longer she’s going to keep me, but for 47 years it’s been --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: And what is her full name, or befo -- before she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Her name -- That’s funny that you’re asking a question like that, because her name was Gerda -- I -- her name is -- is Gerda, same as my name.</span> <span id="s500">G -- My name was G-e-r-d, her name is G-e-r-d-a, so there’s Gerd and Gerda, except I changed my name when I came to the United States, when I took my citizenship’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s501">I just added -- but -- Gerd, I added a - l in between, so that made it Gerald.</span> <span id="s502">And her name is Gerda, and her maiden name was Freudenberg.</span> <span id="s503">Now, I’ll just tell you one little funny story there.</span> <span id="s504">When I got engaged, one of my friends called me up and said to me, “Gee, Gerry, I hear you got engaged.”</span> <span id="s505">I said yes.</span> <span id="s506">“Well, congratulations, what’s her name?”</span> <span id="s507">“Her name is Gerda.”</span> <span id="s508">“What’s her last name?”</span> <span id="s509">And for the life of me, I could not remember that name Freudenberg.</span> <span id="s510">I could think of Schwartz, and Levy, and Cohen, and I could think of all the Jewish names, but Freudenberg, I could not, for a million years could -- could I remember it.</span> <span id="s511">So anyhow, that’s just an -- an aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Now you said that your religious life changed during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Well, my religious life changed because my wife, although my in-laws were really not r -- that religious either, but my wife was.</span> <span id="s514">Not that -- you know, she was -- she went to Sunday school, and you know, to Friday night services with her grandmother and so on, not necessarily with her parents.</span> <span id="s515">And so, basically, when we got married, and then -- and then later on, the children came along, we -- we made sure, that is my wife made sure, and I followed, and -- and now we’re Temple members -- we’re Temple goers.</span> <span id="s516">Last night I was at a Temple, and we’re -- we’re -- we’re -- we’ve been members of this Temple for 36 years, and we’re regular Temple mem -- Temple goers.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Has this been an important part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s519">It has been an important part of my life, and I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s520">When -- When -- During the war, when I lost my brother, who was my very, very best friend, and was a tragic thing, I -- I -- I can’t even start to tell you.</span> <span id="s521">And then later on I lost my father.</span> <span id="s522">And then we -- And here we’re in hiding, nobody can help us.</span> <span id="s523">As a Jew in occ -- under occupation, you can’t pick up the phone and dial 911, and have the police come and rescue you.</span> <span id="s524">91 -- 911 were the Nazis at that point.</span> <span id="s525">And so, here you are, desperate, and every day you didn’t know whether you would live another day.</span> <span id="s526">I all of a sudden realized there’s only one person who -- who can probably help -- possibly help me, and that’s God.</span> <span id="s527">So I prayed to God, in whatever language it was, and so I became -- God, I -- I bel -- I sh -- believed in God, the first time I ever thought of God.</span> <span id="s528">And so when -- when I got married, and my wife wa-wanted to take us to -- to Temple, it wasn’t -- you know, I was perfectly willing to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: You’d been preparing for that for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s531">I mean, I didn’t -- I -- I-I couldn’t speak he -- I couldn’t read Hebrew or anything like that, but I -- I -- I was -- I was Jewish, I felt Jewish, I -- you know, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did you learn Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Y -- My wife does.</span> <span id="s534">My Hebrew I don’t want to brag about.</span> <span id="s535">It’s -- It’s not too good.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Speaking of your -- your praying, and your awareness of -- of a higher being, I -- when I heard your story, there were certain times when it almost seemed as if luck, or else a supreme being was looking over you and your mother.</span> <span id="s537">For instance, when -- when she hid in the closet --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: -- and the put the suitc -- they looked in every closet, but that one, and then you moved her under the bed, and they were stacking everything on top, and she was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Have you thought about th-the role of luck, or God, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Well, at that pa -- very particular point when this happened, you don’t think of anything, you’re just thinking of -- of how do I -- you know, how do I save her, how do I save myself.</span> <span id="s543">My father already was arrested.</span> <span id="s544">You don’t think in those terms.</span> <span id="s545">Later on, when you have time to reflect upon it, that’s when you start thinking in terms, not when it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And have you thought of -- had time to think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I think about it -- if I tell you that there is hardly a day that goes by that I don’t think about my brother, because he was my best friend, and there’s hardly a day that goes by where I don’t think of him.</span> <span id="s548">My father, too, but I -- I was closest to my brother.</span> <span id="s549">You know, ma -- obviously I think of my father, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Plus his -- the brother’s death seemed so --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Oh, it was a -- i-it was the most gruesome, I don’t even want to go into it.</span> <span id="s552">It was the most gruesome, gruesome way that anybody could die.</span> <span id="s553">It -- It -- you know, it’s one thing to be sh -- you know, to have a shot -- be shot, I mean, which is not exactly nice, either, but the way they -- he was in -- in -- in Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, and that was about, I think, about the worst of all of them, if th -- if you can make a distinction between concentration camps, which you really can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Does your -- When you think about your brother, does your sense of justice, or your attitude toward certain political events that have occurred in this country, and in the world, do you think that experience has an effect on your response to current events?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I must assume it has.</span> <span id="s556">I mean, I -- I’m not aware of it, but I-I’m sure, anything that you live through has a-an affect on -- on -- on your outlook, and -- and on your attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: What year was it that you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: 19 -- I should -- na -- ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: ’51, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: So, now that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Six -- And which -- that was about -- that was about five years after I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And that was also when --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Or -- Or six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: -- when Joseph McCarthy began his notorious McCarthy hearings.</span> <span id="s566">Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Did you relate to those hearings at all, or watch them?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Oh yes, I watched -- I watched every day, and I was absolutely furious at his tactics.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Not frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: No, not frightened.</span> <span id="s572">After all, yo -- Well, fr-frightened in -- in a -- in a -- in a different sense.</span> <span id="s573">I was frightened for -- for America, not for myself.</span> <span id="s574">I was frightened for America, until -- and I was disappointed, I might say, in ma -- in Mr. Eisenhower, President Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s575">I thought, as president, he could have done much more than he did.</span> <span id="s576">Harry Truman would not have allowed this to go on, I can a -- I can assure you.</span> <span id="s577">Eisenhower, in that respect -- ah, he was not a bad president, but in that respect he was wishy-washy.</span> <span id="s578">And I was not happy about that.</span> <span id="s579">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: We haven’t discussed -- I haven’t heard much about your relationship with the rest of your family, say like when you got married, did your uncles come to your wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes, they -- I have to -- I have to think for a minute.</span> <span id="s582">The answer is no.</span> <span id="s583">The answer is no.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So, were they living right in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: At that point, no.</span> <span id="s586">One was living in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: And the other one was living in South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Had they left --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Or in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A2: Florida and -- and North Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Fine, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Had they left much earlier from Germany, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Germany?</span> <span id="s595">Yeah, they left in 19 -- they -- they left about 1937.</span> <span id="s596">One -- One was a doctor, and the other one was a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So I know that education had -- is a regret, that you have mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Is that still true?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Oh yes, yeah -- well, is it still true?</span> <span id="s601">At -- At this point, don’t forget, I am what, 76.</span> <span id="s602">You -- You don’t think that much about education any more.</span> <span id="s603">But oh yes, obviously, it ha -- it had an impact on me, because if I had the education, I probably would be a dentist.</span> <span id="s604">Not that I would have, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And after you got married, did you change your occupation, or your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes, I did, I did.</span> <span id="s607">As a matter of fact, one day, and I’ll tell you how I changed my occupation.</span> <span id="s608">It was -- I told you that I could always make a -- a living, and maybe even a good living in a -- in the dental laboratory field, but to make money, I realized that I was in the wrong profession.</span> <span id="s609">And so one day, my wife and I, we lived in a -- in -- in New York City at that time, in a fourth floor walk-up.</span> <span id="s610">We went to a party where there were five couples, in -- plus us.</span> <span id="s611">And we were the only ones that came by subway because I didn’t have a car.</span> <span id="s612">All the others came by car.</span> <span id="s613">And I came home that night, and I sat down wh -- and I talked to my wife about that, and I said, “You know, it’s strange.</span> <span id="s614">All of these people can afford a car, I can’t afford a car.”</span> <span id="s615">And then I started to realize why they could afford a car.</span> <span id="s616">They were, all of them, were in the sales field.</span> <span id="s617">All of them.</span> <span id="s618">Different sales field, you know.</span> <span id="s619">And so what did I do?</span> <span id="s620">The next morning, on a Sunday morning, I get up, I get the New York Times again, and I’m looking sales.</span> <span id="s621">Zillions, and I mean zillions of ads for sales help, and so on.</span> <span id="s622">And there were a couple of ads I cut out, and one of them happened to be with an investment firm in Wall Street, and -- who were willing to train and then employ you.</span> <span id="s623">And so I went there, and they accepted me, and they trained me, and then you had to make sales.</span> <span id="s624">Well, that was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s625">That was a different field.</span> <span id="s626">Now, you’re dealing strictly with American public, and it’s you, by yourself, and you know.</span> <span id="s627">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: And your language by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: And the language, well, my language, I -- I -- I mentioned to you in the beginning, this was one of the key things for me.</span> <span id="s630">I wanted to speak English like an -- like an American, not like -- not like Mr. Kissinger who, after 60 years, still can’t speak proper English, although he’s -- he is probably th -- one of the brightest people, and one of the people I respect very, very much.</span> <span id="s631">But I didn’t want to sound like Mr. Kissinger, and so I -- I paid a lot of attention to -- to the language, and I -- you know.</span> <span id="s632">So, I worked for the investment firm, and it got to the point, after a couple of months, where I just didn’t have any -- you’re not -- I was not on a salary, I was on commissions, and it almost got to the point where I felt I had to leave the business.</span> <span id="s633">So, in that -- in the meantime, we are no longer living in -- in New York, we were living in Teaneck.</span> <span id="s634">We had bought a house for 19,000 dollars, or 21,000 dollars, and I didn’t have the down payment, so I borrowed 2,000 dollars from my mother and 2,000 dollars from my mother-in-law, and that’s how we bill -- bought the house in Teaneck, New Jersey, and so, after business really -- I thought I had to quit, I started, in the basement of this house in Teaneck, I built -- started to build a laboratory, the physical parts of a laboratory, with the benches and all of that.</span> <span id="s635">And then one day --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Like a dental lab?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Back -- Back into the dental lab.</span> <span id="s638">I had to make a living, you know.</span> <span id="s639">So, then one day, or one month I should say, all of a sudden I had a very good month.</span> <span id="s640">I was top salesman in the company, and from that point on, I s -- became one of the top salespeople in -- in the company, which was a nationwide company.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: The name of the company?</span> <span id="s643">First Investors Corporation, at 120 Wall Street at that time.</span> <span id="s644">And then I was -- then I was promoted to group manager, which means I formed my own group, and then I was promoted to vice-president of the company, with an office in Newark, New Jersey, and another office in Morristown.</span> <span id="s645">That was small office, then.</span> <span id="s646">The office in -- in Newark, I had a s -- I had about close to a hundred salesmen.</span> <span id="s647">As fact, I had a hundred salesmen.</span> <span id="s648">And everything -- And I stayed with the company for 17 years.</span> <span id="s649">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Wait, before we leave Newark, I -- I just -- I’ve heard so much about the Jewish community, was there a large Jewish community in Newark?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, a very large community, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: But you chose not to live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s654">The Newark -- The Jewish community in Newark, the people were born there, but by the time 1950 came around, they started moving out of Newark.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, I assume -- I assume that Newark, th-th-the -- the population shifted, and somehow, I -- I can’t put my -- exactly my finger on it, but the -- the mix-up of the population shifted.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You mean with Blacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: It became a minor -- Blacks, and -- and -- and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s659">And it became a mu-much more dangerous city to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Do you -- Would that be around 1954, it says that was when Brown versus the Board of Education, the Supreme Court ends longstanding practice of separate but equal public school facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Right.</span> <span id="s662">Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Do you remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Th -- A-A-And don’t forget, these people had children, and the -- and the educational system -- the educational system in -- in Newark was not up to standards, just like the -- like today, the educational system in New York City is not up to standards, and that’s where we have, you know, a lot of controversy o-over that subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: I’m sorry, go ahead.</span> <span id="s666">You -- You surely have had -- started having children now in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, we -- well, we waited.</span> <span id="s668">We waited five years.</span> <span id="s669">And that’s what you call really planned parenthood.</span> <span id="s670">We waited five years and after five years of -- of marriage, we felt we could now afford to start a family.</span> <span id="s671">And so we had our first son, Robert, and then, after th-three more years, it -- it -- it doesn’t sound very romantic, I might add, but after three years, we decided we -- or -- well, actually, after two years, we decided we really would want another child.</span> <span id="s672">And -- And exactly three years later, we had another son.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Born the same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: N-No, but same month, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And your -- your children’s -- children’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes, the -- the oldest is Robert, and the younger is Peter.</span> <span id="s677">And -- And that made me very, very happy, because you must remember, my family, the von Halle family, and I mentioned to you, I have a family tree that goes back to 1672, all von Halles, and here we’re wiped out, at least my part of the tree was completely wiped out.</span> <span id="s678">I am the -- I was the only male surviving.</span> <span id="s679">And so when Robert was born -- or -- or when I got married, I -- I felt, now there are two von Halles.</span> <span id="s680">And when my -- when Robert was born, we had three von Halles.</span> <span id="s681">And when Peter was born, there was four von Halles.</span> <span id="s682">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: I’ll -- I go now to the other side of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Oh -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: This is tape two, side B, of Gerry von Halle.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: So now we -- we had two children.</span> <span id="s687">They really were -- well, of course, every parent says that, but they were really great children, easy, not difficult to bring up, no problems.</span> <span id="s688">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: What years were they born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I’m afraid you were going to ask that.</span> <span id="s691">If my wi -- If my wife were here --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A2: I’m here.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Robert was born in --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A2: ’57.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: ’57, and that means Peter was born in ’60.</span> <span id="s696">And they were both born in March.</span> <span id="s697">Anyhow, they -- they grew up.</span> <span id="s698">First they lived in Teaneck, then we moved to West Orange, and they went to West Orange High School.</span> <span id="s699">And then they went -- And then we moved to Short Hills, and -- and then they left the house and went to college.</span> <span id="s700">Robert, the oldest, went to Northwestern.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A2: No, he went to Duke.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I’m sorry, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s703">Robert went to Duke, and then later on went to Northwestern, to graduate school.</span> <span id="s704">Peter went to Northwestern undergrad.</span> <span id="s705">And the only interesting thing about those boys of mine, when they were about in their last year of college, Robert came to me and said to me, “Dad, I don’t even know what -- what you really do for a living.”</span> <span id="s706">I mean, they knew what business I was in, but they really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s707">In the meantime I might say, I -- after 17 years with the investment firm, let me just -- I’m skipping around a little bit.</span> <span id="s708">After 17 years with the investment firm, I decided I wanted to be in my own business.</span> <span id="s709">They were very good to me, but I wanted my -- have my own business.</span> <span id="s710">So, in 19 -- oh, 40 fi -- in 1954, I believe.</span> <span id="s711">No, it probably was later, I -- I left the firm, and I started my own business, with a -- with a partner, and the firm became known as von Halle - Goldman associates.</span> <span id="s712">And again, the beginning was very, very difficult, but I -- I realized that.</span> <span id="s713">Every -- Every beginning is difficult if -- nothing -- as they say, nothing is for nothing.</span> <span id="s714">And so I started my own business, which was in the investment business, but also in the insurance business.</span> <span id="s715">And we -- As I said, a very tough beginning, but then we -- we worked, and we worked and -- and -- and we did all right.</span> <span id="s716">And after about five years with my partner, we decided to split, even though to this very day, we’re very close friends.</span> <span id="s717">It wasn’t a matter that we couldn’t get along with each other, it’s just that he had different ideas about how to conduct business than I had.</span> <span id="s718">And -- A-And so then the firm became von Halle Associates.</span> <span id="s719">Now, coming back to my two sons, who were in college, the oldest was in Duke, and he came up to me one day, and he said to me, “Dad, I-I really don’t know what -- what you are doing, you know, wh-what -- what you -- what do you do all day long?”</span> <span id="s720">I says -- He said, “Can I come to your office and -- and see what you’re doing?”</span> <span id="s721">I said, “You’re welcome any -- any time.”</span> <span id="s722">So he came down to my office, he sat down, and after a half a day, he said, “Dad, that’s a nice business of yours, but not for me.”</span> <span id="s723">And out he went, never saw him again in my -- in my office, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s724">Three years later, my younger son, Peter, at Northwestern, said the same thing to me, basically.</span> <span id="s725">He says, “Dad, I really don’t know what you’re doing.</span> <span id="s726">I’d like to spend the day with you in the office.”</span> <span id="s727">I said, “Peter, be my guest.”</span> <span id="s728">So he comes down, and he stays all day, and he says, “This is a fabulous business, Dad.</span> <span id="s729">I like to work for you during the summer.”</span> <span id="s730">This was just, you know, when they had summer vacations.</span> <span id="s731">I said, “Peter, here’s a desk, and let me tell you couple things about the business.”</span> <span id="s732">Well, my son Peter is like a sponge.</span> <span id="s733">You tell him something once, and you never have to tell him again.</span> <span id="s734">As it turned out, Peter, after he graduated college, he wanted to come into my business.</span> <span id="s735">And I said to him, “Peter, you cannot come into my business until you have a job on your own.”</span> <span id="s736">Now, he graduated in -- in -- in Northwestern, in Chicago, and in -- I said, “You get yourself a job in the industry, and after a year, we’ll talk about it.”</span> <span id="s737">So, after -- So, he got himself a job, learned a great deal.</span> <span id="s738">After six months he calls me up, he says, “Dad, I want to come, you know, join you.”</span> <span id="s739">I says, “Remember our agreement was a year?</span> <span id="s740">It’s only six months.</span> <span id="s741">Wait another six months and we’ll talk about it.”</span> <span id="s742">So, six months later, after a year, he calls me, and he joined the firm.</span> <span id="s743">Today, my son Peter is exceedingly successful, even more successful than I was, and today he owns the firm.</span> <span id="s744">He owns the firm.</span> <span id="s745">I still -- I still work there, you know, not -- not from nine to five, but f-from --</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Where is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: It’s here in Clinton, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Clinton, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: How did you know to tell him to wait a year and work somewhere else, or why did you tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Why?</span> <span id="s752">Because I felt anybody -- I didn’t want him to feel that, you know -- he had to understand what the world is all about, and what business is all about, and i-i-i -- he has to be knocked around, if that’s what it takes.</span> <span id="s753">And I felt that’s the way I wanted it.</span> <span id="s754">I didn’t want him to feel, “Well, I work for Dad.”</span> <span id="s755">First show that you can do it on your own, and then you can come talk to me, and then we’ll -- we’ll see where we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Before we leave your sons, your children, I’ve talked to all survivors about how and if and when they talked to their children about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s757">Have you spoken -- From the time you were young, did you speak to them, or did you feel you need -- you needed to protect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Y -- That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s759">I have not spent a great deal of time talking to them about what I went through.</span> <span id="s760">I -- I -- I can’t even give you the reason why I didn’t.</span> <span id="s761">I didn’t do it deliberately, maybe it’s just my nature, I -- I became -- I -- I -- it wasn’t because I wanted to protect them, it’s just that I didn’t talk very much about it, not that they didn’t know what -- what my background was, and -- and -- and -- and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s762">I mean, they knew that my brother got killed, and that I was in a concentration camp and all of that.</span> <span id="s763">They knew all that, but I didn’t make a -- I didn’t make a big point.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Because they haven’t yet asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Well, they -- One of them -- Well, I do a lot of public speaking around the country, and -- and as fact, two years ago, I -- I was at a Temple in Washington, D.C., we had 2,000 people there, and that was a lot of people.</span> <span id="s766">But anyhow, I do a lot of spe -- public speaking, and so -- A2: They saw the tape --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s768">The -- My -- My kids did see the tape, yeah, so they know my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did you watch them as they watched, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I don’t even recall, I don’t recall that.</span> <span id="s771">Maybe I did and maybe I didn’t.</span> <span id="s772">I -- I -- I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: How did your commitment to begin to speak as a survivor, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, I feel very strongly.</span> <span id="s775">The Holocaust is probably the world’s worst Holocaust, I’ve -- there’s no other word for it, that ever happened in -- in -- in the history of mankind, I -- I think.</span> <span id="s776">And here we are, this is 1999, almost 2000.</span> <span id="s777">The survivors are of an age where they may live another five years, 10 years, or 15 years at the most, and then everybody is gone.</span> <span id="s778">And then everything is secondhand, third hand and so on.</span> <span id="s779">I’m one of the sh -- genuine survivors, and I feel it is my duty to my people, and to -- to the world, so to speak, to talk about what happened in plain -- in plain language.</span> <span id="s780">And that’s why I do it, I -- I -- you know, I -- I don’t do it, I -- I don’t get paid for it, and I wouldn’t want to get paid for it, it’s -- it’s -- this is what I’ve -- I -- I feel I have to do.</span> <span id="s781">I owe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Do you speak in -- in -- to both Jewish and non-Jewish groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s784">The 2,000 people in Washington, D.C., a thousand of them were Jewish, and a thousand of them were Gentile, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Do you think that the fact that the man, the professor who saved you was a non-Jew, I guess he was a Christian --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: He was a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Do you think that that has --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: A religious Christian, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Did his -- How did you respond to his religion, or his religiousness?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Very, very, very well.</span> <span id="s791">He -- He would read from the Bible every day, to his -- to -- you know, to his -- with his wife, sitting around the table, and the children, the two children, and my mother and I. And I learned a great deal.</span> <span id="s792">You don’t have to -- The Jewish religion is not the only religion, there -- there are many other religions, and -- and they all have something to say, and they all, you know.</span> <span id="s793">And of course, I feel very good about the Christian religion, because remember, Jesus sta -- was as a Jew.</span> <span id="s794">He was a Jew, and -- and so I -- you know, I -- I have no problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So you actually did get to have some family life, even when you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: When I was in hiding, well family life is the wrong thi -- well, my --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Why [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: -- originally, at -- down at the farm, I had my mother and my -- my -- my -- my father and my mother with me.</span> <span id="s799">When I --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: I mean with the professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh, oh, with the professor.</span> <span id="s802">Yes, we were -- yes, we were -- we ate together.</span> <span id="s803">In other words, when I say we were in a room together, when -- when we were in a room, when we ate, we -- you know, we ate together.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Was that one of the highlights of your day, to spend time with that family?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yeah, there wasn’t very much else to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: I wonder --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: I did -- I did some -- I -- I did -- I’ll -- I did some drawings, you know.</span> <span id="s808">I made a drawing of my -- of Mrs. Initout, and so on, and so on, so that’s the only -- and I -- I read, although there wasn’t that much to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So you read the Bible some?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: [indecipherable] available books.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I was familiar -- I was familiar with the -- I mean, not that I -- if you -- if you were to quote -- ask me questions about it, I -- by now I probably have forgotten a great deal about it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: I -- I know that this is going to maybe sound like an odd question, but do you think that living that closely with a woman, your mother, has affected your awareness or perception toward women in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Well, let me say I -- I -- I like women.</span> <span id="s815">That’s -- If that means anything.</span> <span id="s816">No, I don’t -- I really don’t think so.</span> <span id="s817">Not that I -- I mean, I -- I think I’m pretty much level headed, I have no -- I have no -- I -- I -- I love women.</span> <span id="s818">I married my wife so many years ago, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Is your wife a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: From the --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Well, is she survivor, the answer is -- is -- is no.</span> <span id="s823">She -- She was -- She came here in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: From Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: So you’re both German?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: We are both German Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Trying to think.</span> <span id="s829">There are so many things that happened since the McCarthy era that -- in current events, I wonder if any of them affected you directly or indirectly, such as the Korean War?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well the Korean War, I think, was a fouled up -- we had no business doing what we did in Korea, get involved in -- in -- in that -- in that thing.</span> <span id="s831">I -- I don’t want to call myself a -- a student of the Korean War, but I -- I feel that -- I -- I think we made a mistake getting involved in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: And I guess, during the time that you were -- your sons were young, was the beginning of the protest -- the movement in the United States, Civil Rights protest.</span> <span id="s833">Did you -- Did you have any feelings about racism, did you relate at all to that movement, or did you see it as totally separate from what you experienced in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Well, it’s -- it’s -- it’s completely -- well, you ca -- I can’t say completely, it is different from -- from -- from the experience that we had.</span> <span id="s835">Our experience was one of, if they catch you, you’re dead.</span> <span id="s836">The Civil Rights movement was one of oppression of people, not systematic killing of people.</span> <span id="s837">That -- That -- That is not to say that they didn’t -- that not m-many Blacks were killed, but they were not killed by the government, more or less, they were killed by people who just hated them, and so it’s -- it’s hard to make a -- a connection between the two, although I’m sure you could.</span> <span id="s838">I’m sure you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: I know that there were lots of Jewish young people who were involved in the Civil Rights movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s841">Right, right, and who -- and who --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Do you think that that -- that may have been part of their understanding of --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Well, I think the Jewish people have always had a strong feeling about Civil Rights, and you know, being -- being an oppressed people from -- from way back, I mean, whether you go to Russia, and I mean, you know, the Russian -- the -- the Jewish people have been oppressed for -- for -- for -- for -- from -- from day one, actually.</span> <span id="s844">But -- So I -- I think the Jewish people have a -- you will find their -- their voting pattern in -- in -- in America, is one of liberalism.</span> <span id="s845">That is not to say there are no -- there are no Republicans, Jewish Republicans, but it’s -- it’s -- they’re -- they tend to be on the liberal side.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Vote perhaps more related to issues than to economy?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Yes, yes, I would say so, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: And the Vietnam War, was there some --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Lesson to be learned?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Well, did you respond in any way specific, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s852">I -- Well I -- No, I di -- I did not respond to it.</span> <span id="s853">I probably would have responded to it, if -- if I had been drafted, or so, except I was past the draft age, so it didn’t affect me directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: How about your sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: My sons?</span> <span id="s856">That’s a different -- yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: How were they affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Well, I -- I -- How were they affected, well, I think they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Were they old enough to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No.</span> <span id="s861">In other words, I was too old, and they were too young, so -- so we were -- but it’s -- it has affected the united -- th-the -- the -- it has affected the entire country, and not in a good manner -- in a -- not in a good way.</span> <span id="s862">It was a -- We lost a lot of, lot of people, and we killed a lot of, lot of people.</span> <span id="s863">And when you get to that combination, it’s -- it’s not -- it’s not a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Just to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s865">In the early 60’s, where were you when President Kennedy was shot?</span> <span id="s866">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Well, I was -- I was standing at a -- at a candy s -- at a candy counter, in -- in an office building, trying to buy a piece of candy when that word came out, and of course, I don’t think there’s an American today who doesn’t -- I mean, of -- of age, who would remember, who doesn’t know exactly wh-what he did and where he was.</span> <span id="s868">I -- I was shattered, I was absolutely shattered, I -- when I saw the funeral -- and I’m not a person who’s easily -- who will shed tears easily, because I was brought up that men don’t cry.</span> <span id="s869">Whether that’s right or wrong, that’s a different story, but that’s the way I was brought up.</span> <span id="s870">But when Kennedy’s funeral, I -- I shed lots of tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: What do you think he represented to you and to the country at -- at large?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Well, you see, I think -- I think JFK is really larger than life.</span> <span id="s873">Why?</span> <span id="s874">Because number one, he was so extremely handsome.</span> <span id="s875">He -- His mannerism was -- I mean, I’ve never met another person who had his mannerism.</span> <span id="s876">And I thought he did a good job.</span> <span id="s877">Now, I want to be honest with you, I did not vote for him.</span> <span id="s878">But I -- I -- H-He -- He represented -- you know, he had a beautiful wife, and had beautiful children, and -- and -- and -- and he was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: The country was sort of concerned about his Catholicism, weren’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s881">He -- As -- As -- As you obviously know, he was the first Catholic to -- to be considered for president, and he -- he w -- handled it extremely well, extremely well.</span> <span id="s882">He didn’t ma -- He didn’t -- He didn’t go round the bush.</span> <span id="s883">He says, I’m -- I’m Catholic, but I also want you to know, my loyalty is number one to America, and number two to the Pope.</span> <span id="s884">The Pope is not going to tell me how to handle my job.</span> <span id="s885">And -- And -- And not in those words, but that’s basically what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Do you remember why you didn’t vote for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I am not what you might consi -- I -- I am the exception to the rule, I’m -- I’m not what you might consider a liberal.</span> <span id="s888">Now, that doesn’t make me -- I’m a s -- I’m a centrist.</span> <span id="s889">I feel there are three -- three parts to -- to a political system.</span> <span id="s890">There is the -- There is the left, the right, and there is the middle.</span> <span id="s891">And I don’t belong to the left, and I don’t belong to the right, I belong to the middle, which makes it very difficult sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Well, makes it difficult because you really don’t know -- sometimes the candidates don’t, on either side, don’t fill -- fill your bill.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Well, do you think if Kennedy had lived today, that he would have been so honored?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: So honored as -- as --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: As what he was when he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: No.</span> <span id="s898">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: But -- But -- But that’s not -- that’s not to say anything bad about him.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, a president being murdered becomes a -- gets into a -- his own stratosphere.</span> <span id="s902">It’s -- It’s a different -- It’s a different situation.</span> <span id="s903">If a -- If a president dies of natural causes, well then, he just dies, you know.</span> <span id="s904">We c -- You see, we can look at Roosevelt because he died.</span> <span id="s905">We can look at -- We can look at Truman, he died of natural causes, but Kennedy, he was assassinated, and that puts him into -- you -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: What about another president after him, called Nixon?</span> <span id="s907">What did you think of his handling of --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Nixon -- Nixon, I -- I -- I liked Nixon’s foreign policy.</span> <span id="s909">I thought he and -- and -- and Kissinger opened up China, and I think that was a very important step.</span> <span id="s910">What did -- didn’t I like about Nixon?</span> <span id="s911">When he was -- forget about as a president, when he was in the house, and -- and -- and he was sort of a sidekick to MacArthur -- Joseph McCarthy.</span> <span id="s912">You know, he -- I didn’t like that aspect of him, he w -- and there were other things, and then of course, towards the end, when -- when the -- when he did the -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Watergate.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: The Watergate thing, I mean, he was completely out of bounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Yeah, but he was not a -- he was not a bad president, especially in the foreign affairs field.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: You liked the way he handled Vietnam?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Well, Vietnam really was Mr. -- that’s really where Johnson was more involved in -- than -- than Mr. -- Mr. Nixon.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s920">Although Johnson would not agree, but he’s not alive to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Was the Feminist movement of interest, or affected you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: No, I didn’t -- I -- Let me -- you know, now we’re really getting into politics.</span> <span id="s926">The Feminist movement, I -- I liked the Feminist movement when they started, but then I saw the Feminist movement go to extremes, and especially -- the Feminist movement, when they got to the point of Mr. -- Mr. Clinton, and his affair with Mrs. Lewinsky.</span> <span id="s927">That’s where the -- That’s where the Feminine movement lost me.</span> <span id="s928">Because you either -- you can’t -- you can’t -- th-th-they more or less -- more or less condoned what -- you know, this whole affair.</span> <span id="s929">And that’s -- that’s when they lost me.</span> <span id="s930">I thought they would stand up and vote for women.</span> <span id="s931">Vote for Mrs. Nixon.</span> <span id="s932">Mrs. Nix -- Mrs. Clinton, you know, be with Mrs. Clinton, who was the -- the hurt party.</span> <span id="s933">But the women, they -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Did you not consider -- I’m wondering if you did, cause I -- I -- as I was reading, I was thinking, this is -- a lot of the perspective was that this whole circumstance was private and personal, and that it was being used to downplay any accomplishments that he might make, or speak out.</span> <span id="s935">He spoke out -- He’s spoken a lot for women.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So did you -- did you ever consider that side that said it was a ploy on the other side to discredit his accomplishments?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Well, Mrs. Clinton called it a ex -- the Right Wing conspiracy.</span> <span id="s939">Now I -- I can’t talk about that, because I don’t know what -- whether there was a conspiracy or not, except if you’re asking me about the women’s movement, I -- I -- I really feel that the women’s movement should have stood up for women, and that in this case, it was Mrs. Clinton they should have stood up for, but they stood up for Mr. Clinton, and that’s where I tho -- I think the Women’s movement went -- went off the track.</span> <span id="s940">But otherwise, I think they did a v -- they did a fine job.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: I want to talk about Israel, if you have any feelings about it, but let’s take a short break, while I --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview conducted with Gerry von Halle, conducted by Ginger Miles on July 10th, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s945">This is a follow up interview of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum video interview conducted in 1990.</span> <span id="s946">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Now I’m -- I’m relating to an article that you’ve just looked at in “Nation and World,” that was there April 24th, 1998, and it’s a statement that Netanyahu made about the Holocaust, saying, “This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this.</span> <span id="s949">That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty, and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.”</span> <span id="s950">And I wanted to ask Mr. von Halle’s opinion about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Well, you must remember, we’re t -- he’s -- he’s being quoted in conjunction with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s952">As a Holocaust survivor, and I’m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on, that when we were in Europe, we were alone.</span> <span id="s953">There was nobody to help us.</span> <span id="s954">Mr. Roosevelt didn’t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help the people in the concentration camps directly.</span> <span id="s955">By that I mean he didn’t feel he should -- he could, or he should or what -- for whatever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks, bomb the gas chambers, and -- and etcetera.</span> <span id="s956">Now Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying is, the Jewish people, by necessity can only -- should only rely on their own strength.</span> <span id="s957">I’ve been asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in the United States, and my answer has been, “Under the right circumstances.</span> <span id="s958">Under the right circumstances, it could happen here, too.”</span> <span id="s959">What do I mean by that?</span> <span id="s960">If -- It all has to do with economics.</span> <span id="s961">If the economic situation in the United States gets so bad that people are desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s962">Have been al -- through the centuries.</span> <span id="s963">And therefore, when Israel was made into -- into existence, I felt very, very good.</span> <span id="s964">Why did I feel good?</span> <span id="s965">There is now one country that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent.</span> <span id="s966">And if the situation ever came where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept you, and defend you.</span> <span id="s967">And how do they defend you?</span> <span id="s968">By armed might, if -- if need be.</span> <span id="s969">Don’t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint Louis, not the last one, the one before the last one.</span> <span id="s970">The last one, there were several hundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to Cuba, had Cuba visas.</span> <span id="s971">At the last moment they -- Cuban government refused entry.</span> <span id="s972">Then they went to Miami.</span> <span id="s973">We’re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s974">I’m -- I -- As -- By now, I guess you know, I’m not a great friend of Mr. Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s975">Mr. Roosevelt didn’t feel it was necessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German Jews, and sent them back to Europe.</span> <span id="s976">Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an Israel, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been saved.</span> <span id="s977">So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I’m not a friend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don’t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much better Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with the quote, yes.</span> <span id="s978">And that’s strictly from a Jewish point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yes, several times.</span> <span id="s981">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Were your expectations of the place the same as the reality of being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Well, again, a -- I’m speaking as a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s984">It -- It -- You know, I’m probably one of the proudest -- well, no, maybe -- I’m -- I’m a very, very proud American.</span> <span id="s985">I -- I -- I can’t tell you -- I’m probably more aware of being an American than a native born American, because of everything I went through.</span> <span id="s986">So, I’m a -- I -- I’m a very, very proud American.</span> <span id="s987">And whenever I go on a vacation, I’m -- I’m out of the country, and I come back to the United States and say, “Ah, feels good.</span> <span id="s988">Feels good to be back.”</span> <span id="s989">I forgot what I was going to say in the -- in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: About Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Oh, Israel.</span> <span id="s992">Now Israel, I feel -- it feels good to see a country, where everybody in authority is Jewish.</span> <span id="s993">In other words, the policemen are Jewish, the -- the courts are Jewish, the -- the -- the army is Jewish, the Air Force is Jewish, the -- the -- you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s994">As a -- As a Holocaust survivor, makes you feel good.</span> <span id="s995">Now, does that mean -- now, coming back to the United States then, fa -- after I’m -- was in Israel, as I said, I said, “Ah, feels good to be back in the United States.”</span> <span id="s996">Because, this, after all, is my country.</span> <span id="s997">But I have certain emotional ties to Israel, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Do you think that you, as -- as -- as a Holocaust survivor, has a stronger tie, probably than most?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: To Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1002">Na -- No.</span> <span id="s1003">A stronger tie?</span> <span id="s1004">No, I don’t want to necessarily say that.</span> <span id="s1005">As you know, Jews have very strong emotional ties to Israel, and that’s probably because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1006">In other words, you don’t have to be a Holocaust survivor to be emotionally a-a-attuned, and -- to -- to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Well just as a survivor, when you watch films like “Schindler’s List,” -- did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: I di -- I did -- I did see that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Did you -- How did you respond to the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: I don’t -- I thought it was an excellent film, but I -- y-you see, having gone through this whole thing, it doesn’t affect me probably as much as it would affect you or anybody else, who hasn’t gone through that experience.</span> <span id="s1011">There was nothing new in that film that -- you know, that I hadn’t ex -- either experienced, or -- or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: That brings me to the subject, cause I know you didn’t speak with your children, did you speak with your wife about the Holocaust, or with your friends about it, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: No, not with my friends.</span> <span id="s1014">Well, yeah, my wife.</span> <span id="s1015">I -- I speak with my wife about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: You still talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1018">Not on a -- you know, I’m not hung up, I’m -- you know, don’t forget, by now, it’s 50 years later, I’m an American.</span> <span id="s1019">And sometimes I look back on it, and it almost feels like, did I really go through all of that?</span> <span id="s1020">I -- I’m -- I’m so Americanized that yes, I -- I -- obviously I -- I -- as I said, there’s not a day that goes by that I not think about my brother.</span> <span id="s1021">So it’s not that I forgot about it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Do you feel that -- Have you been aware, or -- of -- of anti-Semitism in America, to this day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1026">I have never -- I mean, you read ab -- I read it in the newspapers, of what happens, you know, swastikas on a -- on a -- on a -- on a -- on a synagogue, but personally, never.</span> <span id="s1027">Not -- Not -- Not once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Most of your -- your friends are Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Most of my friends are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">M-Most of them are American born, although I have -- I have some friends who were born, you know, former refugees.</span> <span id="s1031">As a mer fact, you know, I don’t know whether you realize it, but actually -- and I’m not saying that as a -- actually, I’m not a refugee.</span> <span id="s1032">Actually, I’m an immigrant.</span> <span id="s1033">You can only be a refugee -- people who left Germany before the end of the war, they are refugees, they -- they fled the country.</span> <span id="s1034">In my case -- and I always call myself a refugee, but technically I’m not a refugee, I’m -- I’m an immigrant, because I left after the war.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn’t have to leave, I could have stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s1036">But -- I mean that’s just from -- from a technical point of view.</span> <span id="s1037">People -- People ask me, you know, I -- I -- I always talk about it -- myself as a refugee, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Were people afraid when they left that -- not only that they wouldn’t be able to make a living, but that it might happen again?</span> <span id="s1039">Why do you think so many people left Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Because there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s1041">Their f -- Their -- Their families, you know, most of their families were gone.</span> <span id="s1042">Those who survived, they had nothing, there was no reason for them to stay.</span> <span id="s1043">And in our case, we always had wanted to co-come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Your relationship with your mother, we haven’t discussed much, on the way -- when you -- when she got over here.</span> <span id="s1045">I guess -- How long did she live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: She lived -- She died about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A2: 1987</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: 1987.</span> <span id="s1049">So that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1051">So she died --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: So she’s -- That’s -- She -- She lived -- She lived many years here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: So she got to see your children, and know your wife and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1055">Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1056">She -- She wa -- She knew my wife, she knew my children, and no, she never knew my grandchildren, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Oh, so you -- you have grandchildren, we didn’t talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Well, I was telling you that when I came over, I was one von Halle, then I married, there were two von Halles, then I had two sons, we were four von Halles, and then -- then the children married, so there were six von Halles.</span> <span id="s1059">My oldest son had two boys, so now there are six, eight von Halles.</span> <span id="s1060">My younger son had three boys, so now there are 11 von Halles.</span> <span id="s1061">If Mr. Hitler would know about it, that he -- that he missed this one Jew, who now produced 11 others, he would be very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1062">He would turn over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Is there -- I know that you -- you have -- you go back and forth between Arizona and New Jersey, as well.</span> <span id="s1064">Your life in Arizona, do you speak there, also, do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1066">Well, when I say -- after -- we lived there for 15 years.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, w-we stayed there six months of the year, and six months we stayed in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1068">But, it’s funny, you were just asking that, we just -- after 15 years we just sold our house, and we’re now -- we’re going to be in New Jersey year round.</span> <span id="s1069">That doesn’t mean we -- we can’t go to Arizona, you know, on vacation and -- and rent a place for -- for a month or two, you know, but my -- we’re no longer -- I no longer own the house since -- since last March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And your famil -- your sons are in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: My -- My son -- well, the one that’s in the business, who -- you know, my son now owns my business, he lived in mut -- in Ridgewood, and my other son lives in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Is there anything else around the Holocaust or your life since, or something you’ve learned from speaking to other people, or speaking with audiences, have you been shocked about anything that they didn’t know -- that we didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1074">The average individual, now of course, it depends on whether you’re speaking to Jewish people or non-Jewish people, it makes a big difference, but the Jewish people are pretty well aware of what -- what happened.</span> <span id="s1075">The non-Jewish people know the word Holocaust, and -- but they don’t really know the details.</span> <span id="s1076">I mean, when I say they, not -- you -- you can’t put a blanket s -- you can’t make a blanket statement, but in -- in general, their -- their knowledge of the Holocaust is much more limited than -- obviously, of the Jewish people, yeah.</span> <span id="s1077">No question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to add to -- before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1080">I -- I’m -- all I can say is I’m -- I’m a very -- I’m a very -- you know, I -- this is my third country.</span> <span id="s1081">You know, I was born in Germany, I grew up in Holland, and I’ve lived in -- in -- in the United States for now over half a century.</span> <span id="s1082">And to me, I -- I -- I feel -- I feel so proud to live in this country, and to be an American, and I -- I -- I couldn’t be any happier in -- in any -- in any which way.</span> <span id="s1083">Th -- America has been great to me, has given me all the opportunities that you could ask.</span> <span id="s1084">Yes, you have to grasp them, and you have to go for them, nobody’s going to put it on -- on a -- on a silver platter, but whatever opportunities I wanted, I -- I -- I got, and so I’m grateful.</span> <span id="s1085">And I might say to you, and I will never miss an election [indecipherable], and I feel all Americans, my fellow citizens should -- should -- should realize what it means to be able to go to the polls, and -- and -- and -- and vote.</span> <span id="s1086">I don’t know whe -- I -- maybe that doesn’t belong into this -- into this tape, but I -- I feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: No, it’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: I -- I feel very strongly about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: How -- How the Holocaust has affected you politically, and your beliefs, and -- is the purpose of these follow up interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: It’s very important.</span> <span id="s1092">So if you feel that voting is one of the most important things --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Very, very, very, very important.</span> <span id="s1094">And you have to be aware of what’s go -- you know, we Americans have a tendency of -- when we read the newspaper, we start off with the sports pages, which is fine, I mean, there’s nothing wrong with reading the sports pages, long as you don’t forget to read the first page, too, and know what’s going on, you know, in the judicial system, and -- and -- and every -- everything else in political system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: And behind that belief is what?</span> <span id="s1096">Why, why is it important to vote?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Because the alternative is so terrible.</span> <span id="s1098">Because if you -- if you don’t vote, then you’re leaving the decisions up to people who have an agenda which usually isn’t for the benefit o-of the whole country, because they are -- there are always people who will, you know, the more extreme, and I’m not saying on the right or on the left, m-more extreme, your -- your -- your -- your opinions are, those people will vote, and if you don’t vote, your voice won’t be heard, and detrimental to our system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: I’m trying to think if there’s anything else that we’ve left out, that you’re going to think once I leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I think we -- we pretty much covered it, we pretty much covered it.</span></p> <p><span
