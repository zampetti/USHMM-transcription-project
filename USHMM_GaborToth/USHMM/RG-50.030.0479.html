be somewhere back in the centuries, because it was one clan.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s30">So your name now is --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I shortened it to Krasa, soon as we emigrated from Czechoslovakia, I dropped the o-v-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Cause nowhere in the world it’s used.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Except --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Except in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s37">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I was born in Prague.</span> <span id="s39">I was born in downtown Prague, at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: At home?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: At home.</span> <span id="s42">And it’s a -- the house is there standing because it used to be an old palace.</span> <span id="s43">After World War I, there was a shortage of apartments, they converted some of the palaces into apartments, and in one of the part -- palaces, we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s44">So it was very interesting and it’s still standing there, it’s one of the old houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Now, I know you don’t like to give your birthdate, but I’m going to ask you if you’ll give your birthdate, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I’ll give it to you, because this is for posterity, and I’m not going to play around.</span> <span id="s47">I was born September 24, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s49">Now, I’d like to get an idea about your family, and how you were living, so tell me something about your father, and then your mother.</span> <span id="s50">What was your father like, and what did he do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: My father was a disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s52">We were very -- he was very strict with us.</span> <span id="s53">And he was a self man made.</span> <span id="s54">He came from a poor family.</span> <span id="s55">I don’t know exactly what my grandfather did.</span> <span id="s56">I knew his parents, because both were living at that time when I was up to about s -- when I was about six, my grandfather died.</span> <span id="s57">My grandma died in Terezín.</span> <span id="s58">So I knew her very well.</span> <span id="s59">And he grew up in a little town called Votice, in a t -- 12 years, he went to Prague to go to a high school, to a -- that time it was called [indecipherable], which is for a s-scientist, like MIT or something like that.</span> <span id="s60">And from the age of 12, he was supporting himself, he paid for his studies, all his schools were private, and he supported his parents.</span> <span id="s61">And when he that to us, we had never really a knowledge what it meant until we were much older, and understood what he must have been, to come from a little village to a big town, and no money, and take care of himself.</span> <span id="s62">Because he said always, “You have it easy, I pay your school, you don’t have to do anything.”</span> <span id="s63">Which was true.</span> <span id="s64">My mother on the o -- other hand, came from a very well-to-do family, and the interesting thing is that I don’t have a wedding picture of my parents.</span> <span id="s65">They got married in Prague, in a civil wedding, not a Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s66">So I think she just went and married him, and maybe my grandfather was -- grandparents didn’t even know about it when they did it, because she came from a well-to-do family, my g -- father was from a poor family.</span> <span id="s67">I don’t know, they never spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So do you think that her family didn’t approve?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: She didn’t have a mother, it was only her father at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: But my aunt had a chur -- a synagogue wedding -- synagogue wedding in Votice, so -- and had a party there.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: So I don’t know, my mother was a little rebel --</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: -- and very independent, and very ahead of her times in everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Wer -- was your mother and father similar age, was there an --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, three years difference, so that was a normal age difference.</span> <span id="s80">My father was three years younger -- ay -- older.</span> <span id="s81">My mother was three years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So how would you describe their relationship and their personality?</span> <span id="s83">They sound like very different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I think with our education in growing up, we were mostly guided by mother.</span> <span id="s85">Mother was the person who decided what we do, what we learn.</span> <span id="s86">For example, Mother was very -- decided from the first that I have to go to gimnasium, I have to study, because sh -- not every girl marries, and you have to be able to stand on your own feet.</span> <span id="s87">That was hers -- so that was very far ahead of those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And my father was concentrated on the prince, on the heir, my brother, who was older than I was.</span> <span id="s90">He was studying with him, he was checking what he learned -- math was very important, my father was an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So he was focused on your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: More focused on my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: And your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: My brother’s name in Czech is Yearje, which was pretty popular for that generation.</span> <span id="s95">In -- in English it’s George, translated.</span> <span id="s96">And as I say, they were very -- he was always very pushing -- very much pushing my brother, how he studies.</span> <span id="s97">He wasn’t checking on me, but mother took care of that.</span> <span id="s98">And so my brother really jumped a grade.</span> <span id="s99">He went from fourth grade already to gimnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Where normally it was fifth grade, and that was good because in the end he still could matriculate with the last class, they matriculated before they closed schools in ’39.</span> <span id="s102">He matriculated in June, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: He wouldn’t have if -- if he didn’t jump the grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So he was born in 1920?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: ’21.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: In ’21, I thought three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Were you jealous of the fact that your father focused on him?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s115">Not really, because on the other hand, if we fought, or if we did something, he always got it, and not me.</span> <span id="s116">He was the strong -- he was -- he was chubby, and I was skinny, and so I was the little girl, the princess who nothing should be done to, and he -- he got it.</span> <span id="s117">If we did break something, he got it, not me.</span> <span id="s118">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: -- w-we were not jealous of each other, we had a very close relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So you were close?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And did you play a lot together?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s125">My -- my -- my brother was the older one, so he was schlepping me along sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: And I loved that, and -- and when we were older the girls liked me, because he was very good looking, and they tried to get near him.</span> <span id="s128">So I had good advantages of having an older brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: -- like my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And what was the apartment like, since it was a -- i-inside of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: It was very huge because the rooms were very big, but they didn’t have the amenities that a modern apartment had, and we did move i-in fifth grade, when I went to fifth grade, we moved to a more modern apartment, in different part of Prague.</span> <span id="s133">This was near the old square, these were the old houses, and they did have running water but they didn’t have center heating or anything like that.</span> <span id="s134">You have the big stoves with tiles around them, and -- but this was very comfortable, it was big, and it -- it wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s135">You had to walk up, and there were no elevators, you know, it was a old, old house.</span> <span id="s136">People still live in these houses in Prague today.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s138">Would you have been considered upper middle class, middle class, or up --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Upper middle class, I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So you’re very comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I don’t remember that anything was ever not given to us because there wouldn’t be enough or -- all it a -- had to be, wh-whether my father will allow it or not.</span> <span id="s142">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Not whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: -- we went on vacation, we traveled to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s145">I mean, there was never question.</span> <span id="s146">But my mother was still frugal, she did not like to throw around money, but I don’t think there was any problem with money all our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And y -- you traveled on vacation oh -- oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Every vacations.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: The next day after school we were for two months out of Prague, and my father would come on weekends, or spend the week with us, but we were with my mother, out the whole two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s152">The two months?</span> <span id="s153">And what -- where would you be, like would -- she would rent a house, or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s155">Th-Those were villas where people rented part of it, or something.</span> <span id="s156">That was done not just us, all our friends were living the same way, the company we had were living the same way.</span> <span id="s157">The girls -- not all the girls in school, because there were poor girls in school too, the -- were mixed.</span> <span id="s158">But the friends we had, the Jewish friends all lived the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So did you often travel to the same place for those two months [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: For a few years we always did.</span> <span id="s161">I remember we -- there -- there were several places where we went in Czechoslovakia, then we were going to Austria for a couple years, or maybe three years.</span> <span id="s162">Then we went to Yugoslavia, and then Hitler stop it.</span> <span id="s163">And it started with the Sudeten, and then they didn’t go after.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: ’37 we were the last time on a vacation in Yugoslavia, and ’37 in -- in -- over Christmas we were in Vienna, and then it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We were every year in Vienna because my aunt lived in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s169">And wh -- is there sort of a tradition for the more wealthy to leave Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Two months seems like an awfully long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, that was the school vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s175">It was hot, and dusty, and it was the town so you were outside, and that’s where we could play tennis and do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: My wa -- father was -- they called him director, it’s th-the ravuss, the executive office, or whatever you call.</span> <span id="s178">There was a big factory called Odkolek.</span> <span id="s179">He didn’t stop there, he worked first with the [indecipherable] but I was too young at that time.</span> <span id="s180">That had about 80 stores in Prague, that -- had a lot of employees, big factory and -- outside of Prague.</span> <span id="s181">They had bread, they had chocolate, they had cakes, they had all the -- it was something like General Mills, or something, you know, but they didn’t produce for others, only for their own shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: For their own stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: So he was a big shot at that time in our eyes, maybe there were some bigger ones.</span> <span id="s186">We did not own it, because the rich Jews owned the factories.</span> <span id="s187">This was owned by a board of directors.</span> <span id="s188">I mean it was -- what do you call?</span> <span id="s189">They had the shares of that, and they were mo -- a-all Jews.</span> <span id="s190">And the day Hitler came, my father lost his job and -- and they ran away, most of them [sneezes]</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Most of them emigrated to Canada, the di -- the board of directors.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: But your father stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Now, when you were growing up, what kind of a kid were you?</span> <span id="s196">Do you remember yourself as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, I remember myself as spoiled brat, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What do you mean when you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I could get out of my father anything I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: My m -- in my case my mother was the strict one.</span> <span id="s202">For example, we got our pocket money, and we had to manage our pock -- pocket money, but I wasn’t a good manager.</span> <span id="s203">I’d spend it in the beginning, and I didn’t have for the end of the week, and my brother wouldn’t lend me, because he said you should have managed better.</span> <span id="s204">And I would go to my father, and hug him and kiss him, and get some money, so that my mother doesn’t know.</span> <span id="s205">And I knew how to handle him, even though he was very strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: So even though he wasn’t focused on you because you weren’t the male heir --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: He was there focus, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: He really was very focused on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: -- he was focused, it wasn’t that he didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: We wouldn’t dare to bring a bad mark from school, because that was punishable, we wouldn’t get money, or something.</span> <span id="s212">We were always trying to get -- because we had -- we felt we had to, I don’t know what would have happened if we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I -- I remember one thing, I came home -- we were two -- this is more in the gimnasium, after the fir -- five grades.</span> <span id="s215">I came -- there was one more girl -- Jewish girl in the class, some were maybe mixed, but they didn’t declare themselves, we were two Jewish, full Jewish girls in the class, and she’s still living, she survived the camp.</span> <span id="s216">We’re still friends, she lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s217">And we knew -- we -- the two of us knew German, because my mother wanted us to learn languages, and I had to learn French and German.</span> <span id="s218">And I wasn’t allowed to learn English.</span> <span id="s219">And we knew perfect -- we spoke -- for us it was a spoken language, you still had to learn the grammar, it’s the -- like in any language, but we could communicate and we could talk.</span> <span id="s220">And the teacher was very nasty to the two of us, so of course we said she’s an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s221">So I came home and I told my mother, “I can’t do anything with this teacher.</span> <span id="s222">She’s not going to give me the right mark because she doesn’t like me and Erika, we are -- because we are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s223">And my mother just put me around, she says, “I don’t care why she doesn’t like you.</span> <span id="s224">You’re going to find that many people don’t like you in life.</span> <span id="s225">You have to be so good that even if she doesn’t like you, she has to give you the good mark.”</span> <span id="s226">And that was it, I could never tell her that teacher is against me, or anything because it wouldn’t help.</span> <span id="s227">[indecipherable] perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And what happened with that teacher, did you end --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: We had to study, we went together and didn’t -- we did try to be better than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well, I got my good mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: We couldn’t -- when we -- we lost her, you know, in -- every year they change.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: And that -- that’s -- my mother had no pity over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: But she taught you a good lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah, in -- in [indecipherable] when we went into a store and we had to behave better, because people shouldn’t say the Jews are loud, or something, you know?</span> <span id="s238">We grew up with that, that we are different, and we have to behave differently, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Well tell me about that.</span> <span id="s240">Yo-You -- were you living in a -- in a -- were -- going to school with Jews and with Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s242">And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: You were?</span> <span id="s244">And it was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: -- we didn’t feel any anti-Semitism openly, never.</span> <span id="s246">But our parents made us aware that there are people li -- that won’t like us, and that we have to behave not to stand out.</span> <span id="s247">The Jews were always afraid not to stand out and that was the difference from the Israelis, who don’t care what the other people think about you.</span> <span id="s248">The Jews were very caring what somebody else will say about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So -- so there was a kind of fear --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: -- that even if you didn’t see something overt, it could happen if you weren’t careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Were -- were you raised as a religious person, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No.</span> <span id="s257">We celebrated Jewish holidays, celebrated Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Passover.</span> <span id="s258">Hanukah we got gifts, but there was a little tree, because we had servants, we had maids, so for the maid had to be tree.</span> <span id="s259">And if a maid got a present, we got one too.</span> <span id="s260">But we celebrated Hanukah.</span> <span id="s261">When we didn’t have maids any more, we never had a tree.</span> <span id="s262">And otherwise we celebrated the Jewish holidays, but not the little ones, we never knew Purim we never knew, Shavuot, or Sukkot, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s263">We knew only the big ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And what were considered the big ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Passover, Seder, one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: But no -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Not the whole 10 days, we did o-only two days we didn’t eat bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And Hanukah, you celebrated, but not as a big holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Hanukah we did, and not as a big holiday, we -- we lit the candles, and we got gifts, and that was it.</span> <span id="s270">Only one night we lit the candles, we didn’t do it every night.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I -- I want to go back to your being given pocket money.</span> <span id="s272">So you’re given pocket money every week, and what are you supposed to do -- what were you supposed to be doing with this money, what was it for?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: For our own pleasure, for if we want -- if we want to buy ourself something in school instead of the lunch Mother gave us.</span> <span id="s274">And if we wanted more than Mother thought it’s necessary for me to have.</span> <span id="s275">I would have gifts.</span> <span id="s276">We saved for gifts for Mother and Father.</span> <span id="s277">And we wouldn’t get special money for that, and it was expected that we give something.</span> <span id="s278">So we got pocket money.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So if you were s --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: If you bought yourself some ice cream --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Or if you would go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: My mother wanted us to be able to handle money, and since I remember -- I don’t know when it started -- I think, in my opinion, started in sixth grade, because we didn’t have -- we didn’t have possibility buying lunches in fifth grade, in grad -- in grade schools.</span> <span id="s283">We went home for lunches.</span> <span id="s284">So I think it started in sixth grade, and we could have lunch from home, but I liked the lunches what the other [indecipherable] were buying.</span> <span id="s285">So that went for my money.</span> <span id="s286">By the time sixth grade, we went to concerts, we went to the theater, we went to movies by ourselves.</span> <span id="s287">We had to pay for it from our pocket money, which I spent [indecipherable] Sunday, sometimes all.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And you would not have anything -- when would you get the money, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Every Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Every Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Every Saturday, and I only got it if my closet and my room was clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s293">So you worked hard to keep your closet --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No, only five minutes before, I [indecipherable] it up.</span> <span id="s295">Which my mother always said, that’s not [indecipherable], you’re to keep it all week, but [indecipherable], but she couldn’t change me.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: But you know, it’s -- it’s interesting that you call yourself a spoiled brat.</span> <span id="s297">It seems as if you’re spoiled in relationship to your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: -- not in relationship to --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: -- my mother too.</span> <span id="s301">She made sure we played tennis, we -- we really had everything, you know?</span> <span id="s302">Not -- I didn’t grow up like a girl that had to work, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I didn’t grow up without things.</span> <span id="s305">We had toys.</span> <span id="s306">My father made me a whole furniture -- doll -- for dolls, which he hand carved from -- you know, he was very handy with his hands, he was a -- he was also very nice, and draw beautifully, so we ne -- never got books to color, but he would make pictures for me to color, pictures of flowers, and I would color them.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We really had a easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Do you think that you were selfish?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I don’t think so, we were -- we were taught to share, and we shared with my brother, and I did my sharing with my friends.</span> <span id="s311">I don’t think I was ever selfish.</span> <span id="s312">Nobody was that I knew.</span> <span id="s313">Our house was very open, a lot of people came, mostly Mother’s family, my father didn’t have family.</span> <span id="s314">She was very close with her sister, that’s why we went -- she spent vacation with on -- us, she’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: -- my aunt was like a second mother to me.</span> <span id="s317">And I spend vacation with her in Austria, she -- when I was rough -- five years old.</span> <span id="s318">And well, my parents were very giving, so I don’t think we were selfish, [indecipherable] my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Because of your characterization of you -- when someone calls themselves a spoiled brat, they’re often an extremely difficult person to be around.</span> <span id="s320">But your parents were teaching you discipline, and teaching you a certain kind of responsibility, and respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Discipline definitely, discipline definite.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: You had to greet every time you came, just stand there till you can greet them.</span> <span id="s324">We had to had to sit at the table and not talk, because that’s impolite.</span> <span id="s325">If you made a spot on the white tablecloth, that was an affair, you know?</span> <span id="s326">We were raised strictly in how we behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So in -- at dinner, there was no s -- talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: No, after dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: After dinner?</span> <span id="s330">At the table, or you were [indecipherable] the table?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: At the table.</span> <span id="s332">What happened is my mother wanted my father and my brother to get close together.</span> <span id="s333">She found some old letters, and old stamps, so she brought them, and my father got interested in stamps.</span> <span id="s334">Old Austrian stamps since 1850, since stamps started to be -- and my brother, they -- and they were sitting every night working on the stamps, and you couldn’t breathe, and you couldn’t move the table, and I hated it.</span> <span id="s335">And Mother knew we would do our knitting, our -- she taught me crochet, she taught me to embroider.</span> <span id="s336">We would do our things like good Jews.</span> <span id="s337">We were always [indecipherable] together, we were not, as kids, allowed to go out at night.</span> <span id="s338">And it was a rule, seven o’clock was dinner, so after dinner we had to do something.</span> <span id="s339">We’d listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s340">We didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s341">I remember working on those stamps, and that was their hobby.</span> <span id="s342">The stamps, a lot of them got saved, and my nephew has them.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: My brother’s -- my brother inherited them, because I never wanted to have anything to do with them, even after the war.</span> <span id="s345">And then my nephew inherited them from my brother.</span> <span id="s346">So they still exist, and it’s a old, Austrian collection that supposedly is valued, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I have no idea about stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Were your parents affectionate?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes, and we were a kissing family, and very much so.</span> <span id="s351">That’s why we had to kiss every time you leave, every time you came back.</span> <span id="s352">But we were a very affectionate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s354">What did you like in school, was -- were there particular subjects that you were attracted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, history and geography, that is mine.</span> <span id="s356">Hated math.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Hated math.</span> <span id="s358">No wonder you were uncomfortable with the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: And no wonder my father didn’t bother with me, and ma -- my brother was a math genius.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: My brother was very bright.</span> <span id="s362">He spoke five languages, and he was really very bright.</span> <span id="s363">On him it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And was there something particular about history that you liked, since history is -- was it history of Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yeah, the old Greek and Roman history interested me, loved that.</span> <span id="s366">All the stories about the gods, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Did you want to study Greek?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No, because I went into riyad gimnasium where you don’t have Greek.</span> <span id="s369">You see the schools, are -- I didn’t tell you the [indecipherable] gimnasium where there was Greek and Latin.</span> <span id="s370">The arr gimnasium where they kept only Latin.</span> <span id="s371">[indecipherable] in riyad, where they had the math and the sciences only, no Latin and no Greek.</span> <span id="s372">So from the riyad gimnasium where I went, you could go to both colleges, to the sciences, and to the university.</span> <span id="s373">But the others weren’t geared directly.</span> <span id="s374">I don’t think it’s the same today, I have no idea how it is -- things are there today.</span> <span id="s375">But you had to made a test, right, where you can go.</span> <span id="s376">And the pressure was tremendous, and my brother made the test from the fourth grade, and he was young -- a year older, I went in fifth grade for that test, and I thought I will die if I don’t get in, because my mother wanted me so strongly to study.</span> <span id="s377">But I did pass, and God, I cried when they read the names in class, and I came out with tears, and I knew my mother thought I failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: But you --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Because I was so nervous and so tense that I let go of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s380">And as a reward we went for ice cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I was -- and in fifth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: 10 and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: 10 - 11, 10 - 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: That was end of [indecipherable], so I was 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s388">So you really liked school, when you liked the subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I loved school --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: When it came that I had to leave, I was devastated that I couldn’t study any more, that -- that was, for me end of the world I wanted -- but then burns, my father said, “This will -- war will be over soon [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s392">You know, all this --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Right, that’s what everybody thought</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: -- six months and you’ll be home.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: We were saying even two months, some people, not six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: We have to stop the tape --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: -- and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Hana, do you have any way of explaining why your mother was so ahead of her time?</span> <span id="s404">For a woman of her time to say you may not get married, so you have to be able to be independent, you have to be educated.</span> <span id="s405">It’s very unusual.</span> <span id="s406">Where -- where do you think that came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s408">I think my mother, as I said, was a little rebel of -- in her young days, because she told me little stories, when she got punished.</span> <span id="s409">Her mother looked so strict and severe.</span> <span id="s410">And she loved her parents, and I went to the cemetery every time with her to visit, and she always cried, so I knew she loved them, and she -- I thought, how could somebody love grandma, who looked so strict and -- and she lost her mother when she was 20 years old, and had to take care of the whole -- my grandfather had a far -- big farm, with employees, and things like that, not a small where he was the farmer himself.</span> <span id="s411">And she had to handle all the men, there had to be cooked for all the employees.</span> <span id="s412">And she has to take care -- I mean, she was 20.</span> <span id="s413">She also went to school -- not to a gimnasium, because they didn’t exist in villages, but to a school for girls, to -- they call it pensionnat, and they learn behavior, serving, cooking, and you know, some subjects, too.</span> <span id="s414">Which was unusual, so maybe that’s where she got her independence.</span> <span id="s415">And I don’t think my father liked all that inva -- dependence sometimes because when she wanted for us to do it, and -- and do other things, my father didn’t want always to do it, they might have a little fight about it, but there were no serious fights, there were -- there were regular squabbles because we -- she wanted us to play tennis, and all -- swim and do things.</span> <span id="s416">My father didn’t think it’s important or should be, or the girls should do it, too, you know?</span> <span id="s417">We did all the sports from very early age.</span> <span id="s418">Mother felt very important.</span> <span id="s419">You had to learn tennis, we loved it.</span> <span id="s420">We had to learn skiing.</span> <span id="s421">She tried to ski with us, but she couldn’t keep up with us, and gave it up because she always had to be with us, my father wouldn’t let us go --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Without her.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: -- without her.</span> <span id="s424">And we -- the swimming I started at a very early age, and I did dancing, I did gymnastics, I played piano.</span> <span id="s425">We had all -- everything was because my mother wanted; to travel too.</span> <span id="s426">My mother wanted us to see foreign countries, and -- the only thing that I remember when I started to be little older, and I loved the American movies, or s -- English movies, I wanted to learn English, and I was not allowed.</span> <span id="s427">English is for businessmen, not for young girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And this your mother said?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes, I had to learn French.</span> <span id="s430">French is for girls.</span> <span id="s431">So when I came back in ’45, I immediately started to learn English, cause I always wanted that.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And did you want it because you -- you thought you wanted to come to the United States, or just wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, I wanted it because I wanted to understand those movies --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: -- I -- I l-liked the sound of the language, I didn’t like French.</span> <span id="s436">Especially after ’38, I was hating the French, what they did to us.</span> <span id="s437">The British did it too, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s438">Silly.</span> <span id="s439">And I wanted to learn English, and I started in ’45, and by ’47 when I went to England, I spoke English.</span> <span id="s440">I was so di -- when I am determined, I do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: That sounds like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And you loved the American movies more than the movies of other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Wh-Why do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I don’t know, I admired them.</span> <span id="s447">“Gone With The Wind,” came only after the war, and I maybe saw it 10 times.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I loved that movie.</span> <span id="s450">When I had to leave school, there was “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” on, and my father, as a -- to lessen the pain that I have -- they knew I -- I -- I was unhappy about leaving school, but there was nothing they could do, and so he took me to the movies for that, you know?</span> <span id="s451">And that was the last time I was in the movies, because right afterwards it was forbidden to go to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: To go to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: So I loved anything, we -- you know, it’s interesting, when we were little, when you went to a movie, there were -- we saw Charlie Chaplin movies, there was always the Fox news before, and then a cartoon.</span> <span id="s454">And all this was in English, and I couldn’t understand, I had to read.</span> <span id="s455">The reading wasn’t so easy when I was little, so I wanted to understand.</span> <span id="s456">I don’t know, maybe that was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And did you have favorites when -- how young were you when you went to the movies, five or six years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah, tha -- for the cartoons.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: We got them later than you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: You know, they came to Europe later, “Popeye” and all that.</span> <span id="s463">So we loved cartoons like the kids love today.</span> <span id="s464">Not the crazy ones, but we liked the regular cartoons.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: And they had special performances for children, but once we went to school and had friends, we could go on our own to movies, and that’s when we had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s467">As long as we went with my father sun -- Sunday morning, we didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: He would pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: But if you went on your own --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: But on -- later on my parents did not go with us, we -- we went to the national -- there was part of the school, it was -- they made student programs, and the student programs meant that you got cheap tickets from -- from -- as -- as long as you were a student.</span> <span id="s472">And I was only 10 years old, we went on our own to concerts, on our own to the opera.</span> <span id="s473">And that was sun -- Saturday afternoon, and that was our program, Saturday after -- sun -- Saturday morning we wents there to school, Saturday afternoon we went to the theater, or to the concert.</span> <span id="s474">Sunday we went to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: And that young you were going to opera and concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yeah, yeah, because it was part of our schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: As a matter of fact we had to sometimes write a report about it, that was expected of us to go and hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: And did you study opera in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Nnn.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: It simply -- this was just normal?</span> <span id="s484">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: This was normal.</span> <span id="s486">One subject was music.</span> <span id="s487">So sometimes you had singing, sometimes you had history of music.</span> <span id="s488">Sometimes you learned about the composers, mostly Czech -- mostly Czech music, and Mozart because Mozart was favorite of the Czechs because he wrote in -- in park, he wrote -- got not -- you know, mostly the Czech composer.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So then how --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Rorchak, and Smetana, and Such, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s492">Right.</span> <span id="s493">And d-you -- d -- whose operas did you see, mainly?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Mostly it was Rorchaks, and Smetana, because those were the popular operas.</span> <span id="s495">But we saw Tosca, we saw Carmen.</span> <span id="s496">I mean, we went whatever the program was.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Much ma -- my parents never went to a concert with us, we went with my brother, and my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s500">And did you sit in the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Because it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: -- we tried to save money, we -- we didn’t buy the expensive tickets, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s505">And when you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: There was a special student prices, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: I was going to ask whether there was special prices.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah, and they’re right in the back, we didn’t sit in the orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s510">And were there s -- concerts that you preferred?</span> <span id="s511">Did you prefer orchestra, did you prefer piano, violin --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: And then in Terezìn too, I used to go to Sommer-Herz, to listen to her all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: But you were playing piano all along, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes, but I -- I -- neither my brother nor my -- nor me were very musical, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s517">My father was -- had a tremendous ear for music.</span> <span id="s518">But it was part of the education, you had to go through with it.</span> <span id="s519">And only when it was forbidden did I miss it, because I had to practice every day when I was little, half an hour, then later an hour.</span> <span id="s520">And the watch was on the piano so that I don’t practice a minute longer.</span> <span id="s521">So it wasn’t in me, the music.</span> <span id="s522">It was only because I had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: You had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: But again, when you lose it, then -- my brother to give up his violin, I -- they -- we had to take out the piano and give it up, it wasn’t allowed, Jews to have.</span> <span id="s525">I wanted to play then, and then it was not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Then you couldn’t, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: But just to tell you how part -- and we were in Israel and we had very little, but when Danny, our oldest son was five years old, he had to learn piano.</span> <span id="s528">I thought that’s an omen, that has to be.</span> <span id="s529">We didn’t have a piano, we didn’t have a refrigerator, the first thing I bought was a piano for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: No refrigerator, icebox.</span> <span id="s532">No stove, just the kerosene, but the piano was in the house.</span> <span id="s533">And when we came to Boston, I bought a piano for 25 dollars, that the kids can play piano.</span> <span id="s534">So th-that was what I was used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span

id="s540">A: I can still read notes, but I’m not good.</span> <span id="s541">I have never been really good.</span> <span id="s542">You had performances for the parents, you know, that had recitals that had to be so that the teacher shows what she did.</span> <span id="s543">But I was never good at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Did you like to perform?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: You didn’t like to be in public?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: No.</span> <span id="s549">About anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Ah, in dance I didn’t mind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: In dance?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: In dance I didn’t mind it.</span> <span id="s553">In the gym -- gymnastics I didn’t mind, cause I felt secure that I was good at sports, but music, no, I wasn’t so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: And were you doing modern dance, or you’re doing ballet?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: First I was doing gymnastics.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And that was with a German deutsche toonfuray.</span> <span id="s558">And then my mother didn’t want that I get muscles, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: What is a deutsche toonfuray?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: That was real German, German speaking gymnastics, and later on it was very [indecipherable] oriented, but I was there very early.</span> <span id="s561">And so she took me out, and I did do dancing.</span> <span id="s562">Not ballet, but dancing, so there was more like -- not modern dances, it was like dancing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Was it at -- ballroom dancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: No, it wasn’t that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, it was like a ballet except dancing, you didn’t stand on your toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: You were doing waltz or in group dancing the girls, and that’s what we had the performances.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s570">And y -- did you have a -- one live-in maid, or you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: We had, when we were little, there were a lot of people around, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s572">But we had a nanny that stayed faithful to us, and we loved her very dearly.</span> <span id="s573">After that she got married, she would still come and help Mother, but al -- we had later on only one lived-in -- live-in maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: But when you were younger, there were a lot of people around doing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: There were -- there were lot of people around that cook -- I don’t know where they lived all, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s576">We -- I remember only one live-in maid, but they were coming in and out, and the nanny was there.</span> <span id="s577">We loved her, so she took care of us.</span> <span id="s578">And she was from the same village where mother was.</span> <span id="s579">She brought her in -- into Prague.</span> <span id="s580">And she died shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s581">And she was the only one, where my parents le -- ta -- some money, and she immediately said, “I give you the money back.”</span> <span id="s582">So we said, “No, we divide it into three,” my brother, me and her, because she didn’t have an easy life.</span> <span id="s583">The other people said, “Your parents gave it to us, when they come back we give it to them.”</span> <span id="s584">They never gave it to us.</span> <span id="s585">Even though we told them my parents are not coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s587">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: But she did.</span> <span id="s589">That was our nanny.</span> <span id="s590">But she died in ’40 s -- ’46, beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: She was very sick when we came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Things start changing in ’38 and ’39, don’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: It started really for us in ’38, when Hitler occupied Austria, anschluss.</span> <span id="s595">Because mother’s sister lived with her husband in Austria, and in June they moved to Prague.</span> <span id="s596">They were the ones who told us the horror stories about Jews washing -- I mean, being beaten in the streets, having to wash the pavement.</span> <span id="s597">But they were not taken because they were still Czech citizens.</span> <span id="s598">So they didn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s599">And they got an apartment near us, and that was the year [indecipherable] was very high.</span> <span id="s600">Czech screaming we will never give up, we will fight, before Munich.</span> <span id="s601">And that summer, there was a -- the Czech organization called Sokol was very patriotic, was all -- like a Olympiad.</span> <span id="s602">And all the schools took part in it, and then we marched through pr -- Prague.</span> <span id="s603">And I marched with my school, I took part in it with my school, my brother took part in it with his school.</span> <span id="s604">And we were all very chauvinistics, the Czechs were never -- we will fight, and -- the Germans, and we will never give up.</span> <span id="s605">And my uncle who came from Vienna, was always like pouring cold water over us, and telling us today they scream we will never give up, tomorrow they will scream heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s606">And he was right.</span> <span id="s607">And then came ’38, September, and we did give up.</span> <span id="s608">And from that time on -- my father did look into immigration.</span> <span id="s609">Our life didn’t change until 15th of March, because my father still worked.</span> <span id="s610">I don’t know how he felt, whether he felt any anti-Semitism, but we have seen changes in school.</span> <span id="s611">We still went to school, nothing changed, and -- but some people weren’t so friendly any more, and some people stayed friendly.</span> <span id="s612">But it was a very uneasy -- the slogans were volt -- which rhymes in Czech, Volt number eight had again conquered noses, which meant the Jewish noses.</span> <span id="s613">The typical Jew had a crooked nose, and so that’s -- was always said, that’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s614">And the situation changed, you didn’t feel so safe any more.</span> <span id="s615">And -- but in 15th of March, the day I will never forget, it was snowing, it was very raw.</span> <span id="s616">Where we lived -- we moved from that [indecipherable] other d -- apartment.</span> <span id="s617">Jews did not -- there were no condominiums, you either owned a house, or an apartment.</span> <span id="s618">Houses to own, rent -- to own big apartment houses, you really had to be very rich, because you did not -- mortgages were not like you buy a house today here in the United States.</span> <span id="s619">So we had a large apartment again, in -- on Benohuradi, which was a modern, and much nicer part of Prague, more green there.</span> <span id="s620">And I went to school there in my fifth grade, and then I had to walk downtown to school.</span> <span id="s621">We didn’t use public transportation, we walked to school and home.</span> <span id="s622">And it started -- I -- across from our house was a German school.</span> <span id="s623">And the German school was immediately occupied, 15th of March by German soldiers.</span> <span id="s624">They came -- they -- at four o’clock in the morning, the telephone rang in our house, and my father picked up the telephone, it was somebody from the factory, I don’t know who called, telling my father Hitler crossed the border, Sudeten -- from Sudeten into Bohemia.</span> <span id="s625">Don’t come to work any more.</span> <span id="s626">And that was the end of his work, 15th of March.</span> <span id="s627">And when we woke up, the school was occupied across the street, and I saw the Hackenkreuz fa -- flags hung, and the German soldiers standing guard from my windows.</span> <span id="s628">And it was snowing, it was very cold and raw, and we didn’t go to school that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What kind of flags did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: The German flags --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: -- with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: The swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: The swastika.</span> <span id="s635">And we stayed at the house all day.</span> <span id="s636">Also my parents decided to let the maid go from now on, because my father was without a job.</span> <span id="s637">So that was the whole change of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Can I ask you something?</span> <span id="s639">Your father is working in a Jewish business --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Not a Jewish business, this was a regular business, j-just a board of directors were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: But they were gone from that day on, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s644">So it was so fast nothing -- they just --</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Maybe some of them are already left, I couldn’t tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yes -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: -- before, you know, and some other people bought the sto -- stocks or things.</span> <span id="s648">I don’t know the financial --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: But they clearly knew what they were going to do, as soon as Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Because they wanted to please the Germans right away, there’s no Jew working here.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: It was immediate.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: So this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: And a non-Jew stepped into my father’s position immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s658">So this is extremely shocking, this is not a development --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I don’t know whether my father expected it or not.</span> <span id="s660">We didn’t, we kids didn’t.</span> <span id="s661">I don’t know what was happening from ’38 in the job with my father.</span> <span id="s662">But I know that we were -- my father tried to get out in a way.</span> <span id="s663">I don’t know what all this happened.</span> <span id="s664">Cause we found a letter that a friend of his from Palestine had a job for him.</span> <span id="s665">And I know that my brother took some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s666">You know, we kids were not told anything.</span> <span id="s667">We were not told when somebody was sick.</span> <span id="s668">As a matter of fact I could never forget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died.</span> <span id="s669">I just found out when I came to visit grandma and grandpa was gone.</span> <span id="s670">We were never told anything.</span> <span id="s671">They didn’t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn’t f -- I didn’t feel we don’t money or something, you know, afterwards.</span> <span id="s672">We lived in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s673">We didn’t have to move.</span> <span id="s674">We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a room that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments, because if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to have it clean of Jews, and they moved out.</span> <span id="s675">Somebody else had to take them in.</span> <span id="s676">We took in two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their 60’s.</span> <span id="s677">To me they seemed ancient.</span> <span id="s678">And then we had a -- when they were deported away, which was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they said Hitler will not get them.</span> <span id="s679">But they said they -- they were going to Lódz -- they went in the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we won’t do it, because you have kids.</span> <span id="s680">So when you asked about the suicides, the German Jews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian.</span> <span id="s681">We did not, the Czechs, didn’t think about that ever.</span> <span id="s682">And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife, because when they left, we had to take somebody else.</span> <span id="s683">That was not the German decision that the apartment was too big for a family.</span> <span id="s684">And a friend of mine lived with us, too.</span> <span id="s685">It was the decision of the Jewish community, agreement.</span> <span id="s686">You know, they -- they had to take care of them -- their own people, nobody else would.</span> <span id="s687">And I think everyone complied gladly, we didn’t need that much room.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: So these two women who told your mother they had poison --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: -- went to Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: -- they said they wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: They wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: -- at the -- in the house, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: They told her about it.</span> <span id="s694">That’s what my mother told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Hm, interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: They left us a legacy, they used to own in -- in Vienna, a like bread and breakfast, or something, a pensionnat they call it, pensionne.</span> <span id="s697">And they had a cookbook from 1906, I still have that coo -- cookbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s700">It’s falling apart, and I still bake from that cookbook.</span> <span id="s701">It’s in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And -- and they gave it to your m --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: To me -- my mother for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: -- mother.</span> <span id="s705">How sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Very sweet.</span> <span id="s708">So what was it like for you then?</span> <span id="s709">Is -- where is money coming from?</span> <span id="s710">How do you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: You don’t know, because the day Hitler came, you did go out that day, my mother went to the bank, wanted to take out her safe.</span> <span id="s714">And they wouldn’t let her, the Czechs said no.</span> <span id="s715">The safe was gone.</span> <span id="s716">All what she had in the safe was gone.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t know what my parents had in the safe.</span> <span id="s718">When, after the war I went there, because I knew -- I used to go with my mother, I knew the number, and I knew the safe.</span> <span id="s719">I went there, and the Czechs said the Germans took it all.</span> <span id="s720">And when we applied for, in Germany for German [indecipherable] wrote about it, they said, “Give us a proof that the Germans took it out of Czech Republic -- of Czechoslovakia.”</span> <span id="s721">So, that was gone.</span> <span id="s722">And the money was put immediately under -- confiscated.</span> <span id="s723">Your savings, and your money.</span> <span id="s724">But every month you were allowed to take out certain amount, so that I think that’s how we lived afterwards.</span> <span id="s725">And then I worked -- I had to do something, so my -- I couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s726">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Wait a second, from March 15th of ’38 --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I still went to school till ’39 --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: School till f --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: -- then they closed the universities, and they closed the gimnasium for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: In ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s733">I -- ’39 or sometime during the 40 -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s734">I think it was in ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: And then I had to do something, so my mother found a job for me to do as apprentice for dressmaking.</span> <span id="s737">So I got little bit money, so I had little bit pocket money, and I gave some thana -- something to my mother, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s738">It wasn’t much.</span> <span id="s739">And I had to do something, so I was working as a apprentice for s -- I hated every minute of it.</span> <span id="s740">I hated sewing, but as a reward, my father bought me a new sewing machine, so that -- maybe that will interest me in it.</span> <span id="s741">That’s the same, except it started much later with me, where they felt a girl has to have a -- something, if she needs to earn money, and -- because they did think we will get out.</span> <span id="s742">Mother had some relative in Chile, and we were supposed to go, but we kids were deadly against it, we didn’t want.</span> <span id="s743">The same way I was in the kindertransport, because I wasn’t 16 yet at that time.</span> <span id="s744">My brother was 16, he couldn’t go, and I threw such a tantrum that I won’t go alone.</span> <span id="s745">If he can’t go, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s746">So my mother took me out.</span> <span id="s747">And then I went alone to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: But you would have gone if --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: My brother would -- my -- my brother would --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: -- your brother jor -- if your brother had gone, you would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: -- I would have gone, I just couldn’t bear to be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: -- alone.</span> <span id="s753">Now what -- why do you think your mother chose dressmaking?</span> <span id="s754">Was this because that’s what women did?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: I think the girls did dressmaking or hat making.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: And she thought dresses are more -- more peop -- you know, hats you don’t change as much as dresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: As dresses.</span> <span id="s759">And what did your bro --</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: My friend, the one that went with to school with me, she went into hat dressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Hat making [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Hat making.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s765">Some learned to be a hairdresser or something.</span> <span id="s766">Something that women did those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So what was clear very quickly was that you had to learn to be able to do something [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: A trade, with your hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: -- not something that was professional, in the intellectual sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: You couldn’t, your schools were closed to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Closed, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: University my brother went, I think not even a month university, and they closed all universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: He -- I think he got a job, something on the -- in the Jewish community, I don’t know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s775">[indecipherable] something.</span> <span id="s776">Cause he had already matur -- matriculation, he had all -- you know, in Europe, matriculation was enough to do something --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: -- was not like here, that you have to have four years of college to be something, to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: So he was 19 in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: He was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: No, 18 in 1939, and in 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: The high s -- the universities closed definitely ’39.</span> <span id="s783">I think the --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span

#3</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Did you have a problem with food when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I was spoiled in food.</span> <span id="s791">I didn’t eat anything.</span> <span id="s792">I was always very skinny, and my parent thought I was sick because I couldn’t gain weight.</span> <span id="s793">I was very healthy and I did a lot of sports and not sitting still a minute, so I didn’t gain, I could even [indecipherable] not like today, that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s794">And I didn’t -- I -- those days parent thought that you have to eat everything what if once you get hungry, so that you don’t get hungry, eat everything.</span> <span id="s795">My mother tried, and tr -- I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s796">But when I went to camp by myself, I promised her I will eat everything.</span> <span id="s797">And that stayed with me, and I’ll tell you a funny story about it when we get to that.</span> <span id="s798">I was very choosy.</span> <span id="s799">So m -- I would get paid extra money if I put whipped cream on my dessert, or if I will eat another piece of cake, or -- so I earned money extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: But what ha -- what happens after the occupation, and your father loses his job, but you’re not quite sure what’s happening --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well, we didn’t have such special foods, we had mostly -- first of all, after all the restrictions, my mother had access removed from -- because there was a -- one store very near us of [indecipherable] where my father -- and my father was loved by a lot of the employees.</span> <span id="s802">He was very good with them.</span> <span id="s803">There was a young woman there who loved him too, and her boss, you know?</span> <span id="s804">So she would give Mother out more -- more of noodles, and more of flour, or things like that, without tickets.</span> <span id="s805">Because Jews had different tickets, and my mo -- rations, and my mother could go shopping only between three and five.</span> <span id="s806">And I don’t remember if it was every day or three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.</span> <span id="s807">I don’t know how, because I never went shopping, because Mother wou -- did all the shopping.</span> <span id="s808">So we didn’t -- we had some friends would bring an onion, Jews were not allowed to have vegetables, onions.</span> <span id="s809">There was a funny story.</span> <span id="s810">Fish we were not allowed to have, and my mother got from somebody a carp, and if you know about Heidricks [indecipherable] of hi -- the assassination of Heidrick?</span> <span id="s811">That day, somebody gave Mother a carp, and she put it in the bathtub to have it for weekend.</span> <span id="s812">Tha -- this is [indecipherable] she was on [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s813">And that night Germans came to the house to search, to our house.</span> <span id="s814">And when they banged down on the door, we woke up, and my father right away knew it’s German, my mother threw dirty wash into the bathtub, so they didn’t see the carp.</span> <span id="s815">But of course the carp died.</span> <span id="s816">So we had to have it the next day -- the next -- the same day.</span> <span id="s817">They were looking if we don’t hide the assassins.</span> <span id="s818">I mean -- you know, they just wanted to make the Jews afraid, which they succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s820">Well, so -- let’s -- let’s talk a little bit more specifically.</span> <span id="s821">There’s a -- there’s a series of restrictions that --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: -- w -- could you tr-tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I tried to remember all of them, because I think I was in -- at that time ba -- home.</span> <span id="s825">Of course, the first was to wear the Jewish star, and -- because I considered myself looking Jewish, I would be afraid not to.</span> <span id="s826">You had to have it on your coat, and underneath.</span> <span id="s827">You got -- at the Jewish community you got a sheet of stars, you cut them out, and you had to have it sewn on, not with pins, so that you can’t take it easily on and off.</span> <span id="s828">And that’s the one I have sewn by my mother, still on her dress.</span> <span id="s829">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Does that mean if you took off your coat --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: It had to be underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: It had to be -- yes, I see.</span> <span id="s833">So it always had to be visible, and it was on the left side?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Always it did, on the left side.</span> <span id="s835">Then came when schools were forbidden, any schooling for the children.</span> <span id="s836">And in the beginning I still got some schooling, a teacher -- a Jewish teacher after work, we could go and read something, books or -- she had some books from history, so I would go in, she talked about history.</span> <span id="s837">It really wasn’t schooling, we were just -- they thought to work the brain little bit.</span> <span id="s838">And I don’t know whether my parents paid for it, what it was, but I went with my friend to this s -- but second thing was that Jews have a -- eight o’clock you have to be home.</span> <span id="s839">Jews were not allowed to be on the streets from eight to five unless they had a special permit.</span> <span id="s840">Jews had -- there was from the beginning, eight o’clock was Sperre, we called.</span> <span id="s841">And my father, being very concerned, we kids had to be home 7:30.</span> <span id="s842">And I always said, “You are worse -- Hitler gives us eight, you give us 7:30.”</span> <span id="s843">We were rebelling against that, but there was no way, so our friends to -- we went ho -- they walked us home and then they went home, because they could be eight o’clock, we were the only ones -- my brother and me, we had to be home 7:30.</span> <span id="s844">You have to understand, by this time we are teenagers, so we want to be out little later.</span> <span id="s845">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s846">That was the next thing.</span> <span id="s847">Then came that we were not allowed to go through park.</span> <span id="s848">So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks.</span> <span id="s849">Nothing where green grew, you could go around.</span> <span id="s850">Then we were not allowed to go to the main squares.</span> <span id="s851">To the [indecipherable] like [indecipherable] squares, the old squares, you had to go around, on the out squares.</span> <span id="s852">Then came you couldn’t go in the street car, only the last train, the last platform.</span> <span id="s853">And if it was full, it was your bad luck, you couldn’t get on, couldn’t get on, wait for the next one.</span> <span id="s854">We couldn’t go to any coffeehouses, because the Czechs were -- even the young one used to be -- would go for a coffee or dessert in the afternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee.</span> <span id="s855">That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all, no movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing.</span> <span id="s856">So what we did, like young people, we met in -- every Saturday and Sunday with a group, in somebody else’s house.</span> <span id="s857">And what was happening, these groups became very close.</span> <span id="s858">You couldn’t bring a friend unless everyone agreed.</span> <span id="s859">It was like a social club, you know, because you couldn’t have it grow big, because only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by others and it could be considered that we are planning something against the Germans, or -- so the groups had to be very small.</span> <span id="s860">I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when we put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed it to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s861">At 7:30 I had to be home.</span> <span id="s862">It was only for the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: So it was set -- it was eight o’clock, but for you 7:30, seven nights a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: 7:30, seven nights a week, 7:30 I had to be home.</span> <span id="s865">When we were young it was seven, and then it ca -- became 7:30.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: 7:30, so it was a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: And what’s the --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: And that was dinner, and we had to be together.</span> <span id="s870">Meals were always together.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Always together.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: And there was no excuse from meals.</span> <span id="s873">We had to be together, and if something was conflicting with it, we had to give it up, because my father wanted to see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: So you couldn’t be invited to dinner to someone else’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Did you ever invite people for dinner at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: My parents did, but not my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: But not your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s880">My parents had their friends.</span> <span id="s881">And when we were little we couldn’t have dinner with them, when we were bigger, we could sit with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: But be quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Be quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: What sort of plays?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: I don’t even remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Did -- do you remember</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: -- I have some pictures from it, and I don’t even remember what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Were you acting?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: But -- we were acting.</span> <span id="s890">Our friend who died in Terezín afterwards, very early, was the first one we lost, which was such a shock to us, he was 21, in 1943.</span> <span id="s891">And he was very intelligent, and very bright, an intellectual, and he wrote them, and he was so the -- the director, and he choosed who was doing what.</span> <span id="s892">And that was fun to do because we had nothing to do the afternoon.</span> <span id="s893">We would play, like we had a -- a record player, we would play music, we would do little dancing, but you had to be careful not to make noise so the neighbors don’t hear.</span> <span id="s894">You know, we had nothing to do much in the afternoons, except be in the apartment.</span> <span id="s895">Next week we went in somebody else.</span> <span id="s896">So we tried -- so he tried to do, and then we had rehearsals for months, and months, and months.</span> <span id="s897">And then one production the parents would come and watch us do it, which was so childish I think today, but we didn’t think so at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Why were you meeting each other on Saturday and Sundays?</span> <span id="s899">Since you had no -- cause you were working during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Because during the week we were working --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: You were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: -- that was our free afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: And what would we do, you can’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s905">You couldn’t even sit in a park.</span> <span id="s906">You couldn’t walk the streets, you couldn’t go shopping, you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s907">I remember when we knew this will be forbidden, and we have to wear the star, with a friend I went to see this -- the castle, and go through the church there, which was such a famous part of Czech history, because we knew we won’t be able to do it any more.</span> <span id="s908">We couldn’t go to a museum, we couldn’t go to a church, to -- you know, one thing what we did too, which was interesting when you talk about concerts, we went to church to s -- hear the mass, Bach, and all that as kids.</span> <span id="s909">In the church were the concerts Sunday morning, we went to the church and listened.</span> <span id="s910">Music was very big part of our life, and I didn’t give it to my kids here as much.</span> <span id="s911">[indecipherable] kids, you don’t take them to concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I did in Boston tried.</span> <span id="s914">On Wednesday morning was at the Hatch, with Arthur Freeder -- Fiedler.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Arthur Fiedler, right, the Pops concerts, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: I took my son when he was five there.</span> <span id="s917">But he wasn’t interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: It wasn’t interesting, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I don’t know how our parents made us interested, what -- I don’t remember when they started us.</span> <span id="s920">So that I forgot, that we went to churches, all that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s921">[indecipherable] were closed.</span> <span id="s922">You know, nothing was working, so we met in the houses, that was the only --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: What was your mood?</span> <span id="s924">This is a very depressing, oppr -- oppressive situation.</span> <span id="s925">Everything is --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: We were very optimistic, even my fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: -- my father had a short wave radio.</span> <span id="s929">And Father listened to BBC, and to Voice of America, and to -- mostly the British one they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: BBC?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s932">And he would watch what the war is doing, and he was very optimistic.</span> <span id="s933">Then we had to give up the radio.</span> <span id="s934">Bicycles had to be given -- my brother owned a bicycle, I never did because my mother wouldn’t let me ride a bike, I would have muscles on my legs, legs should be nice and smooth.</span> <span id="s935">So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did is he let out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and everything because he says he’s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans.</span> <span id="s936">And the radio we didn’t give up either.</span> <span id="s937">From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and switched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station.</span> <span id="s938">And my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father what’s happening at night, slip in under darkness.</span> <span id="s939">So the ordinary radio, the Germans did get.</span> <span id="s940">So you didn’t -- we didn’t -- were not allowed to have a telephone.</span> <span id="s941">All my life I -- we had a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward.</span> <span id="s942">So they’d stripped us of everything, and every time we thought it’s the last thing.</span> <span id="s943">And another thing what the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against the Jews.</span> <span id="s944">So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were thinking, what will come this time?</span> <span id="s945">What will they take away this time?</span> <span id="s946">The jewelry?</span> <span id="s947">This is my mother’s ring.</span> <span id="s948">She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar.</span> <span id="s949">So that’s her -- I don’t know whether it was her mother’s or whether my father gave it to her.</span> <span id="s950">But when I had it checked, they said it’s 1900 cut.</span> <span id="s951">That she hid for me.</span> <span id="s952">But you know, it came slow.</span> <span id="s953">All these people say why didn’t you ever -- weapons -- first thing was weapons.</span> <span id="s954">My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver -- had a -- a handgun at home.</span> <span id="s955">So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing.</span> <span id="s956">So they stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave, you had no rights at all.</span> <span id="s957">And you -- if you didn’t step -- when the SS man walked on the pavement, when -- we had to step down into the gutter, whatever.</span> <span id="s958">We were not allowed to be in the pavement when the SS walked by.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: And how did the Gentile Czechs treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Once Hitler came, except for one friend, all dropped me like dead wood.</span> <span id="s961">One stayed faithful, I’m still with -- friends with her.</span> <span id="s962">She’s the one gave me everything, she’s the one with the radio, and the first thing she said to me, “I have your father’s radio.”</span> <span id="s963">I said, “I don’t want it, he gave it to your father, and you were so good to me, keep it.”</span> <span id="s964">She still has it.</span> <span id="s965">But the others dropped us, wouldn’t talk to us, would turn away.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: So they never said anything, they simply stared?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No, they just dropped us.</span> <span id="s968">They were afraid to be seen with us.</span> <span id="s969">I [indecipherable] and they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s970">But this friend still came to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Did that anger you or hurt you, or did you understand that they were afraid, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: I wa -- I did understand, and I tried to connect after the war, and the same thing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: They did the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I did the sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s979">I met with them through somebody I -- I didn’t know where they lived any more, I forgot the address [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s980">We got in touch and the four of us that were very close in the gimnasium, met.</span> <span id="s981">This was soon after the war, very early the summer of ’45.</span> <span id="s982">And I was devastated, I lost my parents.</span> <span id="s983">I had -- didn’t know what I will live off, I didn’t have a profession.</span> <span id="s984">I wasn’t that young that, you know, today you think they are grown-up at that age, I was really immature for that.</span> <span id="s985">And I didn’t know where I will be tomorrow, and I had no roof over my head.</span> <span id="s986">And we met, and we went into coffeehouse for coffee.</span> <span id="s987">And they talked about boys and dances, and dresses, and I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s988">And they were not interested in me at all, and I had nothing to contribute to the conversation.</span> <span id="s989">We said good-byes, and I never saw them again [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: So they never asked you what happened.</span> <span id="s991">They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: No.</span> <span id="s993">When you wanted to say something you were told, “Don’t talk about it, that’s gone, we survived, it’s finished.</span> <span id="s994">Don’t think about it at all.”</span> <span id="s995">So that was the end.</span> <span id="s996">I don’t know where they are, or whether they live, or nothing, e-except that one friend that I kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: So you -- you’re saying that you remained optimistic, in spite of all of this --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Always optimistic in spite -- my father was so optimistic.</span> <span id="s999">I don’t know whether he did it for us, or whether he was -- first of all, he thought Hitler won’t do to the Czech Jews what he did to the German Jews.</span> <span id="s1000">And we always felt we are different.</span> <span id="s1001">We are -- we are not like the Polish Jews that wore -- you know, the Hassidic.</span> <span id="s1002">We were dressed normally.</span> <span id="s1003">They always considered themselves different.</span> <span id="s1004">And then we thought, he can’t do, we are a protectorate, we are not Germany, he won’t do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1005">And once -- special in 1941, when America went into war after Pearl Harbor, we celebrated, this is the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1006">People said the next day will be end of the war, the America will just bomb Germany, and that will be the end.</span> <span id="s1007">The Germans won’t get up any more.</span> <span id="s1008">It didn’t work that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: And you alone, with your friends that would meet every week --</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: We were very optimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: You’re very optimistic, you didn’t sit there and say, oh my God, what’s happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1014">That’s very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Until -- until ’41 when the transports started.</span> <span id="s1016">That was a wake up call that maybe everything will not be -- first of all, in the first five transports, which went to Lódz, [indecipherable] the friends went already.</span> <span id="s1017">And then in ’41 in November, when -- they opened Terezín, a lot of friends went.</span> <span id="s1018">And my boyfriend went, and that’s a funny story about too, cause that’s wa -- how I got to Terezín by myself.</span> <span id="s1019">And that started, and my father had me to be always ready on time.</span> <span id="s1020">Start -- my mother started to preparing for deportation.</span> <span id="s1021">We had our 50 [indecipherable] everyone had what -- what we didn’t wear, what do you take with us.</span> <span id="s1022">My mother wanted everything to be like so, in condition like new, so we wore the other things.</span> <span id="s1023">My mother would e-eggs were a very hard com -- well, you know, commodity.</span> <span id="s1024">Jews were not allowed to -- we didn’t have it in rations, but my mother got some on black market from that lady that was her savior, and she would dry egg whites, use only the yolks, here and there, and if you mix the dried egg whites with water, you had eggs, you know, egg white.</span> <span id="s1025">So sh -- and that didn’t weigh much, so we got all a bag prepared of egg whites to take with us, and she would bake gim --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: How do you da -- how do you dry eggs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: On a plate, and -- and she let it dry until it got hard like crystal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And she would bake special gingerbread that was very hard, but could all -- never got moldy.</span> <span id="s1030">She made for us what we called a studenmix, almonds, nuts, raisins that she still had, and if she had a -- something to put in [indecipherable] and that -- that [indecipherable] and that she made a bi -- see, this is all the food that [indecipherable] took with us, or we wouldn’t touch it any more since ’41, that was prepared for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So you were always ready to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: My father -- I don’t think other people did it, but my father had to be ready.</span> <span id="s1033">And my father made another thing, he handy with wood, he made mirrors for each of us, and put money in it.</span> <span id="s1034">And these mirrors we took with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So that there was a wooden backing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Wooden back and a -- and a mirror, and in between was a hollow, and there he put the money.</span> <span id="s1037">They took it each to th -- Auschwitz, and I had mine to the end, and my brother took it to Auschwitz, and I had mine till the end, but when I took it out, marks were nothing, just a piece of paper, because they were German marks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: And it was worthless.</span> <span id="s1039">When -- when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, did that make you nervous, or you still thought someone’s gonna come in and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: We -- we still thought that the British --</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: I mean Poland, not the Soviet Union</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: -- then German, that was the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: We knew one thing, that Hitler will not give up Czechoslovakia unless there is a war, we wanted that war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Yeah, I see.</span> <span id="s1046">So you needed something, because it was the only way to get a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: And the same thing happened to me when -- the Communists, who I never believed that Communists will fall without a war.</span> <span id="s1048">I said, there has to be a third World War to get the Russian Soviets down.</span> <span id="s1049">Because that’s what we believed, the Germans will not give up on their own.</span> <span id="s1050">They will never move back.</span> <span id="s1051">But of course, we saw Britain will coming, and we -- the biggest depression I think what happened was when France fell.</span> <span id="s1052">Poland, let them take care -- Russia will take care of it.</span> <span id="s1053">But when France fell, that was very depressing, cause we thought they will move forward.</span> <span id="s1054">And then they did the same thing in World War I, and the Czechs were saying French are good lovers, but lousy soldiers.</span> <span id="s1055">They give up, you know?</span> <span id="s1056">But then the Czechs gave up too, finally.</span> <span id="s1057">And the biggest excitement was when there was invasion, when we thought that’s the end of the war right then and there, that the Americans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: -- will -- will walk through Germany.</span> <span id="s1060">Didn’t think Germans are that strong, still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: -- to put up the fight me -- but I think we just closed our eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1064">So you really didn’t have a sense of what the conditions of all these countries were.</span> <span id="s1065">What the economic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Not the condition, not the condition.</span> <span id="s1067">We thought they are strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: -- and they will take care of Germany.</span> <span id="s1070">And we thought Germany -- Germans are weak.</span> <span id="s1071">We thought they don’t have reserves.</span> <span id="s1072">They had -- didn’t have oil, they didn’t have rubber for the wheels.</span> <span id="s1073">I didn’t -- they didn’t have anything, but they made what they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: They could recycle, which, you know, kept them -- and the worst thing was that from the Jewish money, and gold, and art, they supported the war.</span> <span id="s1076">The -- the -- the Jews paid for the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: From what they confiscated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: What they took from the Jews, they paid for the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: They had the money, the Jews in Switzerland, they supported them.</span> <span id="s1081">But you didn’t know that time, but the Jews supported the war.</span> <span id="s1082">And we thought they were run out of material, they wouldn’t have enough to fight with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: My father had some connections in -- in -- in Terezín that he got news.</span> <span id="s1085">What the movement of the front is, he knew.</span> <span id="s1086">But by that time he wasn’t that optimistic, because the interest -- the Altestenrat, I think he knew also what’s happening, because he -- the things he told me when we left, and I couldn’t go with -- they did not want me to -- to volunteer, and I did, and it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s1087">But what he said is, “We had our life behind, we are old.</span> <span id="s1088">You have to survive.</span> <span id="s1089">You have to do everything to survive.</span> <span id="s1090">Don’t worry about us.”</span> <span id="s1091">He [indecipherable] so he went to Russia.</span> <span id="s1092">He didn’t go to Russia, which I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1094">So he knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: He knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: He knew something.</span> <span id="s1097">So between ’39, when -- Germany attacks Poland.</span> <span id="s1098">And then there’s a pact between Germany and the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1099">And then they violate the pact, and they attack the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: That was no surprise to us, because we didn’t trust the Russians anyhow.</span> <span id="s1101">They -- you know, we ju -- when they made the pact with the Nazi -- the right and the left, they were make a pact, that’s just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1102">I don’t think anybody believed that Stalin tells the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And were you hearing things about what was going on in Poland, before the beginning of Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yeah, we were, but you know, people always think things are exaggerated.</span> <span id="s1105">And it happened there, it is not happening here.</span> <span id="s1106">Do you know how today people think, happens to the others, it won’t happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: I think that’s what we thought.</span> <span id="s1109">I think that was what we were hiding behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Now, did you know a lot of people who tried to leave, or actually left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yes, yes, we knew people who tried to leave, we knew people who left.</span> <span id="s1112">My aunt was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s1113">They had a f -- fo America, and they were supposed to go to Cuba because they had to wait, and she just wouldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s1114">They already had their tickets, and everything, and she wouldn’t leave withou -- without us, you know, and my mother, and they stayed, and it was -- well, they died.</span> <span id="s1115">And we were supposed to leave for Chile, and then I don’t know why my parents decided not to.</span> <span id="s1116">And my father didn’t want to go to Palestine, that was open to us.</span> <span id="s1117">I don’t know what was happening around then, because not much was shared.</span> <span id="s1118">We -- more was shared with my brother, my brother knew more than I did, because he was little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: I was going to say, was it because he was a boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: And he was also longer with my parents, he went to Terezín with my friends, I went by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1122">We have to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Hana, I want to go back a little before Terezín, just to get a couple of pieces of information.</span> <span id="s1128">Did you have pets growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: What did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: We used to have dogs, never cats.</span> <span id="s1132">Birds, parakeets, turtles, y-you name it, we brought animals in.</span> <span id="s1133">Both my parents were big animal lovers.</span> <span id="s1134">When we moved from the original apartment where I was born, I don’t think there were allowed dogs there, because we had to give up our dog.</span> <span id="s1135">Was a big German Shepherd, and he went to a farm in Votice, to friends.</span> <span id="s1136">So we didn’t have a dog, but we always had canaries.</span> <span id="s1137">We had different birds.</span> <span id="s1138">My father loved birds, and they loved him, because he always brought them goodies, and they would sing for him and not for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: And w-we tried to get babies by pairing them, and had eggs, but that never happened.</span> <span id="s1141">And we had to give it up when Jews were not allowed to have pets.</span> <span id="s1142">But by that time you didn’t have -- thank God we didn’t have a dog we had to give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: So you gave up the bir -- and you gave -- did you give them away to people who took care of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yes, my parents found somebody who -- because canaries were pretty expensive those days for you know, not -- your dogs you got, any dog you could get free, but -- so I think people gladly accepted it.</span> <span id="s1145">People had pets like that, it was a pet that they didn’t have to walk or do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So it wasn’t unusual for people to have birds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1148">As a matter of fact my aunt, who came from Vienna came out from the train, I still see her, with two cages in each a parakeet, these little green and blue, you know, yellow and blue parakeets.</span> <span id="s1149">She had them until she had to give them up, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: And do you think many of these animals ended up being killed, that they couldn’t find anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: I don’t know, I think the Jews tried to find somebody who would take care, who would love animals.</span> <span id="s1152">I think you could find somebody.</span> <span id="s1153">I don’t know how they did it with cats and dogs, because we didn’t have it, but I don’t think we had any problem of giving it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: But it made you lose a friend, it’s there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Everything was a loss, whether it was the piano that I didn’t care so much before, or whether it was your jewelry that you got as a kid, and you know, the birthday present from your father.</span> <span id="s1158">You didn’t like to part with your things, so you didn’t like to part with the animals either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1160">And tell me, your -- you talked about going out with friends, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: But -- but did you have a social life, were you dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s1164">Within the parties usually you found a partner, and then you switched.</span> <span id="s1165">I mean that going together wasn’t very serious.</span> <span id="s1166">It could become serious.</span> <span id="s1167">And then in 1939 -- ’40 -- I think in the winter of ’40, I don’t know, I met a boy.</span> <span id="s1168">That time we were still going to Hagiboar, which was like a playground where you could run around, and do a little sports.</span> <span id="s1169">That was Jewish, so that was allowed to go to.</span> <span id="s1170">And I met him there through another friend of my friend.</span> <span id="s1171">Since 1939, a girl lived with us.</span> <span id="s1172">My very clo -- became a close friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1173">Her parents lived outside, and they wanted her to learn the profession, so she was learning to sew in some other place than I did.</span> <span id="s1174">And she lived with us and we shared a room, and ti -- tha -- used to go weekends to her parents [indecipherable] just fun.</span> <span id="s1175">But then even that was forbidden because Jews couldn’t travel by train at all.</span> <span id="s1176">So then she couldn’t visit her parents and met them only again in Theresienstadt, which they came from the village, she came from Prague.</span> <span id="s1177">And her brother also stayed in Prague, and lived with my aunt, who was around the corner, wasn’t very far.</span> <span id="s1178">So within, you know the group you were, and you had one or two groups, because you met Saturday and Sunday with others.</span> <span id="s1179">You paired up with a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1180">We were -- when Hitler came I was 14, so by that time we started to be interested in boys, and we did, and I had a boy that we got engaged when we were 16 and a half, 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: My parents and his parents didn’t say anything, and that was -- he put me later on on his list as a family member, and that’s how I ended up in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Well, that’s why I asked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I had to go before my parents, and even though my father was devastated, so was my mother, and I was.</span> <span id="s1185">I wasn’t ready.</span> <span id="s1186">You know, I wasn’t -- today 18 year old girls go to school, and they are ready to be on their own.</span> <span id="s1187">We were not growing up that way.</span> <span id="s1188">We were never alone or going out at night because we never had those opportunities.</span> <span id="s1189">And so we were, I don’t think, not that grown up yet.</span> <span id="s1190">So for me going for the first time out of my house, not knowing -- I remember the last night, thinking will I ever sleep in my bed again.</span> <span id="s1191">And my friend was staying with my parents, it was me who had to go.</span> <span id="s1192">And that was really for everybody devastating.</span> <span id="s1193">And my father tried to arrange and go and tell them that they want to -- they did not want to volunteer because of my brother.</span> <span id="s1194">They felt if they -- as long as they can stay out, maybe the war will end, and we will f -- continue to live our normal life.</span> <span id="s1195">So they didn’t volunteer, and I didn’t want them to.</span> <span id="s1196">So they tried if I could wait for them, and they wouldn’t do it, so I had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: So who -- whats -- was this boy’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: In Czech it’s Honza, it’s John, and his last name was Kosepak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: So you have this funny engagement, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Not funny, we really thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: -- you were serious [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: -- we were li -- we were serious, we -- we thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: -- but the parents obviously --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: -- the parents I don’t know, they didn’t -- were not against it, we knew -- both families knew each other, and f -- was nice Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1205">They were not against it, and they knew the war is here, and people get engaged earlier, or even marry.</span> <span id="s1206">We didn’t -- I didn’t intend to get married or anything.</span> <span id="s1207">And so we just got engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Did he give you a ring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: He did, and I still have the rest of it.</span> <span id="s1210">It was only silver with a blue aquamarine stone.</span> <span id="s1211">The stone is lost, the ring is broken, but I keep the rest of it as a remembrance because that one I smuggled, that one I gi -- didn’t give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: So that was when you were 16 and a half, now you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: 17 something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: -- 17.</span> <span id="s1215">Now you’re 19, so you -- were you actually going together for a couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yes, we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: -- not 19, I w -- he went with the second transport, he was just in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: In ’40 -- in 1940?</span> <span id="s1220">Or ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: 1941, with the second men transport, Edgar went with the first one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: -- he was with the Akar, too, which was November ’41.</span> <span id="s1224">He just became 18, and I was 18 September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: And we met again when I arrived in July ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Now you just mentioned something that I think is important.</span> <span id="s1228">Akar one and Akar two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Aufbaukommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: And can you explain what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: The first ones, because they were supposed to build Terezín, were called Aufbaukommando one.</span> <span id="s1232">That was the 340 something that Edgar went with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: After that went another thousand men, only men, and it was called Akar two, Aufbaukommando number two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: And do these become privileged --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: They were -- were privileged one degree below the Akar one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1238">And then everyone who comes after, it’s not Akar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No, it’s already, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: It -- it’s gone, y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: -- first started with, I think Edgar’s transport -- parents were M. I was already in triple digit transport, AAR647 was my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: My parents were already in CC alphabet.</span> <span id="s1244">The whole AAA, and the BBBB alphabet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: And they came at CC [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: But it’s only the Akar one and Akar two that become [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Two that they’re aristocrastic.</span> <span id="s1249">We call them aristocrastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Aris -- aristocrastic.</span> <span id="s1251">Now when y -- when John -- John?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Well, Honza we called him</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Honza --</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Hanush in Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: -- went, was that shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: To both of us.</span> <span id="s1257">We didn’t -- we had fun together, we enjoyed each other company --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: -- we didn’t want to separate.</span> <span id="s1260">But he said to separate from his parents, too, his parents didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So he didn’t volunteer for that transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Did he tell you he was going to try and get you to -- to come --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: -- trying to get you on the list?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: -- but I think they enticed them, they said if you put them -- these two transports were supposed to be kept in Terezín, they were like privileged, they didn’t think -- and, you know, like Edgar they send him with the last transports, it wasn’t in any other.</span> <span id="s1267">And they said if you put your family members on your list, they will be also privileged.</span> <span id="s1268">So I think that’s why he did that.</span> <span id="s1269">He didn’t mean to get me into -- but that’s how Edgar’s parents too, because they were on his list as parents, came in early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: So that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: So what happens, you get a notice through the mail, or it’s delivered to you?</span> <span id="s1273">What -- how -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: I don’t know how that was delivered, but I got a notice on that and that day, to be at the palace with 50 kilos, which is 110 pounds, what is allowed to take, and that’s it, you go.</span> <span id="s1275">My brother went in the streetcar with me, you had to carry the 50 pounds yours -- kilo -- yourself, up to where you had to register.</span> <span id="s1276">What you had was a backpack, a roll where you had your pillow, your linen, and you put in some food or anything.</span> <span id="s1277">We call it bedrollup -- bedroll, and the trunk.</span> <span id="s1278">So somehow I got from my boyfriend -- fiancé, whatever you want to call it, a notice through his parents that I should make a white rectangle around my name because he will save my luggage, because the luggage was confiscated usually, and you ended up only with the backpack and the roll.</span> <span id="s1279">Not the first transport, only when -- in ’42, so Edgar doesn’t even know about it.</span> <span id="s1280">So, you know, we had to put Sarah in our name, every woman was Sarah, and every man was Israel, to degrade us more.</span> <span id="s1281">We didn’t -- we used to say we are privileged, because Churchill’s daughter is named s -- Sarah.</span> <span id="s1282">So we very proudly carried that.</span> <span id="s1283">I was Hana Sarah Fuchsova.</span> <span id="s1284">So -- or German Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1285">So we did it, and he did save my luggage, and he saved the same way my parent’s luggage.</span> <span id="s1286">He worked at that time at the transports, and he kept his job to help people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: So a -- in this early stages, they -- you were able to get some messages from Terezín once --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I don’t know how he did it, but he did do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: He did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Well, you know, there were nine boys hanged for letter writing in Terezín in January ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: No, I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Oh yes, that’s very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: And -- because they wrote letters and they were -- and they were caught, so they were executed.</span> <span id="s1295">Edgar can tell you about it, he was there when that happened, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: This is before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: And we knew about it in Prague because that was made sure every Jew knows it.</span> <span id="s1298">The Germans made sure, so that they don’t write letters.</span> <span id="s1299">But through some of the gendarmes evidently, he succeeded, give them something, and he smuggled a letter to his parents, and his parents told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: When you’re going to be dropped off by your brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: My brother wouldn’t go out of that streetcar, he promised my father he wouldn’t because he was afraid they can pick him off the street, and bri -- if there is a [indecipherable] company.</span> <span id="s1302">So he was in the streetcar with me at the back, cause we had -- as we were passing, I saw my father standing on the corner, he wanted a last glimpse of me.</span> <span id="s1303">Crying.</span> <span id="s1304">And then he just had to go another station, my brother, and then he returned home.</span> <span id="s1305">And I had to walk up the street to the entrance by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: And your mother stayed inside, by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: My mother stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Were you crying on the train, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Well we were, I think three days or four days it took, till they processed the thousand people.</span> <span id="s1312">Register.</span> <span id="s1313">And I don’t think they even weigh our luggage, you could have had more, but nobody dared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Were you in a cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: No.</span> <span id="s1318">Until we went -- this is with a streetcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: The streetcar, right, is the normal streetcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1321">I-In T-Terezín we were in a cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: But that didn’t take three days, that was in one day, although it took very long, for it’s only 60 miles.</span> <span id="s1324">We arrived somewhere afternoon, three o’clock in Terezín from they started to load at five in the morning, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: So you were waiting in Prague to leave for three days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: In Prague for processing took at least three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Because I arrived on the 16th of July in -- in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And you had left your house on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Around the 13th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: -- I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: When you’re waiting in Prague, and you’re going with your brother on it -- on the street, what’s your biggest fear?</span> <span id="s1334">Do y -- do you know, or is it very confused?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1336">I’m afraid to do this alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: I was scared, I had never been alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Either with my brother, or with my parents, and I have never been alone like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: To have to take care of myself, and that’s when I promised my mother I will --</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: You’ll eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Eat everything, and they gave us this big portion of the watery -- brown water, which was supposed to be coffee.</span> <span id="s1345">So I promised Mother I’ll finish everything I’ll get.</span> <span id="s1346">So I finished and drank it.</span> <span id="s1347">My friend thought I like it, she gave me again.</span> <span id="s1348">And I hated it, but I said I will drink it because I promised my mother to eat everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Now, w-when you’re waiting these there days, and there are a thousand people, are there people that you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I didn’t know anybody, but you start talking to your neighbor -- and I had the same name because you are alphabetically put on the mattresses.</span> <span id="s1351">And you try -- you walk around trying to find somebody whether you know, and it’s a long day.</span> <span id="s1352">You wait, you get to -- you have to go to the table, you have to register.</span> <span id="s1353">You have to give up your trunk.</span> <span id="s1354">The bedroll and the rucksack you carry yourself.</span> <span id="s1355">This is in July.</span> <span id="s1356">I had a winter coat on, I had a suit underneath.</span> <span id="s1357">I had double -- double underwear.</span> <span id="s1358">I had heavy shoes because you wouldn’t take sandals.</span> <span id="s1359">And I had to lug the luggage, and we walked from Bohusovice to Terezín, and some people fainted, and some people couldn’t make it, it was very hot.</span> <span id="s1360">I did.</span> <span id="s1361">And when we came into the -- they brought us to Hanover barracks.</span> <span id="s1362">That was the Schleusse they called it, the accepting barracks.</span> <span id="s1363">Didn’t take long and my boyfriend was there, telling me, I have your trunk.</span> <span id="s1364">And I told him right away to tell my friend that I am here, which he did.</span> <span id="s1365">And he brought her over, he smuggled her in, because nobody was allowed to come near us.</span> <span id="s1366">And they had to process us again.</span> <span id="s1367">And her mother arranged that they move me to Hamburger where they were staying.</span> <span id="s1368">She took over like my mother, her mother, and she later on saved my life again.</span> <span id="s1369">So when we came to register, I already had a address where to go, I went straight to Hamburg, and then my friend said she’s working at the mica production, where we peeled the mica.</span> <span id="s1370">So she went immediately and signed me up for that.</span> <span id="s1371">So the next day I went to work with her.</span> <span id="s1372">So I had somebody there.</span> <span id="s1373">And then you start -- and then I tried to locate my grandma, who was there.</span> <span id="s1374">My grandmother, si -- about three weeks before me -- 15 -- or four weeks, 15th of June she left Prague, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1375">So then my boyfriend located her, and that’s when I say Edgar is wrong, it wasn’t yet opened the ghetto, he had to get me a false document, of another girl to -- so I can go to visit her into that house.</span> <span id="s1376">And I did, and I saw my grandma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: So it wasn’t allowed, you couldn’t just walk around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Not yet, it was op -- and she died on 22nd of August of that same year, and by that time it was opened.</span> <span id="s1379">But when I arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: -- I couldn’t move freely, any -- and the first thing she told me, she was so happy -- she was blind, but she knew who I am, she was so happy to see -- see me.</span> <span id="s1382">According to our -- what we counted, she was 86.</span> <span id="s1383">According to what they have in the files, she was born ’54, not ’56 as we thought.</span> <span id="s1384">So she might have been 88.</span> <span id="s1385">As I say, she lasted about six weeks there.</span> <span id="s1386">Got sick, she died of dysentery.</span> <span id="s1387">And the first thing she said, “Tell your father not to come.”</span> <span id="s1388">She thought my father was a powerful man, can do anything, and he can say I am not going, and he will not go.</span> <span id="s1389">“It’s a terrible place here.</span> <span id="s1390">Why did you come?</span> <span id="s1391">He should have taken care of you, you should not come here.”</span> <span id="s1392">I don’t think she understood, you know, the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: But she understood something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Oh, she understood that it’s a bad place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Bad place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: -- but she didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: What.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: -- that you have no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1400">How did this w-w-woman, the -- the mother of your friend, and what -- what was her name, and -- and the -- the name of your friend, and the mother’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Okay, my friend was named Eva, their name was Dittel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Dittel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: And I called her Mama Dittel afterwards.</span> <span id="s1404">And she died in Munich at age 101 and a half.</span> <span id="s1405">So I saw her last time when we went there to celebrate her hundredth birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: And what she did for me, in September of ’42, I was put in for deportation to Poland -- to east, nobody knew where.</span> <span id="s1408">And she decided that’s ridiculous, her parents are still in Prague.</span> <span id="s1409">She went to [indecipherable] and put down the -- my application.</span> <span id="s1410">She was OD, Ordnungsdienst, so she could do it.</span> <span id="s1411">And said, “This girl is not 21 yet, her parents are in Prague, how can you send her alone?”</span> <span id="s1412">And put stamp, do not send.</span> <span id="s1413">So I got out of the transport, and I didn’t realize somebody else must have gotten in because of me.</span> <span id="s1414">That time we didn’t think that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Yeah, right, right.</span> <span id="s1416">Now it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: That came only when the people started to ask are you guilty of -- yes, somebody else must have gone, because thousand people had to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So they had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: -- and that’s one transport where they have destination unknown.</span> <span id="s1420">Nobody knows what happened to the thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: That’s the September transport to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: So the -- uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1424">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: I found it only, you know, after we got the -- the memorial book from Prague, from the Terezín inshairtif.</span> <span id="s1426">They collected a book of all the names and birthdays and where they went and where people died.</span> <span id="s1427">And all the transport that went ever to -- to Lódz, or to Terezín, and where they went further, and their -- this -- under that transport, destination unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1429">And they have the names of all the people who are on them?</span> <span id="s1430">Oh, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Well, that is hard to find who -- they have the name of the transport, you would have to go through all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Uh-huh, to find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: To find that there -- when you have your name there, it says where you were liberated, and where you died if they know it.</span> <span id="s1434">If they don’t know it, it’s the transport where that went where you died.</span> <span id="s1435">Because many people went straight to Treblinka, so they don’t have the date or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1437">And what was Mama Dittel’s ti -- she was -- let’s explain what that is, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: She was a real, very aggressive, in that case woman, she got the job, and she would -- OD means Ordnungsdienst, which meant she was responsible anywhere there was a line, to keep order, and so if she kept order on -- in the line for people to go into the offices or something when they requested -- everywhere you waited in line.</span> <span id="s1439">Whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s1440">In -- you wanted a job or something, there was 50 people lined up for that, too.</span> <span id="s1441">So they needed these people who kept people not fighting, and to keep them in line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1443">So she had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: So she had such a kind of job, she was standing near the kettle so people don’t fight for the food when they were giving out food that was her job.</span> <span id="s1445">And Eva and I worked together.</span> <span id="s1446">We are s -- friends, we were friends from Prague already, she was one of the group.</span> <span id="s1447">So we used to go to her house, to our house, you know, and to others, she was a member of one of the groups that I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: And she was there since January ’42, they went early.</span> <span id="s1450">And her father was there too at that ti -- and I knew the whole family, my mother knew the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: So the mother had a certain -- certain kind of position, which was why she could get you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: No, she was on the -- yeah, but she was also very aggressive, she could get it, you know, somebody else wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Somebody else wouldn’t march into the office of the [indecipherable], she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And she was accepted, people accepted her.</span> <span id="s1457">She had a way with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: And in -- in the same way she got you into the other barrack.</span> <span id="s1459">Instead of being in Hamburger you were in Hanover --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Probably, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: -- no, a -- the reverse, the reverse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: No, that -- that was ten -- temporary anyhow.</span> <span id="s1463">They would assign you where to go, they would make a list wherever they had place, but if you had somebody, and wanted to be together with the family, and there was room, they would do it.</span> <span id="s1464">I got my mother then, to be with me in the room, too.</span> <span id="s1465">We just put it on her list, you know, as a request.</span> <span id="s1466">That -- the -- where to put people wasn’t difficult to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: -- because they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1469">If there wasn’t room, I had to sleep on the floor between the -- on the corridor until there was room.</span> <span id="s1470">There was constant movement.</span> <span id="s1471">People moved around, they found a friend, they wanted to be put together, that was not so hard to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: And transports went, so there were empty spaces --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Spaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: -- you when -- that was like a seniority.</span> <span id="s1476">You started on the floor, and ended up where you wanted after awhile, when it got -- became available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: So y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: So in the end, Eva and I had a bunk together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Together.</span> <span id="s1480">And you were in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Hamburger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Hamburger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Hamburger.</span> <span id="s1484">Hanover where -- where we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: And then -- then Hamburger became what they called Schleusse, for incoming and outgoing transport, but at mi -- sometimes it was a different barrack, whichever they emptied for it.</span> <span id="s1487">When I came in ’42, it was Hamburger, when my parents came, there were in a different -- Hanover -- when my parents came it was in a different [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Different place.</span> <span id="s1489">And Schleusse means what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Schleusse is where the water goes through.</span> <span id="s1491">People coming and going, and that’s probably how the -- they took it and was a expression I learned only in Terezín.</span> <span id="s1492">In Czech it’s Schoishka, so they took over the word, gave only a Czech ending.</span> <span id="s1493">I-It means passing through, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: But this was also where they would confiscate the luggage, am I right?</span> <span id="s1495">They would take it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: The luggage never arrived there.</span> <span id="s1497">The luggage was put on some carts that the people that worked in the transports schlepped, like my boyfriend, and they schlepped it directly to the magazines or to the storage where they store them.</span> <span id="s1498">This clothing original was only for Germans, that the Jews didn’t get it, only until they opened the stores, did they share the clothing for those -- from those storerooms with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1499">Because th-the Germans were bombed out, they lost everything.</span> <span id="s1500">They needed clothing, so they took it from the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1502">And was your boyfriend -- was Honza taking a chance bringing you your luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: He was, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Yes, but he did it for his parents, and for my parents too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: So did you then take the luggage a -- I mean, put the clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: He brought it after wa -- he kept it until I had a permanent place in the Hamburger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1509">And where did you keep the luggage?</span> <span id="s1510">Under the bed, or what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: No, I didn’t have a space under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: I lived on the upper --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Oh, you were on the upper?</span> <span id="s1515">So then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: -- upper bunk.</span> <span id="s1517">There was a shelf and I put the trunk that was all where you had your clothes, you couldn’t hang it, you couldn’t -- you didn’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: So you kept it in the trunk, and the bedding you spread on your bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: And where -- where would be this shelf?</span> <span id="s1521">Near the -- near the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: O-Our bunk was -- we had the top, the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: And the shelf was going towards -- there was a window, and the shelf was going to the window.</span> <span id="s1525">So on that shelf I had the trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: So someone had to lift up this fif --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1528">The middle one had also a shelf, the bottom one had it underneath.</span> <span id="s1529">But the trunks became my bed later on.</span> <span id="s1530">The tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: And I -- the trunk became your bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1533">Three trunks made a bed on the -- on a trip with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Did you -- excuse me, did you have a lock on this trunk?</span> <span id="s1535">Were you concerned about people stealing?</span> <span id="s1536">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: No.</span> <span id="s1538">I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1540">I think we should stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Hana, I want to ask you some details about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Arrangement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Arrangements, yes.</span> <span id="s1546">So you’re on the top bunk, although it takes you a little while to get to the top bunk.</span> <span id="s1547">Is that when -- when you’re in the top bunk, is that when Eva is up there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: She was there already, and her partner, whatever -- whoever lived there, then moved out of -- I don’t know where, was pretty fast, there was always a mor, or found a better, or found somewhere else to live.</span> <span id="s1549">When it emptied, and I was on the floor, a -- but nobody else wanted it, I could get it.</span> <span id="s1550">It went according to seniority.</span> <span id="s1551">Each room we were about 40 women in the room, and there was one woman who was called Zimmeralteste, which means the oldest of the room.</span> <span id="s1552">And she was the one who made the decisions.</span> <span id="s1553">So -- but she was pretty good, she -- you know, honored some request, it didn’t change anything for her.</span> <span id="s1554">So it didn’t matter if I was in the corridor, meanwhile, when my mother came she was in the corridor.</span> <span id="s1555">She couldn’t climb up because she suffered from sciatica nerve, otherwise I would have switched with her, but it couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1556">And then she got right away a bed because of that, so you know, she made those decisions, she also made sure everything is clean, that the room looks clean, because there were checks sometimes.</span> <span id="s1557">And -- and I don’t know by whom, but we were always expecting some inspections.</span> <span id="s1558">And then she also was the one that distributed the rations.</span> <span id="s1559">You got a ration of bread.</span> <span id="s1560">Sometimes you got little bit of milk, which was like bluish water.</span> <span id="s1561">And sometimes you got little bit of sugar, and margarine, those were the rations.</span> <span id="s1562">So she got the whole thing, and she had to divide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more, you got two.</span> <span id="s1563">Bread was always the same, you got a piece of bread, that was for three days.</span> <span id="s1564">Being me, the first time I got the bread I ate it.</span> <span id="s1565">In two days I didn’t, so I learned very fast that I marked how much bread I can eat every day.</span> <span id="s1566">And that was only once that it happened that I ate it all.</span> <span id="s1567">And I took little bit supply from what I had from mar.</span> <span id="s1568">So, she was the responsible person.</span> <span id="s1569">She also decided if we had little bit of wood, when to heat up the room or not, because there was only little stove, in that -- in -- for winter.</span> <span id="s1570">So it was pretty cold, but you had the blankets.</span> <span id="s1571">You did have blankets.</span> <span id="s1572">So we slept with Eva huddled together under two blankets, we didn’t need each a blanket.</span> <span id="s1573">In summer it was much worse.</span> <span id="s1574">The bedbugs were terrible, and we would take our mattresses and put it on the corridor outside, in front of the room, along the -- you know how these windows are in Hamburger --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: These round [indecipherable] windows, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: -- barrack?</span> <span id="s1577">Under the windows, and we slept outside, because it was too buggy, and too muggy inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: So it was buggier inside than outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: And what sort of a mattress was this, was this straw?</span> <span id="s1581">Or was this a real --</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Yes, straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: It was straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Straw.</span> <span id="s1585">I think that’s what all the Czechs used.</span> <span id="s1586">I think that’s what was mostly they used, horsehair mattresses in good times, but I think for us they -- it didn’t matter, we slept.</span> <span id="s1587">We were so tired, we slept.</span> <span id="s1588">The first -- I wasn’t so tired from the mica peeling, or something, that was sitting down.</span> <span id="s1589">We had fun because we were -- that’s where we made most of the friendships, we were eight girls together.</span> <span id="s1590">Course the young clung together and we were also a very noisy table, because we were telling our th-things, and we were laughing and things, and the old people didn’t li -- the old people, they were in their 40’s and 50’s, didn’t like it, so they were always hushing us that nobody can hear when we are there.</span> <span id="s1591">And all of us knew that this is a terrible job, dusty, sitting and peeling them, and we had to make a -- sort them, and make a certain amount a day.</span> <span id="s1592">It wasn’t just playing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Wh-Wh -- what -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: It’s a -- it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: -- the mica you have to peel thin, they said it’s for the airplane, and there was bigger pieces, smaller pieces, and you had to sort them according to sizes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: And then you peel the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Peel it into thin, like if you would peel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: An onion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: -- anything in layers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1602">So it -- there would be a number of layers on the mica --</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: -- and you would peel it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: You would peel it to the thinnest one and then the supervisor checked that there is not something wrong, no -- the sizes are all right, and -- because he was responsible to the German.</span> <span id="s1606">So we all tried to get into a better job, and one of my friends with whom I’m friend to -- today, she lives in Los Vegas, she decided -- she had a boyfriend too, that time.</span> <span id="s1607">And who told her to get into agriculture.</span> <span id="s1608">So she was the first one to leave the table, the -- you know, the eight of us.</span> <span id="s1609">Then two others went to agriculture, so I decided I’m going too.</span> <span id="s1610">And I went and apply for the job and they -- I said I come from a farm, my grandpa was a farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: So they asked me how potatoes grow, I had no idea, because I have never seen potatoes grow.</span> <span id="s1613">So I don’t know where I got it, I said, “Like onions, with the -- with the roots in the ground.”</span> <span id="s1614">And they said, she knows, and I was in my -- in agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Now where would you -- fir-first of all let me ask you, why was it -- I-I -- one would think that working inside would be better than working outside, but that was not the case there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: What did I have, I had nothing from working inside.</span> <span id="s1617">I peeled mi -- for mica that I couldn’t do anything with.</span> <span id="s1618">I breathe in the particles, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: There’s a lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I wanted to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: They told you get out into the fields, and you can eat the vegetable, so I got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: So then where -- where do you go to apply for a job in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: There was a place where you -- the groups always gather, that was called Drusstvo, it was like a collection place where they had offices.</span> <span id="s1625">These were lot of people, and lot of fields that had to be.</span> <span id="s1626">They had cows -- they had horses, not cows, and they had pigs, and there had to be organization, and there was a head of that, and then over him was the German head, who was in the party but was not -- who was not a SS, was a civilian.</span> <span id="s1627">He must have been member of the Nazi party, was a civilian.</span> <span id="s1628">So there was a organization, so they had to meet in the offices and the -- the storerooms where we stored some of it, because we grew all kinds of vegetable.</span> <span id="s1629">So my friend started it, she knew where to go, she taught me, I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: And I got in.</span> <span id="s1632">Which was in winter, which wasn’t the best thing because we were in the freezing cold all day.</span> <span id="s1633">But you were outside, and you got out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1634">My father, my mother never set foot out that since the day they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: And -- behind the wall.</span> <span id="s1637">I was out every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: So did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: [indecipherable] group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: -- so you -- did you have a different sense of yourself, and was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: A different sense of jealousy.</span> <span id="s1642">I saw people, I said people still live normally, how is that possible?</span> <span id="s1643">They walk on the road, they went with the horses, we had to go to the side because we were marching in columns, with the gendarmes, two gendarmes with their rifles, so we don’t run away, or don’t pick up a fallen apple, drop the apple from the trees.</span> <span id="s1644">And people were -- passed the SS -- we went along the river, and we passed the SS -- like for swimming place, and they were there sitting and enjoying themselves with children.</span> <span id="s1645">And I couldn’t understand why we can’t have a normal life.</span> <span id="s1646">It was very -- we were jealous, why do we have to be like this?</span> <span id="s1647">Why couldn’t we be like them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: So it was a conflicting -- a situation of conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yeah, we -- we -- we talked about it, what we will do when we get free.</span> <span id="s1650">You know, we -- I remember saying I wish I was -- I cou -- I don’t care how old I will be at the -- as soon as I can say it’s 10 years after the war.</span> <span id="s1651">It’s -- you know, we wished for the impossible that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Were you very hungry all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Not when I started to work in the agriculture, no I had the [indecipherable], I brought in the vegetables, I smuggled them in my bra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: But this was very danger -- w-was someone -- a group called Berusky, s-something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Berusky yes, but I was the only person that never was examined by them or touched.</span> <span id="s1656">When I went to work, they were there only at the j -- gate when I working on another place.</span> <span id="s1657">I was the good luck charm for my group.</span> <span id="s1658">I had never been searched by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1661">And I went every day to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Now explain who Beruskys wa -- what the name --</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Those were women, SS German, that waited at the gate, that were allowed to frisk us.</span> <span id="s1664">And of course, if they found something was the same like SS.</span> <span id="s1665">So we were afraid of them.</span> <span id="s1666">Sometimes you had a good gendarme who would warn you, and some people were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Why do you think you were -- it’s an --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: I don’t know, I never lived it.</span> <span id="s1671">I lived through one search.</span> <span id="s1672">There was a big -- this was in summer, June ’44.</span> <span id="s1673">We called it afterwards, fashion show.</span> <span id="s1674">What happened, they caught -- there were people who were transporting ashes out of the town from the kitchens, and from where they were heating in big -- I don’t know, they were ashes.</span> <span id="s1675">And un -- they -- they were stopped by some SS, and they found some lettuce.</span> <span id="s1676">These people were imprisoned, and everybody who was on the field were -- had to stop working, and they hoarded us into one of the barracks, into one of those -- there were -- in the -- in the bastion or whatever that is, there were rooms, and there we had to -- they took four and four wim -- girls in, and they had to strip totally, and the SS -- and we were stage -- standing naked in front of the SS, and th -- he checked whether you don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1677">And then you dressed, and we didn’t know what they will do with us, but they did let us go.</span> <span id="s1678">This took a whole day till everybody was frisked, till three or four, and we went home.</span> <span id="s1679">But while we there -- we were there, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1680">But that was the only time I was frisked like that.</span> <span id="s1681">And because the gendarmes were there, and of course they knew us, they were watching with us, we had to strip to be naked, we called it fashion show.</span> <span id="s1682">And we always said, “Oh, that one was in the -- at the fashion show.”</span> <span id="s1683">Because he was with us, so -- that was one time, but we still -- I don’t think we were afraid that something will happen to us, because we didn’t have anything, whatever we had, we ate.</span> <span id="s1684">A girl had a -- something like a lettuce, so we ate it all.</span> <span id="s1685">It -- it was just swallow a little wad of paper.</span> <span id="s1686">My sister-in-law said they had to swallow something else, like piece of -- they had a crown, or the money on them, which was supposedly harder.</span> <span id="s1687">She just told me now, I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1688">She was in -- my sister-in-law was with another group, she was there, too.</span> <span id="s1689">So I wasn’t sure which one, she says it was June ’44.</span> <span id="s1690">Was hard to remember dates, you didn’t have calendars, so you didn’t know exactly, but you knew when it’s Sunday, and you knew dates, but to remember the dates, you don’t.</span> <span id="s1691">The one date I remember is -- did you ever hear about the census taking in Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: From?</span> <span id="s1693">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: November 11th, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Yes, tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Oh, we were the first barracks, because Hamburger is right on the edge of Terezín.</span> <span id="s1697">So we got the notice that everyone has to be counted, we didn’t know how extensive it is, and what it means, but we had to line up in the courtyard at five in the morning.</span> <span id="s1698">Because it was November, some people took a blanket with them, which was very good, because it was fr-freezing cold to stand there all day.</span> <span id="s1699">We didn’t know what they’ll do.</span> <span id="s1700">And they marched us into this place, which was not like a valley, but it was surrounded by little higher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a division between fields, but it was higher, much higher, so -- there’s a Czech word for it, like a small valley or something.</span> <span id="s1701">And they marched you by hundreds, always.</span> <span id="s1702">And we came there, and we were one of the first ones, so we were right on the edge.</span> <span id="s1703">And they put the SS with machine guns on top of these things, so we got little frightened what will be on -- they going to shoot us here?</span> <span id="s1704">They said to count, somebody supposedly ran away, and there the count was off.</span> <span id="s1705">And I never heard counting one by one.</span> <span id="s1706">So I think it took nearly all morning till everybody got assembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1707">And then people started to walk around.</span> <span id="s1708">My brother lived me and my parents, but I was the only one -- by that time my father got the room in one of the houses, and Mother and Father lived together, because he was also privileged.</span> <span id="s1709">And I still stayed in Hamburger, and my brother found with a friend in the cellar a room, and they made themselves in the cellar a -- a room for them.</span> <span id="s1710">So he lived near my parents, so they were together in the column, but I was again separated.</span> <span id="s1711">So then my f -- brother found me, and I went over to say hi to my parents, that I’m okay, and everybody’s there.</span> <span id="s1712">But then you were afraid, because the Germans were walking by, and you were not allowed to move.</span> <span id="s1713">And when you have to go to the bathroom, luckily you had the blanket, somebody put it around you.</span> <span id="s1714">And they were counted, one by one every column was counted.</span> <span id="s1715">And it was getting dark, in -- in -- in November, it’s not so long daylight.</span> <span id="s1716">And we decided to talk how nice it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home.</span> <span id="s1717">We didn’t know whether we will be there all night.</span> <span id="s1718">It was pretty upsetting.</span> <span id="s1719">So by 11 at night we got home.</span> <span id="s1720">We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming in, some got earlier.</span> <span id="s1721">The next day my father said that’s it, the family has to be together, you have to move in.</span> <span id="s1722">So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing.</span> <span id="s1723">I didn’t like to be separated.</span> <span id="s1724">My brother was again with them, and I was in.</span> <span id="s1725">My brother lived in the house next to them, so the whole block of houses went together, he was not separated.</span> <span id="s1726">So there was not room for another bed, so on the floor we put the trunks, and then we separated them -- the door was blocked.</span> <span id="s1727">And -- and when -- during the day we put them up like a seat.</span> <span id="s1728">So that was the room I had there with my parents, in November ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: So -- well -- now let’s go back.</span> <span id="s1730">So you left the mica working, you’re working the agriculture, you work six days a week or seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Not seven, no.</span> <span id="s1734">There were days when we had to work on Sundays when there was harvest, and maybe it would rain and they wanted to get the hay in, or the -- the harvest wasn’t, for the Germans, going fast enough.</span> <span id="s1735">Those days we would, from early morning till light was out, 10 o’clock or so -- there were days.</span> <span id="s1736">But regularly six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: And what are you do -- doing?</span> <span id="s1738">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Well I have -- every group was different, and everybo-body -- I got into the group with my friends because I wanted to be with them, with this girlfriend that I had.</span> <span id="s1740">And I got in what they call the field group.</span> <span id="s1741">And we were designated to take care of the tomato fields, which was near a village called Travcice, so that those fields were called that.</span> <span id="s1742">And there we went every day.</span> <span id="s1743">We had to plant them, we had to tie them.</span> <span id="s1744">Everything was done by hand.</span> <span id="s1745">We had to clean all the weeds every time.</span> <span id="s1746">We had to harvest them, we had to prepare the fields for next season.</span> <span id="s1747">In between they had some kohlrabi or other vegetable, we had to harvest that.</span> <span id="s1748">And then if something was necessary, we had to plant other -- other vegetable, there were fields.</span> <span id="s1749">Spinach fields, there were beet -- beets.</span> <span id="s1750">You know, anything that you are doing agriculture, there is always work to -- they would put the field, and there was a Staabsgarten, which was -- they were the -- this was for the German population soldiers, or population.</span> <span id="s1751">But there was a garden where they had vegetables only for the SS, for the SS kitchen where they cooked for them, and for the whole SS soldiers [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1752">So my friend, the one that we went to school together, worked there.</span> <span id="s1753">And she went every day there to work.</span> <span id="s1754">You know, everybody had different places.</span> <span id="s1755">My other two friends were -- their mother joined too in agriculture, and they worked on the place where they -- so when I went to help out there, I had onions, I could bring home onions.</span> <span id="s1756">You know, it’s -- we stole anything we could, and we ate anything we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And did you usually eat it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: What we ate, I wouldn’t touch a tomato at home, I ate tomatoes all day.</span> <span id="s1759">That was all I ate all day, I mean, no bread, I wouldn’t use the bread when I had tomatoes.</span> <span id="s1760">[indecipherable] my stomach was full of vegetable, and we -- when we were harvesting kohlrabi we would -- but we had to cover up the peels or anything, because we were not allowed to eat.</span> <span id="s1761">And we had a lookout, because Heindel, who was supervising us, SS, had the motorcycle, we could hear him.</span> <span id="s1762">The lookout will hear him, so we wouldn’t eat, and we would work very hard when he came.</span> <span id="s1763">And if hear -- saw somebody standing up, he gave us two hour more work, the whole group.</span> <span id="s1764">So we had a lookout.</span> <span id="s1765">And the lookouts were on all fields, and we whistled.</span> <span id="s1766">We had a sign to whistle, then he forbid to whistle, so we were barking like a dog.</span> <span id="s1767">I mean, we found always a way to -- to -- I -- I have to put my hand up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: To -- to s -- to signal people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Signal.</span> <span id="s1770">And we had a lookout for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Were you getting f -- whatever normal food would be getting -- i -- people getting in the ghetto during the day that you’re working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Yes, we went home for lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Oh, you went back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: We had to go home for lunch and come out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1776">So you would have whatever breakfast, if they had anything, in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: We had -- breakfast was black coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Black coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: And we had a bread.</span> <span id="s1780">We had a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: So you would get bread for three days that you had to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yeah, a certain, it was this -- about this big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: And where would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Like a big loaf, and a fourth was the -- but then my brother worked in the bakery, so we had more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Where would you keep the bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Except my mother wasn’t a good -- we kept it outside, on a paper.</span> <span id="s1787">My mother wasn’t a -- no [indecipherable] or anything, my mother was a giver.</span> <span id="s1788">There lived a lot of old people in the housing, she would share with them what I brought, [indecipherable] the bread, too.</span> <span id="s1789">My father wasn’t allowed to know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Now, wait a minute, but -- there’s a period of time when you’re working in the fields, and your parents are not there.</span> <span id="s1791">Am I correct?</span> <span id="s1792">That you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: No, my parents were there.</span> <span id="s1794">By the winter of ’43, my parents were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1796">So by the time you have the job --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: -- in the agriculture --</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: -- they’re there.</span> <span id="s1801">But you don’t move in with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: -- for a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: No, I stayed in the Hamburger.</span> <span id="s1805">Mother was with the Hamburger.</span> <span id="s1806">My father and my brother were in Sudeten barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: And after my father got established, and found his way around, and became member of the imagdabolt, and after the housing was totally empty then, I mean available or whatever, I don’t know whether it was empty already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: He got the room for Mother and him.</span> <span id="s1811">So that was little later, that was also around winter of ’43.</span> <span id="s1812">First they were in barracks two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Uh-huh, okay, right.</span> <span id="s1814">Now, when I -- when I asked you about where would you keep the bread, when you were living in the barrack, you weren’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: You kept it up on top on your shelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: On top?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Nobody would steal it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: And what about the bugs?</span> <span id="s1819">Did they eat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: The bugs don’t eat bread, no, they eat your blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: They suck your blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Bed -- bedbugs suck your blood [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: Were there lice?</span> <span id="s1826">Were there lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: Yes, there were lice, but luckily we didn’t have it, that was our biggest concern if somebody got lice, they shaved his head.</span> <span id="s1828">Her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Or her.</span> <span id="s1830">And nobody got lice in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: And how come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: We were very careful.</span> <span id="s1834">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: I don’t know where the lice were more prevalent, but nobody had in our room, in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1837">You tried to keep -- you washed your hair, tried to keep clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: And you washed your hair with what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Cold water and soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: You had some soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: I think we must have gotten - couldn’t be there for three years that I was there, I brought enough soap with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: The soap was swimming.</span> <span id="s1844">You know, that was not the regular soap.</span> <span id="s1845">The war soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: What do you mean it was swimming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: It wouldn’t sink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: It wou -- it was very light?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1851">And did you have toothpaste?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1853">Maybe in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Did you brush your teeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: We did.</span> <span id="s1856">We had to go to the dentist, but he couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s1857">My teeth were -- I got my wisdom teeth there, and afterwards they had to be pulled, but we didn’t have much dental care, but there was a dentist, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: But the dental care was probably pulling teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Probably they had to.</span> <span id="s1860">I don’t know if they had Novocain even that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1862">Were there toilets there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: Yes., and pretty near us was the toilet.</span> <span id="s1864">We were the last room -- we were 191, and the last one was 190, and opposite was the toilet, so we didn’t have it far.</span> <span id="s1865">I don’t remember being any problem with long lines, because we went late at night, maybe and we didn’t go at night, and the early morning because we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1866">So I don’t think we had such a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: There could be a line here and there you know, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: But you don’t remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: There’s always a line in ladies room, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: -- that when you go somewhere, so that’s about it, what we had too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: And when you were in the field, did people just go?</span> <span id="s1874">In the fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Behind the tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Behind a tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: There were no toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: No, I imagine there was no outdoor toilets, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Was this very tiring work for you, or because you were eating more, were you less tired than you might have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: We were tired because we really worked hard, very, very hard, we were out on our feet all day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: -- with the hoe, we had to turn over the ground, we worked like men.</span> <span id="s1884">But you know, you are not really hungry, but because you don’t have it -- first of all, tomatoes, you full your stomach and in half an hour you are hungry again.</span> <span id="s1885">And because you don’t have it, if somebody tells you can’t have more in a day than this, then it’s -- this is very small.</span> <span id="s1886">So you do feel hunger.</span> <span id="s1887">And we talked a lot about food, but we also heard a lot of requiem.</span> <span id="s1888">My friend was singing in requiem, and while we were turning over the manure, she was singing what she learned the night before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Was that good for everybody that she was singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1893">We were singing songs with her.</span> <span id="s1894">She had a beautiful voice, and we knew what’s going on, and we were waiting for the production, and we all went to listen, and it was so uplifting that I could never forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: And when you were talking -- well, we’ll talk about that more, but when -- when you were talking about food, you’re all young women --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: We didn’t talk what we cook, what we like to eat and what we would order, and what we wanted to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: I see, what other people would have cooked for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: I didn’t know anything about cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: What dessert you like best, what ice cream you like best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: We always ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Did this make you hungry, or was this helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: I think it was helpful, we tried to taste it in our minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1908">Now, did a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: We were not really that starved.</span> <span id="s1910">I can’t say, because we did have something, but we didn’t see eggs for years, you know, so you were imagining how good eggs are.</span> <span id="s1911">At one point they decided that they will have silkworms on a f -- there.</span> <span id="s1912">So four of us girls, and I was among them, were responsible for the silkworms, we had to feed them.</span> <span id="s1913">We had to go and look for mulberry trees, and a German was coming with us.</span> <span id="s1914">We had to take all the mulberry leaves, put it in a bag, and then we came where they had the silkworms, and we fed them and cleaned out that.</span> <span id="s1915">They were very nice, they were silky, the worms are very nice.</span> <span id="s1916">And once it was in a farm, and the chicken lost her egg.</span> <span id="s1917">Now we were four girls, and we were trying to get the egg.</span> <span id="s1918">What we would do with one egg for the four of us, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1919">But the -- the German saw it, and he picked it up, wouldn’t let us pick it up, so we lost our egg.</span> <span id="s1920">But th -- those were the things we were longing for that we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1921">We had the soup, and the black coffee and bread, normal meal.</span> <span id="s1922">And sometimes the dumplings with [indecipherable] a treat.</span> <span id="s1923">But you didn’t have variety, you didn’t -- so we -- we dreamt about that, we were hungry for that, but starving like they did in Poland or in -- in those camps, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: You see, I would pull out the carrot and eat it with the earth and everything on it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: So you were really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: -- I got vitamins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Right, I was going to say you’ve got minerals, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: And I bring it home, and I couldn’t tell my father, and we had to cheat him, and telling him that I got it as a reward, and I found it, and I -- I don’t know what kind of excuses I found that he eats half a tomato.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: The tape is running out, we’re going to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: I have to get up and get -- End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: I want to go back to the tomatoes for a minute.</span> <span id="s1936">How -- when you carried a lot of tomatoes, how many could you carry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Well, the maximum that we counted what I carried were 33 tomatoes wrapped --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: In your bra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: In my bra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Now these are not big tomatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Regular tomatoes.</span> <span id="s1942">They are not beefsteak tomatoes.</span> <span id="s1943">They are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: 33?</span> <span id="s1945">Without breaking them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Without breaking them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Did you have a very big bra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Empty bra, yes, very big, I had nothing there.</span> <span id="s1949">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Because it seems inconceivable to have 33 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Once we found on the way, and we happened to have a good gendarme with us, walnuts.</span> <span id="s1952">But if you know the walnuts are in a very prickly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Well, we put them in bra, too, and we got burned from the acid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: You got burned from the acid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: On our chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: But it would also hurt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: -- because it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: But you would bring it in, that was something totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Now I have to tell you, my vision of you with 33 tomatoes is the Berusky would come after you in a second because you would be so hu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: No, we had roll -- the clothing, I had my father’s shirt, for example.</span> <span id="s1963">I -- sometimes to work I had to have my father’s shoes in -- in winter, because I put newspaper -- paper, whatever we found in, because we were working cutting re -- reeds, and that was standing on ice, sometimes little water.</span> <span id="s1964">And I didn’t have such strong shoes like my father, and so he made me wear them so I don’t get frostbite.</span> <span id="s1965">So you -- you know, you -- I wore --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: [indecipherable] your father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: -- my father’s shirt, I could put in anything.</span> <span id="s1968">And when I worked with my friends, I told you they worked four people on this little -- it was a little place where they had few fields of onions, she would give me onion.</span> <span id="s1969">The onion burned you too, made us brown if I brought onions home.</span> <span id="s1970">But the onion was like gold, because that made any food better, if my mother just -- but I don’t know how often my mother -- my mother always found somewhere some wood, and would -- would make something in -- we had a little stove for heating the room, so you only got little leftovers of wood from the carpenters, so -- so she always would find something to heat with.</span> <span id="s1971">We were feeding pigs for example, one week it was our job, our group.</span> <span id="s1972">We were a group that was put wherever they needed.</span> <span id="s1973">And we stole the good potatoes from the pigs and gave the rottens only to them.</span> <span id="s1974">So we always found something different to -- to eat, and to steal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: And how many were in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: We were about 15 girls in the group, sometimes 10, sometimes 12, and was always the same group.</span> <span id="s1977">You kept together one group, and you had a head of the group.</span> <span id="s1978">And there were several groups together and the head of all the tomatoes and everybody was Werner Neuflies who still living at age 95 in Israel.</span> <span id="s1979">And we are still very friendly, and he’s not writing now, so I don’t know what’s happening to him.</span> <span id="s1980">But you had a leader, you had a group leader, and you were a group.</span> <span id="s1981">Now, when they needed to bring in hay, we had to all go and rake the hay and turn it over till it’s dry.</span> <span id="s1982">Bundle it and s-stick it up, and we had to carry the heavy bundles like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1983">But we were all young, we were all in our teens, and -- no, we w -- had women that were in their 30’s too, and had children already, they -- so we were but still young people, so we could do it.</span> <span id="s1984">And we had the vitamins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Was -- where there may -- comparable male groups, or were these --</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: There were some male groups, but not field groups, not garden groups.</span> <span id="s1987">Males were working with horses and different things where women were not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Were any of you in these groups knowledgeable about farming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1990">My friend came from a farm, for example.</span> <span id="s1991">She still lives in Czechoslovakia, we see each other when we go there.</span> <span id="s1992">She’s the one who was singing in the choir.</span> <span id="s1993">She was from a farm, she knew about field work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: So did -- did you learn --</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: When she was young -- she was younger than I was, two years younger, but she still knew about it.</span> <span id="s1996">The Prague girls didn’t know much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: So you had to learn quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: We learned.</span> <span id="s1999">We did -- it’s very easy, shows you what to do with tomatoes, how to plant them once, and you do it.</span> <span id="s2000">They show you how to make the plate around so water keeps, and you do it.</span> <span id="s2001">And then you got through all the rows all morning until you finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: And you said in your group, you don’t know what other groups were like, but whatever food you took out, you shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: We shared.</span> <span id="s2004">We had three older wo -- old women we called them, but as I say, they were in their 30’s and 40’s, who were very nervous, who didn’t want -- were not as risky.</span> <span id="s2005">We -- we somehow -- I don’t think we believed something can happen to us, that’s the stupidity.</span> <span id="s2006">And because they were so nervous, they didn’t know how to hide it, and they didn’t know how to behave in front of the gendarmes, they would put us all at risk.</span> <span id="s2007">So we decided, hey you don’t take anything, you go on the side, so you see you are free.</span> <span id="s2008">And we will, when we get behind the door, we will divide it.</span> <span id="s2009">And they agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: So it was very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: Yeah, but -- was very smart.</span> <span id="s2012">There were days when we couldn’t take, we knew we can’t take because it was a very bad gendarme, and we didn’t know what he will do at the -- at the gate.</span> <span id="s2013">And so there were days when we didn’t take anything, and when we had the feeling it will --</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: So did you discuss this as you were in the field --</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: -- and say, oh we think we should nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Oh yes, we worked together --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A. A: -- we worked together as a group.</span> <span id="s2020">We worked together, we did entertaining together.</span> <span id="s2021">As a matter of fact, the last -- on New Year’s Eve in 1944, we decided we will party, this is the end of the war, we -- two months and it’s ended.</span> <span id="s2022">And I think we knew that the war is going bad for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2023">So we decided -- we saw a room and there was -- used to be a stove -- by that time, don’t forget, after the transports in October, the ghetto was half empty, more than half we had a program.</span> <span id="s2024">And I have the program, I didn’t -- I don’t think I left it -- wrote it -- what [indecipherable] each two or one made a -- a -- a -- like a number performed, and we didn’t have anything to drink, but we were like drunk, because we said we’ll be free, this is the year we will be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q.</span> <span id="s2026">So you were there all night, partying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A. All night partying, yeah.</span> <span id="s2028">Very quietly partyinh, nobody should hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A.</span> <span id="s2031">But we were together, we were very close knit group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A.</span> <span id="s2034">But I think the others were, too, because I think it was a necessity, you have to work together, you couldn’t do it on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: So you didn’t hear fighting in the barrack, or people yelling at each other, having arguments, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Oh, some winnen -- women might have a argument that she threw down a piece of paper on her place, or maybe, but we were so little in the room.</span> <span id="s2037">And then I lived with my parents, there was no argument there, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: When -- when you first got this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: -- bickering, I would call it, not really fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Bickering, okay.</span> <span id="s2041">When you first got there, this is before your parents come, and you have a sort of substitute mom --</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Martha -- Mama Dittel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: -- do you -- Mama Dittel -- do you have a f -- a feeling -- d-does it take away the -- some of the loneliness because there’s someone there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Definitely, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: And I had my boyfriend that I looked forward to see.</span> <span id="s2047">We did part, afterwards, but I had him there, too, so -- and -- and I felt freer in one way, I had no -- the people that looked at us differently, I didn’t meet the others.</span> <span id="s2048">We were among ourselves only, I felt much freer.</span> <span id="s2049">I felt better.</span> <span id="s2050">And I felt that when it is over in two months, I have my room, and my bed, and our apartment and my parents.</span> <span id="s2051">They are still home.</span> <span id="s2052">I felt privileged that they’re -- I was -- by that time I was happy that they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s2053">But was the bubble blew and they came, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: -- which was again, I was happy to see them, I was unhappy that they had to come.</span> <span id="s2056">But at that time, the first few months, I felt privileged that I have still my bed at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: So there was a si --</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: I don’t know why the bed was so important, because I think the bunkbed wasn’t very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: But there was a sense of outside security, because the war will be over, so you’ll have a place, and here it’s not so bad yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2061">You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Because you at least have -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: -- we -- my friend had scarlet fever, my other friend had typhoid fever, and I thought if I -- we slept together on the bunk so I might get it too, and then I can’t get into transports.</span> <span id="s2064">The transports were hanging over you all the time.</span> <span id="s2065">You would be rather sick than getting into transport.</span> <span id="s2066">But I never got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: You never got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: No.</span> <span id="s2069">There was diphtheria, there was encephalitis, there was hepatitis, there was scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s2070">What else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Dysen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Dysentery.</span> <span id="s2073">I was always healthy.</span> <span id="s2074">I think the vitamins did it.</span> <span id="s2075">But o -- even in the beginning when I didn’t have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: So you were very strong, there was something in your system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s2078">Because in the end when we were liberated, friend of mine came as the first transport that came, where we for the first time realized what happened, where we saw for the first time -- we called them musselman, those devastated people that looked like skeleton.</span> <span id="s2079">We tried to feed them.</span> <span id="s2080">We were three girls that volunteered to -- immediately we had to take care of them, and everybody was mobilized to do something for that effort.</span> <span id="s2081">Forget the garden, and -- but s -- do something for these people.</span> <span id="s2082">They cooked the soup, but -- whatever they did, and they brought it and we were supposed to dish it out.</span> <span id="s2083">And they all swamped around us, and the whole kettle and everything was down.</span> <span id="s2084">We had one girl that was like a general, and of course they broke another kettle and she screamed at them.</span> <span id="s2085">They all -- you know, they were afraid of screaming.</span> <span id="s2086">We didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s2087">We got them -- she helped us to get it.</span> <span id="s2088">We saw them like animals and -- and that was terrible for us.</span> <span id="s2089">And with the first came -- the first women, there was my friend with her mother.</span> <span id="s2090">And she was sick so she was in the -- in the teepho -- typhoid barracks.</span> <span id="s2091">But it was open, I could go in and out.</span> <span id="s2092">So -- and she called for me and from the window I saw.</span> <span id="s2093">I said, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s2094">And she told me, I don’t know, piece of bread or whatever.</span> <span id="s2095">I ran home and brought it, and I just walked into the typhoid hospital and I brought it to them, you know, stuff.</span> <span id="s2096">Then I went outs -- we had outside hothouses, you know, for stuff, and we had all this vegetables there, so I brought some veggies to them, something to nibble on, and nobody stopped me, could in and out as I wanted, and I did.</span> <span id="s2097">And some people got sick, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: It’s really quite amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2100">I -- I was not afraid to get sick and I d -- I -- I never thought I could get sick.</span> <span id="s2101">When I think of it today when I have a little sense, it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: You had some sort of immunity --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: -- who knows?</span> <span id="s2105">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Bef -- be -- when you were y -- there before your parents came, did you have bad dreams?</span> <span id="s2108">Do you remember at any time having bad dreams, having nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: Opposite.</span> <span id="s2110">I was dreaming being home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: You s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: And it hurt in the morning more when I woke up around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Because you were in a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: They are not bad dreams.</span> <span id="s2115">Bad dreams I had afterwards, not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2117">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Not there.</span> <span id="s2119">I was always dreaming I’m back at home.</span> <span id="s2120">Because that was -- I -- I wanted my parents to keep the apart -- I wanted home, you know, we wanted to be liberated, and we thought life will continue where it stopped, but it didn’t, and that was the biggest disappointment, and it took out all the pleasure of being liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: -- because it was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: -- what we were -- we thought will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2126">Your parents arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: End of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: No, ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: No, ’42 -- end of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: End of ’42.</span> <span id="s2132">’43 I was already in agriculture.</span> <span id="s2133">’43 they were there.</span> <span id="s2134">End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: So you’re there July ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: [indecipherable] there end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: And they’re -- they come --</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Four months later, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Four months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2141">Four and a half months, it’s about that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: So, to the beginning of ’43 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: -- or the end of ’42.</span> <span id="s2145">End of ’42.</span> <span id="s2146">Okay.</span> <span id="s2147">You didn’t know they were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: No, but as soon as my boyfriend got -- he working with the transports he got the list, he saw them on the list, he came to tell me your parents are here.</span> <span id="s2149">And then he took me over to them, he smuggled me in.</span> <span id="s2150">Because nobody was allowed to come, but those boys that worked with the transport could, and he got me in.</span> <span id="s2151">So I saw them still in the Schleusse, and immediately I put on my mother that I want them in the -- want her in Hamburger.</span> <span id="s2152">My brother and my father went to the barracks they were assigned to.</span> <span id="s2153">My father -- I -- immediately there was a transport going to Poland, and I was afraid they would go, so immediately my father contacted his friend who was on the Altestenrat, on the council of the elders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: And who was that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Zucker, his name was Zucker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: And so he’s he deputy director un-underneath Eidelstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2158">And he made sure that he stayed.</span> <span id="s2159">And he gave him the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: So he got a job [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: Not right away, but he -- he stayed -- the transport I think went -- I’m not sure when the transport -- early in January or end of December.</span> <span id="s2162">I -- I don’t know when the transport went exactly, I could check on that.</span> <span id="s2163">And he made sure he stayed, and then he gave him the job to make order, to make sure.</span> <span id="s2164">My father had a vision that if nobody steals from the main -- I -- I stole from the Germans, but he didn’t [indecipherable] stealing either.</span> <span id="s2165">So stealing is stealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: No matter from whom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: No matter from whom.</span> <span id="s2168">If -- as long as everybody will eat his portions, then these old people that were dying would get enough food, too.</span> <span id="s2169">There was some truth in it, but I don’t think he realized that maybe the young people need more food than the older one, and the kids need more food.</span> <span id="s2170">He wanted justice for everyone, and he worked very hard on that.</span> <span id="s2171">But he was very generous.</span> <span id="s2172">All of his friends and everybody got a good job there, too, as long as he could take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2174">But there’s always --</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: There was the end.</span> <span id="s2176">He went with the last transport when all the -- when all the -- the whole f -- Alteste and everybody was gone, so he -- he couldn’t stay any more.</span> <span id="s2177">Zucker was gone, and I don’t know what happened, why he was taken.</span> <span id="s2178">There was a group of 20 young boys taken by Heindel, out.</span> <span id="s2179">That’s why they wanted me as a witness against Heindel.</span> <span id="s2180">They were taken off the -- you know where you get on -- into the train.</span> <span id="s2181">They were not in the train, yet -- on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: On the ramp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: On the ramp.</span> <span id="s2184">And my father was among them, but he wasn’t in his 20’s, he was 50 years old -- fi -- 50 thr -- 54 years old.</span> <span id="s2185">And they took them to the small fortress and they were the ones -- which I found -- we found only afterwards, and we found his name on the small fortress too, and they were the ones that had to clean out the crematorium from all the urns, and throw them into the river.</span> <span id="s2186">And last time when we were there, there is a memorial for these 20 men, and where they threw down the -- the ashes into the river.</span> <span id="s2187">And according to Elna Haas, he was about six weeks, and then they executed all of them, all 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: After they’d finished this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: Evidently.</span> <span id="s2190">So that -- I found that out from Elna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: And Mother -- that was the 20th of October.</span> <span id="s2193">Mother went to Auschwitz and didn’t pass the selection.</span> <span id="s2194">She was 51, that was too old for them.</span> <span id="s2195">My friend’s mother that passed because she was with her, she said that she is 40 years old.</span> <span id="s2196">She was the same age, 50 about, and that she’s my friend’s sister.</span> <span id="s2197">And because she was naked then -- and she said she had so many children, that’s why she -- she lost a lot of weight, and she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: This was Mama Dittel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Mama Dittel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: When your parents came, and your mother is living with you, and then your f -- your father is in Sudeten, do you thi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Yeah, and my brother, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: -- for -- for awhile before -- and your brother too.</span> <span id="s2203">Do they come and say that they have some idea of what’s going on in Poland?</span> <span id="s2204">Or don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: They don’t know anything, and they’re not hearing -- or they’re not telling you what they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: We knew what’s going on in Poland little bit, because everybody, wherever you got the 30 [indecipherable] and as I said one of Mother’s best friend, we called her aunt, wrote to her, in a way she wrote that it’s awful, and the only thing that’s good for her is the mirror.</span> <span id="s2208">So we knew that she had little bit of money that she could use in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2209">That was the mirror my father made for everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2211">And she was in wudge -- Lódz --</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: Izbica.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: Oh, she’s in be -- Izbica, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: From my real aunt I never got -- we never got news, we never -- she went -- according to the book, I think they went to Sobibór, straight from Terezín, they never went to Auschwitz or anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: Now, does it surprise you that you’re not hearing rumors by ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: We knew it’s very bad, everybody was afraid to go east.</span> <span id="s2217">We knew the Polish people were very bad to the people.</span> <span id="s2218">That was somehow known, that the Polish people are not sympathetic to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: We knew that the Jews are suffering, that they are beaten and killed, and -- and we knew about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2221">But there is still the belief that if you do and work hard, and do what they say, they let you live.</span> <span id="s2222">We didn’t believe in mass extermination.</span> <span id="s2223">We thought in masses is strength, and they can’t kill hundred people at the same time.</span> <span id="s2224">How dumb.</span> <span id="s2225">They could kill six million.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2227">So your parents, I assume, are somewhat less optimistic than they were before they come?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: But in front of us kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: They’re the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: -- they were always talking, it will be ending soon, you will have a normal life, you have to survive.</span> <span id="s2231">Their aim was that their kids survive, they didn’t care much about themselves.</span> <span id="s2232">My parents lost a lot of weight, even though we tried to bring and steal, they never take a thing, you know, from anywhere or anything.</span> <span id="s2233">So we kids were the ones.</span> <span id="s2234">My brother worked in the bakery and would bring additional bread, and -- which he would give his par -- our parents, and they lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s2235">My father was a little belly, and you know, he looked well-to-do, you will see it on the movie, and he was very skinny afterwards, and my mother too.</span> <span id="s2236">And that went very fast.</span> <span id="s2237">And I was bringing home the stuff, so you know, that didn’t help, to [indecipherable] they were healthy people.</span> <span id="s2238">Otherwise, there was nothing wrong with them.</span> <span id="s2239">And they -- they considered themselves old, and lived their life, although they was only in their early 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: No, no, no, no, when she was in Terezín --</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: -- when she same to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2246">She started with the Putzkolonne like Edgar’s mother, like everyone.</span> <span id="s2247">When new people come they start the worst jobs because once you are there for a little while, you find a way to find something better.</span> <span id="s2248">My father didn’t start on that note, he started in some office or something.</span> <span id="s2249">But my mother started in the Putzkolonne with washing floors, and -- and I don’t know where they all cleaned, and I have no idea, because I was gone for the day.</span> <span id="s2250">And then -- for a long time she was very handicapped with her -- she got a terrible attack of sciatica nerve and she couldn’t -- she could only lay down, she couldn’t move for weeks.</span> <span id="s2251">Because there was no medication, nothing, no pain killers, nothing.</span> <span id="s2252">So only time would heal.</span> <span id="s2253">And then finally I -- she got onto a bed so she could rest better.</span> <span id="s2254">And then it stopped slowly, and she started to work.</span> <span id="s2255">So for some time she was incapacitated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Were you concerned that she would be transported out if she was incapaci --</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: No, no, that -- I wasn’t, because I believed in my father.</span> <span id="s2260">We believed Father can do anything too, like my grandma.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: And because he was in a sort of privileged position by then, could he protect your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: You -- he could?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: And they also went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Later -- no, I -- yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Because of that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: And at that time, I knew that if sh -- if I get her into -- there was a man that was responsible, Edgar wanted me to tell you, for the agriculture, his name was Kurzawy.</span> <span id="s2269">He was not an SS, and he was really very good to us.</span> <span id="s2270">When the SS came he was -- he would call us all dirty names, and scream at us, and when the SS went he would said, “Okay, it’s normal again.”</span> <span id="s2271">You know?</span> <span id="s2272">He would always protect us if he could.</span> <span id="s2273">He was a great guy.</span> <span id="s2274">In 1945, he was imprisoned like all the Germans, in the small fortress, and the agriculture group got together and signed a petition and we got him out.</span> <span id="s2275">And he ended up his life in Austria.</span> <span id="s2276">But he was great, so I thought maybe I -- my sister-in-law sometimes worked in his pri -- private garden in his house, it was outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2277">So I thought we -- I could get my mother in to be protected, but my mother wouldn’t let me, she said, “Ah, you are -- your father and me, we are together.</span> <span id="s2278">We will go through this together.</span> <span id="s2279">You have been here before alone, you can survive again, and you have to survive.”</span> <span id="s2280">And she wouldn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: She wouldn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: -- she wouldn’t s -- try to save herself, no.</span> <span id="s2283">And I tried to get in, but they wouldn’t take us.</span> <span id="s2284">We were 29 girls that appealed to everyone we could, including Murmelstein, who threw us out very rudely, that wanted to make a swap, 15 girls take in and 15 parents take out, you know, swap it, it’s number for number.</span> <span id="s2285">No.</span> <span id="s2286">Because it was a rule that we have to bring in the harvest, that -- and that what Kurzawy did.</span> <span id="s2287">None of his girls were allowed to be send away.</span> <span id="s2288">He needs them for harvest, and that he saved everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: So do you now think Murmelstein in some way, even though he was not the nicest of persons, that he ended up saving the girls life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: I think he did it -- I don’t think he cared, I don’t believe that he cared.</span> <span id="s2291">I think he did what was the order from the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: So these people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: And the order was not to send anybody who works in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: And [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Because they couldn’t substitute the older people for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2298">So I think that was his, and as a matter of fact, Kurzawy told me -- I went to him too, and he will talk to us.</span> <span id="s2299">But he said, “You wi -- you won’t be with your mother, and you will be grateful to me that I saved your life.”</span> <span id="s2300">And I said to him, “I don’t ask you for that.</span> <span id="s2301">I want to go.”</span> <span id="s2302">And he said, “You will not go.”</span> <span id="s2303">That was the end.</span> <span id="s2304">So then in February came a Swiss transport.</span> <span id="s2305">And I happened to be in the Swiss transport ti -- again.</span> <span id="s2306">By that time [indecipherable] could go, that was already the end coming.</span> <span id="s2307">And I decided if he didn’t let me go with my parents, I’m not leaving Terezín because my parents will come back to Terezín.</span> <span id="s2308">I don’t want to be somewhere in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2309">Besides, it’s probably goes to the sent -- to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2310">Birkenau we knew -- to Birkenau two, and I do -- I’m not going anywhere now.</span> <span id="s2311">So I went to Kurzawy and he said, “It’s going to Switzerland, I’m telling you.”</span> <span id="s2312">I said, “I don’t believe you, I want to stay.”</span> <span id="s2313">He said, “You can stay.”</span> <span id="s2314">And I stayed.</span> <span id="s2315">Took me out of the transport.</span> <span id="s2316">But that went to Switzerland</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: That really went to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: That really went, but I didn’t trust them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Okay, we have to change the tape again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Hana, when Heindel said to you, you will be grateful to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Kurzawy, not Heindel.</span> <span id="s2324">Heindel would never --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Oh, of course, kur -- s -- I’m sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: -- talk to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Kur -- kur --</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: Kurzawy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Kurzawy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: -- said that you would be grateful to me, cause -- that’s you’re alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Did you then un -- realize that for every --</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: I think we understood that it’s very bad on the other side.</span> <span id="s2335">What we didn’t know, and I didn’t know that he was in sh -- Auschwitz once, that he was there, he saw what happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: So he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: He knew, but I didn’t know it until my sister-in-law told me years later that he was sent to Auschwitz as one of the transports, and he saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: And then he ca -- and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: And that’s when he decided to save his groups, and his -- the girls he worked with, I think.</span> <span id="s2340">We think, we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: So it only seemed to you that he was saying it’s -- one can be very vulnerable there, was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: It’s very bad there, there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: -- you know, much more hunger, there is much more -- we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: And it’s under the SS --</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: -- very, very bad, you know.</span> <span id="s2349">And we knew that the camps were worse -- the ghettos in -- Lódz ghetto was much worse sanitary and everything, that we knew.</span> <span id="s2350">Everybody was afraid of the east, because the Polish people suffered before the war, with pogroms.</span> <span id="s2351">They didn’t need the war for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: I’m asking this only because it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: But nobody believed that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: I know, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: -- somebody can do such a thing to human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: To children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: To young people, old people.</span> <span id="s2360">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s2361">I was so upset when grandma died because I thought it’s my fault, I should have taken better care of her, which I didn’t know what to do, how I would have been able, because they were dying at that time, the -- the book it says 220, I thought about 150 a day in ’42, in summer.</span> <span id="s2362">That was the worst summer for death rate in Terezín.</span> <span id="s2363">And after the war I said I’m so grateful that she did, because they schlepped the old people to Auschwitz, they died on the way in the train.</span> <span id="s2364">She was spared that, she died in a bed.</span> <span id="s2365">You know?</span> <span id="s2366">And she was 86 or 88, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2367">So for her it was a good deed.</span> <span id="s2368">But I -- we knew it’s very bad, that we knew.</span> <span id="s2369">Why would everybody fight not to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: Terezín wasn’t a bargain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s2373">But the real -- what was really happening, no one was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: The gas chamber we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: -- no one had any suspicion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: And we didn’t know that 50 is old.</span> <span id="s2377">My mother said, “Look, I am strong, I am still good enough to work, I can work hard and I’ll come back.”</span> <span id="s2378">She didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: She didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Was too old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: I want to ask you some about, not only the requiem concert, but also other artistic and musical and theater activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: We went to anything we could get our hands on tickets, or whatever they get.</span> <span id="s2383">I saw Brundibar.</span> <span id="s2384">I saw Bartibride.</span> <span id="s2385">I saw all -- some operas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: Did you see, “Marriage of Figaro”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: No, that one I didn’t see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: “Carmen”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: “Carmen” I saw.</span> <span id="s2390">I saw -- I went to nearly any concert [indecipherable] to get on Alice Sommer-Herz, which was the pianist I loved so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: What was her name -- was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Alice Sommer-Herz.</span> <span id="s2393">She’s the hundred year old one, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: A hundred?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: -- I would listen to her, because sh -- to -- she played the Mozart, she played Chopin, and I loved that.</span> <span id="s2396">So I would try to get to these concerts, but they were not only concert -- as a matter of fact, we did some recitals of poems, because a guy, usually George Loy put us, about six girls together, and we recite, just to do something, because we couldn’t sing.</span> <span id="s2397">But that wasn’t too -- too successful --</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: -- cause people didn’t listen to poems too much, so after short while it -- it stopped [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2400">But we wanted to do things, because that -- that took away the boredom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Did you have to pay for these tickets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: With your ghetto gelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: And what was ghetto gelt?</span> <span id="s2404">There was actually money printed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: Actual money that you get for your work.</span> <span id="s2406">We played Monopoly.</span> <span id="s2407">My sister-in-law made Monopoly board, I don’t know where she got the cardboard, and with this money we played Monopoly sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2410">But I don’t know what happened to it.</span> <span id="s2411">She said all she has left is about two calendars that she made for birthdays.</span> <span id="s2412">You get -- you -- you paid with something, like tomatoes, and you -- she made you a -- you know, a something else, and the person made you whatever you ordered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: I have a pendant that I got in ’43 on my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Yeah, yeah, we have it with us.</span> <span id="s2417">Edgar didn’t show you his pendant in those pictures.</span> <span id="s2418">He has one too, different.</span> <span id="s2419">It has his -- his number, transport number in the Akar, and mine has my transport number and the date on it.</span> <span id="s2420">It’s from scrap metal, it’s not silver --</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: -- it’s not gold, it’s just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: -- it has a different kind of value.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2426">Did many, many people go to these events, or a small --</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: It was always full.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: It was always full.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: I don’t know how many people go twice or three times.</span> <span id="s2430">Because it was also hard to get tickets, there was too many people that wanted to go, because that was -- for the two hours, an hour and a half, you forgot you were where you were.</span> <span id="s2431">The music was -- well, I’m not a musician, but I s -- would say perfect.</span> <span id="s2432">That was -- anywhere else the concert could be held, and would be great.</span> <span id="s2433">She was a great pianist, so you know, I’m not a good -- maybe somebody would say the piano wasn’t tuned very well, but -- and there were too -- big competition, you -- sometimes you knew somebody who could get the tickets or you -- you really bargained for that, but you got tickets, you went.</span> <span id="s2434">I don’t remember how it was later, because in the beginning you also had to be eight o’clock home.</span> <span id="s2435">Whether for Freizeit we were allowed, because this was all evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Freizeit was Friday?</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: The free --</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Free day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: No, Freizeit means that was the free entertainment, or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: -- you know, and that you got permission to go later out, I don’t know, but I know that there was a -- from eight to five, you were not allowed to be on the streets, but you had to get home from those performances, so that might have been allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: I just thought of something that may seem stupid.</span> <span id="s2443">Ho -- how were your barracks lit at night?</span> <span id="s2444">With what?</span> <span id="s2445">Candles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: No, there was electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: There was li -- there was electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Electricity.</span> <span id="s2449">There was only no heat.</span> <span id="s2450">There was no heat or hot water.</span> <span id="s2451">I don’t know how they had it in the kitchen, but in the washroom, where Edgar ad -- des-described it, where we went every night to wash, and sit under --</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: There’s no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: -- the cold water --</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: -- hi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: -- yeah, there was no hot water there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: You sat under the cold --</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: No, you -- you jumped onto the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: -- and sat down and opened the pipe, and -- and that was your shower.</span> <span id="s2460">There was no shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: You had towels?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: We had towels from home, sure.</span> <span id="s2463">That was in the hun -- 50 kilos, in the 110 pounds.</span> <span id="s2464">You had towels, you had bed linen in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: And then you sent this out to be cl -- washed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: Only the big things you could send out to be washed, like the bed linen and the towels.</span> <span id="s2467">Your -- your things, you washed in the cold water.</span> <span id="s2468">You had a basin that you shared.</span> <span id="s2469">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: And you washed that.</span> <span id="s2471">And where would you hang it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: Above your bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: So it would drip down?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: You hang it this way, they didn’t drip down.</span> <span id="s2475">[indecipherable] where you could.</span> <span id="s2476">Also between the windows outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: Wherever you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: But in the cold weather -- really cold weather --</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Yeah, it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: -- it would -- it -- it would freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: So you didn’t wash that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: I don’t know how we did it.</span> <span id="s2485">I don’t know things of ordinary, we didn’t have paper, we didn’t have pencils, only what you brought in.</span> <span id="s2486">But then those people that work with it, the painters, they got it, they might have, you know, some may k -- have come to their friends, or again exchanged the barter system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: But paper was very valuable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: There was no toilet paper, I don’t remember ever getting a ration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Of toilet paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: And any hygiene, there was no hygiene.</span> <span id="s2493">But we all ar-are s -- young girls, did not have period for those three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: You never got your period in Theresienstadt -- Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: You entered the ghetto, it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: It stopped.</span> <span id="s2497">You know it’s interesting, because many women will tell you when they went to a concentration camp it stopped.</span> <span id="s2498">But they forget that they may not have gotten it in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: No, it stopped in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: It stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: And you had obviously --</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: -- which was lucky, because we had no way of getting --</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: -- anything.</span> <span id="s2506">It started only when we came back to Prague.</span> <span id="s2507">I don’t know when, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: -- never thought about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Well, it was fortunate that it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Well, evidently.</span> <span id="s2512">Which we didn’t think of at that time.</span> <span id="s2513">We just forgot about it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Were -- was anybody worried that they weren’t getting their period?</span> <span id="s2515">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: That was the least of your worries.</span> <span id="s2518">But you re -- you never got it?</span> <span id="s2519">So immediately?</span> <span id="s2520">So it wasn’t that you were getting less food.</span> <span id="s2521">Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: Well, it was the first three or four weeks and nothing happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s2525">You didn’t worry about health those days, we were young, we thought we are -- nothing can touch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: It means you’re invulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: Was the Verdi Requiem one of the most important concerts for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: And why was that the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: The most impact, the most -- because we -- I at least knew what they are singing about because my friend told me.</span> <span id="s2532">She was singing for us, she was with Schecter.</span> <span id="s2533">She knew what [indecipherable], and I took Latin in school, don’t forget I went to school from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: -- sixth grade I had Latin.</span> <span id="s2536">So I knew what libera may mean, e-even if I didn’t understand every word, and couldn’t translate it for anybody, I didn’t know that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: And what did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: It was very powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: And what did it mean for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: I thought I am back in Prague in a concert scene.</span> <span id="s2541">So [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2542">You -- you forget where you are that -- those two hours, you -- you hear the music, you hear the concerts, you hear the opera [indecipherable] it was only singing, there was no acting, there was no stage.</span> <span id="s2543">I mean, there was a stage where they s -- were standing and the piano and only singing.</span> <span id="s2544">And you were back in the National Theater hearing the opera.</span> <span id="s2545">I mean all in am -- imagination was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: So it was -- but all of the performances that you heard were important, was the requiem particularly important somehow?</span> <span id="s2547">Or was it more --</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: I think so because it -- somehow our -- my friend told me what the meaning is, to tell them that they will suffer.</span> <span id="s2551">In the end, truth will win somehow, and we wanted to believe that.</span> <span id="s2552">You know it was very interesting, I thought I could kill any SS with cold blooded.</span> <span id="s2553">In ’45 when they started -- when they marched them, they were torn, they were dirty, they were not these spic, span with these high boots SS.</span> <span id="s2554">I suddenly didn’t hate them so much, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2555">They looked so vulnerable.</span> <span id="s2556">I don’t think I could have killed anybody, and -- even though I thought I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: So they became people again in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: In some way they looked worse than we did.</span> <span id="s2559">But in 1947 I went to England, and on the way back, I -- I brought some oranges.</span> <span id="s2560">I had a one year old nephew, my brother had a child with my sister-in-law, my friend.</span> <span id="s2561">And on the all -- the all -- we went through Nuremberg which was all destroyed, and I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s2562">And under -- in the station we stopped, and I had these oranges, and chocolate in my trunk that my friend -- I called her cousin, gave me for everybody.</span> <span id="s2563">And they were begging for food, those children.</span> <span id="s2564">And I said, “No way do I give you German children anything.”</span> <span id="s2565">Like if those kids murdered all the others, but I could look at them begging for food, and I didn’t feel guilty at all.</span> <span id="s2566">And I know I was awful, I know I -- I’m biased all my life, and not good, but I just couldn’t get rid of it at that time, ’47 was too early after the war.</span> <span id="s2567">Now I am different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Do you remember the preparations for the Red Cross visit in June of ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Yes, yes, because our group again, being put anywhere we’re needed, was put on the main square to do the grass.</span> <span id="s2570">And it was all done, we had to clear everything away, new earth had to come.</span> <span id="s2571">There was nothing, there was just mud and stones.</span> <span id="s2572">We had to clear it of stones, which was heavy work, several times.</span> <span id="s2573">The earth had to be brought in and turned over, and put in lime and stuff that -- to grass to grow.</span> <span id="s2574">And then we had to seed it, and then we had to stamp it by -- by -- see, we worked days and days and days on fershernerone we called it beautification.</span> <span id="s2575">And then when they did the film, we had to march because we -- we looked healthy, because we had the vegetables.</span> <span id="s2576">We had to march with our hoes, and shovels on our shoulder.</span> <span id="s2577">And march in front of the camera, and pick up the cake, and then behind the corner, we had to put the cake back on, and a new tray was brought in.</span> <span id="s2578">Nobody could take a bite.</span> <span id="s2579">That was just a little something that we had to pick up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: This is the film --</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: That Hitler made -- Hitler gave a ghetto to -- a city to the Jews, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: To the Jews.</span> <span id="s2583">But it was never actually [indecipherable] the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: Yeah, the film that they showed, we -- we saw part of it, we saw our f -- one of our friends in it.</span> <span id="s2585">But the agriculture walking there, they never showed that.</span> <span id="s2586">They said there are parts missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: And that was missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: Maybe they didn’t put it in, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: They never completed it as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: Yeah, maybe they didn’t put it in, it might be it’s lost.</span> <span id="s2591">I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: So you were watching also, while you were -- while you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: We knew what they are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: What they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: We knew what they are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: The shops were being introduced, the shops were being staffed.</span> <span id="s2598">My mother was put in the food shop, where she was selling mustard and relish, that’s all they had.</span> <span id="s2599">But it was a change, I loved mustard and bread, and that was the [indecipherable] delicacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: So it went on long enough, so actually people living in the ghetto could go into that store and get --</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Yes, they -- yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: -- if they had gelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: -- it was -- it -- it took time to establish that it took time till the grass grew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: Then we had to cut it to -- to -- you know, to make sure it looks good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: And could every --</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: Have the flower planted too, flowers.</span> <span id="s2608">There were -- it was made beautiful.</span> <span id="s2609">They were putting up -- one space was for the gazebo for the musicians or something.</span> <span id="s2610">And on the day of the inspection, I was in the fields working, I was not in town.</span> <span id="s2611">We were rarely in town during the day, because once the grass grew and was finished, we went back to the fields, cause those had to be taken care of, and the summer is still most work.</span> <span id="s2612">So on the day of th -- I never saw the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: The Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: -- people, the Red Cross or anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span> <span id="s2616">Now, during that period before the Red Cross visit, could anyone who had free time walk in that area and go into the shops?</span> <span id="s2617">Or was that a restricted area to only certain people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: It was a restricted area, it was in the middle of the town, and I don’t know when the shops opened exactly, but once they were opened, I think you could go in.</span> <span id="s2619">I don’t think -- I don’t know how early before that they opened it, but in the ghetto, was no restricted area.</span> <span id="s2620">I have no idea how it was during the exi -- actual inspection, whether they restricted the main street where they walked, because I was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: I wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Now, it’s a few months -- well, it’s four months, June, July, August, September -- five months after this visit, that your parents and brother are deported.</span> <span id="s2624">Are you living together during this period, or have you wi -- now been separated?</span> <span id="s2625">Are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Until they were deported, I stayed in the room with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: You stayed with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: My brother next house.</span> <span id="s2629">When they -- by the time they left, in the last transport, there was nobody in the house, I was all alone in the whole house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: And my sister-in-law was in another house around the corner, and she was alone, too.</span> <span id="s2632">So first we moved in together.</span> <span id="s2633">I moved over there, I -- I didn’t want to stay in -- in that room, I -- I had nightmares, I was -- I wasn’t afraid of anything, I was afraid to stay there alone.</span> <span id="s2634">I tried to save few of the things.</span> <span id="s2635">When you went to Auschwitz, you were allowed your backpack and what you can carry, no more a trunk, that stayed all with me, the three trunks.</span> <span id="s2636">My brother’s things too.</span> <span id="s2637">And then the agriculture department opened a house right opposite where we had the place where we gathered for work.</span> <span id="s2638">And my sister-in-law immediately, through her supervisor, got a room for us there.</span> <span id="s2639">So we were five girls that moved in into that house in one room.</span> <span id="s2640">I don’t remember the fifth, my sister-in-law says we were five, I remember only four.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Let me ask you something, I know this -- I know how difficult this is for you to talk about.</span> <span id="s2642">But y-you assumed that your parents were protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: Until they weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: Until they weren’t.</span> <span id="s2645">And at a certain point, I guess, the people who were protected stopped being protected, they just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: They all went, and I knew there is no help by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: By that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: Because once my father says, “We have to go,” I knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: And did -- you obviously spoke to your brother before he left.</span> <span id="s2650">He was the first one to go, he left on a different transport than your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: He left on a different transport, and my sister-in-law says they got married the day before, I thought always they got married the same day he left.</span> <span id="s2652">That was a period of time when me and my sister-in-law were jealous of each other.</span> <span id="s2653">She’s 18, I am 20.</span> <span id="s2654">So, you know, you don’t -- 21 -- you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Get married first if you’re younger, isn’t that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: You -- not that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: -- that didn’t bother me, mi -- married my father -- my brother, not anybody I wanted.</span> <span id="s2661">But she would claim my brother more, and she would claim that she knows him better.</span> <span id="s2662">Now I lived with him, he was a little baby, I know him better.</span> <span id="s2663">So in Terezín we were bickering to, and fighting, and all that.</span> <span id="s2664">When we came back and my brother returned, he was not in a very good condition that time, because he weigh like 90 pounds, 80 pounds, he was very skinny.</span> <span id="s2665">He had the boils like Edgar.</span> <span id="s2666">Didn’t look very good.</span> <span id="s2667">But the first thing he said, “I don’t want to hear my wife what she says, and I don’t want to hear you.</span> <span id="s2668">We are now the only family [indecipherable] and you will get along.</span> <span id="s2669">And that’s it, don’t come to me.”</span> <span id="s2670">So we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: That was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: We got along, we had to get along, but not willingly.</span> <span id="s2673">We love each other now, and I’m so happy when I see -- have to see each other every year at least.</span> <span id="s2674">She was just here now.</span> <span id="s2675">So she left Monday, the day you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: And -- is that true, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2677">And Honza also was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: He was deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: Earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: -- in the third transport, we -- we separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Before, because I wasn’t ready to be a true fiancé or whatever.</span> <span id="s2683">I wasn’t really ready for it.</span> <span id="s2684">And he wanted more experience, let’s put it that way, as a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: So he was looking for more intimate experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: And you were saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: So we separated, but we didn’t fight.</span> <span id="s2689">And when he -- he came to tell me he is in a transport, this is in ’44, when they all were leaving in the third transport, and will I would accompany him to the Schleusse, and I said, “Yes, I’ll go with you.”</span> <span id="s2690">And his last word -- words were, wait for me.</span> <span id="s2691">But we were not going together, what do I’m waiting for?</span> <span id="s2692">His mother stayed, his father went, too.</span> <span id="s2693">And we were very good friends, she came to visit us in Israel, his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: So he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: He was an oldest child, he was a terrible --</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: -- terrible loss to her.</span> <span id="s2698">She stayed in Terezín, we were there, because she worked in the mica, and those people were also safe because that was war effort.</span> <span id="s2699">So she stayed till the end, too, like I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: Now, when you talk about yourself, with respect to sexual intimacy, did you notice that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: We knew what’s going on, but I just wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: You weren’t ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: I wasn’t ready, not in camp, and not under those conditions.</span> <span id="s2704">That’s not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: But you -- but you noticed that this was happening around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: Oh yeah, we knew that, that there were plenty of girls who were willing, go ahead.</span> <span id="s2707">I had better ideas about my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Was this surprising to you, shocking to you, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: No.</span> <span id="s2710">I just wasn’t ready in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2711">I wasn’t ready because I don’t think my parents would approve.</span> <span id="s2712">My parents were all to me, and I wanted to live the way my parents wanted me to be.</span> <span id="s2713">I -- my mother was very modern and everything.</span> <span id="s2714">We never talked about sex or anything like that, but I thought she wouldn’t approve, so -- not just casual, I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2716">Do you think people were being casual?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2720">Even some of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: And they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: And they knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: And when you say casual, you mean they weren’t in love with somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: They were neve -- not in love somebody, it was just the present that counted, and somebody e-else can come afterwards, and I wasn’t that type, I couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: Did you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: I knew that I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: No, no, no, I -- no, no, I’m not talking about understanding yourself.</span> <span id="s2728">I understand that you understood yourself.</span> <span id="s2729">Did you understand o-other -- the women and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: I did not judge them, no, I did not judge them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: That’s their way of life.</span> <span id="s2733">My best friend was that way.</span> <span id="s2734">She told me about it, she told me I’m stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: And why did she think you were stupid?</span> <span id="s2736">Because she thought you should do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: Because I didn’t take advantage of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: Of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: -- free -- of being free, not even having parents.</span> <span id="s2740">She had her mother there, and I -- I just -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2741">I -- I wasn’t mature enough.</span> <span id="s2742">I think I was too yo-young, even though in age I was older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: By this time I am 20 - 21.</span> <span id="s2745">And so today 21, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: -- old.</span> <span id="s2748">I mean, you know, I just wasn’t mature for that.</span> <span id="s2749">I did not think that -- I -- I wanted relationship, but something that I can value, and that wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2751">No, I’m not suggesting that you should have been different.</span> <span id="s2752">It’s a very -- it’s -- I -- I would imagine in some situations of -- of that level of depravation, with the possibility that you’ll die, that one might say, this is something that I’ll do.</span> <span id="s2753">And I suspect that that might be what motivated --</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: That wa -- was for them, and not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Edgar says I was stupid.</span> <span id="s2757">He says I was stupid till I got married.</span> <span id="s2758">He had always said I was stupid as a young kid.</span> <span id="s2759">I don’t know, you know, I respected my parents very much, and all my life, I just wanted to be the person they wanted me to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: The -- it was very important to me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: No, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: But I think -- I always said to Edgar, it would be different -- because I had my s -- my fights with my parents, I wanted things that they said no.</span> <span id="s2764">My father wouldn’t let me go on trips when he thought it’s too dangerous, because he was overprotective, and I was -- tell you I told him you are worse than Hitler, Hitler said eight, and you say 7:30, you know, but he had to be 7:30.</span> <span id="s2765">So we f -- I had fights with my parents, I wasn’t the -- just the cream of a relationship.</span> <span id="s2766">But they died so tragically.</span> <span id="s2767">I couldn’t do anything for them, to help them.</span> <span id="s2768">If they lived certain age and died of illness, and I could take care of them, I don’t think it would be so painful, and I don’t think that you would have such a impact, their teaching, on me like this, what happened.</span> <span id="s2769">Because I believed strongly that they will come back.</span> <span id="s2770">For me it was a shock.</span> <span id="s2771">For whatever, my parents will come back, my father knows what to do.</span> <span id="s2772">He will help Mother, and he will -- he always -- he survived World War I, he will survive this war.</span> <span id="s2773">So I was -- I believed my father be powerful, and -- which he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2774">You know?</span> <span id="s2775">So the -- for me, the hardest times were after ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: When your parents and brother were deported, and you couldn’t go, you must have felt really awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: We all did.</span> <span id="s2781">We were in the barracks from which they were deported, we were 29 girls with our backpacks that we packed, thinking -- what sometimes the Germans did, if they room in the -- in the wagons, or if not enough people they thought were deported, they would collect anybody they saw on -- in the courtyard, and sh -- we thought maybe that way we get with.</span> <span id="s2782">So we stayed until the train left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: Hoping to get on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Hoping to.</span> <span id="s2785">And we were huddled there all night, because we couldn’t go back in, back home.</span> <span id="s2786">We were 29, and we were all crying because the parents just left.</span> <span id="s2787">And that was it, we were devastated, but I did what my parents said, I have to go back to work, and I had to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: So you end up with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: But the three days were difficult, I was constantly thinking that three days we ne -- I don’t know how we knew that it takes three days.</span> <span id="s2790">Somebody must have told us it takes about three days to get to Auschwitz -- to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2791">We didn’t think it’s the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: They were talking about Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2794">But we didn’t know it’s next to Auschwitz, we didn’t know where it is.</span> <span id="s2795">We thought it’s another camp like Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: That we knew somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">Q: You knew the name, but you had no idea --</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">A: We didn’t know -- no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: -- of the con -- no idea what it was, and that the conditions --</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: But they said three days it takes to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: So when the three days were over, I said, “Oh God, they’re out of the wagons.”</span> <span id="s2804">My mother had some food, and some drink in the wagon for the trip.</span> <span id="s2805">Whether she ate it, whether she didn’t, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2806">And my father, too.</span> <span id="s2807">And I was relieved after there days, because I thought they were now start maybe working, and maybe they had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: -- establish themselves, and what I didn’t know that that’s -- when they arrived, that’s the end.</span> <span id="s2810">Ah, not my father, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2812">So from November until the Russians come in May --</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Russians came May eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: Eighth of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: But somehow we knew something is happening because in April -- first of all, people weren’t coming back to Terezín in the awful state they were in.</span> <span id="s2816">And there was lot of work to do, we still had to have the vegetable growing, we still had to have -- feed the people.</span> <span id="s2817">There were not enough people to do things, because we were so decimated, just the few of us.</span> <span id="s2818">And the Red Cross, Czech Red Cross came over --</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: There’s another Red Cross visit, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: No, the Czechs came over --</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: -- around the fourth of May.</span> <span id="s2823">They -- I think fourth of May they moved some people from the small fortress into the hospitals in -- in Terezín.</span> <span id="s2824">And in April, the Swedish re -- Red Cross, the -- came with I think four buses, I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s2825">And they picked up all the Danes -- there were the Danish people.</span> <span id="s2826">And the Danes were very good if -- they took all their girlfriends with them, even though they were not Danish.</span> <span id="s2827">And sometimes they were not girlfriends, they just took somebody with them to get them out.</span> <span id="s2828">The SS didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2829">The Swedes were standing now and giving out cigarettes and chocolate, and the SS wanted to stop him, and he said -- they just showed him [indecipherable] the SS man decide.</span> <span id="s2830">So we knew something has happened, the SS wouldn’t interfere.</span> <span id="s2831">There was nobody who would interfere if you wanted to get in, or the SS didn’t say anything if you wanted to get on the bus.</span> <span id="s2832">Depended whether the Swedes will take you.</span> <span id="s2833">So some people got to Sweden that way, like a fren --</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: Did you -- did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: I didn’t want to leave, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Cause you’re waiting, you think your parents are coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: My parents and my brother will come, and that’s wa -- we -- I didn’t know where to go in Prague.</span> <span id="s2838">Where do we meet in big Prague?</span> <span id="s2839">They know I am here, they will come here.</span> <span id="s2840">That’s what we had, you come back to Terezín, I’ll wait for you.</span> <span id="s2841">So I didn’t want to leave any more, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: So who is doing the kitchens, I mean, there -- s -- you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: Women, all women --</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: Women.</span> <span id="s2845">Everyth --</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: -- and there were no -- very few men, there were some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: -- men.</span> <span id="s2848">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: -- there were some.</span> <span id="s2850">There were some in the agriculture too, but very few.</span> <span id="s2851">And when the Russians came from that time, it was the worst thing, because first of all they quarantined us right away, you couldn’t move freely any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Within the ghetto you couldn’t move freely --</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: No, within the ghetto, you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Oh, you could, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: -- but you couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s2856">We could, we were agriculture, again.</span> <span id="s2857">I could go in and out, and I did.</span> <span id="s2858">My sister-in-law, as soon as she heard that my brother -- someone -- I don’t know how the news traveled.</span> <span id="s2859">My sister-in-law found out that my brother is on the way to Prague, so I knew my brother survived, he’s going to Prague.</span> <span id="s2860">So she said, “I leave everything here.</span> <span id="s2861">Watch over our things, we need everything.</span> <span id="s2862">I’m going to Prague.”</span> <span id="s2863">She left.</span> <span id="s2864">My friend left too, for Prague.</span> <span id="s2865">And then she said, “I got an apartment back, if you want to come, come.”</span> <span id="s2866">So I decided with another friend, we will go, I want to see my brother.</span> <span id="s2867">Meanwhile, the people from the last transport came, who said that my mother didn’t survive, that she did make the right side.</span> <span id="s2868">I didn’t believe them.</span> <span id="s2869">In my mind I knew it’s true, but in my heart, no.</span> <span id="s2870">My mother is somewhere in a hospital, she -- sh -- I’m sure sh -- she said she’ll survive, she’ll keep her word.</span> <span id="s2871">And -- but I decided I want to see my brother.</span> <span id="s2872">I didn’t know anything about my father.</span> <span id="s2873">But le -- meanwhile, my brother spoke with Erna Haarth, and knew about my father, and he told me.</span> <span id="s2874">And was devastating for me, but you know, I was still hoping maybe it’s not true, maybe somebody else died, and not him, maybe.</span> <span id="s2875">He’s so sick, maybe he forgot his name, maybe -- you know, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Well, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: -- I wanted the impossible to come true.</span> <span id="s2878">So we met with my brother, I saw my brother and that was nice, and then I went back.</span> <span id="s2879">Because he said, “Go back, and you have to come only when you can take all your luggage, we need everything.</span> <span id="s2880">I have nothing what I have only.”</span> <span id="s2881">And he left few things when he went to Auschwitz, and I have few things from my father and mother, so I watched over it, and on the first of June, they announced that the first transport going to Prague, so I immediately put myself on the list, pack everything, took all the luggage I could in the train, and I went for Prague -- first of -- Prague, first of June, and I went -- I knew where my sister-in-law, my brother are.</span> <span id="s2882">Her father came back, so he got his own apartment back, so that’s where we met.</span> <span id="s2883">And sh -- and I brought the things, she didn’t let them come up, I had to leave it all in the courtyard, and they sprayed it till that we don’t bring the bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2884">Ba -- back to the bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2885">We thought that Theresienstadt is moving, and that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: Everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: -- from the bag -- bedbugs, millions of them.</span> <span id="s2888">So -- so that’s how I came home, with the first empty -- and I found out from the poems, and from some writing of his mother, she wrote a little diary what happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: Edgar’s -- Edgar’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">A: Edgar’s mother.</span> <span id="s2891">It’s hard to read because she wrote in pencil.</span> <span id="s2892">And she writes that first of June they came by train to Prague, so they were on the same train I was, but I didn’t know them, so I wouldn’t know who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s2894">Now, if I can interrupt your story for a moment, is there a story about bedbugs --</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">A: Yeah, there is a story that -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: -- and a candle that I’m supposed to ask you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: But from him, not from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A: As you know, we lived on the bunkbeds --</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: -- with Eva, and right at the window, the fourth window from the corner was our window.</span> <span id="s2902">And downstairs the men were working on the railroad day and night.</span> <span id="s2903">Now we had with Eva, a arrangement that if one is being bitten, she wakes the other up, then both of us look for them.</span> <span id="s2904">Now we didn’t have what to do with them, so we put water in that dish we were fus -- getting our food in, put water in it, and we were throwing them in to drown them.</span> <span id="s2905">But we had to do it always together, and we had to find them.</span> <span id="s2906">So we had a candle.</span> <span id="s2907">And in summer it was hot, we slept naked.</span> <span id="s2908">So we would light the candle and look for it, and Edgar said they had a good show downstairs, the boys did, who were working.</span> <span id="s2909">We didn’t care.</span> <span id="s2910">We couldn’t sleep, we had to catch the bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2911">So that’s the story he likes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2913">The candle had nothing to do with the bedbugs, but just had to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: No, we had to see where --</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">Q: -- see them -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">A: -- where to catch them.</span> <span id="s2917">How do you see them in the dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2919">So many people saw you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: And you couldn’t -- not too many.</span> <span id="s2921">You couldn’t put on the big light, because you would wake everybody.</span> <span id="s2922">So we would put on the candle and look for the bedbugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: So we can sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q: It’s fortunate you didn’t start a fire, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: We didn’t think of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: So you come back to Prague.</span> <span id="s2928">How long does it take you before you believe that your parents are not coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: I don’t know because I -- I wanted to believe for a long time, maybe s-six months.</span> <span id="s2930">We had to dict -- we had -- we wanted to get something back from my parents, so we went to the insurance company because they had life insurance.</span> <span id="s2931">We went to the firm whether my father wouldn -- get something from like pension or something that he paid, but of course, we were over 21, so there was nothing we could get.</span> <span id="s2932">And the -- the insurance company wanted death certificate.</span> <span id="s2933">We couldn’t explain to them we don’t have death certificates, they died in a camp.</span> <span id="s2934">So we had to go to the court and declare them deceased, and that took six months.</span> <span id="s2935">And then we got o-officially death certificate.</span> <span id="s2936">And I don’t know whether that made me believe.</span> <span id="s2937">I don’t think I wanted ever to believe that they are dead.</span> <span id="s2938">And then we went to the insurance company, and then they told us, well the Germans took their life insurances and everything.</span> <span id="s2939">It’s in Germany.</span> <span id="s2940">So we wrote to Germany nec -- to the company, and they said give us proof.</span> <span id="s2941">They wouldn’t give us the proof, and they didn’t believe us, so that was lost.</span> <span id="s2942">I don’t know when I stopped believing, when I knew they are gone.</span> <span id="s2943">I didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s2944">I knew that.</span> <span id="s2945">I -- I saw -- I don’t know whether I even could have taken the suffering I saw in the other people and the state they were in, imagining that my father would look like that.</span> <span id="s2946">So I didn’t wish that on them either.</span> <span id="s2947">I just wanted them to be alive, and the way they were before.</span> <span id="s2948">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: You wanted to move from one period of time, back to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: Back to whatever, but nothing I ve -- I -- they wouldn’t give me our apartment back because my brother lived with his wife there, and I was a only person, the apartment was so -- too big, so I didn’t get an apartment, I had no right for an apartment as a single person, so I had to find a room somewhere, and I had to find a job.</span> <span id="s2951">And I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2952">And luckily a friend of mine send me to the trade unions that they are looking for somebody.</span> <span id="s2953">I don’t know why they took me, because I was supposed to work as a secretary and I never -- I -- meaning -- I say I never saw, I saw a typewriter, but I never worked on a typewriter.</span> <span id="s2954">But they took me and gave me chance to learn.</span> <span id="s2955">And I was lucky to have a job, and when I had a job, I rented a room, and that’s how I started, with nothing.</span> <span id="s2956">But I still, you know, in back of my mind, some miracle will happen, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: -- in my -- in my head I knew it is impossible.</span> <span id="s2959">I went every day to the -- there was a office of political prisoners, which we were considered by that time, political prisoners, and they published every day a new list whom they found in some hospitals, or in Germany, survivors.</span> <span id="s2960">And I would go there every day to look for the names, whether my parent’s names appear there.</span> <span id="s2961">I was searching.</span> <span id="s2962">I went to Red Cross, whether they have some people that, you know, we think maybe they just lost the memory and don’t remember where they are from, or who they are, whether that exists, you know?</span> <span id="s2963">There were some people in shw -- Sweden, I wanted to know whether they are -- whether the Red Cross there knows about them.</span> <span id="s2964">But there was no -- no way that there -- could survive in a -- when people were witnesses that -- not the -- exactly to it, but witnesses to what happened, and they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: Was your brother like you, or did he believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: He -- he believed they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: He -- he knew, but he had his wife, and my si -- nephew was born September ’46, he -- he went back to school.</span> <span id="s2969">That’s why he told me, “I can’t help you, I am student, I don’t have money.”</span> <span id="s2970">He lived with his father-in-law and his wife and -- and the son.</span> <span id="s2971">And he had a new life, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2972">Not -- no -- very fe -- all my friends that we were the groups, few girls came, no boys.</span> <span id="s2973">None of my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: So Honza is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: -- the friends I knew -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">Q: Honza didn’t come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: No, no, none of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: None of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">A: None of my brother’s friends, none of my friends, none of the boys I knew survived.</span> <span id="s2980">Of one friend, one brother, who lives in Australia, who was like four years younger.</span> <span id="s2981">His brother was ou -- my brother’s friend.</span> <span id="s2982">So we were in a group.</span> <span id="s2983">But from the groups we were bef -- before the -- before Terezín, none of my male friends, if you put it that way, that were in a group, not all the boyfriend, came back.</span> <span id="s2984">Only the ones i -- Eva is -- few of the girls, and the rest were the girls we lived through the whole -- until the end, because they were in agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">Q: So you’re 22 or 23, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">A: In ’45, I was 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">Q: -- 19 [indecipherable] 22.</span> <span id="s2988">’46 you’re 23.</span> <span id="s2989">And you not only don’t have your parents, your whole world has collap -- essentially has collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2991">Yeah, and don’t forget, I -- my aunt, whom I loved very dearly is gone.</span> <span id="s2992">My uncle, my three cousins.</span> <span id="s2993">My mother had an extensive family with whom we were very, very close.</span> <span id="s2994">One of her cousins which -- whom I knew very well, survived in Bratislava, and two of them -- so I was in touch with them.</span> <span id="s2995">And her sons, I was very close, which are like second cousins already.</span> <span id="s2996">One survived in England.</span> <span id="s2997">In ’47 I went to visit him, we are still in touch.</span> <span id="s2998">That was the whole family that survived, but the family that was living in -- near Votice where we went visit -- when we went visiting my grandma, my mother’s cousin would call all the cousins and her aunt, and we would have big dinner, and th -- it was like a huge family, even though they were mother’s cousins, they were not -- you know, ki -- my close family, but we were very close, and I loved them like an -- all were gone.</span> <span id="s2999">Everybody there was gone from her family.</span> <span id="s3000">Her brother, the brother’s family, the three children and his wife.</span> <span id="s3001">The -- everybody was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: How difficult was it for you with your -- with your brother, with whom you were close in a certain way, but now he’s moving in another direction, and you don’t know where to move?</span> <span id="s3003">You -- your -- i-is that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: I think I suffered, but I knew that I have to do what he says.</span> <span id="s3005">I can’t hang on him.</span> <span id="s3006">I knew I would be dead weight if -- in that case, and that I have -- I have to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">Q: So does in some way your having been in Terezín -- I -- I hate to put it like this, but in some way a help to you because it was the first time in your life you were alone, before anything bad happens.</span> <span id="s3008">So you learn that you can cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">A: Yes, yes, it helped me, it made me different.</span> <span id="s3010">It made me aware of different life than just protected by my parents, and I think it helped me to f -- put my feet down on the ground in ’45, because that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s3011">I -- today I think it was difficult too, because I have nobody to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: Nobody wanted to listen to us.</span> <span id="s3014">With my friends I could, and we were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s3015">But nobody want -- I couldn’t went -- I couldn’t talk to my brother, he wouldn’t listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">Q: He wouldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">A: No.</span> <span id="s3018">He looked only forward, my brother.</span> <span id="s3019">He wouldn’t listen what -- just forget what happened.</span> <span id="s3020">You -- you have to look forward.</span> <span id="s3021">So you know today we know that sometimes people need to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: I didn’t know it that time, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: Well, you knew in some way, because you wanted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: I think so, but I didn’t know -- have a person that I would want to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: You didn’t find someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: No.</span> <span id="s3028">Eva was in the sa -- you know, my friends went through the same with me, but most of my friends had family.</span> <span id="s3029">Had mothers.</span> <span id="s3030">Eva had her mother, my other friend had her mother.</span> <span id="s3031">Most of them.</span> <span id="s3032">One had mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: And Mama Dittel never said do you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3035">They wanted to forget, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: Everybody wanted to forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: Mama Dittel went through Auschwitz, she didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s3038">We were visiting, we were very close, I was very close with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">Q: So w -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">A: But not close enough to have a shelter there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: I had no shelter, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: You had no shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: Until 1948.</span> <span id="s3045">I was moving from room to room because somebody got married, because a friend took me in and the brother married, they needed the space.</span> <span id="s3046">I pick up my trunk and I move.</span> <span id="s3047">In 1948 my friend brother had a little studio apartment.</span> <span id="s3048">You had to have a permit from the town, you had to get -- it’s -- it was very complicated to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s3049">But he we -- he was running in front of -- away from the Communists, and she said move int -- into his apartment and then you will have it.</span> <span id="s3050">So I did, and that’s the fir -- and from work they helped me to get the apartment, and I had roof over my head permanent, that nobody can tell me I’m getting married, you have to move out, or you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s3051">I moved from place to place during the three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">Q: So for those -- those years, ‘45 to ‘48, you don’t have a permanent place at all.</span> <span id="s3053">You always were thinking --</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: Any time I cou -- can be asked to move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">Q: And all that time you’re working as a secretary?</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: So you learned how --</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: From -- from auba -- August ’45.</span> <span id="s3059">I had to, I had no money.</span> <span id="s3060">I had to take the job as soon as it appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q: And you learned how to type, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A: I learned how to type, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q: Were you good?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: I don’t know, they kept me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: They kept you, I guess you were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: I worked here 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3069">In one job as Administrative Secretary, so I think I did okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: Obviously, very good.</span> <span id="s3071">And you married -- you met Edgar in ’46, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">A: Well, we met and separated, and he went to -- to Switzerland and I went to England because I wanted that -- I wanted to learn better English, and I spent about six weeks, ’47, in England, and I wanted to stay in England.</span> <span id="s3073">And they offered me you could stay as domestic.</span> <span id="s3074">Well, when I wrote that to my brother he exploded.</span> <span id="s3075">“You didn’t survive the war to be a maid.</span> <span id="s3076">You have a job here.</span> <span id="s3077">We are the only family and you are tearing it apart.”</span> <span id="s3078">So I returned.</span> <span id="s3079">You can go any time you want to England.</span> <span id="s3080">And I returned because -- and then the Communists came and I couldn’t go --</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: And you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s3082">And then you re-met Edgar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: Edgar, in ’48, when he came back from [indecipherable] and suddenly appeared in my office.</span> <span id="s3084">Had no idea why we didn’t hear for year -- for the two years he was away we didn’t hear from him cha --</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: For two years you were separated, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: A year and something, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3088">And he found you, cause he knew where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: I was still working, he knew where I was working --</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: Uh-huh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: -- so he went to look up for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3093">And you took up again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: We started to go out again, and by this time he’s a -- he was sophisticated, he was traveled in the world, and he was good looking, and I got interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3096">More than you were before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: I wasn’t interested before because first of all my friend was interested in him, and she invited him, and I didn’t want to take him away from her.</span> <span id="s3098">I didn’t know what the arrangement is, I didn’t know he was not interested, or interested in me more, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3099">I just didn’t feel it’s right.</span> <span id="s3100">She introduced us, but she told me she is interested in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: But she -- she has a f -- she married, but she -- we planned together to run away with my friend, the one that lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s3103">By that time she got back the business -- she and her sister survived, so sh -- they got the -- back the business of her father.</span> <span id="s3104">And she had some money, and to get illegally across the border that time, what she found was like 10,000 dol -- crowns, not dollar.</span> <span id="s3105">And she did it, and I was visiting my brother at that time, but even if I were in Prague I couldn’t go, I didn’t have the 10,000.</span> <span id="s3106">So she left illegally in ’48, in May.</span> <span id="s3107">And so after she left, and Edgar came back, I had no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3109">You could see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: She was gone --</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">A: -- she was here in United States already.</span> <span id="s3113">And she had a boyfriend, and married an American soldier that was in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s3114">So we are very close, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">Q: And how soon after you -- you start seeing ed -- and it’s Edgar Krasa, in case anybody doesn’t realize --</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: Pretty soon I got interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: Interested --</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">A: Very pretty soon, he didn’t know it that I made up my mind.</span> <span id="s3119">That’s it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: -- that’s the right person.</span> <span id="s3122">The first time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">Q: And how soon after you decided were you willing to meet his parents?</span> <span id="s3124">Or did you meet him s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: He asked very fast about that, that was one thing that I didn’t want, I thought it’s too serious the first time when he started right away we go to visit my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">A: But Edgar took it as a visit.</span> <span id="s3128">I came there with him, I agreed to it because I was already interested in him.</span> <span id="s3129">And the mother’s -- he said, “I want you to meet my girlfriend,” new girlfriend, whatever he said.</span> <span id="s3130">And her mother -- my mother-in-law said, “Another one?”</span> <span id="s3131">Like what -- she shouldn’t think she’s the only one.</span> <span id="s3132">And his father looks me over, I was very skinny that time, and says, “What do you see in her?</span> <span id="s3133">Nothing front, nothing back.”</span> <span id="s3134">So that was their greeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: This is the introduction.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: But they were, you know, I have not seen a family together that all -- everybody, like two parents and the son.</span> <span id="s3137">I -- I thought it was something marvelous to be invited to dinner there, and -- and share.</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">A: And Edgar was a great son, he did not -- he would -- Mother would go with us to every concert, which I sometimes didn’t like, he doesn’t even know it.</span> <span id="s3140">Cause I wanted to be all alone with him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">A: And we had to go every Sunday to visit his parents and play cards with them, you know, he was that kind of a son.</span> <span id="s3143">He wouldn’t leave them even -- he would bring the company there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: And I liked it because it was family.</span> <span id="s3146">There was something tangible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: And it was a kind of devotion you understood --</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: -- because you -- you had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: I think I respected it.</span> <span id="s3151">I respected it because I saw it at home, too.</span> <span id="s3152">My father and my mother were really dedicated to his parents.</span> <span id="s3153">My mother didn’t have her parents any more.</span> <span id="s3154">My mother was great with her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and -- and there was great respect, and we had to respect the grandparents very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: You described yourself as feeling very guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">A: Yeah, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: And you still feel guilty?</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: Do you really blame yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: No, but all the girls that went, like Eva with her mother, and the other Eva that I knew, saved their mothers because their mothers had a reason to try to be together, would try to get to the other side.</span> <span id="s3161">That happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: But it didn’t always happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s3164">I only looked at when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">Q: When it happened, and blamed yourself for not being able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3167">I couldn’t do anything for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: That was hopeless.</span> <span id="s3170">And wouldn’t be even near him, because men were immediately separated, which we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3171">But after knowing everything in ’45, I felt if I was there, maybe I could have sav -- everybody said it’s ridiculous, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">Q: You know it intellectually.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">Q: But not -- not in your heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">A: No.</span> <span id="s3176">Cause I really tried hard, and it didn’t happen, so maybe I didn’t try hard enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">Q: Is this your punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3179">I don’t know, but I was tied to my -- you know, there are -- my brother was more independent than I was.</span> <span id="s3180">Since he was a boy, he was more inden -- independent.</span> <span id="s3181">And my kids, thanks to Edgar were independent.</span> <span id="s3182">I wouldn’t have let them be independent.</span> <span id="s3183">So maybe that’s -- I wasn’t -- I -- I tell you, I wasn’t mature for being alone in the world and do for myself.</span> <span id="s3184">Some -- Edgar was.</span> <span id="s3185">He was the one who fed his parents since he was 14.</span> <span id="s3186">Sup -- Supported this parents.</span> <span id="s3187">And he was very easy to start anywhere else life.</span> <span id="s3188">For me there -- every time it was difficult.</span> <span id="s3189">Whether it was Israel, or it was United States.</span> <span id="s3190">And so I am not so courageous like he is.</span> <span id="s3191">I needed somewhere to come back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">Q: I know there’s a -- a lot more to your story after the war, it’s very complicated, but I -- we’ll have to do a lot of that at another time, but a lot of people think that when the word liberation is used, like [indecipherable] right, that everything is fine.</span> <span id="s3195">And it’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">A: We thought so too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">Q: You thought it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">A: We thought so too.</span> <span id="s3199">But our liberation was, you go back home, I go back to school and everything will be normal.</span> <span id="s3200">And of course it wasn’t, it cannot be normal.</span> <span id="s3201">And my sister-in-law who got the apartment back wasn’t normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">A: She got interrupted her schooling even earlier than I did.</span> <span id="s3204">They did offer you -- they give you a paper that you finished school, but what’s the use, that education was missing anyhow.</span> <span id="s3205">So you thought liberation means back to where you were before the war.</span> <span id="s3206">And like when you saw, if you go back to your hometown, it’s not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">A: We didn’t -- we didn’t know that, or we didn’t want to know it, and didn’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3210">That was -- that was the fantasy while you were in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: But it’s a very difficult adjustment, if one ever fully adjusts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: Do you think you adjusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: I think once I met Edgar, and we started new life, and then really, I think that was for me good life.</span> <span id="s3216">That was what --</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: -- I wanted from the beginning.</span> <span id="s3219">I didn’t want a career, I wanted a family.</span> <span id="s3220">So I worked because I have to support myself.</span> <span id="s3221">I didn’t think of working myself up or something, that wasn’t important.</span> <span id="s3222">Important was to have family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: So my brother said -- I said, if I don’t have a kid by -- or something by 25, I’m going to do it without the husband.</span> <span id="s3225">My mother, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">A: Ahead of the time.</span> <span id="s3228">So my brother joked that, “I think somebody will sacrifice himself, I put an ad in the newspaper.”</span> <span id="s3229">I was determined to have it one way or the other.</span> <span id="s3230">I was determined.</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">A: I wanted a family, but if I can’t have it, I’ll make my own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">Q: And what was it -- what was it about having a family.</span> <span id="s3234">Was it reconstituting what you had before and recreating it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: Yeah, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">Q: Is that what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">Q: So that you could make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: I needed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">A: You know, some people are [indecipherable] they don’t even want a partner or anything, because it -- it’s -- you have to adjust to a partner, too, and all that, so they don’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s3244">But for me that was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: You said you mainly had bad dreams or nightmares after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: After -- after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: Did that continue for many years?</span> <span id="s3248">Does it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: -- even now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: No, I don’t think so any more, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: And the bad dreams are --</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">A: Even in Israel -- in Israel I was dreaming we are in Prague, want to get out, and can’t, and Edgar is in Israel, how will we get together.</span> <span id="s3254">Things being separated, so I had dreams about that.</span> <span id="s3255">But I think that stopped already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Q: And did you ever have nightmares about Terezín, that you were back in Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3260">And can’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: And you can’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">A: Always this can’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">A: Or after we ran away, that I am back in Czechoslovakia and can’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">A: That -- that did happen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">Q: And I’m certain you’ve dreamt about your parents.</span> <span id="s3268">Or I shouldn’t be so certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: I dreamt of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">Q: I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">A: -- yes, I dreamt that I found them in a hospital in Poland.</span> <span id="s3272">I -- I dreamt that they came su-suddenly back.</span> <span id="s3273">I wouldn’t even know how they would find me, because we didn’t have a common address --</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">A: -- or anything where to find me, but you don’t think about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">A: And till today when I think about my parents, I see them the way they were in their 50’s.</span> <span id="s3278">I have no idea how they would age.</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">Q: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s3280">When did you start talk -- who did you find, when you found someone to talk about what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">A: Nobody until Edgar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">Q: Nobody until Edgar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3283">A: Until he wanted to know what I did, or something, no.</span> <span id="s3284">And until the 90’s, nobody wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s3285">People I worked with for 25, didn’t even know I was in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">Q: Did they know you had come from Israel, from th --</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">Q: And from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: But they never said, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: They were young people that were born here and they didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: But you were in United States when the film, “The Holocaust” was on television.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: Well then that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">Q: 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">A: That was in ’78?</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: I think that’s when people started to get so in -- I thought it was in 80 - something, so I thought that’s when people start to be interested.</span> <span id="s3298">And that’s when they started to ask questions, yes, after that movie.</span> <span id="s3299">That was a serial, and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: -- that -- that was anyhow fiction, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">Q: Yes, it was fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">A: -- not a true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">A: I saw it, and I thought, that isn’t true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: But it worked, because a lot of people started talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3311">And was it helpful then, or was it too late?</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">A: I don’t know, but I think what happened to us is that we found out that being quiet is harmful, people should know that as we are dying out, there are coming more and more people that will say it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">A: It’s fiction, it’s imagination.</span> <span id="s3315">And in memory of all those that died, that it should be known and so I can talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">Q: But you don’t talk in schools, am I correct?</span> <span id="s3317">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">A: No, because I am not a public speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">A: I am very conscious of my accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">Q: It’s a beautiful accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: It’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: When I heard myself on the tape the first time, I said, I sound like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: No you don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: On the tape I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s3328">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: And I get embarrassed in front of all people.</span> <span id="s3330">I -- you know, this is fine, I can do this any time.</span> <span id="s3331">And besides, I already feel I know you, since yesterday and feel very comfortable with all of you here.</span> <span id="s3332">But total strangers, I -- I have difficulty, and Edgar can do it with a thousand people, he doesn’t mind, and he will joke, and he’s witty, I am not.</span> <span id="s3333">I can’t joke about it.</span> <span id="s3334">When he gets embarrassed he jokes more.</span> <span id="s3335">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">Q: And you don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">A: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">Q: You -- you get very shy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3340">I don’t -- besi -- and again, I don’t have what to tell in the schools, it’s not such a interesting story like his.</span> <span id="s3341">Comes back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">Q: Well, I guess that’s in the eye of the beholder, what’s interesting or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">A: I know, but you know, especially the way Terezín is pictured now as a paradise for the Jews.</span> <span id="s3344">So -- what should I tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: It wasn’t a paradise for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">Q: Or for anyone else there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">A: For anyone.</span> <span id="s3349">And that’s where I have the difficulty, take people back there, because the psychological, the fright when it came transport is going, new transport is collecting.</span> <span id="s3350">Who is going to go, which friend is going to be in it?</span> <span id="s3351">Will I be in it?</span> <span id="s3352">Where is it going?</span> <span id="s3353">That -- that psychological -- that cloud was over you all the time.</span> <span id="s3354">All those years, up to the end we didn’t know when a transport is going, until the Red Cross came.</span> <span id="s3355">Because one thing we were afraid of all that, what will the end be like?</span> <span id="s3356">Will they shoot us all?</span> <span id="s3357">Now we are such a small group here, they have it much easier.</span> <span id="s3358">Will they let us survive?</span> <span id="s3359">And when we heard the stories that they did not let the people survive, the last day they were shooting them, I don’t think they would -- if they have time would have not be willing to do it to Terezín, too.</span> <span id="s3360">So that was -- we were always afraid of the end, even though we were in Terezín, the end was for us a mystery.</span> <span id="s3361">And we thought in masses is strength, that they can’t kill 50,000 people, but we learned that they could, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">Q: Let me just ask you one -- I’ll ask you two more questions.</span> <span id="s3363">One has to do with the -- the world in which you live now, that -- that isn’t the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3364">When you hear the news about genocides in various countries, in Rwanda in ’94, in Bosnia, in Cambodia --</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">A: You are saying it’s going on again --</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">Q: Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">A: -- and it’s everywhere, and still in the world.</span> <span id="s3368">And I feel that humans do it to themselves.</span> <span id="s3369">You know, I couldn’t believe in God afterwards, because my mother was such a angel, and my father helping everybody, how could they be killed?</span> <span id="s3370">And the rabbi, I don’t even know his name, I don’t know where he came from, I met him somewhere where I was.</span> <span id="s3371">And I told him I don’t believe because He let my parents be killed, and who were so good.</span> <span id="s3372">And he said to me, “What do you think God looks like?</span> <span id="s3373">Do you think he’s there like a puppeteer, moving his finger and saying this one die, this one live?</span> <span id="s3374">God gave humans brain.</span> <span id="s3375">Humans are doing this to humans.</span> <span id="s3376">He’s not guilty, he’s trying to make you a better human.</span> <span id="s3377">You believe in Him, you believe in good.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Q: You believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">A: I think humans that -- are doing it to themselves.</span> <span id="s3380">I don’t think that -- I think it’s in -- it’s -- they are animals.</span> <span id="s3381">If a man can kill a little baby and go home and hug his own baby, how can he do it?</span> <span id="s3382">And that’s what the SS did.</span> <span id="s3383">So they are not humans to me, they are just animals.</span> <span id="s3384">And I can’t even treat animals badly, because they have feelings and pain; and they could, so they are worse than animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">Q: So has the world improved?</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">A: No, they are still doing it.</span> <span id="s3387">They are doing it still all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">Q: So this has to be a disappointment to you, you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: It is, but I don’t know how to repair it, I’m not that clever.</span> <span id="s3390">Education, education, but what happened in Israel?</span> <span id="s3391">The kids are educated to hate each other, the kids are educated to fight, th -- th -- it’s -- they get hatred with their mother’s milk.</span> <span id="s3392">And it won’t be good until they change that.</span> <span id="s3393">And I don’t think it will be for our generation to see.</span> <span id="s3394">Maybe these terrible atrocities and terrible wars can change the generation of my grandchildren, that they get some sense, and say violence doesn’t pay, and shouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s3395">Our generation wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">Q: We haven’t learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">Q: We haven’t learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s3399">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">Q: Is there anything you’d like to say that I haven’t asked you about, or you’d like to say anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">A: No, I don’t think so, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much --</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">Q: -- for your honesty and your being willing to talk about what I know is really difficult for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">A: Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">A: There are parts of -- even during the war when we were happy.</span> <span id="s3408">I cherish, I think for life, all the friendships I made there, and we are still writing, even if we can’t see each other, we are all over the world.</span> <span id="s3409">This -- and I think those friendships, and those -- that closeness cannot be replaced, and cannot be achieved later.</span> <span id="s3410">The circumstances were such that you became close, and that’s a great feeling to have such friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3412">Well thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">A: This is my grandfather, Gustav Krasa, who died sometime in 1923, so I have really never met him.</span> <span id="s3416">That’s my mother’s father.</span> <span id="s3417">She was a born Krasa.</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">A: This is my grandmother, Johanna, born strassa -- Krasa, who died much earlier, in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">A: This is my father Oskar Fuchs, and my mother, ro -- Rosa Fuchs, and my brother, their firstborn, Yearje, which means George.</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">A: This photo is again my brother, and me.</span> <span id="s3424">A professional picture by a photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">Q: About what year, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">A: I think I was about three here, maybe two and a half, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">Q: And this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">A: This one is again me and my brother, I think about two years older, maybe four I am here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">A: This is my mother, Rosele, and me and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: And here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">A: My brother and me.</span> <span id="s3433">I have to be about six to seven because I got my new teeth, front teeth.</span> <span id="s3434">So I would judge first or second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: And this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: This one is going to first grade.</span> <span id="s3437">We did not have kindergarten in our times like here.</span> <span id="s3438">I was very proud to get the school bag, and I wanted a picture with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">Q: Doesn’t look like your brother was quite so happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">A: My brother was older, he was already being in third grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: And here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">A: That’s my brother in -- going to first grade.</span> <span id="s3443">And because he had the picture with his school bag, I wanted it too, when I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">A: This is me, but I’m not sure whether that’s fifth grade, or -- probably before going to gimnasium or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">A: This is around 1940, when we started to wear stars.</span> <span id="s3448">Both my friend and me went to get pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">A: This is my friend, Ollie Dupe, who perished with the 5,000 Czech Jews on March seventh, 1944, in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">Q: And this was the
