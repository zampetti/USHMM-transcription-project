Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">24:26 A. I was born July 11, 1934,in Ghota (ph) Germany in the providence of Turingen to Ruth and Hans Rehbock.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q.</span> <span id="s28">What do you remember about Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A. Not much first hand.</span> <span id="s30">We left in 1938, I was four years old.</span> <span id="s31">Up till then was typical of a normal childhood.</span> <span id="s32">I refreshed what I've been told when I went back to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q.</span> <span id="s34">You went to England after Germany.</span> <span id="s35">What do you remember about</span></p> <p><span id="s36">there?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A. England was only a stop off point before America.</span> <span id="s38">Just time before getting on a boat.</span> <span id="s39">The early years in Europe I've only talked about with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q.</span> <span id="s41">You were the son of German Jews in the U.S. - How did you feel and when did your parents start talking to you about their</span></p> <p><span id="s42">experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">25:13 A.</span> <span id="s44">There was never anything hidden, but not a lot dead.</span> <span id="s45">I always knew I had been born in Germany and many family members were lost.</span> <span id="s46">I never really asked for details until later on.</span> <span id="s47">I was specifically told by my parents that now we were going to be Americans.</span> <span id="s48">After arriving here we went to Chicago and I was sent to cousins while my parents were working so I could learn English.</span> <span id="s49">My parents stopped speaking German as soon as they got off the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">It was as if the memories were so bitter they wanted to break off any remembrance of the past.</span> <span id="s51">The memories were never forgotten but not initially talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q.</span> <span id="s53">Did you feel any different about yourself in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A.</span> <span id="s55">In the 40s here in Chicago there were other immigrant children.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">There were 2 other boys whose parents had come from Germany in the thirties.</span> <span id="s57">We always prided ourselves that we were always the best students in the class.</span> <span id="s58">It was something I thought about - that maybe because we all had to start over again or because Jewish children in Germany couldn't go to school we were better students.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">We were always accepted, not singled out because we were Jewish (there were other Jewish kids in the school) and none of us had accents.</span> <span id="s60">I never felt different at home or school.</span> <span id="s61">I guess I brought some of what was good from the old world.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">27:55 Q. Were you ever ashamed your parents having an accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A. I never felt ashamed.....</span></p> <p><span id="s64">TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A.</span> <span id="s66">It never bothered me that they had an accent.</span> <span id="s67">Everyone always felt welcomed at my house.</span> <span id="s68">Because my parents worked long hours the children that came to the house saw only my Grandmother.</span> <span id="s69">A lot of the social life of the family was centered around the cousins.</span> <span id="s70">I went there everyday for lunch hour and after school went home.</span> <span id="s71">Then there was Hebrew school and Boy Scouts which my father was involved in.</span> <span id="s72">So, any differences never stopped me from doing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">2:30 Q.</span> <span id="s74">Did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A. Yes, one of my friends was Japanese-American.</span> <span id="s76">Other friends were through the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s77">Most of my best friends were Jewish now that I think about it because I saw them in Hebrew school, Boy Scouts and Sunday School.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q.</span> <span id="s79">How did you feel when you heard what was going on in Germany and when the survivors started telling their stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A.</span> <span id="s81">As a child I felt detached.</span> <span id="s82">I felt I had been there and my parents had, but I had gotten out and my family was in tact the way I knew it.</span> <span id="s83">Only later did I realize that I was one of those survivors.</span> <span id="s84">I didn't relate to the displaced persons from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">4:94 Q.</span> <span id="s86">When did you first relate your experiences in Europe to</span></p> <p><span id="s87">yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A. Probably not in any detailed way until the Holocaust film was on</span></p> <p><span id="s89">TV.</span> <span id="s90">Even then it was through the minds of my children and not through my experiences.</span> <span id="s91">The next morning my son asked some questions that I couldn't answer.</span> <span id="s92">They asked my parents the questions and I found out all that had happened and I could relate to what I had gone through to what had happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s93">This was just in the last few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q.</span> <span id="s95">Did you ever go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A.</span> <span id="s97">Last summer my wife and I went to the town in which I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">We had mixed feelings about what we'd find and how we'd feel.</span> <span id="s99">My mother was not supportive of my wanting to go back.</span> <span id="s100">But she wrote letters to the non-Jewish people who helped members of my family and after she heard back and then she really got into what the experience would be like.</span> <span id="s101">I tried to get some physical descriptions of what to possibly expect of the town.</span> <span id="s102">She drew me a map of where my relatives and buildings should be.</span> <span id="s103">I took that with me and called Frankfurt to talk with the daughter of the people my mother wrote to.</span> <span id="s104">They picked us up and we talked about their experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s105">Her father had hidden some people in the house and she said how she feared every night that her father might be caught.</span> <span id="s106">We went to Ghota (ph) the next day.</span> <span id="s107">I tried to think back to what it was like when I was a child and had some strange feelings.</span> <span id="s108">The town had not been bombed and things were as my mother described them.</span> <span id="s109">We had pictures of the places there and as we took pictures it seemed to be the same scene all over again.</span> <span id="s110">As we went through the town and found all my mother had described we were reliving the scenes from my childhood.</span> <span id="s111">There were some East German soldiers walking down the street and I remembered stories my mother had told me about having to salute the soldiers in the 30s and I had the feeling that this was what it was like.</span> <span id="s112">That was my first emotional tying together of being a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">12:64 I heard about my mother when she was a little girl and we got caught up in what happened in the town after we had left in '38.</span> <span id="s114">We were in the courtyard of my grandfather's house in which I had played as a child.</span> <span id="s115">I recognized it and we took notice of what my mother had said about it.</span> <span id="s116">There were signs of life all around and I looked up and saw a clock and a bell.</span> <span id="s117">I had never heard about them in the stories.</span> <span id="s118">We took a picture of them.</span> <span id="s119">I had kept asking our guide if things would have been there when I was there.</span> <span id="s120">I was caught up in the details.</span> <span id="s121">We eventually got back to West Germany and got a phone call from my mother I said, "Mother you never told us about the clock and the bell."</span> <span id="s122">I heard her voice crack and I realized I had told her about something she had never told me</span></p> <p><span id="s123">about.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">15:49 Q.</span> <span id="s125">Did you have any encounters with Germans that said I remember your family but I could not do anything to help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A.</span> <span id="s127">While there our contacts were with the family that had close contacts with the family.</span> <span id="s128">We saw a woman who remembered much about the family and details about the past in the 20s and 30s.</span> <span id="s129">She reflected on my aunt who had been in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s130">But we never talked to her or anyone about what they did or could have done.</span> <span id="s131">Except in each case they talked about what Mr. Grohl (ph) had done because it was so positive and in jeopardy of his own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Total strangers that we talked to (they needed to be old enough to remember) turned up a lady and she remembered my grandfather and how he helped out people in the town.</span> <span id="s133">This gave us a warm feeling because this was how we remembered my grandfather.</span> <span id="s134">Everyone there had only nice things to say.</span> <span id="s135">We didn't get political.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">There was an awareness of the today in Germany.</span> <span id="s137">The husband of the woman who took us around worked in East Germany and could not associate with us because we were Westerners.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">18:42 Q.</span> <span id="s139">What would you say to the people in the future to prevent</span></p> <p><span id="s140">this happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A. My deep feeling is that we cannot forget and cannot allow our children to not understand fully what happened - not just to the Jews of Germany but to the Jews of Europe - and everyone involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">We also need to remember the things that happened after the war to those that survived it.</span> <span id="s143">We need to teach Jew and non-Jew that these were real experiences.</span> <span id="s144">There needs to be education as to how it happened.</span> <span id="s145">This cannot be allowed to be forgotten - ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">.</span> <span id="s147">END.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0060 PAGE 4</span></p></body></html>
