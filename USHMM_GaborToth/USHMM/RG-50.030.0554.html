half.</span> <span id="s60">And she – she remember, you know, the wealth and all the happiness pre – pre-war.</span> <span id="s61">So affect her much more than a – than affects me, because I was un – no conscience about my – my own existence</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: [indecipherable] I did.</span> <span id="s64">On – on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little bit more, I don’t know, 19 – 1942, when the first transport of people have been taken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that – in that transport went my family; my – my – my parent – my – o-on both sides, for the exception of the – my – my mother’s brother, one of them have been killed.</span> <span id="s65">I don’t know if that’s by an accident or what, he be – was a fire on the roof in – in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s66">He went up to the roof, but never came back.</span> <span id="s67">He was 25.</span> <span id="s68">His name was Ignatius.</span> <span id="s69">And the youngest brother my – of my mother’s, Henry.</span> <span id="s70">He was 18 and he – he took poison, he killed himself.</span> <span id="s71">But he was in the underground, the organization, had been caught, so in order to avoid, you know, further consequences, he did that.</span> <span id="s72">I – Miriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the – to the extermination camp with my – with my grandmother, who at that time was fift – 52 years old.</span> <span id="s73">And my mother was a widow on the age – age of 30.</span> <span id="s74">30?</span> <span id="s75">Thir – 31 - 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So, after the war started, what ha – what had happened to your family?</span> <span id="s77">Did they try to escape Warsaw, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, when my mother – my mother – my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America, because a cous – my ma – my – my – my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well.</span> <span id="s79">So sa – always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir – in the late 30s.</span> <span id="s80">But my – my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa – the business was going well, and you know.</span> <span id="s81">They thought the war – nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic.</span> <span id="s82">So they never fled away.</span> <span id="s83">And once was the war start, like everybody else, we – we have to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s84">And the reason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn’t live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family.</span> <span id="s85">And me – my – my father, the older men of the family, he – he was there with – with the rest when they close and they ah – they emptied the building and took everybody away.</span> <span id="s86">So, my mom was – when she said well – she wa – she didn’t – she didn’t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working camps, that was for extermination.</span> <span id="s87">So she says, I am not waiting here for – for death, I am – I am running away.</span> <span id="s88">If I will be caught on the – on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life.</span> <span id="s89">So she – you know, was corruption, like everywhere else.</span> <span id="s90">So she – she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray – Aryan documents on the other side.</span> <span id="s91">They – they didn’t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo.</span> <span id="s92">So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she – sh-she – es – expect to take.</span> <span id="s93">So she was very am – you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing the document.</span> <span id="s94">And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming.</span> <span id="s95">So from the – from the back of the building we run away, just in time.</span> <span id="s96">So s – as – close calls like this, we had a couple of them.</span> <span id="s97">Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the war, where the – the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians.</span> <span id="s98">So, in order to get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri – also risking a life.</span> <span id="s99">But coming back to those times – so we – we left – we left the ghetto, and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south – on – a – a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wisła river.</span> <span id="s100">And so sh – in order to run from Warsaw, she went there with us.</span> <span id="s101">And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is noticeable immediately.</span> <span id="s102">So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s103">And of course those – those voyages cost money, and we – we didn’t have too man – too much of it.</span> <span id="s104">So shortly after bri – getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish.</span> <span id="s105">And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand.</span> <span id="s106">It’s a big risk.</span> <span id="s107">But if you can’t, I have no one to call any more, you know.</span> <span id="s108">So – and she, she did so.</span> <span id="s109">She said, wait.</span> <span id="s110">She hold us all the day there until the fire – the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself.</span> <span id="s111">And he comes convince by her – his wife, to help us.</span> <span id="s112">And they advise – the plan when he – what he comes with was the following.</span> <span id="s113">My sister, she was a blonde with blue eyes, that’s no problem.</span> <span id="s114">And – so she went to a – with – with – were nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: The con – the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Con-Convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: My mom, he brought her a false document, put her fa – photography in that, somebody who was deceased, more or less on the same age.</span> <span id="s119">The name was Wovataska(ph) Janina(ph).</span> <span id="s120">And on these papers she should volunteer to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s121">And this way, according to him, she would survive.</span> <span id="s122">And I was the problem, being circumci – and he knew a place where he can take me, but the condition was, to take kids there – so the kids who have no one, the orphans, abandoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s124">Mm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: So – because for security reasons, no visits, nobody coming, nobody know.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: So that – that was a condition for this.</span> <span id="s128">So he said to my mom, leave – the kids have t – the kid had to be left in the corner of the street where I am due, where I am there, it’s – it’s my – my place to work, no?</span> <span id="s129">And my mother couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s130">Well, she had – didn’t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di – do this for.</span> <span id="s131">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And – and your sister was how old at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: She was – she was at that time, she was nine.</span> <span id="s134">So, she had to leave me in the corner and w – and, you know, just grab the first streetcar passing by, that what she did.</span> <span id="s135">And I almost get her in, because I started to screaming myself.</span> <span id="s136">My sister [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s137">People start to surround me and the policeman comes and he took me, and [indecipherable] the people were, you know, that why [indecipherable] and the place called Klarasebo(ph) in the out-outskirts of Warsaw, not far from Warsaw, very close to Wilarnow, which is the – the – the – that was the – the summer palace of the k – the king of Poland in other times.</span> <span id="s138">And the convent where I went to, that was a Methodist, it’s not Catholic, it was Methodist.</span> <span id="s139">So, being Protestants, you know, the Germans didn’t bother them, they thou – they thought they are part of them –</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: – right?</span> <span id="s142">Mas – or were more affinity.</span> <span id="s143">The woman who look after us, after the kids inside, were all Jewish womens.</span> <span id="s144">Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so that’s no – nobody would denounce, you know.</span> <span id="s145">Were personally interested, right?</span> <span id="s146">In that’s time I had two years and two months in that time, when I get separate from my mom.</span> <span id="s147">And in – in 1946 in – in April – no, in April of you – April, end of April, my mom found us, my sister and me, in a – and a ga – in a – in a Jewish orphanage.</span> <span id="s148">That was after the war, in Otwock.</span> <span id="s149">And that’s 30 kilometers southeast of Warsaw, on the eastern bank of the – of the river.</span> <span id="s150">In 1945, when the Germans start to retreat, obviously my sister said something which guides the people who are trying to put the families together, because they knew about this organization, and – and in no time I have been bring fr – brought from that place to – to the place where my sister was.</span> <span id="s151">But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting the Jew – Jewish kids together.</span> <span id="s152">So maybe my – my sister didn’t say tha – nothing, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s153">So, we were taken to Otwock.</span> <span id="s154">And well, I survived this way, and I s – when my mom comes, I was just re – convalescing from, I don’t know, one of those, you know, kids things, measles or something like that.</span> <span id="s155">So I – I was separate from the rest of the kids, in order to avoid possible, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Contamination, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: – epidemics, yeah, right, right.</span> <span id="s158">So the lady who was looking after me, her name was Dora, she – she ask me to [indecipherable] that’s the – this Polish version of my name, yeah.</span> <span id="s159">Said, do you know what – who is this lady?</span> <span id="s160">And I wa – I look on her, I remember I [indecipherable] a moment, no, and I said, well, that’s my mom.</span> <span id="s161">And my da – my mother start to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: It’s okay, take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Crazy.</span> <span id="s164">Said, what happened to her, what’s wrong with her?</span> <span id="s165">I couldn’t understand why she’s crying, you know?</span> <span id="s166">Well, I was too small to measure the time and emotions and things like that.</span> <span id="s167">And th – since then my life changed.</span> <span id="s168">So, after that we tried to escape from Poland, and we managed to do that.</span> <span id="s169">My mom was a very brave woman, you know.</span> <span id="s170">Brave, have guts more than one man – man who would like to have it.</span> <span id="s171">And so we – we escaped from Poland, three – four of us.</span> <span id="s172">Was my – the three of, my mother, my sister, me, plus a young woman, she was 24 at that time, Maryla(ph) – I don’t recall her last name now, from Wrocław.</span> <span id="s173">She joined because she was a daughter of an officer who was a s – immediate superior to my father av – my – my – my mother comes back to Poland, she was remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And she remarried a Polish man who was in the service, in the – when the – when the troops occupied Germany, defeat Germany, had been occupied by the alliances, so he was part of the – of the occupation troop.</span> <span id="s176">And he was in the – in RAF in England, the Polish squadron, and so the – she remarried him.</span> <span id="s177">He was a very, very good man, he was a excellent stepfather for me.</span> <span id="s178">Stepfather sounds bad, was a good father, I mean.</span> <span id="s179">And – but he was not Jewish, he was Christian, so I didn’t live – grow in the Jewish environment with its relations and everything else, I have been deprived from that, all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Let me –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: In 1946, in oc – in octo – October, he had been transfer to England, and with him, of course, the family.</span> <span id="s182">So – and also they say, was the kind of person, he says, well, we are – if we’re going to be a family, one family, let’s have one surname, so he adopt us both.</span> <span id="s183">My daughter – my sister and me.</span> <span id="s184">And in October of the same year, we were in o – already in England, was an entirely different life.</span> <span id="s185">And we stay in England until 1949, and my parents decide for Argentina.</span> <span id="s186">So we emigrate to Argentina in 1949.</span> <span id="s187">So the – wha – first, second and third grade, I made it in England, and through grade four I went, i-in sp – in Spanish in Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s188">Well, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38.</span> <span id="s189">Of course, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate, and we had four wonderful daughters.</span> <span id="s190">I lost my wife 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: And I have six grandchildren.</span> <span id="s193">And when this congress had a place in – in – in Toronto, completely by chance, somebody who I knew who was living in the – in massa – who lives in Massachusetts, called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so and so date, I – I’m going to – we are going to be in Toronto, herself and her husband.</span> <span id="s194">So we will like invite you for a dinner Friday with us.</span> <span id="s195">And maybe you’re daughter and your s-son-in-law can join us.</span> <span id="s196">So I said, well, I’m answering by myself because I am no – I have no commitment, will be a pleasure, and about them I have to find out, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s197">They may be coming to something else –</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: – maybe they can.</span> <span id="s200">And that’s – really, that what happens, they couldn’t attend, so I went by myself.</span> <span id="s201">So we – we tal – we talk about different things and finally comes a topic, what brought you to Toronto?</span> <span id="s202">And so she mentioned that she is coming to a congress of the hidden children [indecipherable] hidden children of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s203">What is this?</span> <span id="s204">She said, oh, you know, the kids, you know, were hidden and – you know, on the Christian houses or here and there, and they – and the – in the churches.</span> <span id="s205">Say, I fit perfectly to this category.</span> <span id="s206">So – so I get interested, and that was my fir – first attendance, no re – with no registration, because I learned the – the same day, or very – very same day about.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Next day was starting day, the – the congress.</span> <span id="s209">So I went there.</span> <span id="s210">I met lots of people, different people from different places, and I learn about some – I – I meet some people who were in Otwock at the same time I were.</span> <span id="s211">Of course, now I – now I remember the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Because I was in the youngest group.</span> <span id="s214">But some – some of the people I met, they do remember my sister, who was seven years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And so after that, I re – I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew.</span> <span id="s217">Okay, I have to tell you my sister passed away very young, on the age of 46, that was in 1979.</span> <span id="s218">So, I called my – my nephew, and I mention to him that I – because I knew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from and whatever, but hi – his story [indecipherable] story.</span> <span id="s219">But, you know, my sister as well, she didn't have a chance – she was never in the Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s220">She married to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the – from Pomerania.</span> <span id="s221">That’s the northern part of Poland, right on the sea, on the Baltic.</span> <span id="s222">A very handsome, nice fellow, so they were – were okay, but the – the tr – all the tradition and everything what could be, have been lost.</span> <span id="s223">So, somehow we were lost for the Jewish community, right?</span> <span id="s224">But my s – nephew always was curious about that, and that was something which, for obvious reasons, my sister didn’t talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Because she was hidden, her br – her origin, as my mother did.</span> <span id="s227">As long my mother lived, I never mention my origin.</span> <span id="s228">I respect her will because listen, I don’t know what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this – to decide that.</span> <span id="s229">So I were – I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like this.</span> <span id="s230">Once – once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do?</span> <span id="s231">If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not?</span> <span id="s232">And that was – ma – ma – my – my – my daughter was like – my older daughter was like 10 years old, and the next one was almost nine.</span> <span id="s233">And my mother says, you know, this is something, it’s a big question.</span> <span id="s234">I’m not in position to tell you what to do.</span> <span id="s235">And after, you know, a – a pause, she said, if you want to save them – to save them suffering, don’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: That was what she told me.</span> <span id="s238">But I – I – I – I – you know, I kept thinking about it, and finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by ignorance, some of our – my kids be in the environment where they will come to be a – maybe anti-Semitic or something like this.</span> <span id="s239">That’s what’ll be the worst thing what could happen to me right now.</span> <span id="s240">So I said that, and that was the time when my – my wife learned about my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s241">And I said, well, don’t – you don’t have to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian, never mind ho – how my person is.</span> <span id="s242">I have been Christian, I still am Christian.</span> <span id="s243">But I don’t want to deny it, where I’m coming from, and it’s nice to be able to say the truth.</span> <span id="s244">So that’s was years ago, and then once ma – I had contact with Jews in my trade, because I was in the fur business.</span> <span id="s245">And I’d just been exporting fur from Argentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a furrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter.</span> <span id="s246">But the people who I knew and I was dealing with almost on the daily basis, most of them were Jews.</span> <span id="s247">Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine.</span> <span id="s248">People much mature, 30 years older than me.</span> <span id="s249">So they – they – they – they lived this period of the Holocaust entirely differently than I did.</span> <span id="s250">They were fi – 16 - 17, you know, young people, o-or 30 –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: – when you – when I born.</span> <span id="s253">So – and sh – well, make – always, you know, exchanging point of view ideas and histories and so in – and that was something which was eating me up, you know, because on the one side I were so close to them, and I want to be one of them.</span> <span id="s254">And that was the Polisher, because I speak very good Polish, and I never learned to speak Yiddish, unfortunately, so well, that’s life.</span> <span id="s255">I lived the way I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: And at this stage of my life, since they to – the when – since, I think was 2001 or 2002, when this pi – this – this congress and wa – in Toronto has place.</span> <span id="s258">So when I call my – my – my nephew, and I told him that I met people from the place I have been in Poland, in the orphanage, and I mention the place, Otwock, say well, you know, I – looking through the papers, Mommy ple – papers, I find the pho – a – a picture, a photo, and on the – on the reverse says, something written, in Otwock, 1945.</span> <span id="s259">Said, can I have this picture or the copy of it?</span> <span id="s260">Copy it on both sides.</span> <span id="s261">And he did so an-and – and send it to me immediately.</span> <span id="s262">Very diligent, cause I spoke to him Thursday and Monday I had the photo in Toronto.</span> <span id="s263">And he lives in San Francisco, so for a freight express, immediately.</span> <span id="s264">And, in the photograph it was three young girls, and two little boys, one of them were myself, and – and bres to another boy like this, sitting the front, and three girls standing in the back.</span> <span id="s265">So also, after the congress in Toronto, some of the people I met there, they invite me to have a tea in the house, that’s all, to get closer.</span> <span id="s266">And one of the ladies, who is 10 years older than me, she is almost 80, she is eight – 79.</span> <span id="s267">Very nice person.</span> <span id="s268">I was in her house, made a mention about this photography and I brought that with me, the copy.</span> <span id="s269">And she say, one – one second.</span> <span id="s270">She went, and she brought the album, and had the same photography made, because the one who was making the photos was her brother, her older brother.</span> <span id="s271">He – he was a, you know, he was an amateur, he likes to make photos, and he was the one who make this photo.</span> <span id="s272">So in – so she says, you know, this one, Vanda, I don’t recall the last names.</span> <span id="s273">[indecipherable] I don’t – I don’t recall – is living in Tel Aviv, and this other one, also Vanda, lives in – in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s274">She is not passing a very good moment in her life because she is – no – she is 70, she is overweight, she’s depressed, blah, blah [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s275">Maybe I have to go there and cheer her up, I said, just making a joke, big joke, okay.</span> <span id="s276">So, and say, but you know who is living there is this person, Kornblum(ph) his last name [indecipherable] he is very much involved in keeping the – the – the people who were in this orphanage together, you know, and following who is living where, having the phone number to get in touch, and he also pub – publish a boo – a little book, memories of the young – a young boy’s memories, of his period of time on – during the war.</span> <span id="s277">And he is a very nice person, you can approach him, and he will be an excellent guide for you when you go there.</span> <span id="s278">An-And me – so I never had been in Israel before, and that was something which I own on myself.</span> <span id="s279">Actually, we were s – we were planning to go with my wife, in – in the year 2000, but she passed away in 1999 in April.</span> <span id="s280">So I didn't go, and after that I didn’t felt like to go, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: So, a – a couple years later, I called this person to – to Tel Aviv, and so okay, should I speak to you – you in English, or in Polish, what i – how do you feel more comfortable?</span> <span id="s283">So, either way.</span> <span id="s284">So we start to speak Polish, and I say, well, I am – I – I introduce myself.</span> <span id="s285">Say, oh, Sophie’s brother.</span> <span id="s286">This touch my heart.</span> <span id="s287">Somebody – excuse me – who remember my – my late sister so well.</span> <span id="s288">That was in January the 12th, and then February the 12th, I were in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s289">I met him, his wife.</span> <span id="s290">They were classmates, Sophie’s classma – classmates, so they knew each other –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: – very well.</span> <span id="s293">My feeling seems – the congress in – in Toronto was very lucrative [indecipherable] I should call it like that.</span> <span id="s294">But a-also was emotional because I – I met people who I knew these people exist maybe – may exist, but I didn’t know how they are, where they are, right?</span> <span id="s295">And then – but brought me back to the family.</span> <span id="s296">And when I met blum – Kornblum(ph), and his wife, we agreed to meet in the morning for breakfast together in the hotel where I were standing.</span> <span id="s297">I didn’t know him and he didn’t know me, but I imagine that must be the person, and he was.</span> <span id="s298">Very pleasant.</span> <span id="s299">His wife was a little darling.</span> <span id="s300">And we stopped to talk at nine o’clock on the morning, was 12, lunchtime already, we were sti – still talking.</span> <span id="s301">So, you know, memories, things, what we do since, and what happened to my sister, you know.</span> <span id="s302">We – when she – he knew that she was living to – to Britain, to London, and av – nothing else, so – anyway, for me was to find, like us finding old family who I left many, many – lost many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s303">And 1966, in Buenos Aires, on the – on the platform, you know, waiting for a subway – was a station where combined two different lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: So it always is full because you know, people change, it’s a mixture, in – interchange place.</span> <span id="s306">I saw – and – and – an-and – and – in a – how do you say, in a tremendous amount of people, I saw face, a woman’s face, and I felt – touched my heart, you know.</span> <span id="s307">Say, I know her, but you know, something very deep.</span> <span id="s308">I know her from much, might be from very, very long time ago.</span> <span id="s309">I didn’t know, I couldn’t remember, I was trying to remember, because the way impressed me, the fact I saw her.</span> <span id="s310">So in – in the meantime, I was trying to get closer to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: And I close – I came to – and I – I decide, in this fraction of time, that I must know her from my childhood.</span> <span id="s313">Because I have good memory, I play chess, so I – I exercise my head – memory all the time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: And I couldn’t remember where I know her from.</span> <span id="s316">So when I get close to her, I approach her in Polish, and she gets scared, and that, so I apologize in Spanish, of course.</span> <span id="s317">I didn't meant to – to – to – and, but she respond in Polish, says, who are you?</span> <span id="s318">So I say, well, I have my stepsfather surname.</span> <span id="s319">Well, what was your original name?</span> <span id="s320">So I told her, it didn’t meant nothing to her.</span> <span id="s321">So she said, where you were during the war?</span> <span id="s322">When I mention where I were during the war, she embraced me.</span> <span id="s323">She asked me who – who else survive.</span> <span id="s324">So – and this lady happens to be one of the ladies who look after us in this orphanage where I were, when I was a very little, small boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: So the – the three pictures of my childhood, which I have and I possess, have been given to me by her, in 1966 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: The next Sunday after this encounter, I visit her with my mother.</span> <span id="s329">It’s a very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s330">She lost all her family, and she marry – she remarried to a man who also lost all his family.</span> <span id="s331">So they met – they le – and they lived together in Buenos Aires, in a good positions, he was in the – in the diamond business and doing well.</span> <span id="s332">So they lived in the very, very nice sector of the city.</span> <span id="s333">And well, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: I want to ask you –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: I want to – I want to go back a little.</span> <span id="s337">What – what is the first thing you remember, what is the first memory you have of – of being in a place, or be – or seeing a person.</span> <span id="s338">Is there something –</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: No, the first pla – the first – well, many things – well, I’m not going into details, because it’s – it’s

small.</span> <span id="s342">And that is in Sandomierz.</span> <span id="s343">Sandomierz is a composed word.</span> <span id="s344">San is a [indecipherable] of a river, and domierz is – means when it’s reaching to.</span> <span id="s345">So it’s a river who reach – is reaching another river.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Getting into Wisła.</span> <span id="s348">So that’s the name of the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: And I remember, you know, a countryside road with the trees on both side, and the kind of trees in the – in the carriage, which we were on, with horses pulling it.</span> <span id="s351">But you know, this carriage is like a la – ladders on each side to – to – to carry, how to

my mother’s milk.</span> <span id="s359">And so was a little bit of a shame maybe, for some people.</span> <span id="s360">My mom ma – my mom didn't want to deprive me of this, because she didn't have anything else to give me.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: So, I ha – I always carrying a little bench, and sitting my mom there and then pulling out the

get her hands on it.</span> <span id="s372">So this is something which I don’t remember, but I have been told.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: And the –</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Do you remember the day the war ended?</span> <span id="s376">Do you remember being, for lack of a better term, liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What – do you remember anything that was going on in the orphanage at the time [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, I remember – I – I remember some action, which have been taken at the place where the orphanage was.</span> <span id="s380">So because the a – th-the front was moving, so for security reasons we have been evacuated, all the kids, all the people from the convent.</span> <span id="s381">And when, through this, we – because we never went out, we were always there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Had us on the – on th – no – no mountain, but we’re beyond the elevation.</span> <span id="s384">And I remember the – the – the – the – the – how you call it, I don’t know, the

it’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And – and that – you know, the memories of a kid, a small kid, this [indecipherable] was huge space, you know.</span> <span id="s390">And I – I went to visit it, and I’d find the place in 1992.</span> <span id="s391">And, well the [indecipherable] was there.</span> <span id="s392">The space was not as big I – I imagined it, or I reme – I recall it.</span> <span id="s393">So when – when we were – when we were evacuated, I don’t know what station, what – what train station was this, but I remember a station and on the, you know, ho-how do you call it, on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Platform?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah, platform, yes, were many corpse in the white, you know – you know, it was sheets or something

are dying.</span> <span id="s397">So, that’s – I re – I remember that because we had to walk, and their – they were like this, so don’t step on them.</span> <span id="s398">For a small kid who has to be – make a big, you know, step, you know, was hard for me, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: – I was small.</span> <span id="s401">Well, my – my – my [indecipherable] slow down because of the lack of – of food.</span> <span id="s402">In Warsaw the – I s – always remember is the hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I was terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s405">I was eating those little apples, wild apples.</span> <span id="s406">They are very green and very red, half and half.</span> <span id="s407">But it you put something like this in your mouth, are so – no – no – no – no bitter, but like – like – like lemon, but much –</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Sour?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Oh, sour, terribly sour.</span> <span id="s410">I don’t know how I could eat it, but that is the only thing I got, so I ate it.</span> <span id="s411">And those things were bringing dysentery problems, terrible, too, and I survived them all.</span> <span id="s412">And I recall being very smalls there, that sometime the kids need to feel like to move the bowel, and they have nothing in it, so they – they – the intestine was going out.</span> <span id="s413">And the ladies help us, pushing it back.</span> <span id="s414">And we being so small, like four years, or four years and a half, we learned.</span> <span id="s415">So was not so many women to look after us.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: So we help each other when that occurs.</span> <span id="s418">We knew we have to push it back –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: – into the other.</span> <span id="s421">So those things, I didn’t felt like it’s something terrible.</span> <span id="s422">When we talking in the normal circumstances, it’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s425">But in those times was the most natural thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Like when you were o – when you were on this train platform and you saw all the bodies wrapped in sheets –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: – did that even – did it frighten you?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Impress me?</span> <span id="s432">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Did it – it – nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: It was just part of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, it was just – we – that was the dead people, but that was every day, you know, and – but I didn’t feel fear, I was too small.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: So the sense of fear, that was unfamiliar to me, was very familiar to my daw – sister, and to my mom.</span> <span id="s439">That’s why, you know, when my mother took the decision to remarry, to the person [indecipherable] say well, she was one of the many Jews who didn’t want to be Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: It was like a punishment to be a Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s442">And she was a young woman, she was only 35 when she remarried.</span> <span id="s443">And she was an attractive woman.</span> <span id="s444">The – her new husband was three years older than she was.</span> <span id="s445">So she was expecting to have a normal life –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: – you know?</span> <span id="s448">And the answer she gave me when I ask her if I should tell or no my dot – my daughters, gives me an idea, a remote idea what she could happen to – us to.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: In order to – you know, to feel like this.</span> <span id="s451">I – I’m sorry because I didn’t – when was the time to ask, I didn't, you know, because I know – I don’t know much about my – my histor – family history before and all this, who knew maybe a little bit more, or sure more than me, was my sister, but we didn’t talk about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: She hide under her [indecipherable] the same way my mother, that she learned to do that.</span> <span id="s454">And for me, I didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: You know?</span> <span id="s457">And during the time I were living in England, with other Polish families which mainly were anti-Semitic, with or with no reason, I wouldn’t major – I – I would be able to – how anti-Semitic [indecipherable] they will be just discriminating, or they will be hating the Jews.</span> <span id="s458">I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s459">But I am – the way I have been raise, you know, was a very, very important thing to – to keep my private parts, don’t show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Don’t – don’t pee when the other kids are peeing, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s462">So this – those are – were kind of, you know, limitations of normal life, which I were not – I were of wh-why –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I just accepted like a mandatory thing, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s466">And they never worried about that at the – at the orphanage, or they – they kept everybody out, cause – were they worried about you being discovered as –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: At the orphanage, at the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Well, no, because we were not exposed to nobody else, only to the few ladies who were to – looking after us.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Always the same, the same environment, the same place, not going out, nobody saw us.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So it wasn’t an issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah, tha – like in a – yeah, like be in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: You no – you never –</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Nah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: You never went

you’ve come to these conferences and met other people that were in the same place that you were, do they remember the ladies who took care of them as well?</span> <span id="s483">Do you have conversations about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, I didn't – I didn't find no one from the first place where I were at.</span> <span id="s485">I find people from Otwock, was the – on the second place.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Where I had been taken in 1945.</span> <span id="s488">So, those people are the ones who I met, not from the – before.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: You – so you haven’t found anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: From the other place, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: No.</span> <span
